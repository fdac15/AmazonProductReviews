"CA2 is, for my money, the best of all the MCU films.My ""A"" level only contains four movies, Avengers 1, Iron Man 1, Guardians of the Galaxy, and, at the top of the list, this one. They are top of the list because they are the ones si could watch over and over and never get tired of them.Sometimes A1 and this will switch places only because of how awesome it was to see everybody together. However, CA2 always slips back into first place because it is not just a great superhero film, it is just a great film, period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OX2H2HIRGEH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFQSW1U#wasThisHelpful","R3OX2H2HIRGEH8","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the better MST3K as they shake the routine up a little with a fun role reversal. This one is a Mike episode. Movie is a western and is, of course, bad.Not a classic but still better than most of the other stuff on TV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PXYJ7RQHR2AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00860AP4M#wasThisHelpful","R3PXYJ7RQHR2AV","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An absolutely remarkable story from a time long past. Imagine the days when air travel was still glamorous, paperwork was actually done on paper and everyone seemed to put complete trust in appearances. Throw in a con man who was 10 years ahead of his time and you've got a remarkable true story which has you rooting for the villain, even though you know you shouldn't.I was constantly reminded of Donald Westlake's fictional character John Dortmunder or the recurring Parkerverse character, Alan Grofield. This non fiction book is so entertaining and wild, it could easily be a biography of these awesome fictional characters.Highly recommend, fast, couldn't-put-down read. I can't wait to see the movie version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291HCC1CV3I5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBFMHU#wasThisHelpful","R291HCC1CV3I5J","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A cleverly designed neck pillow which is versatile, packable and easy to use. We purchased two of these for a very long (26 hour) bus trip. The pillow has a strap around the back so it slips over the back of the seat and pretty much stays in place as long as you are using it.There is a valve which allows air to enter and leave. You may have to blow it up a little but often we found it inflated enough by itself as it finds it's natural state. When you've inflated it, you can lean into it and release air until you find the perfect comfort level. I found it comfortable for sleeping with my head straight back or slightly turned either direction.Being able to deflate and pack the neck pillow is a great feature. Fully deflated it can be crunched down to about the size of a beer can. I like this feature so much better than using a preformed neck pillow which you always have to carry around and account for. You do lose a little bit of lateral support because the pillow doesn't come around your neck, but the convenience, for me, far outweighs the limitations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24KQ04UZ8A2YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRA8RZA#wasThisHelpful","R24KQ04UZ8A2YM","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As crazily complete an account of a musical movement as you will ever read. I hate to say it, but this is my era and I was completely engrossed by the depraved and drugged out path Punk took through its all too brief lifetime.The book is entirely made up of interviews from everyone who could possibly have anything to say about the seedy history of Punk music. There is no descriptive content other than these interviews which are carefully and cleverly woven together to provide a dynamic timeline of this ugly step child sub-genre of rock and roll. Everyone is interviewed, from musicians to producers to journalists to drug dealers to drag queens to groupies. This complete cast of characters from both sides of the Atlantic creates a narrative so seedy that sometimes you feel you have to bathe after reading it.And that is as it should be because the story in its decadence is completely mesmerizing.Everybody is here, The New York Dolls, MC5, The Dictators, The Dead Boys, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, Andy Warhol, Lou Reed, Patti Smith and that only gets you half way through the book. I am also happy to report that as a huge fan I was gratified to learn that the number one degenerate from which all Punk sprang (or, more appropriately, seeped) is the king himself, Mr. Iggy Pop; a man pretty much at the center of this descent into musical madness.For me this is the definitive story, and by far the best overview, of the insane world of Punk music I've ever read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGY4UEJ5YAPAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F21WW6W#wasThisHelpful","RGY4UEJ5YAPAS","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Famous as the source of the film ""Soylent Green,"" Harry Harrison's book is less about evil governments and corporations putting something stunningly awful over on the starving masses than it is about the horrors of out of control population growth. In fact, the main revelation of the film doesn't even exist in the book.Harrison has created an overpopulated world that is always on the brink of explosion. With many of the same depressing characteristics and structures as Orwell's ""1984,"" he tells more of a police procedural type story than a sci-fi thriller. There is very little action except for the frequent food and water riots.The book is a little dated because of its heavy moralizing on the absence of birth control which is almost absurd and unimaginable in today's world. The real strength of the narrative is in Harrison's remarkable ability to create a feeling of claustrophobia in his readers. His descriptions are so well constructed and real that you can actually feel what a hopeless world this is.These remarkable moments of descriptive prose will draw you into the book and keep you turning pages. A dark classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BKLWMHM6IS06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XRELMA#wasThisHelpful","R3BKLWMHM6IS06","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was Bob Fosse's last film, finished a very short time before his death. His obsession with his own mortality which manifested much of his later work was poured out into this remarkably constructed film. Fosse dedicated the movie to one of his few truly dear friends, Paddy Chayefsky, who had died only a few months before filming began. Chayefsky's passing shook Fosse deeply and it is clear from this film that he knew he himself was living on borrowed time. Death overshadows every frame of this film.The performances, the scene construction, the editing and well...just everything, clearly shout Bob Fosse, perhaps more intimately than any other of his films. Without the normal razzle dazzle of his remarkable dance numbers to fall back on, Fosse instead choreographed his take on the life of Dorothy Stratten with the same kind of minute detail as her deranged, murderous husband choreographed her death.The acting is superb, especially from Eric Roberts, whose performance as Stratten's husband Paul Snider is one of the creepiest ever put on film. Since the audience (most of them, anyway) know the eventual outcome of the movie, the build up to the horrific ending is almost unbearable. The film has a ""mockumentary"" style with actors being interviewed by the camera as if they were the real people. This style was unique (but not unheard of) when the film was made, but completely common today.As of this writing, the film is from the Warner Archive vaults and is only available on DVD. There is no additional material, just the film. I hope someday there is another, more comprehensive release because it would be interesting to hear from Fosse himself and those who worked with him about what was happening to him and the production crew as they worked through this very dark story.Save this film for a good day, because as brilliant as it is, it is a complete downer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RYBJ4L25BYSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T797FJE#wasThisHelpful","R3RYBJ4L25BYSD","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bottom line is that this is a very attractive and classy patio furniture set. The chairs are very comfortable and when everything is all put together it just looks great. You will be happy to have family and guests sit around this table and enjoy a beautiful summer evening.We've never owned a set like this which needed to be completely assembled, so here are some observations about that process.The set arrives in 4 large boxes.  I had no problem with delivery and was kept in the loop by the delivery company every step of the way. One problem we didn't anticipate was the size of the boxes. We were not able to immediately put the set together, so we had to store the boxes for a few days which took up nearly every extra available inch of space in the garage. The boxes are huge.Heed the signs that warn you not to cut open the packages. The cushions for the chairs are on the outside of all the other stuff in two of the boxes. A misplaced cut from a utility knife will almost assuredly damage something. We used a putty knife to slide under the glued down edges to pop them open. The boxes are thick and well secured so you can't just rip them open.Once the packages are open, you will be faced with an incredible array of parts, most of them related to the chairs. Fortunately, all the hardware is sealed in shrink-wrapped sheets so it is easy to keep track of the small pieces. The job of assembling is definitely a two man job. It takes most of a full day to get everything together using two people. If you've ever assembled anything like this you probably know that your life will be much easier if you don't tighten everything down until you've fully assembled the piece. Leave yourself some wiggle room and everything will fit together nicely.After the gas unit is assembled and the gas canister is installed in the secret table compartment, the unit is ready to go. You really can't imagine how cool this thing looks when everything is put together and turned on. If you've ever stared into the magical dancing flames of a campfire, you know how mesmerizing it can be. We are in the middle of the summer, so the flaming table is a really nice touch, especially as the sun goes down. It is really all for looks though, as the flame itself has no real practical use. You can't cook with it. You really wouldn't use it for heat (like a campfire) because if it was cold enough for that you probably wouldn't be sitting around on the patio furniture.Sitting at the table eating dinner is fun, however the flame also makes dining at the table a little more impractical than normal. Nothing can be passed across the table (for obvious reasons) and the fairly large center dip takes away a significant amount of table space, basically limiting personal space to the table area in front of each chair which is fine if it is just a few people using it but if all six spaces are being used, there would be amazingly little extra table space. The manufacturers wisely included a cover for the center fire pit so at least you can reclaim that space when eating.The thick cushions make the chairs very comfortable and although the chairs don't tilt back, they do swivel which is very nice.All in all, it is hard to beat this set for visual attractiveness and ""wow"" factor. If I could have any wish granted regarding this set, it would be having some way to easily convert the flame in the center to a cooking flame for something like fondue or even to be able to barbecue small items like shish-kabobs or things like that. If there were a center insert which could be removed and changed (and cleaned) so you could convert the decorative flame to a cooking flame this set would be both beautiful and very practical. While the flaming table is very cool, comfortable and fun to sit around, it is hard to spend too much time sitting without wishing it was the whole thing was a little more versatile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV3DTLJ8ZUP29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1VG5FW#wasThisHelpful","RV3DTLJ8ZUP29","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well constructed and comfortable sleeping bag. The different layers for different temperatures is pretty cool. I have only tried this bag out in warm weather but when the temperature gets cooler, I'm pretty confident it will be comfortable enough to the 30 degree limit at which manufacture has it rated. It seems to be just about perfect for 40 to 50 degree temperatures, given you options for finding your comfortable spot in those temperaturesMy only problem with the bag is its size and weight. Mine weighted in around 5 pounds which, if you are a backpacker, is a lot of weight to carry, even in the 30 degree configuration. In summer temperatures where sometimes a light quilt or a blanket will do, it is positively obese.If you car camp or use sleeping bags around the home, this is a great choice and a great price. I probably wouldn't use it for more specialized purposes like an winter emergency bag for the car (up north anyway). The weight/temperature ratio is not so great for those kind of uses.I can't image ever using this bag in warmer temperatures if I had to carry it around. Throwing it in the back of the car for some car camping would be perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXRZXGJ9T4RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOYKVSK#wasThisHelpful","RHXRZXGJ9T4RC","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:-The case fits the Samsung S6 nicely. It takes a little bit of effort to fit it into the case the first time, but once on, it won't come off unless you want it too.-Although the leather starts out stiff, after a few uses of taking the cards in and out, it hits a nice equilibrium of accessible and security.-The cards are held within an indent in the case which helps prevent them from catching on to anything in your pocket.-The buttons are easy to use in the case.-I did not drop the phone while in the case, but it legitimately feels like the phone would be reasonably protected with it on.-Very minimal. The case has no excessive flair to take away from the beauty of the S6 design.Cons:-As mentioned before, the leather starts out very stiff and it can be a pain to remove cards for normal use. This negative wears off over time.-The optional card kick stand did not work for me. I was able to keep it in place, but attempting to type anything resulted in the phone falling over. If you are looking for a case that provides a kick stand, I don't know if this is the best option you can find.Bottom Line:- A very well designed case which meets all the fundamental needs of a phone case with out taking away from the S6 size and usability. If you are not specifically looking for a wallet-phone case, there are other options that might better fit your interests, but for those looking with-in the wallet-phone case subcategory, it will be difficult to find a better candidate than CM4's Samsung S6 case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ZAKFUVE00ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNOB7WS#wasThisHelpful","R20ZAKFUVE00ON","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A perfect fit for our XL and at a buck a bag they are a great deal too.The way the bag connects to the vacuum nozzle is pretty cool on the XL. It is just a plastic slot which the cardboard of the bag fits into then the plastic part just snaps shut with the bag fitting tightly over the nozzle with a click. The XL is a fantastic machine but this part of it always makes you nervous because if the connection is not perfect everything the vac sucks up will miss the bag and make a mess. So rest easy XL owners, the magic connection is sound and the bags are good quality.A dozen will last us awhile but I would definitely feel comfortable ordering this brand of bag again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LLI45M85DTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4SP78C#wasThisHelpful","R21LLI45M85DTA","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The mouse is incredibly light yet fits well in my hand.  It is very responsive and installs with no software, just plug in the tiny USB receiver which is about the size of a thumbnail and everything works great.  The mouse operates with a single AA battery.  The mouse has the normal right and left finger controls and a click wheel in the center.  There are also several other small buttons on the side which perform the same operations as the top buttons.The tiny USB connector is great because I never really have to take it out of the laptop when I'm traveling with it.  It fits very snuggly up against the edge of the computer so it will not sustain any damage or damage your computer if it gets knocked into like bigger receivers might.The price is great and so far I am really happy with this mouse.

"After the winter of 2013-14 and the outrageous heating bills, we decided to go back to using the plastic over the windows solution.  Back in the day it was plastic sheeting and duct tape over windows which allowed more cold air in than they stopped.  It was an imperfect solution but it stopped the cold breezes.  We have much better windows now but last winter's brutal cold still took a toll.The 3M window kit is an elegant, inexpensive, low tech solution.  The installation is simple.  A small strip of two sided tape around the window sill holds tight to the plastic with no problem.  The new barrier stops any random cold leaks and does a good job holding the heat in.  Three packages took care of the entire house with plenty left over.  When an early November two week deep chill made a surprise visit this year the product probably already paid for itself in savings.The only problem is once it's up, it's up until spring.  Sometimes you get those rare days with tolerably warm temperatures which are great for opening up windows and airing the house out after long stretches of cold.  Obviously you don't want to be tearing down all your plastic at these moments, so you just have to make do.Great product which is one of those excellent and rare low cost solutions to a big problem.NOTE ON INSTALLATION:  I found the easiest way to work with the large sheets was to attach a top corner then use the top edge of the window for a straight edge and place that edge first.  Once the sheet is hanging from the top edge of the window I had a second person hold it taut from the bottom and only then d I cut it.  I found this much easier (and more efficient in using the material) to do than pre-cutting the sheets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2ZS7A2AAGH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002NCJI#wasThisHelpful","R1R2ZS7A2AAGH8","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a device which will do everything I need it to do with exceptional mobility.  I also need a good keyboard since I write a lot.  I have an I-pad Mini and I tried to use a bluetooth keyboard with it which worked fine and was much lighter than the computer solution, but it lacked the software and capacity I needed.With increasing speed the distance between weight/mobility and functionality is becoming a moot point of consideration.  The Acer V3 is not much larger than a first generation I-pad in height and width.  It is about twice as thick and three times as heavy, but that is still really small and really light for what you get.  What you get is 500 GB of hard drive and 4 GB of RAM.  I am going to upgrade to 8 GB (there is only 1 RAM slot which requires some surgery to get at) then I can't think of anything this won't be able to do.I loaded Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign on it, not to be used as my main work computer but so I can do quick stuff on the fly.  They work well for small stuff but I really need to get the RAM upgraded to take advantage here. The wi-fi works well and connected right up and the battery lasts an amazing 6 + hours which is almost a trans Atlantic flight!  I don't know if you still have to do this but out of habit I always completely drain the battery before I recharge it for the first few times I use a device so it feels really weird to have the battery last so long.The keyboard is proportionately small, but well designed and completely usable even for my normal heavy touch. The trackpad is insanely sensitive.  Definitely pillow fingers needed.  I like the option of the touchscreen but haven't used it extensively because the fingerprints all over the screen bug me.  It is equally usable either way.For a very reasonable price you get a powerful work or internet computer which has greater capacity than a Chromebook and runs MS Office (not included) and other software while being the same small weight and size.  It's a great alternative if you are not able to shell out the cash for an Air which is it's Mac equivalent.The only thing I don't like about it is the incredible amount of junk loaded onto it when you receive it.  I would prefer a cleanly installed OS that I can customize (like a Mac).  It took half a day to de-install and delete all the useless Acer stuff, apps and software which clutter up your work space.  I guess some might like this stuff but I find it annoying.  This is also my first experience with Windows 8 and, at this point, I am unimpressed with the cluttered, pointless interface.The only thing left to discover is how well it holds up to repeated use and moving around.  If you check around on the Tube you will find videos with the bottom off and as you can see this fan-less computer has very few parts which are not securely locked down, so it should be able to withstand a decent amount of handling.  I will update as time goes on.UPDATE 1 (X  plus two weeks):  I am developing a hatred for Windows 8 which is deep and pervasive. From its intrusive log in (which I'm still digging around trying to get it disabled) to its long load times, it is truly a bloated disaster. Could Microsoft possibly create an OS worse than Vista?  When you get your computer be sure to shut off automatic updates if you don't want to get stuck staring at your screen for 15 minutes (not kidding, first update: 15 minutes!) while it mysteriously loads more crap on your computer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10622TUMQABJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2O4VLS#wasThisHelpful","R10622TUMQABJJ","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a lifetime connoisseur of messenger bags I am especially excited to write this review. I am very picky about the bags I use because I tend to use them for many years, especially ones I really like, and I really like this one.Right off the bat, I like the size.  Big enough to hold a 15"" computer, 5-6 average sized wire notebooks, an I-Pad Mini and a few other odds and ends, there is plenty of space for normal day to day use. There is a zippered internal pocket which can hold valuables, keys, or whatever. I've had bags with separate main compartment-like sleeves but this one doesn't have that. It's just one big open space so obviously it's going to be most useful for carrying around stacks of rectangular plane things of varying depth (like laptops, books and notebooks) up to maybe 5 or 6 inches thick. That would still leave you enough room to put an object about the size of a regular brick at one end. The entire compartment then zips shut before the top flap comes over it. The top flap is held down with  a long, can't miss, strip of velcro.Beneath the cover flap are two exterior pockets which also zip shut.  These are good-sized pockets, almost paperback book size, and are great for smart phones, keys, chargers w/cords, etc. I will be packing this bag as my only carry-on for a 5 day trip I will be going on and I am actually using one of the front pockets for a nice sized first aid kit. These are the biggest external pockets I've ever seen on a bag and there are two of them.There are also two good sized pockets on the sides with snaps. These can easily hold a 20 oz. bottle of water (or whatever).  The snaps sort of limit the usability for storage as things can easily fall out. There is a full size flat pocket on the back which is also secured with velcro.  This might be the kind of pocket you would carry a newspaper, magazine or an I-pad in because it is very easy to access.The super long strap extends to 48"" which is long enough to allow a 6 foot (plus) person to carry the bag over their shoulder with it hanging about hip level.  The stitching is excellent with the strap attached at three points on both sides.A Message For Men:  Guys, face it,  it's a big purse.  Long ago I came to the conclusion that one of the great gender specific advantages women have over men is they are allowed to carry purses.  I have always been jealous of the ability to grab an always prepared bag and have a bunch of useful (and often useless) stuff immediately on hand.  Indiana Jones changed all that.  I believe messenger bags have become popular because they are an acceptable form of a man purse.  This is a tough looking canvas (mine is olive green) bag, so although I am actually carrying a big man purse, I feel no shame.  I use this bag for day to day commuting and as luggage.  It's versatile, roomy and awesome looking.My only concern looking into the future is the zippers.  If there is any part of the bag which is screaming for an upgrade in quality it is the zippers. They seem fairly small for the rough and tumble nature of the bag.  I would be especially concerned about them if the bag was crammed full like it would be if I was using it for luggage and carrying some extra clothes for a few days away.  At the moment they are holding up well but if there is any change I will update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WGAH2NDDOAV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QQY2JO#wasThisHelpful","R1WGAH2NDDOAV7","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good quality case that will protect your I-pad Mini from many of the day to day dangers it faces.  The I-pad rests in a plastic holder inside the cover.  It is held to the case by four rubberized corners.  The I-pad is easy to get in and out of the case (not that you would be doing that very often) with the corners bending back just enough to allow the I-pad to be inserted.  Once in the fit is very snug and secure.One of the interesting things about this case which I haven't seen on others is there is a plastic lip on the open side which is slightly wider than the I-Pad itself. This is where the magnetic latch for the cover is held and it causes the cover, when closed, to sit atop the I-pad without actually touching the screen.  I like this feature better than covers I have used which sit directly on top of the screen.  The only problem is it gives the cover an extra thickness which you normally don't have.  When everything is put together, I can't help but to compare it in size and weight to your average sized book of poetry.  It's a weird comparison, I know, but I can't get over how much the whole thing feels like a small hardcover book.  If you slipped it in among books on a bookshelf, spine out, you would never know it was a tablet case (ignoring the fact there is no printing on it).The only tiny flaw I found with it is the power button which is on the top right corner of the I-pad is inconveniently partially covered by the corner holder of the case (really no big deal).As cases go, if you don't mind a little extra thickness, this is a solid, attractive case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23R623QXGHGFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4VA73G#wasThisHelpful","R23R623QXGHGFL","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very happy with this remarkably compact little heater.  It generates enough heat to keep comfortable an average sized room.  We is it in a front bedroom which is always cold and it raised the temperature enough that we were able to shut it off once in awhile to save some electricity.When I received it I was amazed at how small it is, a little bigger than a Mr. Coffee coffee maker, yet it still cranked out a nice amount of heat.So far, I'm happy.

"I received a unit and thought it was broken so I requested a replacement.  Either the second is broken or this is just one of the most ineffective heaters I have ever purchased.  It sort of heats up its immediate area but doesn't seem to have any effect as close as 6 or 7 feet away let alone heating up an entire room. On the box it claims to use convection to move the heat (I notice that this is not worthy of mentioning in the product description).  If this is an example of convection then convection sucks.  You need some kind of blower to move the heat around.I didn't find it to be worth the energy it uses or the space it takes up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E9GR21GSME2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Q4EYEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2E9GR21GSME2C","A3EFZZY5DUHLVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EFZZY5DUHLVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A book is the real protagonist of Geraldine Brooks' latest novel, ""People of the Book."" The author writes in the ""Afterward"" section that this is a work of fiction, inspired by the true story ""of the Hebrew codex known as the Sarajevo Haggadah. The Haggadah is an illuminated manuscript which contains the traditional text of the Passover Haggadah that accompanies the Passover Seder. It is one of the oldest Sephardic Haggadahs in the world, originating in Spain in the 15th century. The author succeeds in creating a riveting account of the volume's history, from its origins in Seville to a 21st century museum in Sarajevo.What makes this book so precious, besides its age and great beauty, is that it is illustrated with numerous miniature paintings, much like the Christian illuminations of the Gospels. Jews, during this period, considered figurative art a violation of the Third Commandment, which prohibits the making of ""any likeness of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth below."" Who was the talented artist who created this masterpiece and broke with tradition? And why?When the mysterious book was discovered in Sarajevo in 1894 it was considered a miracle that it had survived, almost intact, for so many centuries - tumultuous centuries filled with violence. It was not destroyed during the expulsion of the Jews and Moors from Spain in 1492, nor was it burned during the Holy Inquisition, which began in 1498, when Tomas de Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor, targeted Marranos, Jews who had converted to Christianity. Large numbers of Jews then migrated to Venice, where they were expelled, once again, and their books burned, in the 17th century, but this Haggadah was kept safe. The treasure somehow survived and made its way, along with the ""People of the Book,"" to Sarajevo, where the Ottomans had initially welcomed them in 1565.During the Dark Ages, the Muslim's vast empire extended into Europe and southern Spain. Their culture was the ""one bright light where science, art, and poetry still flourished."" Both Jews and Muslims were reviled, tortured and murdered by the Christians, and together, in places like Sarajevo, the two peoples could live in peace. Still, the book and its people were to experience much more brutality and bloodshed in WWI and WWII.One of the most dangerous periods in the volume's history was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, an international armed conflict that took place between March 1992 and November 1995. The city of Sarajevo was under constant siege.In 1996, Hanna Heath, an Australian rare book expert, is offered a job by the UN to conserve the Sarajevo Haggadah, after it is discovered intact, even though many had feared it had been destroyed during the heavy shelling of the city. Dr. Ozren Karaman, (a fictitious character, based on a real person), is chief librarian of the Sarajevo National Museum and professor of ""librarianship"" at the National University of Bosnia. Dr. Karaman, a Muslim, risked his life to save a Jewish book.Hanna's task is to prepare the fragile volume for an exhibition at a newly built museum. As she works, she finds clues to the Haggadah's history - an insect's wing, a fine white hair, stains of wine and blood on a few pages, missing clasps, and a few grains of salt. She is determined to solve the mystery of the extraordinary object's provenance. She and Dr. Karaman begin a tentative romance at this point. Hanna, a most appealing person, and an irreverent Aussie, has problems with relationships, both with men and with her mother. This is due to past events which occurred in Hanna's childhood and provide an interesting glimpse into her character.There are frequent flashbacks to medieval Spain, 15th century Venice, 19th century Vienna, Jewish communities near the the Adriatic Sea in the 1940s, and to Seville in 1480, where the reader finally meets the illuminator who created the Haggadah. We are introduced to the people who came into contact with the book throughout its history and protected it.Geraldine Brooks' characters are rich, colorful and well developed. Her recounting of the history surrounding the book is extremely well researched, and her own imagination is very fertile. The narrative is well written and the pace is fast. Ms. Brooks won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel, ""March,"" which I read and enjoyed very much. But I was enthralled reading ""People of the Book."" It is definitely a 5 STAR novel.JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QUYGGTNUKDXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4HUWW2#wasThisHelpful","R3QUYGGTNUKDXX","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the author, Berlin in 1927 is a difficult city to leave, even for the best of reasons. There's the Wannsee and its beaches in summer, the Ice Palast and Luna Park in winter, and the ever beautiful Unter den Linden, the Tiergarten, the Zoologischer Garten and multiple cafes with rich pastries all year round. Berlin is the city of divine decadence, (remember the movie ""Caberet?""), and a thriving film industry. And Weimar Berlin still suffers from losers' blues, with a treasury depleted by war reparations it is not able to pay. The capital city is also where the reader gets a sense of how strong the NAZI Party has grown, from 27,000 members nationwide in 1925 to 108,000 in 1929. ""Shadow and Light's"" primary storylines surround the film industry and the Party. Movie director Fritz Lang and Joeseph Goebbels are characters here, as are actress and writer Thea von Harbou, actor Peter Lorre, the Tiller Girls and far right-wing media magnate Alfred Hugenberg.Nikolai Hoffner, chief inspector in Berlin's Kriminalpolizei, is called in to check-out the apparent suicide of UFA studio's movie executive Gerhard Thyssen. But the suicide is a murder, our detective deduces.Silent films are on the way out, but not quite. The future is in movies with sound. The Americans knew that UFA ""was after sound"" and had come up with a device ""which would revolutionize the way films are produced."" ""Without sound all you have is shadow and light. Flat, soulless, barren. Sound is the third dimension."" Leni Coyle, an American talent scout in the employ of MGM, a major rival of UFA, comes scouting for the device...and becomes Hoffner's lover while she's at it. Fritz Lang and crime syndicate boss Alby Pimm are somehow induced to assist Hoffner in the investigation, which takes them into much murkier realms than mere murder and the demise of silent films.I first met protagonist Kriminal-Oberkomissar Nikolai Hoffner in Jonathan Rabb's ""Rosa."" There, Hoffner was a superb multi-faceted character, a consummate professional, and brilliant detective with a tremendous sense of irony. In ""Shadow and Light,"" though still as savvy, Hofner is less tough, almost pathetic, and more much morose. Depressing, in fact. His drinking habit has progressively increased. but he is still driven to discover anyone and anything involved in this most complex of cases. This flawed man has allowed the skeletons in his closet to reach out and tap him on the shoulder too frequently. Wife Martha was murdered as a direct result of his sleuthing. Alienated older son Sasha is now caught up in the rising tide of fascism, and 16 year-old son Georg has left school to be a script researcher and gofer in the film industry. The detective may be a more interesting character for all this, but his is a tale that makes for a dark read, sometimes too dark even for noir.I also found the plots, subplots and sub-sub plots convoluted and too difficult to follow at times, even for someone with lots of patience. I loved Jonathan Rabb's ""Rosa,"" but ""Shadow and Light"" falls short. However, if you like German historical novels, you shouldn't miss this one - just borrow don't buy.JANA","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACWKA4KYBMW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIB01SE#wasThisHelpful","R3ACWKA4KYBMW0","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recently offered the Bestechno Camping LED Lantern by the product vendor, for my personal use and an honest review. I accepted the offer because my old lantern is wearing out. As almost everywhere, we get storms, nor'easters, and occasionally, hurricanes, here in NYC and sometimes the electricity goes out for long periods of time. I cannot read by candlelight and need a lantern that produces enough light so that I can read. There is nothing more boring than sitting around for 24 hours with nothing to do. The lantern is also perfect for camping, hiking, etc.The Bestechno Camping LED Lantern is much smaller than the lantern I already own. The lamp body is 5"" tall without extending the two foldable wire handles, but the LED bulb provides illumination for a circle of about ten feet, good enough to be able to read by. The 60 Lumens efficient premium LEDs produce maximum brightness and with 3 x AA batteries, you'll have up to 40 hours of light.  The battery compartment is located at the bottom of the lantern - simply unscrew it to place batteries. Rechargeable batteries are also compatible with the lantern.The lantern, although small, is not at all flimsy. It is well constructed and sturdy, built with military grade plastic and is water resistant. The lantern is ideal for camping.  As stated above, there are two foldable wire handles, for easy carrying or hanging from a tree branch or inside a tent. You can turn the light on and off by simply pulling the top lid away from the bottom and vice versa. There are no switches. The more you pull the lid up the brighter the light becomes.At $9.99 you cannot beat the price and the vendors promise a refund if the customer is not 100% satisfied. How good is that?? I am extremely please with this product!JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJR30MV74VMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VSIFRY#wasThisHelpful","R3UJR30MV74VMY","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine year-old Bruno is an innocent, carefree boy growing up in Berlin during WWII. He has three ""Best Friends For Life,"" and wants to be an explorer when he grows up. Bruno lives in a beautiful mansion, complete with gardens and servants, along with his older sister Gretel, their lovely mother, and their father, a high ranking SS officer. The boy comes home one day after school, in 1943, and finds Maria, the family maid, packing his belongings into wooden crates, including things he had hidden and were ""nobody's business."" He learns that his family is moving away from Berlin and he must go with them, leaving behind his school, best friends and beloved grandparents.Following a formal dinner that the ""Fury,"" (Führer), attends, Bruno parents explain the reason for the move. His father has received a huge promotion to ""Commandant."" They are going to live in a place called ""Out-With,"" (Auschwitz), in Poland and will remain there for the ""foreseeable future.""The new house is a cold and somber place, located in a desolate countryside. Bruno hates his new home and misses his friends. He feels terribly isolated and bored. There are no boys to make friends with here and he wants to return to Berlin. From one side window in the house, he can see a high-wired compound inhabited by sad-looking people in striped pajamas. He wonders what these people do all day and why, in fact, they wear pajamas in the daytime. He wants to go and play with the boys he sees there. When he asks his father who ""those people"" are, his Commandant Dad responds that ""they aren't really people."" Lieutenant Kotler, a supercilious young SS officer on his father's staff, constantly ruffles Bruno's hair and calls him ""little man."" Bruno's anger at Kotler's condescension is just a part of the rage and helplessness he feels about his living situation, where he feels like a prisoner.Since there is not much to explore within his own compound, where the family lives, it is inevitable that Bruno would seek excitement elsewhere. Thus, he finds a way to escape his confined quarters and eventually makes his way to the barbed wire enclosure where now he can clearly see the inhabitants within - all wearing gray striped pajamas with gray striped caps on their shaved heads. On one of his excursions, he meets a boy named Shmuel, a broken waif of a child wearing a numbered uniform. Shmuel lives a very different life than Bruno. He is a Jew, and along with his father, a prisoner in the camp. He sometimes hides by the fence, during work detail, where he meets Bruno and the two form a friendship. They even share the same birthday. Shmuel tells Bruno about how his family was transported here from a ghetto in Poland. Bruno talks about his wonderful life in Berlin, and smuggles food from the kitchen to give to Shmuel. But Bruno still doesn't ""get it."" The enormity of the evil confronting him is beyond his comprehension. He believes that the numbered striped pajamas are part of a game played inside the barbed wire enclosure. He asks his friend what is burned in the chimneys. I won't go any farther with my summary as I don't want to include ""spoilers.""The narrative is in the 3rd person, but the story is told from a child's perspective. The boys' friendship is an allegory of sorts, the author calls it a ""fable.""  Children are able, if given the chance, to overcome differences in culture and identity. Their innate innocence allows them to believe that people ultimately can get along if they're not encouraged to hate. Conflict and distrust are cultivated by governments and the media.Of course, this is not a ""real"" story of Auschwitz, where prisoners would be shot or killed by the electric barbed wires if they spent time hanging out there. And, of course, Shmuel, would not have survived the camp long enough to befriend anyone. Most children, who were of no use in the labor force, would have been sent to their death immediately upon arrival at the camp. And, it is beyond me how an intelligent, albeit naive and self-centered child like Bruno, would be calling the Fuehrer, the ""Fury"" or be unaware of the war. But as I mentioned above, I do think this novel is allegorical in nature, in which case, I allow for author's licence.The novel brings to mind 2 quotations, which I will share with you.""Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows."" John Betjeman""When childhood dies, its corpses are called adults and they enter society, one of the politer names of Hell. That is why we dread children, even if we love them. They show us the state of our decay.""

"I congratulate Carlos Ruiz Zafon on his latest offering, ""The Angel's Game,"" a superb work of fiction where magical realism meets gothic horror and romance. Ruiz Zafon pays homage to the art of writing, and to such authors as Charles Dickens, who wrote ""Great Expectations,"" a book which plays an important role here, as well as to Charlotte Brontë, with her Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, the couple who gave ""Gothic"" its name. The reader enters a world which on the surface seems normal, however, there are many elements at play which are magical, illogical and often disturbing.Before reading ""The Angel's Game,"" I couldn't help but think about Sr. Ruiz Zafon's debut novel, ""The Shadow Of The Wind,"" which I read as soon as it came out in 2004 - a wonderful book! Now, five years later, as I began to read this new novel, I couldn't take my mind off its storyline to compare it with its older sibling. After completing this novel, I recognized that I had already met some of the characters who appear here, including the wonderful ""Cemetery of Forgotten Books,"" a labyrinthine library where each book awaits someone to choose it and give it another chance to live by making it part of the new owner's life. The book cemetery is a ""sanctuary and a mystery,"" and formidable enough to be a character in its own right. ""Every volume has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and the soul of those who read it and lived with it and dreamed with it."" This cemetery first appeared in ""The Shadow Of The Wind,"" but that is all the two works have in common. ""The Angel's Game's,"" storyline is totally new and original.In Barcelona, late 1920s, protagonist David Martin is a writer and author of ""penny dreadfuls,"" (lurid serial stories appearing in parts over a number of weeks), for the Voice of Industry newspaper, a periodical which has seen far better days. Martin uses a pseudonym, as he considers himself to be a serious writer and does not want to be identified with the work which earns him his daily keep. Pedro Vidal, the publication's star writer, is Martin's mentor. The young man believes that he owes him much for his encouragement and for affording him the opportunity to make a decent living. As Martin's Grand Guignol-like series takes off, new customers flock to buy the latest installments, and David's once empty pockets begin to fill. But his colleagues resent his success.David Martin's favorite place in the whole city is the Sempere & Sons' bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It is here that he took refuge from his troubled childhood. Sr. Sempere, his dear friend for much of his life, gave him the best gift he had ever received - a copy of ""Great Expectations"" by Charles Dickens. Sempere also introduced him to the ""Cemetery of Forgotten Books.""Martin is released from his job at the paper - too much ill will from his colleagues, bad moral, etc., etc. On the recommendation of Vidal, he receives an extremely lucrative offer from a new publishing house to continue writing his stories, a series called ""City of the Damned."" Martin signs the contract which offers him more money than he ever thought he would make. It stipulates that he will write, anonymously, segments of the story to appear monthly in hardback editions. Unfortunately, as he is later to learn, the publishers are a bunch of ""second-rate fraudsters.""  This deal makes does make him a huge ""success"" with the public, but he has never written a page with which he was satisfied, and in a few years he will be thirty years-old. His fans don't even know his real name. And, Christina, the woman he loves is looking for someone worthier to receive her affections.It is at this time that he receives his first correspondence from Andreas Corelli, a mysterious editor of a French publishing house. The genial Corelli makes Martin an offer which he cannot refuse, but refuse he does...sort of. He is asked to devote an entire year of his life, exclusively, to ""working on the greatest story you have ever created: a religion."" The writer is appalled. Apart from the fact that he knows or cares little about organized religion, he is not ""tempted to create a story for which men and women would live and die, for which they would be capable of killing and allowing themselves to be killed, of sacrificing and condemning themselves, of handing over their souls."" In return for his work, should he accept, he will receive all that he has ever wanted. Corelli's initial geniality now takes on a more sinister aspect. David doesn't refuse outright, but allows that he will give the matter some thought.He holes up in his gothic-style mansion, topped by a tower that ""rises from a facade carved with reliefs and gargoyles."" The house had been closed for years, abandoned, before he bought it, and has has a murky and macabre past... as any good goth house would. Here David maniacally writes two great novels - one for Vidal to claim as his own, and one for himself. Vidal's book is celebrated while David's is panned. He suffers from terrible, blinding headaches and forgets to eat and sleep.In dire straits, emotionally and physically, he finally accepts Corelli's Faustian offer. Then he pays a visit to the ""Cemetery of Forgotten Books."" He selects one, ""Lux Aeterna,"" by ""D. M.""  Who is this author with the same initials as David's? The volume appears to be about a new religion. It seems that David Martin is not the first writer to receive the same request from Corelli. What happened to the other's manuscript, which was obviously not what the editor wanted, or else why hire Martin? As David begins to write, to fulfill his nefarious promise, he discovers that his life seems to parallel that of his predecessor who wrote ""Lux Aeterna."" This is a real mystery and quite a deadly one, with several very real corpses. All evidence points to Martin as the guilty party - the prime murder suspect. Soon David's life begins to resemble those of the characters he creates for his penny dreadful series.""The Angel's Game"" kept me riveted to the page. Ruiz Zafon's gift for remarkable storytelling shines. As one reads his elegant, frequently poetic prose, the theme of the beauty of the written word becomes manifested in the author's narrative.  He paints the city of Barcelona with a dark brush. And his characters are wonderfully original.The novel's one weakness is the conclusion. I was disappointed in the facile manner in which all the threads were tied together, but not disappointed enough to rate this fascinating tale anything less than 5 STARS!

"On March 18, 2008, presidential candidate Barak H. Obama spoke to the American people from Philadelphia. He addressed race in a manner that has rarely been discussed in a public forum before. But Barak Obama was a historical candidate running for the presidency of the United States of America in extraordinary times. And he spoke as someone from both inside and outside the African American experience.Two days after this address, he approached award-winning journalist Richard Wolffe, who had been covering the Obama campaign for Newsweek Magazine ever since the candidate announced his run for the presidency on January 16, 2007. Wolffe, while interviewing Obama, told him that his story was largely unknown, even though he had written a bestselling memoir, ""Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.""  Wolffe said, “People want to know who you are. Who are you? That’s the question people are going to ask six months from now, and six years from now.” The candidate agreed with Wolffe’s assessment, and asked the journalist to write a “Theodore White kind of book” about the campaign. Mr. White won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction in 1962 for his book, The Making of the President, 1960, about the campaign between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy. He then went on to write outstanding books about the 1964,1968 and 1972 presidential campaigns.Wolffe dismissed the notion of authoring a “Making of a Present-type” book. He said there was already too much press coverage. He told the future president, to my great dismay, that “publishers want partisan screeds nowadays. They don’t want reporting.” Wolffe then went on to say or think, “Teddy White. How archaic. The poor man, (Obama), doesn’t understand the media.” The condescension of the author is outrageous, as he terms obsolete the ever relevant Mr. White, and the “what sells in print naivetee” of Obama. That was a real turn-off for me.Given the very nature of candidate Barak Obama, his lovely family, the historical significance of an African-American man entering the presidential campaign, with a woman, Hillary Clinton, as his leading contender, his eventual opponent, John McCain, with his own historic and dramatic story, and the unlikely choice of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential candidate – a journalist would have to be a total flop to write a bad book about such events. And Richard Wolffe is certainly no slouch.Drawing on some twenty-four months of coverage and countless interviews with Barak Obama, Wolffe has attempted to answer the “Who is he?” question.Because of all the media coverage of all the candidates and campaigns, there is little that surprised me in “Renegade,” which, by the way, was the Secret Service’s name for Obama during his candidacy. There are a few new tidbits, especially about events surrounding Hillary Clinton’s appointment as Secretary of State. I did find myself wishing for a Theodore White kind of book, however, with more objective coverage about both Democrat and Republican campaigns, their conventions and platforms, and more gossipy details of infighting, etc., from behind the scenes.“Renegade gives us a more biased look at the amazing story of Obama’s presidential run and his big win in November 2008. The reader is given a ring-side seat to the candidates long journey – from freshman senator, (99th out of 100 senators in seniority), who had trouble gaining admission to the Democratic convention in 2000 – to President of the United States. What a ride! Yet, there is something lacking here – perhaps the tension and excitement which would have come from a more bipartisan coverage.I enjoyed the read, but I was a Hillary supporter long before I fell in line and campaigned for Obama. I would have liked to read, at the very least, an Obama & staff summary of why she lost the nomination. What were her biggest mistakes? The biggest mistakes her staff made? I’d like to know why in the world John McCain selected Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential candidate.There are portions of the book, however, which are quite moving. I learned that the future President Obama is, in fact, a man of moral character, a family man and a brilliant man, with a natural ability to lead and the strength to tackle difficult issues with tremendous energy, and an openness and realistic optimism that inspires.There are passages like: “His memoir revolved around something and someone not present in his childhood: his African father and his African American identity. Even that was a partial view, obscuring the role of his mother and grandparents: the white family that raised him. He was obviously black, yet he grew up with a white perspective. He was American, yet he grew up with an international perspective. He was a Democrat who sought to understand the Republican perspective. He was a moderate who spoke the language of radical change, and a progressive who spoke in moderate tones.” Now that is wonderful descriptive writing and right on target!Unfortunately, Mr. Wolffe’s prose does not flow. He is all over the place with his timelines. In one paragraph he writes about an incident which takes place during the campaign for the Democratic Party’s nomination, and two paragraphs later he has the now president-elect making cabinet decisions. A few pages along, the reader gets excerpts of Obama debating McCain, and then we are back at the Iowa, and Nevada caucuses. There are few segues which allow the reader to smoothly make the transitions in time and place. I really expected more from this journalist, whom I respect and admire. And I would like to know who edited the book!So, if you are an Obama fan, as I am, wait for this book to come out in a paperback, or buy it used, or borrow it. Save yourself the money of the hardback copy, because even though the book is interesting, it is not a “Must Read!” I give it 3.5 Stars for the writing and 4 Stars for the content.JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E555WZG9NPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MDAIHLE#wasThisHelpful","R2E555WZG9NPE","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recently offered the Kai Pure Komachi Kitchen Knife Set by the product vendors for my personal use and an honest review. Wow! These knives are terrific...so colorful and razor-sharp. They are much better than I thought they would be. The three knives are color coded and come with sheathes to protect the blades and your fingers.The high-carbon stainless steel blades are easy to clean and sanitize, plus they have contoured colored handles for comfort. The color coding helps to make sure that you use the correct knife for the correct purpose and to help the blades last longer. Blade coating is food safe, helps food release from the blade, resists corrosion and cleans easily.This particular set includes a 6.5"" blue Santoku Knife, a 3.5"" green Paring Knife and a 6"" purple Multi-Use Knife with a partially serrated edge. I have been using them every since I received them last month and they do not disappoint.The instructions say: ""The knives are dishwasher safe, but it is recommend to wash them by hand to extend the life of the blades, keep them sharp and preserve their vibrant color. Wash the blades and wipe dry after each use. Do not cut frozen food with these knives or use scouring pads, steel, or gritty cleansers.""I am glad that I had the chance to try this excellent set. I think they would make a terrific Christmas present for the ""gourmet chefs"" in your life.JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U36FC5BQFF7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016N6YVFE#wasThisHelpful","R1U36FC5BQFF7V","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not into bloody, gory, serial killer novels, with the exception of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter - a real favorite of mine, although I wouldn't want to have lunch with him! However, author Chelsea Cain has come up with a new take on the genre. Her psychopath is a woman, Gretchen Lowell, and an extremely beautiful, brilliant woman at that.We don't hear about many female serial killers, and that may be partly because women aren't as prone to commit this type of crime as men. Criminologist, Eric Hickey, has assembled the most extensive database on demography of serial murder. He states that, ""88% of serial killers are male, 85% are Caucasian, and the average age when they claim their first victim is usually around 28.5. Women account for 15% of violent offenders (men are 6 times more likely to commit violent crimes)."" Gretchen Lowell makes Ted Bundy look like a pussycat!Detective Archie Sheridan is a hero in Portland, Oregon. Sheridan headed the so-called ""Beauty Killer Task Force,"" and solved the case two years before the novel begins. It was proved, in a court of law, that Gretchen Lowell was responsible for the deaths of 26 victims. She claims she has murdered over 200 people, brutally torturing each one first. She has no profile and is an equal opportunity killer - blacks, whites, Hispanics, young, old, men, women - it doesn't matter. However, she does not victimize children. She is called ""The Beauty Killer,"" not because she is beautiful, but because when the medical examiner was asked to categorize the condition of the first of many corpses, he whistled and said, ""It's a beauty!"" Autopsies are usually boring, according to the ME - mostly drownings and suicides. He is positively ""tickled"" by Gretchen's original work. It is just a coincidence that she's a ""looker.""Archie was the lead detective on the case. He was also Gretchen's last victim. The FBI profiler was sure the killer was a man, an opinion which almost cost Sheridan his life. Ms. Lowell, posing as a psychiatrist, (she was an operating room nurse, in actuality), insinuated herself into the task force by claiming that she gave up her practice to write a book about the killings. She is clever enough to have created a portfolio of credible information which could be backed up when investigated. She told members of the team that she read about the gruesome murders and believed she could be of help. The case had been hell for the detectives, and Lowell ""believed"" she could talk with them - not counsel - just talk to ease their anxiety. They had been working on the case for ten years and their lack of success was really getting to all of them - all the dead, mutilated bodies, all the grieving, traumatized families waiting for closure, all the dead ends.One afternoon, two years before, Archie visited Lowell in her office. His supposed colleague gave him coffee with milk, sugar and drugs. When he awakened he was strapped to a gurney in a basement, outfitted like an operating room, with medical-looking machinery, and a drain on the cement floor. His captor cooed in his ear, ""Whatever you think this is going to be like, it's going to be worse."" Now, two years later, Archie remembers all too clearly what was done to him. His spleen was removed without the benefit of anesthetics, nails were hammered into his rib cage, he was given enough drugs, when he wasn't being physically tortured, to become addicted to an impressive cocktail of medication - uppers, downers, you name it. His tormentor doodled on his chest with a scalpel, including a drawing of her signature, a heart...need I go on??However, Gretchen did something different with Archie than she had done with other victims. She allowed him to live for 10 days, although he longed for death. She only gave her other victims 3 days before she mercifully killed them. When Archie began to die, she called 911, reported the situation and asked for immediate medical attention. Then she turned herself in to the police.Archie lives, but after an extensive stay in the hospital, he is placed on long-term medical leave. He is too damaged psychologically to maintain his marriage to his childhood sweetheart, although he loves her and adores their two sons. The couple finally decide to separate. However the worst after effect of his kidnapping and torture is his compulsion to visit Gretchen Lowell in jail every Sunday. His excuse for these weekly visits is that she occasionally divulges another victim's name and place of burial. Her only condition for these revelations is that Archie maintain these weekly visits - thus she continues to exert control over him. Worse still, he is drawn to her sexually. His problem is perhaps a version of the Stockholm Syndrome, ""a psychological response sometimes seen in abducted hostages, in which the hostage shows signs of loyalty to the hostage-taker, regardless of the danger or risk in which they have been placed.""I haven't included any spoilers, as this background information is divulged at the beginning of the novel. The plot of ""Heartsick"" involves a series of murders occurring in Portland, Oregon. Someone is killing and raping teenage girls. Gretchen Lowell does have a role here also, although she is in prison. The police reconvene the ""Beauty Killer"" task force and Archie is asked to come out of ""temporary"" retirement to be lead detective on the case. Although he maintains a professional demeanor, he is dysfunctional. To look at him, to work with him, no one would know. He is careful to keep his condition a secret, and, in fact, coming back to work helps keep him sane. He shovels drugs down his throat as if they were candy - just enough medication to relieve his physical and emotional pain, but not enough to really damage his kidneys and liver.Pink-haired Oregon Herald reporter Susan Ward is assigned to the case and is allowed complete access to the murders, crime scenes, and to Archie - she is to work alongside him. Her goal is not only to write a series of articles, but to write a book also. Why does Archie allow a reporter complete access to the case? Why did Gretchen allow him to live? You will have to read the novel to find out.This is a ""can't put it down"" read. The author writes well, the narrative clips along at a good pace, and Ms. Cain's characters are quite compelling. She really brings them to life on the page. The storyline is told in a series of flashbacks, from the present to the time when Archie was a captive. This book gives the term ""psychological thriller"" a new meaning.""If you like thrillers, you will love this one.

"In 1968 the London Season was on the wane. At one time it referred to the annual period when it was customary for members of the a social elite to hold posh debutante balls, dinner parties various soirees, large charity events, etc.. This period could begin any time after Christmas, depending upon the success of the hunting season in the country. It also coincided with the sitting of Parliament. London became a virtual marriage market during the Season. There were only a few short months for eligible debutantes to be officially presented to the queen, attend approximately 50 balls, 60 parties, 30 dinners and 25 breakfasts in order to, hopefully, find themselves a wealthy, titled husband. And a young lady was not considered approved for the marriage market until she was presented at court - her curtsy to the queen had to be impeccable if she were to succeed.However, in 1968, the world was in a period of flux - politically and socially. This was the end of one era and the beginning of another. Although many of the traditions and customs remain, the official organization of the Season no longer exists The presentation of debutantes at court was abolished by Queen Elizabeth II in 1958. And while the London Season continues - young debs still have to be married, as do eligible bachelors - the scale of events has been cut-back significantly.Boutique clothes and micro mini-skirts from Carnaby Street were ""in,"" as were the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in 1968. Charles, Prince of Wales, was probably dating his Camilla - although both were single at the time. And the unnamed narrator of ""Past Imperfect,"" fresh out of Cambridge, was enjoying himself, along with his circle of friends. Prominent among these friends was the handsome, debonair Damian Baxter. Although not a member of the nobility, nor rich, this young man had the wherewithal and poise to act as one of the privileged, and to be accepted by the younger set, although not by their parents.Damian was not after inherited wealth or a noble wife, though his peers would never have noticed this. He did not covet the life of the elite - he wanted to ""witness it - to experience it, but only as a traveler from another land."" ""He didn't want to live in the past where he had no position. He wanted to live in the future where he could be anything he wished.""Now, some forty years later, Damian is as rich as Midas, with a large, elegant home in Surrey where he lives alone. He is dying. After receiving an unsigned letter from a former lover telling him he had sired a child out of wedlock, back in the good old days, he finds himself desperate to find his natural heir. Obviously he wants to bequeath him/her his considerable fortune, 500 million, but he also has a need to know that his line will continue, albeit from the wrong side of the blanket. Damian had married in his 30s, but by that time he was sterile due to an unfortunate bout of adult mumps. During the promiscuous period of the 1968-69 Seasons, he had affairs with various young women. One of them could possibly be the mother of his child.Damian calls upon our narrator to assist him in finding his offspring and the prospective mother. What is so remarkable about the request is that Damian and the narrator had a major falling out in 1970, and lost touch with either other's life. The narrator actually hates his terminally ill former friend. ""Past Perfect's"" mysteries include: Does Damien have an heir? Why does the narrator hate Damian? And why does he accept Damian's request for help in his quest?In fulfilling the dying man's request, the narrator must return to his own past and, inevitably, compare it with his present existence. He has been forced to remember what he wanted from life at nineteen...before he knew what life was about. Now, thanks to Damien, ""he must bear witness to what happened to all those silly, over made-up girls, the vain self-important young men - and to what happened to himself."" ""He has been rendered discontented when it is nearly too late to fix, but soon enough to have many years ahead to live with that discontent.""There is a list of five women - five former debs whom Damien had sex with back then - all of whom have children of the right age. As the narrator finds them and explores their past and present lives, more of the storyline, from the 1960s to the 21st century, are revealed. And these women, also former friends of the narrator, are more than happy to discuss their pasts with him. Their stories represent different aspects of British upper class society.Author and Academy Award winning screenwriter, (Gosford Park), Julian Fellowes writes with wit, as he describes the lives of the upper classes as they were having to start to come to terms with the changing times. The well written narrative is full of astute observations on human nature. The novel is frequently funny, and often poignant. The characters are wonderful. Obviously, I enjoyed ""Past Imperfect"" immensely.

"In 1968 the London Season was on the wane. At one time it referred to the annual period when it was customary for members of the a social elite to hold posh debutante balls, dinner parties various soirees, large charity events, etc.. This period could begin any time after Christmas, depending upon the success of the hunting season in the country. It also coincided with the sitting of Parliament. London became a virtual marriage market during the Season. There were only a few short months for eligible debutantes to be officially presented to the queen, attend approximately 50 balls, 60 parties, 30 dinners and 25 breakfasts in order to, hopefully, find themselves a wealthy, titled husband. And a young lady was not considered approved for the marriage market until she was presented at court - her curtsy to the queen had to be impeccable if she were to succeed.However, in 1968, the world was in a period of flux - politically and socially. This was the end of one era and the beginning of another. Although many of the traditions and customs remain, the official organization of the Season no longer exists The presentation of debutantes at court was abolished by Queen Elizabeth II in 1958. And while the London Season continues - young debs still have to be married, as do eligible bachelors - the scale of events has been cut-back significantly.Boutique clothes and micro mini-skirts from Carnaby Street were ""in,"" as were the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in 1968. Charles, Prince of Wales, was probably dating his Camilla - although both were single at the time. And the unnamed narrator of ""Past Imperfect,"" fresh out of Cambridge, was enjoying himself, along with his circle of friends. Prominent among these friends was the handsome, debonair Damian Baxter. Although not a member of the nobility, nor rich, this young man had the wherewithal and poise to act as one of the privileged, and to be accepted by the younger set, although not by their parents.Damian was not after inherited wealth or a noble wife, though his peers would never have noticed this. He did not covet the life of the elite  -  he wanted to ""witness it - to experience it, but only as a traveler from another land."" ""He didn't want to live in the past where he had no position. He wanted to live in the future where he could be anything he wished.""Now, some forty years later, Damian is as rich as Midas, with a large, elegant home in Surrey where he lives alone. He is dying. After receiving an unsigned letter from a former lover telling him he had sired a child out of wedlock, back in the good old days, he finds himself desperate to find his natural heir. Obviously he wants to bequeath him/her his considerable fortune, £500 million, but he also has a need to know that his line will continue, albeit from the wrong side of the blanket. Damian had married in his 30s, but by that time he was sterile due to an unfortunate bout of adult mumps. During the promiscuous period of the 1968-69 Seasons, he had affairs with various young women. One of them could possibly be the mother of his child.Damian calls upon our narrator to assist him in finding his offspring and the prospective mother. What is so remarkable about the request is that Damian and the narrator had a major falling out in 1970, and lost touch with either other's life. The narrator actually hates his terminally ill former friend. ""Past Perfect's"" mysteries include: Does Damien have an heir? Why does the narrator hate Damian? And why does he accept Damian's request for help in his quest?In fulfilling the dying man's request, the narrator must return to his own past and, inevitably, compare it with his present existence. He has been forced to remember what he wanted from life at nineteen...before he knew what life was about. Now, thanks to Damien, ""he must bear witness to what happened to all those silly, over made-up girls, the  vain self-important young men  - and to what happened to himself."" ""He has been rendered discontented when it is nearly too late to fix, but soon enough to have many years ahead to live with that discontent.""There is a list of five women - five former debs whom Damien had sex with back then  - all of whom have children of the right age. As the narrator finds them and explores their past and present lives, more of the storyline, from the 1960s to the 21st century, are revealed. And  these women, also former friends of the narrator, are more than happy to discuss their pasts with him.

"Stephenie Meyer has created an extraordinary series, ""The Twilight Series."" ""Twilight"" is also the title of book one. And what original, delightful novels these are - even for someone who prefers her/his literature a bit more sophisticated. I could not put the first book down, literally...and will begin book two, ""New Moon,"" as soon as I finish writing this review. Believe me, there's a reason that more than 10 million ""Twilight"" series books are in print. They are addictive!Isabella Swan is seventeen - a typical teen, good looking but somewhat clumsy. She is adapting herself to her long limbs and changing body. Her parents have been divorced since ""Bella,"" as she is called, was a baby. She and her Mom live in sunny Phoenix, Arizona, where she has few friends. Bella is a shy and private person. But she gets along with her mother - miracle of miracles for an adolescent girl/young woman. Bella is also this stories narrator, so the reader experiences everything from her point of view.Each year she visits her father, Charlie Swan, the chief of police in rainy, dreary Forks, Washington. These annual visits have been more of a torture than a treat for Bella. The constant rain, boredom and loneliness would get anyone down, except for those used to life in Forks. She has only three friends there - Jacob Black, a Native American of the Quileute tribe, (also a teen - and a handsome one at that), his father, Billy Black, and tribal leader Sam. All three are absolutely fascinating and original characters. They have known Stephanie since she was a toddler. The 3 of them have always regaled her with ancient Quileute legends.Bella's mother, Renee, is about to travel with her new husband, Phil Dwyer, a minor league baseball player, to Florida for spring training. Bella has little choice - she can move with her mother and stepfather to Florida, or go to Dad in Forks. She decides to go to Dad so as not to be a third wheel in her newly wedded mother's marriage. Bella, is not a selfish person. She tends to consider others' needs before her own, a trait that can bring her joy, but can also endanger her life.It is in Washington that major changes effect Bella's world. Once installed at Forks, she is not reticent about expressing her displeasure to Charlie, who would do anything to make his daughter happy - except move away from his home. When she begins high school, the lovely Bella, the new kid on the block, surprisingly finds herself very popular. With all the attention she receives, she is quickly befriended by a several students. Unused to being the center of attention, she is dismayed to find that many boys/young men compete for her favors. And she begins to enjoy living with her easy-going, somewhat introverted father. But Bella, who is more embarrassed than flattered by her newfound popularity, has eyes for only one boy - the dazzlingly handsome, aloof, charismatic, Edward Cullen. He is the most beautiful person she has ever seen, with his golden hair, and his dark brooding eyes - even his voice is mesmerizing. Edward is the youngest son of the mysterious and reclusive Cullen family. He and his four siblings, also noticeably beautiful, sit apart from the others, at a separate table, during lunch....but they never eat. He watches her intently, but alternates between interest in Bella and what appears to be anger at her.When Edward and Bella are assigned to be lab partners in chemistry class, he avoids working with her or even looking at her. As a matter of fact, he is downright nasty. However, when an accident almost ends Bella's life, Edward saves her in a most non-human way. It is than when Bella discovers that Edward and his family are ""benevolent vampires"" who have vowed never to drink human blood. They hunt animals, and the blood of deer, mountain lions, bears, etc., is their source of sustenance. They don't eat - except for animal blood - so they dine in private. They do not sleep, and of course, they all have the usual vampire super human powers...and then some. They are all extremely sophisticated, accomplished and alluring. They can walk in daylight but their skin gleams and glitters in direct sunlight. These strange and potentially dangerous beings, unlike the characters in most vampire fiction, seem to have hearts and souls. So as not to give themselves away, they are happiest when it rains and is dark and misty outside. The head of the household, Carlisle, is a respected doctor in the community, whose citizens have no idea that there are vampires in their midst, although Jacob and his Native American tribe know.So Bella and Edward grow close as friends, and then they much more. They yearn for each other - and although the word ""yearn"" may sound corny, it really describes their feelings for each other. ""Twilight"" is labeled ""young adult"" because there is no culmination of the couple's strong sexual attraction. They do not have a sexual relationship. However, there is much sensuality here and plenty of erotic kissing. Actually, I think the abstinence gives the feeling of more passion than usual. Edward is a gentleman and also fears that intercourse with Bella might harm her...him being a super strong vampire and all.As Bella says, ""About three things I was absolutely positive: first, Edward was a vampire; second, there was a part of him -- and I didn't know how dominant that part might be -- that thirsted for my blood; and third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him."" Bella also discovers the reason behind Edward's initial hostility toward her. He is torn between his desire to love her and the desire to devour her. He is afraid his vampire nature might become stronger than his self control.I do not want to give the plot away. Let it suffice to say there are multiple storylines and much danger here - to Bella and her family. And there is love. Plus, the Native Americans are more than what they seem.Whatever flaws there are in this novel, (it IS fantasy fiction!), the magical narrative overcomes them threefold! I am thrilled that I have 3 more books to read in the series. This one is exceptional!JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5K02VIHMGJWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016W1KMQM#wasThisHelpful","R5K02VIHMGJWX","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shanghai China in 1937 is known as the ""Paris of the East."" It is a thoroughly modern, international city, with a large foreign community. There is also a heavily populated Little Tokyo section, where Japanese residents promote ""Friendship, Cooperation and Co-prosperity between China and Japan.""Sisters Pearl and May Long, (a generational name, ""Long"" means ""Dragon""), are the novel's protagonists. Pearl, the older sister is the narrator. She is quite lovely, very tall and willowy with rosy cheeks. These attributes, however, prevent her from being considered a classic Chinese beauty.

Both sisters have been educated by American and British teachers, and Pearl, who is an excellent student, is fluent in four languages. May is more flighty, charmingly spoiled, and has little interest in studies. They have defied their father, ""Baba,"" who believes in the Confucian religion which says, ""An educated woman is a worthless woman."" And they both plan to marry for love.Unfortunately, ""Baba"" Long, who is an affluent businessman, has a gambling habit and owes a fortune to the criminal Green Gang headed by Pockmarked Huang. The crime boss is so powerful that his reach extends throughout China and beyond. So Baba makes an arrangement with Huang to remunerate him. His daughters are to be sold into an arranged marriage and the money used to pay off the gambling debt. The Long family has lost everything and is threatened with death if the agreement is not honored.The grooms are ""Golden Mountain men,"" who have traveled with their father, Old Man Louie, to find brides in China. Pearl and May are married within twenty-four hours after learning of their father's ""troubles."" Old Man Louie lives in Los Angeles, where he owns various factories. His older son, Sam Louie, is about Pearl's age and although not educated, he has a pleasant demeanor. However, the younger son, Vern, is only fourteen and May is horrified to be forced into a relationship with this boy. Non-quota immigration visas are obtained for the sisters at the American Consulate. Pearl and May are to take a boat to Hong Kong to meet their new husbands and father-in-law, who have traveled ahead of them. From there they will all take a ship to Los Angeles.A few weeks later, in July 1937, the Sino-Japanese War breaks out. During the first months of the war, the city of Shanghai is brought under the control of the Japanese army. The Japanese wage a fierce three-month battle and Chinese and Japanese troops fight in downtown Shanghai and in the outlying towns. The sisters, caught up in the horrific bombings, flee the city with their mother, looking for a way to Hong Kong. Along the way, Japanese soldiers repeatedly rape both Pearl and her mother, while May remains in hiding. The mother dies and the sisters barely escape with their lives.They manage, after much hardship, to obtain steerage passage to Los Angeles. The sisters suffer for months as internees at the Angel Island Immigration Station, the Ellis Island of the West, where they are harshly interrogated. Eventually they are reunited with their husbands and their new family, and learn, with great difficultly, to adjust to life in Los Angeles' Chinatown.Lisa See explores the strong relationship between the sisters, and the importance of family in the Chinese American culture. The Chinese encounter tremendous prejudice from the moment they enter the United States, through WWII and during the Korean War, when the North Koreans are assisted by the Communist Chinese government. The McCarthy era proves to be even worse, as patriotic Chinese-Americans are persecuted for being spies for Mao and The Peoples Republic of China. The Louie family persist, however, and try to obtain as much of the American dream for themselves and their children as possible.This is a wonderfully rich historical novel. The in-depth character development is extraordinary. Ms. See's writing style is tight, fluid, and very descriptive. The author is a Chinese-American, (1/8 Chinese), and grew up in Los Angeles, spending much of her time in Chinatown. She has also traveled throughout China, to the modern cities and the most remote regions of the country. Lisa See has become one of my favorite authors.

"I was recently offered the Urqueen women's Top Blouse Button Down Printing Plaid Shirt by the product vendor, for my personal use and an honest review.Designed with a slouchy, relaxed silhouette, this laid-back boyfriend shirt is made of 90% Cotton and 10% Polyester and features a rustic plaid pattern. The shirt is extremely soft to the touch. I really like the plaid - I have the black and white.I hand-wash the shirt as I find that it shrinks. However, it is machine washable if one wants to take the risk..This shirt can be worn fashionably with jeans and tights or to sleep in. The major downside is that the shirt is definitely not true to size. I purchased an X-Large and it is really a small or small medium. What a major disappointment for me, as the shirt's largest size is X-Large. I wound up giving the shirt to my daughter who is petite. So, be wary when purchasing clothing made by Urqueen as their products do not run true to size.JANAI would normally give this item 4 stars, but because of the false sizing I can only rate it with 2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12WB3GLDUIJX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SNKIN2#wasThisHelpful","R12WB3GLDUIJX4","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee. In fact it is my favorite kind of coffee with its mild full flavor and lack of bitterness. I have a Keurig coffee maker and have searched for Blue Mountain Keurig K-Cups and have never been able to find them.I was pleasantly surprised when vendors from Dancing Moon offered me a 12-pack of their 100% Board Certified Genuine Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee K-Cups for Keurig Brewers in exchange for an honest review. As soon as the package arrived I made myself a cup of coffee. I have to say that the flavor and aroma exceeded my expectations.Before I had my Keurig coffee maker, I used to buy the Jamaican beans and grind them for use in my french press coffee maker. These K-Cups are almost as good as using fresh ground beans. I think this says a lot about the quality of Dancing Moon's coffee.As advertised this is 100% Board Certified Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee. Not a blend.Jamaican Blue Mountain has developed a reputation that has made it one of the most expensive and sought-after coffees in the world. So, yes, this coffee is expensive and while I plan to buy more coffee from dancing Moon, I will brew myself a cup for a treat and use a cheaper brand of coffee for everyday drinking.As an extra incentive to buy this particular product, 5% of all profits are donated to The Semper Fi Fund to benefit wounded servicemen and their families.PS - a piece of trivia...Jamaican Blue Mountain beans are the flavor base of Tia Maria coffee liqueur.JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LV19I5SZ48K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017A6WJ3M#wasThisHelpful","R2LV19I5SZ48K0","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Eliot, (nom de plume of Mary Ann Evans), wrote a literary masterpiece with ""Middlemarch."" This Barnes and Noble hard cover edition is a good one, however I would recommend their newer, paperback publication with an Introduction by author and poet Lynn Sharon Schwartz, or the Penguin Classic version. There is also a brief biography of George Eliot included in the B&N paperback. This superb novel will always rate 5+ Stars for me, but this particular edition is not the best.Ms. Eliot created here, an entire community in England in the mid-1800s and called it Middlemarch. She populated this provincial town with people of every station, local squires and their families, tradespeople, the rising middle class, (Middlemarch, right?), & the poor and destitute, ruthless and honest. She crowded them together, with all their ambitions, dreams and foibles, in this magnificent literary soap opera, and wove a wonderful web of plots and subplots. Ms. Eliot also wrote scathing social commentary and used great wit.The fortunes of Middlemarch are rising in this new era when machines and trains - fast, available transportation - are changing the world, the economy, the politics. Rigid social codes, the British class system, is in danger of being breached. Folks are out to make a quick buck, or a shilling - anything to acquire wealth and enhance social position.Dorothea Brooks lives in Middlemarch. She is an intelligent, sensitive young woman, who wants to dedicate her life to important endeavors. She does not want to settle for a typical marriage and family, but looks toward a more noble cause. As a woman, a professional life is not open to her, nor is the pursuit of intellect, outside of marriage. She weds the elderly Rev. Casaubon, a cold, narcissistic man, thinking that by assisting him with his scholarly research and writing, she will find happiness.Dr. Lydgate comes to Middlemarch to begin his medical practice there. He is an idealist, who has dreams of finding a cure for cholera and opening a free clinic. He meets blonde and beautiful Rosamund Vincie, who fancies him for a spouse...along with a new house, new furniture, an extensive wardrobe, etc.A dashing, romantic Will Ladislaw, nephew of Rev. Casaubon, enters the story, as does Rosie's brother Fred, who wants desperately to marry his Mary, but is out of work and in debt. This cast of richly drawn characters continues to grow with the introduction of Mary's family, the Garths, the banker Bulstrode, friends, relations, and an evil villain or two.This complex novel and portrait of the times, is one of the best reading experiences I have had in a long while. I cannot recommend it highly enough.JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BEML0546S3ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760701717#wasThisHelpful","R3BEML0546S3ZB","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Vicious Circle"" is a wonderfully entertaining, fantasy thriller a la noir. The novel abounds with otherworldly creatures - demons, ghosts, zombies, a succubus, lycanthropes, (loup-garous). and one of the Devil's highest ranking minions. What makes the novel really unique, however, is the humor. Felix, (""Fix""), Castor is one of the wittiest protagonists I have come across in a long while. And many of Mike Carey's other characters are real originals. Some of the dialogue made me laugh out loud while shaking in my proverbial boots.Castor is a hard-boiled but very sympathetic freelance exorcist/ghostbuster. London is his stomping ground. His business card reads ""F. Castor Eradications."" Fix, as his friends call him, is down on his luck and owes his landlady back rent - nothing unusual about this. Close friend, and former landlady, PEN, aka Pamela Elisa Bruckner, lives in a three story inverted penthouse - the penthouse is underground - and the monstrosity of a house has been in her family for eons, literally. She is a Wiccan Priestess and has been Castor's buddy since college days.The primary tool Castor uses in his trade is a whistle, a Clarke original, Key of D, (""the saddest chord""). He plays music on his tin whistle to bind and banish spirits. And naturally, he takes it everywhere. The whistle is for him what a gun is for a cop. Since the Millennium, which brought a great upsurge in supernatural activity, he has had to use his whistle and all his other exorcising accoutrements frequentlyFelix accidentally wove a master demon, Asmodeus, into his friend Rafi's soul about a year ago. Rafi and his demon now reside in a facility for the violent criminally insane. And all hell breaks lose, literally, when Asmodeus takes over Rafi's mind and acts out. At the top of Felix's ""to do"" list is to exorcise this powerful demon and set his friend free before he is transferred to a ""bottom of the line"" facility. This is not an easy task, as magical textbooks put Asmodeus at the top of the ""infernal pecking order,"" and he is burning Rafi up from the inside out!Felix's priorities multiply when he is contacted by the parents of a missing girl. They hire him to find their daughter. There's one catch - their daughter, Abbie, is a ghost. Abbie drowned on a school trip last summer, and about three months later she ""came back home,"" to her parents delight. If they cannot have their daughter back in the flesh, they'll take the spirit rather than lose her altogether. A few days before, a disreputable exorcist named Dennis Peace took Abbie's ghost, binding her to him, and claiming to be her real father. Abbie's parents believe that only a strong exorcist like ""Fix"" can go up against Peace and recover their daughter's ghost.Eventually, Felix gets a fix on Peace, but two loup garous show up with an equal interest in the exorcist kidnapper. They bludgeon Felix and do all kinds of other nasty things to him to get him to talk, but he doesn't have the information they want. So, he is left in really bad shape - barely alive. And the case of the missing ghost becomes more complex - all kinds of twists & turns, and lots more action and violence.Meanwhile, Felix's friend, Ajulutsikae, a powerful succubus, is trying her hand at exorcism - one can never have too many skills. Felix is allowed to call the sexual incubus ""Juliet,"" and she keeps her powers in check for him. Although she does drive him crazy with lust, he is able to control himself when in her company. Juliet is investigating a haunted church. Another one of Hell's minions has woven itself into the fabric of the church. Resolving this dilemma and saving the congregation proves to be too complex a task for Juliet's novice capabilities - so she calls upon Felix for help. One could say his whistle is being put to good use.This is no predictable paranormal mystery. The mystery is extremely difficult to solve and the villains are almost too powerful to defeat. A sinister, shadowy air permeates the novel. Carey's exotic characters, the human and not so human, are wonderfully conceived and at times outrageous. Carey's descriptions are very creative and often funny - which provide a break from all the heavy stuff. However, too much extraneous information and way too much graphic violence kept me from rating ""Vicious Circle"" 5 Stars. The book needs a bit more editing and toning down.""Vicious Circle"" is the second in the Felix Castor series. Although this series is Mike Carey's first foray into fiction, he is a highly successful comic book writer who created the critically acclaimed Vertigo series Lucifer, which garnered numerous international awards and was nominated for five Eisners. I can't wait to read book 3, ""Dead Men's Boots.JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNCAK2UXU48V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GG434M#wasThisHelpful","R2HNCAK2UXU48V","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rooftops of Tehran is both a bittersweet coming of age tale as well as a story of the tragic loss of innocence.The setting is Tehran in 1973 and 1974, a period when Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, a brutal dictator, ruled his country with an iron fist with the help of the United States. Members of his National Intelligence and Security Organization, the dreaded SAVAK, were seemingly everywhere. Mohammad Mosaddeq, the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran, from 1951 to 1953, was famous for his passionate opposition to foreign intervention in his country. He was removed from power by a coup d’etat funded by the British and U.S. governments. The Shah, who had gone into exile during this period, returned to Iran, triumphant, and resumed total power once more.Pasha Shaheed, our seventeen year-old protagonist, is too busy getting on with his young life and the process of growing up to be concerned with matters that do not involve him, his family and his friends directly. Pasha and his best friend, Ahmed, just completed eleventh grade and will return to high school in the fall as seniors. They are already making plans for college. Pasha’s father desperately wants his son to study civil engineering in the United States so he can return to Iran and build bridges. Pasha wants to study film making. Typical!The two best friends spend the spring and summer months sleeping on the rooftops, as do most Iranians, in order to escape the heat. They talk, with intensity, about life in general – “There are no walls around what we say, or fears shaping what we think.” There is much humor in their discussions also, and in their schoolboy pranks and antics. Most of all, they talk about the young women they are in love with. Pasha and Ahmed are from Iran’s burgeoning middle class, and live during a period, before the 1979 revolution, when it was OK for unmarried boys and girls to have friendships, even to fall in love and demonstrate modest affection for one another, although this still remains taboo amongst the poor and the more religious people.Ahmed loves Faheemeh in silence. Everyday he bikes ten minutes to her neighborhood, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. He makes friends with her two overly protective brothers to become closer to her, and dreams and schemes about a way to meet her. His father has told him that “Persians believe in silent communication; a look or a gesture imparts far more than a book full of words.”Meanwhile, Pasha loves Zari, a neighborhood girl who is a close friend of his, but who has been betrothed, since birth, to Pasha’s dear friend and mentor, Ramin Sobhi, a political science major at the University of Tehran. Everyone calls Ramin “The Doctor.” The teenage boy feels torn. He idolizes “The “Doctor,” but is desperately in love with, and desires, the girl his friend is to marry. Guilt abounds.Eventually, Pasha, Ahmed, Faheemeh, and Zari become close friends.They share their most personal experiences with one another. All four are very aware of the undercurrents of feelings which pass between them. They attempt to delicately balance friendship and love.“The Doctor” is very political, and hates the repressive mullahs as much as he hates the Shah’s regime. He is extremely intelligent, yet, he is a humble young man. One day, he tells Pasha that he, Pasha, has “That.” “That” is a “priceless quality that is impossible to define, really…but you recognize it in the actions of great people.” He begins to educate Pasha about the lack of democracy in Iran. He tells him of the jails where innocent people are held, sometimes forever, with no trial, formal accusations or evidence. Many are horribly tortured. Others simply disappear.""The Doctor” informs Pasha that he will be away for a while. He is going to an area near the Caspian Sea with a group of college friends to teach literacy, a service the government frowns upon. He plans to marry Zari when he returns. But he never returns.Mahbod Seraji’s characters come to life on the page. The main characters’ extended families – loving, boisterous and eccentric – bring much humor and some sorrow to the well written narrative.My one problem with the novel is also a strong point of the novel. The qualities shared by the book’s characters are universal qualities. This story could be about people anywhere, especially in countries where there are repressive governments. It is not difficult to identify with Pasha, his friends and family. They are like us. And we hear and read about such horror in the world today that we have become inured, in a sense, to the unspeakable. The situation in Iran under the Shah is really no worse than life in that country today – or in many other countries.I did not get a real feel for the fascinating Iranian culture or the Iranian people. I wish the author could have incorporated more of the “differences” between the West and Iran, instead of accentuating the sameness.Overall, I really did enjoy the novel and highly recommend it.

"""Elizabeth of York: A Tudor Queen and Her World"" is not historical fiction, rather a work of history researched and well written by Alison Weir. Here she documents the life of an English Queen Elizabeth - not as well know as Elizabeth I, ""The Fairy Queen,"" nor Elizabeth II, England's modern day monarch. Our protagonist is Elizabeth of York, whose obscurity belies the high profile of her connections.""In English history, the War of the Roses was a series of dynastic civil wars over the right to occupy the English throne. The two families with rival claims to the throne, were the Yorks and the Lancasters. This feud brought on a series of cruel civil wars in England in the years 1455 to 1485. The emblem of the Yorkists was a white rose and that of the Lancastrians a red rose. Because of this the wars were called the ""Wars of the Roses."" Elizabeth was very much a ""White Rose"" of the family York. In terms of convoluted plot twists, reversals, treachery, shifting alliances, military setbacks, and 'surprise' endings, this place and period have few parallels in history, making this book an extraordinarily absorbing read.Elizabeth's father, King Edward IV, married for love, not political alliance, which was something of scandal and caused endless problems during his reign. Elizabeth's mother, the former Elizabeth Wydville, (also spelled Woodville), was Queen consort of England, as the spouse of King Edward IV, and reigned from 1464 until his death in 1483. Her marriage to Edward was her second. She had previously married Sir John Grey of Groby, a Lancastrian, who was killed on the battlefield leaving Elizabeth a vulnerable widowed mother of two sons. Her second marriage, to Edward IV, was a cause célèbre of the day, thanks to Elizabeth's great beauty...she certainly lacked great estates as a war widow of the opposing faction. Elizabeth and her Woodville family's advancement was the cause of much strife in the country and resulted in at least 3 attempts to take the crown from Edward.Elizabeth of York was born at the Palace of Westminster, February 11, 1466, the eldest child of King Edward IV and his Queen. She had eight living siblings, five sisters - princesses all, and two brothers, - one brother, Edward, was to become King Edward V, and the 2nd male child, Richard of York, was named after Edward IV's father, Richard, the ""Grand Old Duke of York.""On Edward's death in 1483, the crown passed to his twelve year-old son Edward. Edward IV's younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, (the infamous King Richard III), was appointed Protector. He escorted the young king, and his brother Richard, to the Tower of London where they were settled in the royal apartments...at least for a time. The famous Princes in the Tower were never seen again. However it is unknown whether they were killed or who killed them if it happened. On Richard's orders Parliament declared, in the document ""Titulus Regius,"" that the two boys were illegitimate, on the grounds that Edward IV's marriage was invalid, and as such Richard was heir to the throne. He was crowned Richard III in July 1483.Henry VII, Henry Tudor, leader of the red rose Lancastrian faction, seized the throne in 1485 after Richard was killed in the Battle of Battle of Boswell Field. Henry grudgingly agreed to marry Elizabeth. In a masterful political move, Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of York finally married on 18 January 1486, thus uniting the Red and White Rose factions and finally ending the War of the Roses. Their first son, Arthur, was born on 20 September 1486. Elizabeth of York was crowned queen on 25 November 1487. Following her coronation she gave birth to six other children, Arthur, Margaret, Henry, Elizabeth, Mary, Edmund and  Katherine. The last three didn't survive infancy.I am an English history junkie, especially interested in the period in which Elizabeth lived - medieval and Tudor. So, Weir's documentation of the feasts and pageants that mark coronations, births, marriages and deaths with good, juicy and documented details fascinates me. While thoroughly scholarly, with  pages of annotations at the end, and much time spent in the text on detailed, substantiated arguments and counter arguments of historical contention, ""Elizabeth of York: A Tudor Queen and Her World,"" still manages to be irresistible as gossip. It’s full of vivid descriptions of the personalities, the ceremonies, the clothes, the residences, the beliefs, and the viewpoints that made up royal life, and to some extent common life, during the time of Elizabeth of York.If you want to take a wondrous trip though 15th and 16th century England, this is the book for you. Kudos to Ms. Weir.JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVISK6WUOSDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWS2JDO#wasThisHelpful","R3AVISK6WUOSDH","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""From Doon With Death"" is Ruth Rendell's first novel, and also marks the literary debuts of protagonists Chief Inspector Reg Wexford, and his partner in crime-solving, Inspector Mike Burden. At this somewhat late date in life, I thought it about time I explore Ms. Rendell's mysteries, and her psychological thrillers, which receive such rave reviews. My recent introduction to the author's works began with From Doon With Death. I believe in starting at the beginning.Now I understand what all the fanfare is about. This is an excellent mystery - and it is only her first effort. I know she has matured greatly as a writer in the forty plus years since she published this book in 1964. I look forward to following her development as a writer as I continue to read her books, authored under the name of Barbara Vine, as well as Ruth Rendell.Margaret Parsons and her husband of six years, Ronald, have recently moved to Kingsmarkham in Sussex. They are a happily married, rather introverted couple, and keep to themselves most of the time. Although Margaret is a lay preacher at the local Methodist Church, and has some acquaintances there, the two have not made any friends yet. They are definitely not wealthy and live a very frugal existence. Ronald works for the Southern Water Board at Stowerton and Margaret is a homemaker, a good one too. Their large, ugly house, is not well constructed, nor does it have a refrigerator, washing machine or other modern conveniences. It does contain, however, a small but very expensive collection ofVictorian literature and poetry, bound in suede, scented leather and watered silk. All are inscribed, on the fly leaves, from Doon to Minna, and the messages are personal, romantic, and intense, to say the least.At the book's beginning, a frantic Ronald Parsons telephones Inspector Mike Burden, a neighbor, to tell him that his wife hasn't come home that evening. The body of the thirty-two year-old woman, is found the next day, strangled in a near-by wood. She had left home with only her keys and purse, not even her coat. When the valuable book collection is discovered in a trunk in the attic, the investigation takes on a new nature. Who are Minna and Doon? And who was Margaret Parsons?Although the seemingly prim and proper Mrs. Parsons is dead when the story begins, the author paints a vivid portrait of the victim in retrospect, through the testimonies of those questioned in connection to the crime. Chief Inspector Wexford, with his countrified ways and off-beat humor, is a meticulous detective, if somewhat eccentric. Inspector Burden, also very competent, makes a wonderful straightman and side-kick. The narrative is taut, the characters diverse and original, and the mystery suspenseful. I couldn't figure out who did it. Ms. Rendell also writes a scathing commentary about the idle rich. This is a book that stands the test of time and continues to rivet its readers. I highly recommend it.JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GAC1EZV94HXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTJRPJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3GAC1EZV94HXF","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gabriel Garcia Marquez' One Hundred Years Of Solitude is the literary equivalent of a magic carpet ride, your own magic genii come to life, and Shaharazade's 101 tales wrapped into one brilliant, multilayered epic novel. From page one you will voyage with the most remarkably original cast of characters, through worlds of vibrant color, where the sun shines almost always - when not obscured by a four year downpour. You will find yourself laughing out loud when you are not sobbing in sympathy with someone dying of heartbreak. I do not like to label Sr. Garcia Marquez' work ""magical realism."" There is no label to accurately describe the writing that gifted us with One Hundred Years Of Solitude. This is a book that defies description. You must read it to experience the fantastically real world of Macondo, and the people who live there. Once you know them, they will be a part of your own world forever. Have you ever looked at a painting, walked into it and become a part of it? When you open this novel at page one, you are beckoned to enter.Macondo is a mythical South American town, founded, almost by accident, by Jose Arcadio Buendia, and populated primarily by his descendants. This is the story of one hundred years in the life of Macondo and its inhabitants - the story of the town's birth, development and death. Civil war and natural calamities plague this vital place whose populace fights to renew itself and survive. This is a huge narrative fiction that explores the history of a people caught up in the history of a place. And Marquez captures the range of human emotions and the reasons for experiencing them in this generational tale.There is much that is delightful and comical here. Surprises never cease, whether it be Remedios ascending, or a man whose presence is announced by clouds of butterflies. There is satire, sexuality and bawdiness galore. But there is also a pervading sadness and futility that permeates throughout. Cruelty is a reality in Marquez' world, as are failure, despair and senseless, sudden violence. The plot is filled with passion, poetry, romance, tragedy and the echoes of the history of Colombia and Latin America.I first read One Hundred Years Of Solitude in 1968, while living in Latin America. I have read it 2 or 3 times over the years, always picking up new pieces of wonder that I had previously missed. This is my favorite novel, and I am an avid reader. My favorite fictional character is Melquiades, the gypsy who foretells the future of the township and whose ghost accompanies the reader until there is no more to read. Having read this in Spanish and English, I must laud Gregory Rabassa's extraordinary translation which faithfully brings to life not only Marquez' story, but his lyrical prose. This is one of the 20th Century's best works of fiction.

"There has been an epidemic of bed bugs in NYC and although I am pretty sure my apartment is not infected, I was searching for a very good mattress protector and pillow protectors and when a friend recommended the SureGuard pillow protectors I took a chance and purchased the product.

"I was recently offered the ""Smart Weigh CSB5KG Digital Multifunction Kitchen and Food Scale with Bowl"" by the product vendor, for my personal use and an honest review. I have had the scale for about a month now and have used it frequently, specifically to discover how accurate the scale is and how well I am able to accustom myself to using a scale rather than a measuring cup.I discovered, over the last 30+ days, that a kitchen scale is extremely useful because volumetric measurements, (cups, tablespoons, teaspoons), are the wrong way to measure large amounts of anything that is not a liquid. When you fill a measuring cup or spoon with any ingredient, the amount you get depends on a number of factors: how small you’ve sliced it, how tightly you’ve packed it in, how carefully you’ve scooped, etc. But when you weigh the same ingredients on a scale, none of these factors comes into play. Four ounces of flour, (or cheese, carrots, honey, etc.), are 4 ounces, no matter who’s measuring, or how. A food scale teaches you a lot about portions. It shows you what 4 ounces of protein looks like and what 1/4 cup of pasta really is. I especially like a food scale for baking and for helping me to watch my weight.The ""Smart Weigh CSB5KG Digital Multifunction Kitchen and Food Scale with Bowl,"" instantly computes weight and displays it on the large easy-to-read blue backlit LCD display. The digits are extra-large which make them easy to read. The scale features a 60-Second auto shut-off.  It switches easily between units of measure - grams (g) and ounces (oz) - for easy weight translations. A button on the left toggles between kg and lb and also is used to calibrate the scale if needed. Instructions for doing that are in the included user guide.The extra-large weighing platform offers ample room for large ingredients and containers. The scale is designed to weigh up to 5000 grams, (approximately 11 pounds), in 1 gram increments for precise measurement. If you place a bowl or item on the scale after its been turned on all you have to do is push the on button again and it will reset to 0.  You can then add the food you to want to weigh.Also included is a removable bowl with a pour spout for efficient liquid weighing. The bowl has a 5 lb. capacity and is dishwasher safe. This unit is powered by 2-AA batteries which are provided.So far I have found this to be an excellent product. It has proven to be accurate and convenient.

"I was recently offered the ""Smart Weigh Precision Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale"" by the product vendor, for my personal use and an honest review.

When you step on the scale, you will be able to get readings on an immediate basis. No on/of button here. The scale automatically shuts off after 10 seconds. The weighing platform is extra wide, 12"" x 13,"" which helps to prevent slippage. There is an easy to read backlit LCD display with tall 1.2"" digits. I don't have to squint my eyes to see the numbers.This is advertised as being manufactured with high precision sensors to provide the most accurate and consistent weight readings. I have weighed myself frequently over the past month. I am watching my weight so this offer came at the perfect time. I have compared my weight on this digital scale with my analog scale and the ""Smart Weigh"" proves to be consistent. With the analog scale, a good one, I have to make occasional adjustments so that it registers zero pounds before I step on.The strong tempered glass design of the unit has a sleek and slim appearance. It can support people weighing up to 330 lbs /150 kg. The scale takes four AAA batteries which are included.The ""Smart Weigh"" scale is backed by a two-year manufacturer's warranty.As I wrote above, I am extremely pleased with this product and may buy one for a friend who plans to go on a diet. ;) Seriously!JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLCKG8QTKPHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFRZVQI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLCKG8QTKPHW","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Remembrance"" depicts a remarkable love story that blossomed amidst the terror of a German concentration camp in 1944 Poland. Screenwriter Pamela Katz used the true life story of the late Jerzy Bielecki, a Polish man who fled Auschwitz with his Polish Jewish lover, Cyla Cybulska, as the basis of the script for German director Anna Justice’s 2011 film. The film is in English. This is such an emotionally powerful and poignant tale and has stayed with me for a long time after I saw it.In a WWII concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, the film follows young Polish prisoner Tomasz Limanowski, (the real life Jerzy), played by Mateusz Damieck, and his Jewish girlfriend Hannah Silberstein, (in actuality Cyla Cybulska), with Alice Dwyerin in this role.There are two interwoven stories here framed in flashbacks. The film opens in 1976 and fifty-two year-old Hannah, (now played by Dagmar Manzel), is married and living in New York. She is suddenly overwhelmed by memories of Auschwitz and what came after it. This flow of feeling is prompted by an interview she sees on television. The man on the screen is recalling his flight from Auschwitz and as she listens she is seized with the conviction that he is Tomasz, whom she has long believed to be dead. She desperately calls the Red Cross that day, for the first time since 1946, when her initial search for Tomasz had led to a dead end. Now Hannah is conflicted by her feelings. She has a well established life and family but she also has a deep need to see Tomasz again.The storyline then cuts back in time to 1944, where much of the action takes place. Tomasz Limanowski, a captured member of the Polish resistance, manages to aid the ""cause"" from inside a concentration camp, where his slave labor includes supervising distribution of loaves of bread. As a non-Jewish political prisoner, he lives in slightly better conditions than his fellow inmates. His resistance task in the camp has been to capture photos of the horrifying war crimes taking place and smuggle out the negatives that will reveal these crimes to the outside world. Hannah Silberstein is a young German Jewess imprisoned in the work camp. She and Tomasz fall desperately in love and it is their love which sustains them, somewhat, amongst the horrors of reality. Whenever possible, Tomasz buys off his fellow office worker with a bottle of vodka so that he and Hannah can be alone together. They share bread that Tomasz has stolen for them and they share love, almost as precious as food in the camp. With the assistance of other inmates, Tomasz gains access to an SS uniform and forged papers. On the day of the escape, terrified that it is happening too quickly to be fully prepared, Tomasz dresses up as an SS officer and demands that Hannah follow him, all the while horrified that he will be exposed as a Polish prisoner. Tomasz walks her to the exit of the camp. The guard, not picking up on Tomasz's limited German, allows the couple to pass, and Tomasz and Hannah successfully march down the road until out of sight and run off into the woods. This escape strains the imagination...but it actually happened. Director Anna Justice captures the urgency of these scenes, imbuing them with tension. We feel the miraculous sense of relief in their flight - although their odyssey is far from over once they’re outside the camp, living as fugitives.The wartime sequences are so involving that I found it wrenching when the plot returns -  as it regularly does - to the older Hannah in New York. There's a staginess to these sequences and I found Hannah's husband's role, played by David Rasche, to be jarring and not in accord with the rest of the film. His voice and dialogue irritate me. The present day aspect of the movie doesn’t hold up in my opinion. Not only does this later storyline offer little of interest in terms of action, the scenes play out awkwardly, despite a steady performance from Manzel.""Remembrance"" is compelling viewing. Given the time span, it's important to establish the emotional bond, the human importance of what's at stake in the romantic relationship and how it was forged in the fires of desperation and danger. That's where the emotional depth comes from for both the characters and the viewers. The film's creators rightly call it a story about the effects of chance and the notion of the path not taken and the life not lived.JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R43VCJOGQ0TCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQPKK3K#wasThisHelpful","R43VCJOGQ0TCB","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was recently offered the ""KI Store Battery Operated Cordless Touch Screen LED Lighted Make Up Mirror,"" by the product vendor, for my personal use and an honest review.Seeing yourself accurately is essential for applying makeup accurately. As I age I find that I need more light to apply my make-up. Both of these mirrors, the rectangular one and the magnifying one, are made of ultra-clear, high-quality glass for superior reflectivity and clarity. I am, overall, very pleased with this product. My make-up mirror was getting old and the lights were not as bright as I require, so I was thrilled when I received the mirrors and found them to be almost perfect for my needs. The larger rectangular mirror, measures "" 6"" X 9.""  The small magnifying mirror, which measures 3"" in diameter, has suction cups for attaching it to the larger one, if one wishes to do so. The magnifier, with 10* magnification, is especially good when applying eye make-up. I occasionally put it in my purse for use outside my home.When your product arrives, after opening the package, you will see 1 rectangular mirror and 1 mirror stand. Mount the mirror on the base before use.  The mirror just snaps firmly into the base. Before inserting 4 AA batteries, not included here, make sure that the switch is in the OFF position. Open the battery compartment, located on the back, and insert  batteries. Close the cover. Before using the touch the sensor switch, make sure that the ON/OFF Button is in the ON position. Touch the sensor switch, visible at the bottom of mirror, and the lights with turn on. Touch the sensor switch again, and the lights will go off.  After you finish use, press the switch button to the OFF position to save power. I had trouble opening the battery compartment the 1st time and had to ask a friend to help me with this. After the first time, it  opened and shut easily. There are 16 LEDs in this mirror - 8 down each side. The mirror adjusts 180 degrees. The casing is made out of a thick ABS plastic. The base is very sturdy, and has a tiny tray built into it. The design in quite attractive.I do feel that the LEDs could be a lot brighter. This is still a very good product, however, I get much better light with the sunlight that comes through my window. For nighttime use this lamp is fine, but again, I could use more light so, for best results, I occasionally turn on a table lamp and with both lights I can see well enough to apply my make-up..JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQEMHY1KD35NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y02GVI4#wasThisHelpful","RQEMHY1KD35NZ","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like to drink wine with meals occasionally and I certainly serve wine when I have friends over. Often there is wine, good wine, left in the bottle. Previous to using the  AVINA wine stoppers, I had tried using another ""similar"" product and found that the wine frequently took on a different taste after storing it in the fridge for over a day or so. I am talking about white wine here, as I do not refrigerate red wine, but keep it in a cool place. With red wine, the previous stopper I used was not effective at all after 24 hours.I was recently offered the Locking Wine Stopper Set by the product vendor, for my personal use and an honest review. I am rating this a BIG HONEST 5 Stars!!! I have used the wine stoppers 3 times now. Twice with ""leftover""  white wine, that had been refrigerated for 36 hours for one bottle and about 50 hours for the 2nd. I allowed time to take the chill off the wine to serve it cool but not warm. On both occasions the wine tasted like I had just poured it from a fresh bottle. What amazed me most was the result of using a stopper on half a bottle of excellent red wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon. After about 48 hours I took off the stopper and allowed the wine to ""breath for about half an hour, (you can skip this step), and, once more, the wine tasted fresh. And the stoppers are so easy to use. Simply push and lock to close. Just lift and release to open the bottle. These stoppers are reusable.I think the secret to the success of this product is that the hermetic bottle seal provides to be extremely airtight. It is supposed to keep wine fresh for up to 5 days. I haven't tried this for a 5 day period yet, but given the results I have obtained so far, I think this will prove to be true. The best part is that if one is not satisfied, if the stoppers do not work as advertised, there is a product warranty. Once you register your purchase, if you subsequently break your wine stopper set, the company will replace it, (see pack for details).  AVINA bottle stoppers are designed to work with over 90% of wine bottle sizes. However, stopper kit is not suitable for most Champagne, Cava, Prosecco or Sparkling Wines.I highly recommend this wine stopper set. I think it is terrific for my needs.

"Katy Simpson Smith’s first novel is a dismal one. ""The Story of Land and Sea"" is set in Beaufort, a small coastal town in North Carolina, during the final years of the American Revolution. This is a multigenerational story of love and loss told in three parts, following three generations of fathers and daughters. The reader is introduced to John, who we find reflecting on the loss of his wife Helen. She died in childbirth several years before. John, a former sailor on pirate ship, has traded the sea life for one on land. He runs a store, and answers his daughter Tabitha's endless questions about his time as a pirate and about the mother she never knew. The young girl is enthralled by the idea of the ocean and identifies her mother with it. When Tab contracts yellow fever, John turns to the sea once more. Desperate to save his daughter, he takes her aboard a sloop bound for Bermuda, hoping the salt air will heal her.The novel begins with Tabitha's 10th birthday and works backward until it reaches her grandfather Asa, (her mother's father), who is a turpentine plantation owner and a devout Anglican. ""What if God didn't put us here to accept, but to struggle?"" is the novel's recurring question. Asa has suffered many terrible losses in his life, including the loss of his wife, brothers, and newborn sons.The second part of the novel is a flashback, telling the story of Helen, John's wife, Tabitha's mother and Asa's daughter. Her father dotes on her. At age 10 Helen is given one of Asa's young slaves, Moll. The complex relationship between the girls is one of the most powerfully drawn in this novel. As the girls grow up Helen meets John, the pirate turned Continental soldier. She flouts her father’s wishes by falling in love and marrying him. Moll, meanwhile, is forced into marriage with a stranger.Part three of the novel is about Moll, and her son, Davy. It also follows John and Asa after the Revolution. This section is nearly impossible to describe without spoiling some important plot points.""The Story of Land and Sea"" is not a fast-paced or exciting book. It is a melancholy read about life's disappointments and the pain of living. I was not prepared to read such a bummer of a novel. Yes, there's some beautiful writing here, but I found that the rhythm of the story suffered for the sake of artistic expression.  I love historical fiction and was looking forward to reading this but the characters do not speak to me. I felt very detached  from them. I was also sometimes confused because of the time frame and order of dates. The book moves back and forth from past to present and the story of Helen's and John's life seems to be out of order. ""The Story of Land and Sea"" is not a straightforward narrative, but instead turns out to be small bits of story pieced together to make a whole. The good thing about the book is that it's fairly short. The bad thing about it, for me, is that I didn't really like it. There is not one bit of joy to be found here.JANA","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38OY5OE774JK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062335944#wasThisHelpful","R38OY5OE774JK9","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The novel's central character, Harry Sanders, Jr., is a young Foreign Service officer, just shy of his 30th birthday. He is from a wealthy, liberal Connecticut family and from birth has led a privileged life. Since childhood, he has aspired to be a diplomat. We first meet Harry when he is serving with the United States Embassy in Indochina. He is smart and willing to tackle assignments beyond his experience. Although the country is not named, it is clearly Vietnam in the early 1960s before the United States sent in ground troops. It is a time “when the war was not quite a war, more a prelude to a war. Their army was called a guerrilla force. Our army was called a Military Assistance Command.” Harry, on the brink of a promising future, carrys out a dangerous and clandestine meeting with insurgents to explore an illusory talk of peace. The mission is destined to be a failure. Rather than dialogue with his opponent, Sanders is harangued by a Vietnamese captain until he realizes that ""the war would not end until the Americans got out of the way."" He is imprisoned in a jungle hut and left for dead. Harry barely makes it out alive. His feet are permanently damaged by the long, barefoot, fevered walk back to civilization. When he shoots a young enemy militiaman he is terribly traumatized. This misbegotten mission will affect him for the rest of his life, and have an impact on his career also. His “fate was to witness events 'I didn’t understand and would never understand.'” ""American Romantic"" chronicles the price American power exacted on the national psyche in the second half of the 20th century.However, as the title indicates, this is also is a love story, bracketed by Harry's life as a diplomat making high level decisions. We see him not only though his own eyes, but through those of his lover, a young German woman, Sieglinde, who is far more knowledgeable in the ways of the world. She is the product of the war with Germany, abandoned, orphaned, on the run from life. Although their relationship is very brief, his memory of her will haunt him for the rest of his life. This short affair will prove to be a pivotal point in Harry's life.The events of his first traumatic posting will follow him to more manageable positions in Africa and Europe. The second half of the book takes place after Harry is retired and his wife has died. He reflects back on his life. This section reads like a completely different novel. Harry is in love with a woman in each part of ""American Romantic."" The memory of  Sieglinde, in Asia, is very powerful and he cannot forget her. And May, his wife, an American from Vermont, is Harry's partner in a series of diplomatic postings around the world. On the surface, they are a handsome, successful couple, but May has her own baggage to contend with and she never fully acclimates herself to the diplomatic life. No matter how far he travels, the two women who populate his past and present continue to affect him deeply.I was intrigued by this tale of an American diplomat making his way through assignment after assignment from the 1960s to the present day. Through the story of the once idealistic, but increasingly cynical Harry we find that he has learned that diplomacy and intrigue can be inextricably entwined. Just’s book is both thoughtful and exciting. It is powerful in its depiction of the American involvement in the Vietnam War. This novel is somewhat reminiscent of Graham Greene's antiwar, anti-American novel, “The Quiet American,” written in the early 1950's. ""American Romantic,"" however, is intrinsically different from Greene's in that the author attempts to explain the American impulse of ""trying to make a better world."" To me, Ward Just is skilled at conveying emotions, at making the readers feel what his characters feel, and that is the greatest strength of ""American Romantic.""JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3METX1HGJYFDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544196376#wasThisHelpful","R3METX1HGJYFDT","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Battle of Okinawa] was a series of battles fought in the Ryukyu Islands, centered on the island of Okinawa, and included the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific War during World War II. During the 82-day-long battle the Allied forces suffered 14,009 deaths (over 12,500 Americans killed or missing) with an estimated total of more than 82,000 casualties of all kinds. This does not include several thousand who succumbed to their injuries received during the battle, but died days and even months later. Based on Okinawan government sources, Japan admittedly lost 77,166 soldiers, (not including civilians and supporting naval or air forces based elsewhere), during the campaign, who either died of wounds, were killed or committed suicide during the battle. No figures are given for supporting Japanese forces killed.This unusual novel, set on Okinawa, depicts with dreadful intensity the seemingly never-ending battle which was waged here. After the war, Japan surrendered an enormous chunk of valuable land for U.S. military bases, many of which, (including the Kadena air base), remain to this day.Sarah Bird's novel moves among several settings on Okinawa and manages to encompass the grief, beauty and turbulent history of the island. The reader experiences life on the U.S. military base on Okinawa in the present day and island life outside of the base. We visit Okinawa during World War II when  it served as a defensive barrier between Japanese and U.S. warships and we catch more than a glimpse of the Okinawan spirit world, as this historical fiction is full of Okinawan folklore. The author approaches her novel by weaving together the stories of two teenage girls, an American and an Okinawan, who live on the island 70 years apart.World War II-era, Tamiko Kokuba, suffered through the terrible battle. She stands atop a 150-foot cliff overlooking the sea, contemplating suicide. Tamiko worked in one of the cave hospitals set up on the island for the Japanese forces. Pregnant at age fifteen, she had been raped by soldiers on both sides of the conflict. With defeat certain, Tamiko finds herself squeezed between the occupying Japanese and the invading Americans. The spirits of the dead are part of her culture's life and she believes her entire clan waits for her in the afterworld. She envisions a netherworld populated by ""kami,"" (Japanese for “spirits”), “a hundred thousand spirits who’ve gone before"" as they ""greet us with cries of joy."" “They had no choice but to jump,” she mourns. “and, now, we have none. The soldiers, either Japanese or American, will kill us as soon as the sun rises. We cannot die such a violent death. If we do, we will be condemned to haunt this place forever and never be reunited with our clan."" Okinawan custom requires recovery of the body and regular tending to the remaining bones in order to to have a life after death. Thus, the novel begins with this intense narrative.We meet the second narrator, Luz James, in chapter two. She and her story are set in modern day Okinawa during Oban, a three day period where the dead are invited to return to their families for days of feasting and goodwill. Luz is an American, an ""army brat,"" daughter of a single mother who is the half-Okinawan master sergeant in charge of the police on Okinawa’s Kadena Air Base. We first encounter Luz on Suicide Cliff, the same cliff on which Kamiko once stood. “Jump? Or don’t jump?” She ponders, devastated by the death of her older sister and best friend Codie, who was serving in the Afghanistan war.Luz and Tamiko’s paths intertwine seamlessly in both literal and spiritual senses as Luz contemplates suicide and Tamiko waits for a body to house her spirit. I don't want to spoil this beautiful and most original story for you, so I will stop here. Let it suffice to write that I was caught up in this remarkable novel and came to care very much for its characters. I had never read any of Ms. Bird's books before. Now I think I will explore more of her work.JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMEDIK4CDP579/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350112#wasThisHelpful","RMEDIK4CDP579","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In March, 1944, Adolf Hitler launched ""Operation Margarethe"", the invasion of Hungary. Hungary's fascist government, collaborated with their German occupiers in forcing their estimated 800,000 Jewish citizens to hand over all of their valuables to government officials. This included gems, gold jewelry, wedding rings, paintings and anything else considered to be of high monetary value. The confiscated property was placed into individual bags and boxes which identified the owners, and receipts were issued. After a majority of the Hungarian Jews were shipped to concentration camps, primarily to Auschwitz-Birkenau where most were murdered, Hungarian authorities re-sorted all the confiscated valuables into content categories. By that time it was all but impossible to identify proper ownership of any of the valuables.In late 1944, as the Soviet Army was advancing on the Hungarian capital of Budapest, a government official concocted a plan to evacuate much of the Jewish loot out of Hungary. Large amounts of the valuables were then loaded onto a 42-car freight train that was to head for Germany. This was the Hungarian Gold Train.The train was intercepted by the Americans  and the majority of the assets was transferred to a Military Government Warehouse in Salzburg, Austria. The valuables were put into the control of the Americans and, for the purpose of this story, into the protection of a young American Jewish officer, Jack Wiseman, an honorable if overwhelmed lieutenant. In the first section of the novel, Wiseman obviously wants to preserve the possibility that some goods might be returned to the owners or their heirs and he struggles to guard the train’s contents. I was amazed and disheartened to learn that Americans were the primarily looters.Author  Ayelet Waldman has drawn the central event of her absorbing novel directly from history. She has devised a multi-part structure that allows her to focus on several distinct moments over a 100-year period. A generational novel set in Salzburg in 1945, and also in Budapest, both in the present and in 1913, the storyline  follows a precious necklace, intricately worked in the design of a peacock, a pendant with a tiny photograph of two women friends inside. Jack eventually steals this necklace from the warehouse.The first section of this story tells of  Jack's stewardship of the confiscated goods in 1945;  his love for a Hungarian woman in a nearby refugee camp; and the guilt which overshadows his life after he steals the pendant. The tale moves on to his granddaughter, Natalie Stein, in section two.  Years later, just before his death, Jack asks her to go on an all-but-impossible mission to find the rightful owners of the necklace or their heirs. Natalie searches throughout Europe and Israel and has a story of her own. The last section is set in Budapest  in 1913 where Waldman, who has has clearly conducted extensive research, brings to life the world of the Central European Jewish bourgeoisie and paints portraits, with words, of some of the people whose possessions would eventually fill the train. This last section is a narration by a Viennese psychoanalyst of his treatment of a young Jewish woman.I found  ""Love and Treasure"" to be a well written and worthwhile read. The characters, both primary and secondary, are well drawn.  Ayelet Waldman has created an intriguing narrative through which she explores the incredible wealth and stature of the Jewish citizens of Hungary before the war.

"I was recently offered the blue Hot and Cold Eye Mask, by the product vendor, for my personal use and an honest review.The eye pillow mask is filled with organic flax seed and French lavender flowers. The mask cover feels luxurious. It is made of a satiny material, very soft. You can smell the lavender before you open the package. The mask can be used either hot or cold depending on your needs. To heat it, you just mist it with water and heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds. It stays hot/warm for about 10 minutes. If you do not have a mister or spray bottle, which I don't, I just wet my hands with water and patted the mask until it was slightly damp. If you want a cold mask, put it in a zip lock bag and freeze it overnight. For more immediate relief of pain and stress you need only put it in the freezer for about 2-3 hours. My dermatologist told me that a cool eye mask works by causing blood vessels to constrict, which reduces swelling temporarily.I have tried the product three times now. I used it cold twice. I have a tendency to have puffy, tired eyes. I look at a computer all day and I read a lot. For me, the cold compress works better than the hot for these symptoms. The reduction in eye swelling was/is noticeable after a few hours. Since the mask molds to the face and eye area, it didn't fall off while I slept on my back. It is recommended for daily use for dark circles and puffy eyes.I heated this mask once, and the warmth felt wonderful on my face and eyes. However, the heat doesn't reduce the eye puffiness as well as when used cold. I think the heated mask would be good for headaches or migraines.One can also use the mask as is, without heating or freezing. The scent of lavender is soothing and very relaxing.IMPORTANT - for storage, place in a zip lock or air tight plastic bag and keep in a cool dry place.I am so glad I had the opportunity to try this product. I am thinking of buying one for a friend who suffers from headaches.JANA","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZU8TLMCP420L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKVHRW8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZU8TLMCP420L","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are three main characters in this literary romance. The book is told from the alternating viewpoints of these characters - thus the ""troika.""Julian Pravdin is a young Russian immigrant to the United States, an orphan with a violent past. He has the luck to be discovered and mentored by a very wealthy businessman and has become a self-made millionaire living in Manhattan. Sophie Pravdin is Julian's wife. She is beautiful, smart and sophisticated. She is also paralyzed from the waist down, a quadriplegic, due to a terrible accident. And Cuban-American Perla is a young exotic dancer who lives with her widowed mother in Miami. They can barely make ends meet. Perla, a young woman of grace, is quite intelligent, beautiful and complex. However, because of money problems she works as a pole dancer/lap dancer in Paris Nights, a slightly seedy club in Fort Lauderdale. Tips count for something when one is down and out.Uncharacteristically, Julian walks into Perla's club one evening. He appears to be every woman's fantasy, (except for the fact that he is married). He is attractive, wealthy, charismatic. Of course Julian and Perla meet. And thus begins a journey that will change the course of all their lives.This is a story of three broken people who are made whole through their powerful connection with one another.Adam Pelzman, in his debut novel,  explores the torment and emotional turmoil of Julian, Sophie and Perla. He writes with depth and passion.  The language is graphic, at times. However, it brings reality to the brutality and ugliness experienced by our characters. Pelzman tackles difficult and unconventional issues head-on. Oddly, while Perla and Sophie narrate in the first person, Julian is described in the third person. This doesn't quite work for me. It is not harmonious to the storyline. I felt that I never got to know the enigmatic and distant man who is Julian. On the other hand Perla's character is electric. She and her story remain with me well after I completed the book. Overall, I was intrigued and gripped at times by this unconventional novel.JANA","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6SNBOWXRJSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039916748X#wasThisHelpful","R2B6SNBOWXRJSI","A1RECBDKHVOJMW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RECBDKHVOJMW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are bags of chips that can be eaten rather quickly (and are AMAZING), but then there are bags of dried fruits that make a much more substantial snack or even meal replacement. It is nice to have snack choices that go from light to more filling depending upon need. The box comes packaged in a very sturdy box so there is no chance of the food being ruined or crushed.

"Frank Kusy is an absolute delight to read. I've never heard his voice (obviously) but I can almost hear him as I read his stories. I was very excited to see that he had a new book out for my Kindle and I gobbled this one up in just a couple of days.Part of what makes this book special and excites me is that fact that it is book one!  This feels like an incredibly personal journey into Mr. Kusy's journey to self-actualization. He speaks fondly of his mother and grandfather and it is obvious that their excellent examples were part of his journey. He was slow to take off, taking the time to observe the world around him but what shines through is a man who takes great care and compassion with those around him. As a person with relatives in an aging home, I found it particularly heart warming that this man went there to work and came out with enlightenment for himself and for those he touched. There is a robust character Mr. Sinai who I particularly adored.You won't go wrong with this book, or frankly any book by Mr. Kusy. This may be my favorite, but it doesn't take away from all the others- it just enriches his total opera omnia.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SSPHQ5C4RL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PZCPT0#wasThisHelpful","R10SSPHQ5C4RL6","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this product for knee pain and have noticed a vast improvement. I consulted with my doctor about exactly where to place the electrodes which I think is a smart idea for everyone because there are all sorts of warnings about where NOT to put them.  I just felt safer having my doctor instruct me as to where would benefit me most. I have found that a 3 or a 4 setting works best for me although that might be a bit too much of a sting for some. I have a fairly high pain tolerance and I could probably go even a bit higher than that but for now that works great. I leave the electrodes on for 5 minutes at a time and do it three times per day.The machine itself is lightweight, easy to operate, and extremely portable.

"One of my favorite things about this lip balm is that I can look at the list of ingredients and recognize them all.  It contains all organic ingredients and to me that's very important. I like to know what I'm putting on my body, especially on my lips and face. The balm itself is smooth and went on well. It was firm enough to have some substance but not so thick that my lips felt waxy. I think the consistency is spot on. The peppermint was a bit strong for me at first and if you have a low tolerance for mint oils, you might find it almost a bit too much, but it evened out pretty quickly and simply felt refreshing.

"These are delicious!I am completely impressed with every bar in this variety pack. I was offered samples for review and am thrilled to have experienced these bars. I have a child who has many allergies and he was able to eat every one of these bars. It was interesting to give a child a bar marked energy and to be able to see that they actually are energy bars!  The taste, consistency, and overall quality of these products is exceptional. The price point is also affordable and makes these a no brainer for my family to have as on the go healthy snacks. It's important to note these are dairy free and vegan products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30D2KFAFAJ85U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV3IO7U#wasThisHelpful","R30D2KFAFAJ85U","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be marketed as a young adult (YA) book but it is widely appealing. I think it shouldn't be stuck in that genre even though it does appeal to young adults. Any lover of fantasy, alternate realities, or other world fascinations will love this book. It starts a little slow and focuses some on character development which I appreciate in the start of a series. It quickly picks up though and I found myself reading it through in two sittings.Pat is a sweet little girl and I immediately identified with her and her world of annoyances and put upons. She finds a link between two worlds during her annoyance and uses that to escape and to entertain us!  There is a lot of room for D.J. Clarke to expand this world and heroes, to show us how the break happened, and to teach us more about the characters. I am very excited about the books to come.If you love fantasy fiction you are going to love this book. If your heart belongs to children and to cats, you are in for a real treat like I was!  This is a very fun and interesting trip around the imagination of this author. I highly recommend you give it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15R85VD3ONVXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSZV7D0#wasThisHelpful","R15R85VD3ONVXW","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a powerful little charging port! It is marketed for travel but I'm using it in my home for the million different devices that need a daily charge. I am able to charge my iPad, iPhone, Kindle, and phone case all at once. Normally products like this have an issue charging iPads because they use more power but this is truly 36W. I can charge all of these items overnight or for quick charges I just plug in one or two at a time. For example, my iPad goes from zero to fully charged in about 2 hours. If I catch it before it's in the red then it takes just over an hour to charge fully.I have been using this for about a week and do not notice any heat, there is no blackening of the wall plug that it is in, and no shortened battery life from my products.

"This is an incredibly strong first novel for author E. Squires!  I was delighted to find it to be such a well developed Dystopian novel with exceptional world building and character development. Heidi as the main character is brilliant, she is complex, brave, smart, and determined in her endeavors. It amused me to see that 17 year old girls in the future behave just like 17 year old girls now. They want to get away, forge their own path, and make their lives better.Newland is our dystopia in this story and it is comprised of a caste system or hierarchy- Masters, Advisers, and Laborers-  Taking this journey with Heidi was exciting, she is a determined and very strong female lead- who is thought to be a boy for much of the adventure!  I really loved the gender play in the book and how characteristics that we are so accustomed to assigning to one gender or another were handled. Something Squires did so well as break those barriers and show us that we are all just people.Excellent first book!  My only issue with the book is the editing, which could use a fair amount of work but didn't take away from the story enough to make me rate it lower than a 5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27G8EGXHZCIQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QP3SDNC#wasThisHelpful","R27G8EGXHZCIQC","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an outstanding book. It is a third in a series and this is the only of the three that I have had an opportunity to read. It stands on it's own and it's not at all necessary to read them in order, but I certainly will read the others now. Richard Taylor is a talented writer who is able to show us a heart warming story of love with a backdrop that is something many of us are unfamiliar with. I know little to nothing about war but being able to see the experience through the eyes of Izzy was very special. This is a romance, but one that has a very solid foundation and an interesting setting.I related a lot to Izzy and this is decades removed from the times of her experiences. The fact that this author can convey emotions in a timeless fashion is a unique talent. The characters Izzy and Abe find unlikely love and even more they find a love that they must fight for. The worth in their connection is tested in their journey and is enough to give everyone some hope as they read the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T4W8M8MMZ9U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QVWBG4K#wasThisHelpful","R1T4W8M8MMZ9U9","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is incredibly refreshing. Catalina Sanchez (Vega) does a grand job bringing us a children's book that actually builds up the self esteem of young girls in a way that is not interdependent upon a prince or some other type of male figure.The premise of the story is heart warming and the very compelling to young readers. If they can read themselves they will love it, but it is an excellent book to read to a child. I love the seed swallowing premise as much as I loved Jack and the Beanstalk as a child.

"Dameon Cox has brought us a very complex and moving story in Book 2 of the Zenith Series. I love so much that he includes maps with a lot of detail at the start of the book because the many scenarios and realms in this type of series are many.This is a book firmly in the fantasy genre and is epic, it reminds me of a very complex RPG Table story. I think Cox does a great job with his character development and his story line. There are no missing pieces of loose ends. What is great as well is that you can pick up book 2 before you've had the opportunity to read book 1 and not be lost at all. The maps are a great help!If you are a fantasy fan I highly recommend this book. It is clear that Mr. Cox has an incredible imagination and a gift for writing that allows him to share it with us all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13156S72NFS9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MN06Y9G#wasThisHelpful","R13156S72NFS9K","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was certainly a shocker!  I have no idea why the title didn't warn me but I was drawn in by the cover art, which as I write this and look at it should have been a clue!  Nonetheless, I'm thrilled to have read this collection of short stories that are steamy steamy!  Never could I have imagined a collection of stories that center around horticulture but focus on the erotic. It is a brilliant concept and I loved it.I love how the lovers in the book have a big range, it's different characters cast in these roles so we get to explore an entire range of erotic pleasure and experiences. This is twelve stories that are really well done and can be very quickly read. I read a couple a day very much enjoyed them all.This book is really well written and well edited, even if you think this is not something you'd enjoy, I'd challenge you to read it and NOT enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBP5IAT4VMZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLEFNLY#wasThisHelpful","R1VBP5IAT4VMZ0","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book!.  Mott does a great job exploring some hard topics. As I read I felt especially encouraged by the portrayal of Bianca. She was raised as a privileged girl who was given a lot in life. What she was given, however, that can't be seen in the comforts of her life was the ethic to be a hard worker and a goal oriented person.Bianca and her dreamy husband Tevin experience what is a nightmare by not being able to conceive. Bianca and Tevin soon learn that hard work and privileged can not guarantee them everything in life. The bounds of their marriage, their sanity, and their faith are tested in this great book.This is just an excellent and fast book that will entertain and keep you engrossed from start to finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30OB7JWXDAUEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DS3VR2G#wasThisHelpful","R30OB7JWXDAUEL","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those rare books where the characters actually carry the story and what happens in their environment or the world they live in almost becomes anecdotal. This is a love story through and through and shows us that love, when it is real, is timeless.Mikayla is a complex and interesting character, she explores love and her options in a way that is very much things we can see in ourselves., Christy has done such a great job developing her character. Love interest, Mitch- is my favorite because he struggles with memory, yet operates following her instinct and his heart.

"I have let this collection of poetry settle with me for a few days before writing this review because it is extremely an emotional collection.As a new mother I thought that I would be happy happy happy and everything would be simple like everyone else makes it seem. I quickly discovered that nothing is simple and nothing is easy and most especially nothing looks like it looks for my friends!  There is so much no one talks about or admit regarding motherhood, that it seems almost a crime what Vought has done by writing it all down. What I do know is that it's not a crime- it's a truth that if more people knew, would help.Vought bravely pulls us into a world where she understands the reality of motherhood and she is able to show us with her excellent poetry the love, the struggle, the heartbreak, the worry, and the fun. It was brave of her to write this and even braver to share her poetry with the world.  I'm glad she did.If you're a mom or love one, you need to read this.

The characters are so memorable and likable that I just want to read more about them.  If you take anything at all from this cover let it be the erotic part because WOW .. It sure is a steamy little book. The sex scenes are never gratuitous, however, they are well placed and mesh nicely with the story line. In a lot of books you see that they are making a story just to mask the erotica, but this book is different, there is a real and excellent story attached.I was so excited by the entrance of Count Dracula and I actually yipped a little while reading.

"What a fun book!  We don't see much humor in paranormal fiction but Haase does a great job showing us that even the paranormal world is not so serious all of the time.This is a young adult read so don't be worried about 14+ reading and don't hesitate to read yourself as an adult, I was fully engrossed and enjoyed the story very much. This book doesn't disappoint or pander to the younger age group. Often when we read young adult novels they seem almost condescending or like they are trying too hard. Haase doesn't do any of that, he just writes in a straightforward way which is very appealing.Now if you'd like to read about Ryan, his curse, and his path in his world as a savior then read this book and enjoy this world!

I found myself so invested in the lives of Jamar and Trenton.The prodigal sons of two influential men who just happen to be mortal enemies. Trenton is a bit of a ruffian and an unlikely match for Jamar- but the heart wants what the heart wants. I expected at the start that Jamar and Trenton would have a few hot romps and move on, but it was brilliant watching the love story emerge.There are many parallels to Shakespearean love stories and I like to see the symbolism from great literature roll over into modern stories about love and lust. Mahabeer works hard in this story to bring these characters to life through brilliant character development.

"As a 22 year old who spent the majority of my life with music pounding into my skull I have a slightly perceptible hearing loss. I know that sounds insane and I'm too young, but it's real and I'm certain it's from years spent with unregulated headphones.I've been reluctant to allow my son to use headphones or even listen to music loudly because his ears are so precious and studio grade protection for children is insanely expensive. MEElectronics offers an excellent middle ground with these lightweight headphones. I was struck immediately by their excellent construction and fun color.

He is thrilled to be invited to join a secret fraternity .. the unknown, the secrets, the intrigue draws him in and his passion for long time crush Malik plants him in place. What the book is fully of steamy passion, but is actually so much more. As you read (and blush and look over your shoulder to make sure no one sees you) you will realize that the sub text of this book is about more than love- it is about acceptance and brotherhood. A man embarking on his life post education and finding a place where he can so beautifully be himself and explore passion, love, and the types of human bonds that last a lifetime.This book is certainly 18+ and shouldn't be pigeonholed into a masculine gay genre.

"I was hooked right from the beginning of this book!  It is classified as a young adult novel and I fit in that category! I would, however, recommend it to my mum or my sixteen year old sister and fully expect them to love it like I did.In some ways this book is a cautionary tale told in this world of social media, instant gratification, and file sharing that goes viral. However, the book is much more than that. It is a foray into relationships, love, family loyalty, and the bonds that make us who we are.Our main characters Bea and Luke are extremely likable and remind us what love is like when first experienced. Bea is someone I especially loved because her life has been a challenge faced with loss and grief. Teson handled her story so well and was able to show us the full facet of this character with ease.The title of the book is not in any way misleading and maybe more of a caution!  Prepare to be twisted and turned as you go from page to page of this fast paced mystery/thriller/romance book.

Jonathan Dunne is talented in his ability to create a story with twists and turns that will make your heart beat faster and your brain arrive just at the moment truths are revealed.I have never been to Dublin and have always had a fantasy type wonder about the country of Ireland. It was an absolute treat to see the city through the words of Dunne, he writes in a way that makes the city real and both takes away some mystery yet adds even more. In the end the book just added fuel to my needing to see Ireland fire.The book follows Nathan, who has inadvertently stolen something from a member of Dublin's most powerful crime family.

I read this book vaguely aware that it was and then about 10 pages in had to make sure that it was!  Howell is a gifted author and creates this supernatural world in such a fun way that several times I wondered about what a great table master this author would make!The Willows is this very special and magical place where witches, vampires, and werewolves all live together in peace with truces and agreements in place.

"Well .. Justin and Leila have one steamy love affair!When Justin is set free from being held captive for years, Leila escapes the Harem and hides in his cabin. The two must rely on each other for survival and soon the sparks erupt.The book is erotica of the finest form, but it's also a story with a very well developed plot, and excellent character development. Daria Charon has done an excellent job of bringing Justin and Leila's experiences to us as each of them have needs and seemingly the other can help them achieve those needs.This is an excellent book, fun, fast, and contains some surprises. It is for adults and I'm looking forward to more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2ZKH1Z88X0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4FSN0A#wasThisHelpful","R2V2ZKH1Z88X0B","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the premise of this book which is that the past never remains the past. It is woven in the threads of who we are the decisions that we all make. Kabongo does a superb job bringing this truth to us in her novel. It is very well written, well edited, and with compelling cover art.The book is a mystery and the type of mystery that just keeps you reading. Not so much just reading to figure out the ending or what the twists and turns will reveal, but the type of mystery that draws you into it and brings you along for the ride. This family, the Coopers, are deliciously dysfunctional. They tell lies, they backstab, and they are not above any type of malice that will keep secrets buried.I especially love Shelby who is strong, brave, and full of enough knowledge about herself to understand her limits and her inability to trust others will hold her back. Her story is gut wrenching and honest in a way that it needs to be in order for this entire book to work. And work it sure does. Superb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301B9WCQ33O7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYCNXYU#wasThisHelpful","R301B9WCQ33O7Z","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Fanning myself*  This book is .. WHEW!  You should read this alone or with a very close loved, or desired one.This is a book first about the bounds of family. Alex has a deep desire to honor his mother and finds in that dying wish a way to honor himself and his desires. Alex falls for a male classmate and what happens is pages and pages of amazing erotic fiction.This book is more than just delicious erotica, it is also a bit of a supernatural ride as Alex becomes.. immortal!

"As a new mother I was drawn to this book. I was both horrified and absorbed by the story and the circumstances that make it so good. The book centers around six women who have all experienced the unthinkable- the loss of a child. We read stories like this and hold our own kids a bit tighter. Hayton does an excellent job of writing with compassion and with an excellent range of emotion. These situations are all our own worst nightmare and I feel like I've learned a lot from this work of fiction.The story also tells us a lot about the power of women and this group of women show us how to love and support one another through tragedy and the every day struggles of life even. They band together and with the help of a psychic end up finding a whole new puzzle. The book is excellent, and I very much enjoy the writing style of Katherine Hayton- she has clearly spent a lot of time with her characters and cares very much for the authenticity of their experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VRGOLFJNU3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNUMCZ2#wasThisHelpful","R21VRGOLFJNU3I","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forever one to judge a book first by its cover, I was immediately drawn to the steely gaze of Amun as he appears to us with the stark, black background and the vivid yet cold blue eyes. I was delighted to find that author J.S. Lewis is incredibly talented and able to share a story with his readers that will invest them emotionally and intellectually.Taking a page from ancient mythology is the premise of this book and the protagonist, Amun, in order to realize his full potential as a man must not only face and overcome the trials of every day man but he is also tasked with the fact that he must become immortal. We follow along with Amun as he embarks on an exciting journey towards manhood, leaving behind those he love in search of great power that will protect them in dark times to come. His character captivates us as he grows and matures before our very eyes and his pain and struggles we are able to identify with as they suddenly become our own. Towards the books breathtaking climax we find Amun at a crossroad of his destiny as he must save his people from peril and in order to do this he must not only face the opposition but the battle that rages inside himself. Amun must come to terms with his sexuality in a climate where his desires if acted upon are punishable by death.I was also deeply moved by the side stories of characters such as Annie Palmer, William Courtney and Danny Steele, each with a groundbreaking challenge of their own that everyone is able to relate to in one way or another. The writer has something for every human being in this multi-layered story of friendship, loss, love, romance and heartbreak.This book is moving and has a lot to say. The themes within the book are timeless and that is what makes books like these so important. It is set in the early Eighteenth Century and some of the struggles- genocide, slavery, sexual oppression, and discrimination are just as prevalent today as they were back then. The more we read, write, and talk about these topics the better life on this earth will be for all beings. I highly recommend this book for mature, open-minded audiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPYY9CLZFNO2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG7G4HK#wasThisHelpful","RPYY9CLZFNO2L","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book completely cracked me up. I love to read short stories because I can put them down and pick them up while reading other books but Bolaride Jackson has done so well with this book that I read it straight through.Following his years as a young attorney in North Carolina, Bolo, entertains and never fails to show us that every life contains hilarity and that in the end we are all just working at something.Jackson has an interesting life and handles challenges in the best of light.It was really enlightening to read about a time when law wasn't all that we see on television as the sensational world of wheeling and dealing. It was interesting, too, to learn about how much of Bolo's early career was about navigating the people and institutions that have long been a foundation in North Carolina.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KHDTTATRN8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HMTD60S#wasThisHelpful","R11KHDTTATRN8E","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karen Andor is a talented, insightful, and honest writer. The book deals with some extremely difficult situations and scenarios and could be considered a trigger for some people who have suffered trauma. It can also serve as a different perspective or outcome that may help the healing process a bit.The book follows a young boy and his brutal life at the hands of a violent alcoholic father and a mother who is not in any way equipped to be his advocate. What is fascinating is that the book expertly travels the realms of the boy's mind as he slips into his own brain to find the solace and comfort that he is unable to find in life. He has learned in life that relationships are painful because every relationship he has is bad. He goes out of his comfort zone and falls in love with an animal and that even ends in tragedy.This is a great glimpse into the incredible power of the human brain to protect us from realities that we can't possibly comprehend or deal with. The child has the beginning signs of what could end up being a severe identity disorder.I am very impressed with the way that Andor develops this story and with the respect she gives the main character. It is rare to see such difficult subject matter handled with as much grace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJSBW33TBM5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HOGN6TU#wasThisHelpful","R1OJSBW33TBM5S","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book deals with some pretty horrific subject matter that I had been previously unaware of. This story is, as the cover suggests, about a man and his dog. Greg Smith does a great job making the dog, Shadow, a main character. The development and the way Smith navigates us to love this animal is truly masterful storytelling.Captain Cramer is Shadow's companion and as a Marine he is a compelling character of strength, fortitude, and a willingness to do what is right. I very much enjoyed his part in this book. He is an outstanding main character and an hero who has the understanding of right and wrong to his core.This book is at times difficult to read because of the tough subject matter but I encourage you to read on and get past the parts that make your heart hurt because the story is really a special one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYN3MY05BX6EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3EAJVC#wasThisHelpful","RYN3MY05BX6EG","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The trouble with women, ' said Moira, 'is that they don't stick together. If women stuck together like men do they could rule the world."".This is an important quote from the book and shows us a bit of where this book goes as its main theme is of three sisters and their escapades surrounding a hilltop observatory.I find S.A. Jefferies writing style to be fluid and descriptive. Careful attention and time was taken to develop their characters, especially Jenny, and I was able to navigate around their surroundings as if I have been there myself.I think that the themes in this book are important and well examined in a fictional and exciting setting. Enough so that I was left wondering about the themes of female strength and the bonds that we share and how important it is for us all to work together. In a society where media pits women against each other and celebrates critical behaviors it is important to remember that strength comes in numbers.This is an excellent read that goes very fast.

"What a delight this book is!  I love an excellent historical romance and this certainly meets the mark with abundance. Hannelore Moore has a fluid writing style that feels like it is effortless and flows right into the pages.I absolutely loved being brought into Evangeline's world especially because it's 18th century England!  Books like this never stop thrilling me because they are glimpses into worlds that I can only imagine, and when someone else imagines them better than me and has the talent to write it down I am grateful.Evangeline has earned the moniker ""The Ice Goddess"" not because she is ice cold but because she is shy and doesn't engage the way other greedy or power hungry women of her time did. Her aloof countenance falters when she meets Kendall and struggles with the love she feels for him and the way she feels for herself.I really enjoyed this book and it was an excellent way to spend an afternoon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C28ZHACV13SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1GY4X2#wasThisHelpful","R1C28ZHACV13SE","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am fascinated by this book and completely impressed with author Ariane Page. As a student I have recently taken several classes in the Psychology and Sociology areas and have learned about different theories of the brain, motivation, and social norms. Ariane Page has brought us her very well conceived and written ideas about love and motivation.Learning how we process love is always fascinating, because we all love, we lose, we learn, and we try again. The theory in this book is LIFE, which an acronym for Law Inherent to the Five Elements. This is my first exposure to the LIFE theory and if it was explained and examined differently I probably would have disregarded it, but Page brings it to life in a practical and understandable way that makes me hungry for more information and a deeper understanding.I'm anxious for more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109EH9UGWEPKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUQM800#wasThisHelpful","R109EH9UGWEPKP","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a tremendous story that made me laugh and cry. Mostly it made me realize that so much of our value today is in the moments and the lives of those who came before us. The way that Billy Battles' great-grandson takes the love, attention, and care necessary to make stories from the journals is tremendous to me.Selfishly I took special delight in this book because Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are featured and I named my son for Wyatt Earp- any time I can see these two written about and come to life satisfies the geek and historian in me. I love books that surround the old west and Ronald Yates does a phenomenal job with this book.

"This memoir is simply wonderful. It is moving beyond compare and had me laughing at some parts, and crying at others.  As a person who loves her friends deeply, I found the friendships in this memoir to be poignant and very much similar to my own friendships.Nancy is a fascinating woman who lives by the idea that each person must have some basic principals in their life to be fulfilled and happy. They are someone to love, something to look forward to, and work that makes them happy. I really love these ideas and can see how living this way would be a path to happiness.Lynda is Nancy's best friend, and some could argue, soul-mate. Their pairing for friendship is unlikely and part of what is so special. They see in each other needs and wants that mirror their own and the result is fully accepting love and support.This memoir is special and tackles some very difficult subject matter.

I find his approach brilliant and his vision progressive. He is asking us to look at these photos of the animal world the same way we would look across a subway car and study another human. He is not asking us to assign human traits to the animals, he is simply showing us that there is an energy in all living things that we may not always understand. As much as we do not know what humans are thinking when they stare off, neither do we know what any animal is thinking.The pictures are vivid and brilliant. They will set you thinking and probably looking up more pictures!  The book is excellent!*This book is best viewed on an e-reader with color capabilities.

I imagine that quotes will be taken from this collection and used for toasts at Victoria and Olivia's weddings.

Sandy Appleyard shows us that sometimes the best and easiest way to remember a life is through the child's own voice.

The message of kindness in the book also resonated with the older one who tends to be a bit of a bully with my baby sister.

"I adore this book.  This is a real family unafraid and without excuse being themselves.  What struck me is that all of these stories are real. You can tell that they are not written 'up' for comedic value and they are not put on stage hoping for a larger audience. They are exactly as the title promises: True Stories from an Everyday Family.When I first bought the book I was half expecting stories told in the Sedaris voice because that's what I'm accustomed to when I'm reading about families. I was happily shocked to discover this is not at all like that. This family is living the way most normal families live- with the freedom to squirt the kids with a water bottle to get them moving in the morning- with the kids threatening to call CPS.The banter reveals what is genuine and obvious love for the kids and in chapter two or three there are even letters written to the older children to guide them in life that are candid and poignant.This book was an absolute pleasure, I'm grateful to have read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Y3KU3OENABT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTM7WMI#wasThisHelpful","R36Y3KU3OENABT","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seems very well made and was easy to install. I received the shower head for free in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R277DQC90NLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OSCQR2G#wasThisHelpful","R1R277DQC90NLE","A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2MUP8JRJXEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A few days after my wife died, both of my knees started to ache with varying amounts of pain, from 4 to 8 or 9 on my personal 1 to 10 pain scale. Nothing seemed to help, and my GP suggested seeing a doctor at the NYU Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan.We chose Dr. Halpern, author of The Knee Crisis Handbook: Understanding Pain, Preventing Trauma, Recovering from Knee Injury, and Building Healthy Knees for Life, and a very experienced knee expert (among other things, he was team doctor for the Jets for a number of years). Dr. Halpern diagnosed advanced arthritis, and he suggested I try Glucosamine. He said that my case was fairly well advanced -- he couldn't explain why the pain was presenting so late in the disease's progression -- and that some patients had good results from Glucosamine. In any event, side effects were minimal and alternatives were much more ""heroic"". (And, also, perhaps unavailing as I learned while representing a major company that made artificial hips and knees.)I did a bit of research and learned that reports of effectiveness range from 10% to 70%, depending on the population being surveyed; ""Consumer Union"" has historically been on the low end of that range, although more recently ""CU's medical and nutritional consultants have identified and tested a few products ... with possible benefits and sufficiently low risks to recommend for general use, including: saw palmetto for benign enlarged prostate in men, glucosamine and chondroitin for arthritis, and fish-oil capsules (omega-3 fatty acids) for heart disease.""Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a ""likely effective"" rating for treating osteoarthritis.In my case, I started taking three of these tablets a day, and the pain subsided only three days later. Today, ten months later, it is rarely more than a 1 or 2 on my pain scale, and when it kicks up I take one to three more tablets.

"As a 24/7 caregiver for a number of years for my late wife, we tried three or four different alternating pressure mattresses.During the last three months of her life, we needed a much larger and feature filled pressure mattress, primarily because she got great joy from manipulating the controls of the bed.However, this mattress would have been perfect adequate as a starter mattress when she was more mobile and needed protection from bed sores, one of the greatest banes of the bed-ridden and the caregiver.I tested this mattress for several nights and am very pleased to give it high marks, both from price and utility perspectives.Robert C.

"I rarely weigh ingredients when cooking, but weighing is essential for baking. I took a course at the Culinary Institute of America, their Boot Camp -- gosh they like military nomenclature at the CIA -- and the cooks and bakers were in total agreement:""TIP #2: BREAK OUT THE SCALE Many home bakers rely on measuring cups to portion out their recipe ingredients by volume. It’s probably what you were taught to do, and it may seem to work well enough. Professional bakers, however, are always looking for consistent results and they search for ways to control the end product. Knowing that the amount of flour in a measuring cup can and does vary (due to humidity, settling, how and when the flour was milled, the type of cup being used, and the way the cup was filled), professional bakers remove those variables by weighing their ingredients. Scales simply provide a more accurate measurement. If you don’t have a scale or aren’t ready to give up your measuring cups, that’s not a problem—we provide volume measurements in our recipes. -- See more at: enthusiasts.ciachef.edu/making-artisan-bread-at-home/In my experience, weighing ingredients when does make it easier to measure. With volume measure, you need to pull out multiple cups and spoons and wash each one of them at the end. With mass measure, you need only a single bowl and a scale that you tare after each ingredient is added. Weighing is also more precise. Depending on how it's packed, a cup of flour can weigh anywhere from around four ounces (113 grams) to six ounces (170 grams), a difference of 50%!  Weighing your flour and other dry ingredients eliminates this variation.But precision in other cooking doesn't mean much: If a recipe calls for a pound of onions, for example, you would probably have to cut one of the onions to get to the precise amount. I would throw them all in. The onions themselves, the browning time, other factors would lead to excellent results.And, with tiny amounts of spices, a gram for example, takes no account of variations in the spices; using measuring cups and then adjusting to taste makes much more sense to me in practice.So when baking, this scale is a very good choice, one like it essential in my experience. It is a very handsome scale; I like the low profile particularly; somehow it makes it easier to keep my counters clean and free of unnecessary utensils. Its measurements were almost identical to the other two scales in my arsenal -- over-stocked I know.Robert C.

"My doctor recommended the NeilMed Sinus Rinse - 2 Bottles - 250 Premixed Packets and NasaMist Saline Spray, Kit system four years ago: ""It will take out all the crud left behind from breathing our challenging New York City air.""Used virtually every day morning and evening -- it's become a way of life.They say codgers should change habits from time to time and I tried, really, really tried, but after two weeks gave up. Several problems:-- very soft plastic -- I needed to use two hands to make it work -- NeilMed one is enough.-- very little water flow -- no matter how hard I pressed, I couldn't the liquid into my mouth through the sinuses.-- hard to fill even with a little funnel my companion gave me as a present.They also say it takes 50 repetitions to learn a new skill -- but not in this bit of daily health care for this codger.Good luck if you try these and if you haven't used this sort of self treatment, try the NeilMed system.

"As a maintainer for the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, I chat with other volunteers about their favorite tools, and believe me the discussions can become passionate. One of the trainers for our maintainers took this position when I asked him if these pruning shears were any good: ""couldn't say offhand - typically we use larger loppers or smaller pruners. I haven't ever used shears for trail maintenance, though we do have two older pairs in the local tool cache. I do know that Fiskars is one of the most readily-available brands, and I haven't had any issues with their other products. A local Home Depot or gardening center would likely be able to give better information on shears.""Approaching 80, I decided to use these on a recent maintaining expedition on the Orange Trail at High Mountain State Park.Frankly they got a bit of getting used to; the manufacturer who has great customer service and who offered me these shears for a Review -- sent me some great instructions. My first instinct when feeling resistance is to push through, but with these you back off the pressure until you hear a click -- very audible in the forest -- and then lightly squeeze again.Fun really, and as my hands get weaker I will use them again, and perhaps more and more. Not yet committed enough to put them into my tool backpack but will certainly store them in the trunk of my car for that evil day.Robert C. RossNovember 2015How to Unlock Your PrunerApply pressure by squeezing on the handles to release the pressure on the slider. The slider should then easily move to unlock the pruner.How to Use a Ratchet PrunerIn order to gain the maximum benefit from your ratchet pruner, you need to use it correctly.  A ratchet pruner is used differently to a conventional pruner.1. Open pruner all the way.2. Place pruner on the branch, as far into the jaw as possible. If you don’t place branch past the midway point, you will not have maximum leverage and the branch may be difficult to cut.3. Squeeze the handles together, advancing the blade through the branch with minimal effort. Once you feel increased handle resistance, STOP squeezing.4. Release pressure to open the shear slightly until you hear a definite CLICK.  Again STOP and do not open the blade any further.5. Squeeze again, repeating steps 3 and 4 to completely finish the cut. Do not pull or rip at the branch.Caring and Maintaining Your Ratchet PrunerTaking good care of your pruner will help ensure they work well and remain trouble free.1. Use a clean cloth to wipe the blade of any residue.2. Remove any debris around the spring or ratchet mechanism.3. Apply a coat of oil (I use WD-40 because it is so versatile) to your newly cleaned pruning shears.4. Oil also helps your pruners open and close smoothly without catching or sticking.5. Use a rag or paper towel and wipe off any oil residue, leaving a thin coat of oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NW0F4GYVNHG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH9TS9G#wasThisHelpful","R2NW0F4GYVNHG6","A2NN6H2RZENG24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NN6H2RZENG24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently re-released in Paperback, this important work is being published once again, with a fully updated full-color map included!From the publisher:""Rarely, a guide to understanding a classic American landscape comes along. The Catskill Forest: A History is Michael Kudish's account of his life-long pursuit of how climate, soils, plant biology, and people have affected the Catskill forest since the last glacier retreated 10,000 years ago. It's all here: Native Americans, European settlement and agriculture, early forest industries. Dr. Kudish guides us into the mountain ranges one by one. Pick your favorites--Slide, Bearpen, Peekamoose, Kaaterskill High Peak, Shokan High Point. Go out on the trails. Explore the long history of connection between the Catskills and the people fortunate enough to inhabit or visit these enchanted mountains."" --Morton S. Adams, MD, Olive Natural Heritage Society and Catskill Institute for the Environment.""This book is one of the most comprehensive natural histories of the Catskills and its map includes historic uses along streams throughout the Catskills. Information that is invaluable to anyone trying to understand stream ecology today. Great stocking stuffer for the budding naturalist in your life! Or for the adult one as well.Extracts: ""Some people consider human effects on the landscape as part of natural history, but this writer prefers to keep the natural and unnatural (i. e. human) history separate because of the very different nature, and greater degree, of forest disturbance caused by people. This brief history is written more from the viewpoint of the forest itself, and less from the human viewpoint expressed in most historical writing. The Catskills, as defined geographically by this writer, extend greatly beyond the Catskill Park Blue Line, especially on the west and north. This brief history therefore includes lands as far as the West Branch Delaware River and as far north as the Manor Kill.""Human effects first began to be felt along the Escarpment and in the Ashokan Basin as Native American populations increased in the adjacent Hudson Valley sometime between 7,000 and 5,000 years ago. Their frequent fires began to sweep up into the adjacent mountains and converted the northern hardwood forests into southern hardwood forests; the latter consist primarily of nut trees – oaks, hickories, chestnut, and a shrub: mountain laurel. Repeated fires locally in the interior may have come later, the northern hardwood forest having been converted to the southern hardwood forest along the Esopus-Birch-Vly Creek corridor and the East Branch Delaware River corridor perhaps between 4,000 and 3,000 years before the present. Southern hardwoods therefore follow people.""""European industries invaded the Catskills, each industry disturbing the forest in its own unique way. Settlement and agriculture were first, increasing during the first two decades of the 19th century. Farming for crops and pastures meant forest removal. Lumbering was done for houses, barns, mills, factories, and other buildings.""A wonderful book for anyone interested in the Catskills or in nature in general.Robert C.

"Wow.I was not expecting too much -- the Amazon seller who offered me a large quantity for reviewing purposes was new, they said, to Amazon, and I wondered why so generous.Well, I don't care what their motivation. This is really very high quality coconut oil, delicious in smoothies, excellent for chapped hands on the trail, even good when I give my companion her favorite back rub -- both her and my skin feel great.I did a bit of research on how to judge a high quality coconut oil -- the same sort of process I suppose that foodies like me get obsessive about. A Doctor Fife gave me some insights as noted in the attachment; this oil passed all the tests with flying colors.Robert C. RossOctober 2015How can a person identify a good quality coconut oil? There is a way you can tell a high quality coconut oil from the rest. There are four things you can look for in a quality coconut oil. I’ll discuss each one briefly. The first thing to look for is a Virgin coconut oil. I recommend virgin coconut oil over non-virgin or RBD oil. RBD stands for refined, bleached, and deodorized. The less processing a food undergoes the higher the nutrient content and the healthier it is. Processing removes and destroys nutrients. Virgin coconut oil is made from fresh coconut without high heat or chemicals. The resulting product is less refined than RBD oil and retains more of its natural phytonutrients, which give coconut its distinctive aroma and flavor. In RBD oil all the phytonutrients have been removed so it is tasteless and odorless. Although virgin coconut oils, in general, are superior to RBD oils, not all virgin oils are of equal quality. In fact, there is a wide range of quality among them. There are many different ways to make virgin coconut oil. The methods and care used in the process determines the final quality of the product. To be honest with you, I have tasted some very poor quality coconut oils. In fact, some have been so bad I had to spit them out. Oils like this give the coconut oil industry a bad name. I won’t tell which brands to avoid, but I will give you some guidelines to distinguish the good from the not-so-good. I have tasted many good quality and a few extraordinary quality coconut oils. How do you tell the difference? How can you avoid the “not-so-good” ones? Appearances can be deceiving, that is if you don’t know what to look for. When looking for the best quality oil the appearance is very important. The second thing you look for in a high quality coconut oil is purity. If you are familiar with coconut oil you know it naturally has a high melting point. At 76 degrees F and lower it become solid, at higher temperatures it turns into a liquid. It’s much like butter, when it’s in the refrigerator its solid but if left out on a hot day it melts. High quality virgin coconut oil should be snow white in color when it is solid and water clear when liquid. If you see any shade of yellow or gray it is of an inferior quality. Pure coconut oil is colorless. Any discoloration is a sign of contamination. Contamination can be from mold or smoke residue. If old or sun-dried coconuts are used to make oil it will almost always contain mold. The mold isn’t considered harmful because temperatures used in processing are high enough to essentially sterilize it. If the heat used comes from open flames from wood or gas fuel smoke can be absorbed into the oil. The third thing to look for in a high quality coconut oil is aroma and flavor. Virgin coconut oils should always retain a coconut smell and taste. If not, they have been highly refined. If they have no flavor they are essentially RBD oil, even if they did come from fresh coconut. Some virgin coconut oils have a very strong flavor or smell. These are almost always of poor quality. The smell and taste comes primarily from contaminates and not coconut. If the oil does not taste and smell like fresh coconut beware. Some of the nastiest oils I have tasted were strong flavored and did not taste like coconut. Most virgin coconut oils use some type of heat in processing. Often smoke from the heating process contaminates the oil giving it a toasted or smoky smell and taste. Some oils when I open the jar smell like roasted coconut, which I like, but tastes like smoke, which I don’t like. The very best virgin coconut oils do not have a strong roasted or smoky taste or smell. They should have a very mild coconut aroma and flavor. The flavor should not be overpowering, but just mild enough to enjoy without altering the flavor of the foods it’s used with. The fourth criteria is price. You get what you pay for. Obviously, a very inexpensive oil is going to be of inferior quality. From my experience the cheapest oils are the most disagreeable tasting, and usually tainted with residual contaminants. The way to judge an oil is: 1) source, 2) appearance, 3) taste and aroma, and 4) price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36OH8JOH9KI1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8HZS1W#wasThisHelpful","R36OH8JOH9KI1F","A2NN6H2RZENG24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NN6H2RZENG24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the most cockeyed ""books"" I've ever read. Simple, filled with icons, almost incomprehensible.I have it on my iPhone 6 so that I can dip back into it from time to time to see if I am intellectually capable of figuring it out. So far, I'm way behind the necessary curve, disheartening, really, because the author claims that only TV slugs will miss its import. Haven't watched TV for nine months and it still doesn't click in my mind.On example involves the author. He quotes his Wikipedia page which includes 98% about his and his brother's football careers, mentions a diet book, but has nothing about this literary effort.The other authors and their biographies are even more opaque.The section on the wall around the earth in Antarctica is baffling. I took a cruise there, went ashore for awhile, but saw no sign of the military who will arrest at or shot at gunpoint if you do not obey. ""And the military surrounds the entire outer wall."" How long has that been going on? What military was doing that before there was a United States. I just can't get my mind around that concept, having seen how cold it was during their summer in December.The picture of the map in the book is good, but you can see a much better version on Wikipedia at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg You can read the entire scripture condemnation of the round earth theory on the map itself:""SCRIPTURE THAT CONDEMNS THE GLOBE THEORYAnd his hands were steady until the going down of the sun—Ex. 17: 12. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed.—Joshua 10: 12–13. The world also shall be stable that it not be moved.—Chron. 16: 30. To him that stretched out the earth, and made great lights (not worlds).—Ps. 136: 6–7. The sun shall be darkened in his going forth.—Isaiah 12: 10. The four corners of the Earth.—Isaiah 11: 12. The whole earth is at rest.—Isaiah 14: 7. The prophecy concerning the globe theory.—Isaiah: 29th chapter. Woe to the rebellious children, sayeth the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me.—Isaiah 30: 1. So the sun returned ten degrees.—Isaiah 38: 8–9. It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth.—Isaiah 40: 22. He that spreads forth the earth.—Isaiah 52: 5. That spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.—Isaiah 54: 24. My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth.—Isaiah 58: 13. Thus sayeth the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the moon and stars for a light by night (not worlds).—Jer. 31: 35–36. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood.—Acts 2: 20.Another footnote reads: Send 25 cents to the Author, Prof. Orlando Ferguson, for a book explaining this Square and Stationary Earth. It Knocks the Globe Theory Clean Out. It will Teach You How to Foretell Eclipses. It is Worth Its Weight in Gold.Where did professor Orlando Ferguson stand to draw that map?I realized that it might be necessary to see a better version of the map; luckily there is a very good one right here on Amazon -- Map of the Square and Stationary Earth. Four Hundred Passages in the Bible That Condemn the Globe Theory or the Flying Earth, and None Sustain It. This Map Is the Bible Map of the World. By Orlando Ferguson Reproduction. 16.5 X 24 Inches.Right now, I'm struggling why with those four big angels  it is necessary for ""the military"" to also guard the wall. Puzzlement.Well, I will keep plugging and in time may be able to give others some idea of the substance here. Wish me luck please.Robert C. RossOctober 2015I'm sorry to keep focusing on this particular passage but the author emphasizes that this map is entirely accurate. If so, the Aussies are also in on guarding the perimeter:ATMs -- automated teller machines -- have become a ubiquitous feature in the lives of most people in developed nations. There are so many of them that, if you need cash, there's probably one somewhere nearby. Even if you go to your own bank to deposit a check, it's pretty common to go to the ATM instead of the flesh-and-blood teller. It would be downright weird to be somewhere without same-day access to a cash machine. And Antarctica is no exception.According to Australian government's Antarctic division, there are a few hundred to a few thousand people living on the southernmost continent at any given time, with more during the summer than the winter. Most of the people on Antarctica live at McMurdo Station, a U.S.-run research facility. McMurdo Station doesn't have all the amenities that you'd find in most other places, of course, but it's not all work and no play. McMurdo has a general store which sells all sorts of souvenirs, movies, and of course, liquor. (Here are some pictures.) There was once a bowling alley (pics) but it was dismantled in 2009. There's a cafeteria-style dining hall and a handful of bars and clubs, too. (It should be of no surprise that alcoholism is a major problem in the area, but that's another story.) Most of that requires money and often, cash is a good option. But storing months-worth of money in your Antarctic apartment is impractical and kind of dumb, so those living at McMurdo need access to cash on demand. There are no banks at the station, so the solution is comes in the form of two ATM provided by Wells Fargo. Only one of the machines is operational at any point in time, with the other serving as a backup -- a necessary redundancy due to the machines' remote location. Serving the ATMs is, to put it lightly, difficult. After all, you can't simply tell a mechanic that he or she has to grab a coat and go off to Antarctica. In 2010, David Parker, a vice president in Wells Fargo's ATM division, spoke with blog NeedCoffee.com about the process of maintaining and fixing the machines -- and the risks involved:You know, the other thing too that you may find interesting--I don't know how much you know about folks that need to go down to Antarctica--it's a huge process to do it. So when we're preparing for the vendor visit, it's like a ten-month process. [. . .] The reason being is, they obviously go in the off-season when it's obviously warmer because no planes fly onto the ice in their winter months. And so anybody that goes to Antarctica has to be cleared with a physical, a dental, and a psychological evaluation, because if for some reason the plane can't get out, you're trapped down there until the next season.Despite the difficulties of providing banking services to the Antarctic, there's no reason for people living there to open up accounts with Wells Fargo. According to NCR, the vendor who services the machines on behalf of the bank, there are no fees for using the ATMs.Credit: ""Now I Know"" blog","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8XCN7TDADD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0104NTXCS#wasThisHelpful","R3A8XCN7TDADD7","A2NN6H2RZENG24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NN6H2RZENG24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was delighted to receive a generous sample of hemp protein from Viva Labs, a company I have come to trust, having tried and reviewed several of their products.This sample had a lovely nutty flavor, and is a great addition to several of my favorite dishes, including oat groats and oat milk at breakfast, as a source of protein in almost any smoothie, and even sprinkled over popcorn,Foods can be classified as complete, partial, or incomplete sources of proteins. In order for a food to be classified as complete, it must contain all eight essential amino acids. Hemp is considered a complete protein because it contains all eight essential amino acids in sufficient quantities to meet the body’s needs. This also makes hemp a good alternative source of protein for vegetarians and vegans.Hemp protein is easy to digest. It contains two types of proteins, edestin and albumin, which are known as globular proteins. Globular proteins dissolve easily so they are readily accessible for the body to use. This is in contrast to soy protein, for example, which can be more difficult for the body to digest. Soy contains inhibitors that block the action of trypsin and other enzymes that are needed to break down protein. This can often result in unwanted bloating and gas.A fascinating back story on hemp is that George Washington grew it at Mount Vernon, although not for food.Robert C. RossOctober 2015Addendum: ""I am very glad to hear that the Gardener has saved so much of the St. foin seed, and that of the India Hemp. Make the most you can of both, by sowing them again in drills. . . Let the ground be well prepared, and the Seed (St. loin) be sown in April. The Hemp may be sown any where. "" George Washington to William Pearce, 24 February 1794.Throughout his lifetime, George Washington cultivated hemp at Mount Vernon for industrial uses.  The fibers from hemp held excellent properties for the making of rope and sail canvas, which was a major need in the age of the sailing ship.  In addition, hemp fibers could be spun into thread for clothing or, as indicated in Mount Vernon records, for use in repairing the large seine fishing nets that Washington used in his fishing operation along the Potomac.At one point in the 1760’s Washington considered whether hemp would be a more lucrative cash crop than tobacco but determined that wheat would be a better alternative. During the period when he was considering hemp, he wrote to his agents in England in the hope of determining the costs involved in production and shipping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKCMZFE36H6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFR695W#wasThisHelpful","R1CKCMZFE36H6C","A2NN6H2RZENG24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NN6H2RZENG24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both my late wife and the new lady in my life were and are firm believers in the power of cranberries, and it was real pleasure that I was able to pick this excellent version from Vine from a very reputable supplier.One caution: Memorial Sloan Kettering maintains an up-to-date website on herbs and their usefulness in cancer prevention and other uses. It is well researched and a superb source of information for all supplements that it covers. Here is what it says about cranberry products like this one:""Cranberry juice or extracts have not been shown to treat or prevent cancer. It may be helpful for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in limited populations, but there is not enough evidence to recommend it for UTI prevention.""Cranberries contain compounds known as proanthocyanidins that have been shown to prevent bacteria from attaching to the bladder wall, which could cause UTIs. Human studies suggest it may be helpful for this purpose in some limited populations, including prostate cancer patients, but overall evidence is conflicting. Cranberry may also prevent bacteria from attaching to the stomach lining and areas in the mouth. Although lab studies suggest activity with several types of cancer cells, this has yet to be confirmed in human studies.""In patients who are prone to kidney stones, regular use of cranberry should be limited as it contains oxalates, a compound found in the most common form of kidney stones.""As a husband caring for my late wife, there was nothing more terrifying than the risk -- and during one very difficult period -- the reality of UTI. This product may be a placebo, but it brings peace of mind to both patient and caregiver and that is a very good thing.Robert C.

"A very high quality of an iconic moment in American history.Following is a fascinating back story about the picture from the wonderful blog ""Now I Know"".Robert C. RossOctober 2015The image above, often referred to ""V-J Day in Times Square"" or simply ""The Kiss,"" is iconic. The photo was taken in New York City on August 14, 1945, shortly after President Harry S. Truman announced that the United States has prevailed over Japan in World War II. The photographer, Alfred Eisenstaedt, was on the staff of Life Magazine at the time, and the photo was first published in that magazine in a section of photos chronicling victory celebrations. The image became famous quickly, but the people depicted did not share in that fame. Eisenstaedt was taking picture after picture on the 14th and didn't stop to ask any of his subjects who they were, and as one can see, neither the man's or woman's face is clearly visible in the image. But eventually, the identity of the man who is likely shown in The Kiss came to light. Unfortunately, it turned out the kiss wasn't romantic. It was, by contemporary terms, probably assault. The guy most likely to be the sailor is a man named George Mendonsa. According to a profile in the New York Post from 2015, Mendonsa was on date that afternoon -- a first date -- with a young lady named Rita Petry. The two attended a movie together at nearby Radio City Music Hall. Before the film ended, though, news spread throughout the city and the theater alike that the Japanese were surrendering. Manhattan (and for that matter much of America) turned into an impromptu party. People took to the streets, cheering, with alcohol flowing in celebration. Mendonsa told the Post that he himself had ""quite a few drinks"" before the pair made their way to Times Square. The Post explains what happened next:As they crossed Seventh Avenue at 44th Street, George caught sight of a woman in a nurse’s uniform: “What I remembered about the nurses from five months earlier . . .”Actually, George has it wrong. It had been three months before, out in the Pacific, aboard the USS The Sullivans. He’d watched on the morning of May 11 as two Japanese kamikaze planes, one after the other, smashed into the nearby USS Bunker Hill, setting off a series of explosions and killing 346 sailors (43 bodies were never recovered). George helped pull hundreds of men, some horribly burned, out of the water, and watched with awe as nurses went to work on them. So on this joyous and unbelievable afternoon, George ran from Rita — the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen — grabbed the first nurse he saw, spun her around, dipped her and kissed her.The two had never met before they locked lips -- which means that he didn't have the nurse's permission to give her the now-famous kiss. We can't be sure how the nurse reacted, though, because her identity is unclear. There are a few theories as to who she is -- the Post and CNN share a few of them -- but there simply isn't a lot of evidence to support any one woman's claim. But we're pretty sure that it's Mendonsa in the sailor's uniform. The best piece of evidence? In another photo of the kiss, Rita Petry is standing in the background, clearly identifiable and smiling at her date as he dips and kisses a complete stranger. And Rita has kept in contact with George since V-J Day -- the two ended up getting married, and should be celebrating their 70th anniversary this month.Bonus Fact: The identities of the kissing ""couple"" isn't the only mystery of The Kiss. Because Eisenstaedt took so many photos that day, he wasn't sure what time the photo was taken. A physics professor named Donald Olson cracked that one, though, using shadows and other clues to figure out that the image was taken at 5:51 P.M. that day. Olson, as Wired explains, has made similar investigations into a bit of a hobby: ""he’s figured out what time it was when Van Gogh painted Moonrise (9:08 p.m.), identified what inspired Walt Whitman’s “Year of Meteors” (an Earth-grazing meteor procession), and determined just when Ansel Adams shot Autumn Moon, The High Sierra From Glacier Point (7:03 p.m. on September 15, 1948).""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNAXVVCD9IQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EEP2J6#wasThisHelpful","RXNAXVVCD9IQS","A2NN6H2RZENG24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NN6H2RZENG24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Danny Lyon was granted extraordinary access over 14 months interacting with prisoners in six Texas prisons in the late 1960s ago.His interactions with prisoners were sometimes fierce, sometimes quite calm, always interesting. His photographs capture incredible insights into prison life, some of the most remarkable photographs I've ever seen in a lifetime of going to photography exhibitions all over the world.He recently described his collection in these words: “I’ve tried with whatever power I had to make this picture of imprisonment as distressing as it is in reality. The few times I doubted the wisdom of my attitude, I had only to visit someone in his cell to straighten out my mind. And the material collected here doesn’t approach for a moment the feeling you get standing for two minutes in the corridor of Ellis.”The book, a guide to an exhibit at Rice, is well made on good stock, and is well worth perusing if you love photography, or want to learn more about prison life, a modern form of slavery for many Americans.Phaidon has published an excellent facsimile of this powerful, disturbing book, released this month: Conversations with the Dead.

"There was The Catcher in the Rye, a classic coming of age story for young Americans in New York City and the East Coast.Red Sky at Morning: A Novel (Perennial Classics) is an equally compelling coming of age story for a young American from the South moving to the incredibly complex of world of New Mexico.Josh Arnold and 18 other major characters are beautifully drawn, and Josh's journey from childhood to adulthood is a superb description of how a young person becomes a man by having the responsibility of becoming the head of the household thrust upon him by World War II.My wife loved New Mexico -- we had a second home there and travelled back and forth many times during the last ten years of her life -- and so much of this book rang completely true for me.It's rare to find a book where characters and setting are so beautifully interwoven. Bradford accomplishes some, but not all of that in his So Far From Heaven -- a tale of an adult finding himself in the wonders of New Mexico. ""Red Sky"" is a significantly stronger novel, but together they make perfect companion pieces to describe some of the wonders of New Mexico, by an author who clearly knows and loves that fantastic place.Robert C.

"New York Society LibraryWhat a marvelous book.The Dioramas have very specific and often fascinating histories of their own, and this wonderful book describes not only the contents but the incredible ways they were assembled and built. Details abound. How did the artists blend the foreground -- often dirt and stones from the original site -- seamlessly into the painted background? How did they arrange the lighting so that the shadows are natural but the animals and plants are beautifully lit?A year ago, I attended a lecture by Ross D. E. MacPhee, a curator in the Mammalogy Department and supervising curator of the restoration of the Hall of North American Mammals. It was absolutely amazing the incredible detail that he and his team of employees and volunteers employ in restoring the exhibits. The bison never looked more beautiful!This book is a perfect companion to at least two other fabulous books about the Museum and its collections:Dinosaurs in the Attic: An Excursion into the American Museum of Natural History -- two main sections: collecting expeditions, including adventures in creating the  28 extraordinary dioramas in the Akeley Hall of African Mammals, recreated from paintings, photographs, data, and specimens collected in the field by the explorer and taxidermist Carl Akeley, his wife and his team on expeditions in the 1920s; anda second set of journeys through specific areas of the museum, all beautifully reported by Douglas J.

"I found this thermometer to be very easy to use for a 78 year old codger, and it was very accurate when checked against the thermometer in my urologist office during my regular six month visit yesterday.I found the following information from the Mayo Clinic very helpful.Regular digital thermometers use electronic heat sensors to record body temperature. These thermometers can be used in the rectum, mouth or armpit. Armpit temperatures are usually the least accurate. Rectal temperatures provide the best readings for infants, especially those 3 months or younger, as well as children up to age 3. For older children and adults, oral readings are usually accurate — as long as the mouth is closed while the thermometer is in place.If you plan to use a digital thermometer to take both oral and rectal temperatures, you'll need to get two digital thermometers and label one for oral use and one for rectal use. Don't use the same thermometer in both places. [I like this one so much that I have ordered a second and will mark them for oral or rectal use, as Mayo suggests.]The pros:•Most digital thermometers can record temperatures from the mouth, armpit or rectum — often in a minute or less.•A digital thermometer is appropriate for newborns, infants, children and adults.The cons:•Parents may worry about causing discomfort when taking a child's temperature rectally.•You need to wait 15 minutes after eating or drinking to take an oral temperature. Otherwise, the temperature of your food or drink might affect the thermometer reading.•It can be difficult for children — or anyone who breathes through the mouth — to keep their mouths closed long enough to get an accurate oral reading.Thankfully, my kid temperature taking days are long past, so I include that information for those still in the trenches. For me, two of these will do admirably.Robert C.

"I have never used knee supports before, but these wonderful sleeves have made me a believer. They make an excellent supplement to the bone on bone arthritis course of therapy I have been following. My story follows; the glucosamine continues to help manage my pain, but the strong support avoids or at least lessens the pain of my hiking --  about 50 miles a week these days.Wonderfully easy to pull on or off, even when I am sweaty, easy to rinse out and dry over night, time to buy another pair for backup -- don't ever want to be with them.Review based on a pair supplied by the Amazon seller in exchange for this Review -- thank you.Robert C. RossSeptember 2015This is a copy of my review for Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM, GUARANTEED Joint Agony Relief, 240 Capsules:A few days after my wife died, both of my knees started to ache with varying amounts of pain, from 4 to 8 or 9 on my personal 1 to 10 pain scale. Nothing seemed to help, and my GP suggested seeing a doctor at the NYU Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan.We chose Dr. Halpern, author of The Knee Crisis Handbook: Understanding Pain, Preventing Trauma, Recovering from Knee Injury, and Building Healthy Knees for Life, and a very experienced knee expert (among other things, he was team doctor for the Jets for a number of years). Dr. Halpern diagnosed advanced arthritis, and he suggested I try Glucosamine. He said that my case was fairly well advanced -- he couldn't explain why the pain was presenting so late in the disease's progression -- and that some patients had good results from Glucosamine. In any event, side effects were minimal and alternatives were much more ""heroic"". (And, also, perhaps unavailing as I learned while representing a major company that made artificial hips and knees.)I did a bit of research and learned that reports of effectiveness range from 10% to 70%, depending on the population being surveyed; ""Consumer Union"" has historically been on the low end of that range, although more recently ""CU's medical and nutritional consultants have identified and tested a few products ... with possible benefits and sufficiently low risks to recommend for general use, including: saw palmetto for benign enlarged prostate in men, glucosamine and chondroitin for arthritis, and fish-oil capsules (omega-3 fatty acids) for heart disease.""Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a ""likely effective"" rating for treating osteoarthritis.In my case, I started taking three of these tablets a day, and the pain subsided only three days later. Today, ten months later, it is rarely more than a 1 or 2 on my pain scale, and when it kicks up I take one to three more tablets. They actually taste good, and work very well.My brother-in-law has had a similar problem for the past five years, and his pain is also controlled by this product. Based on the reports of others, it may not help everyone, but it sure helped both of us.I've tried a number of different brands, all of which provided the same relief. The bottle, sent to me free for review purposes, has worked great for me for over a week and a half. Moreover, I have had very positive experiences with several of Viva's products and have also relied on their literature and enjoyed interesting discussion with their customer service people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYHFOA34IEM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YW74562#wasThisHelpful","R1WYHFOA34IEM5","A2NN6H2RZENG24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NN6H2RZENG24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Preston.Preston's book is beautifully written, a bit better than Rexer's, but the photographs are grainy and almost useless, except to add a bit of interest.The photographs and other illustrations in the Rexer are superb, and the book can be greatly enjoyed by simply looking at the pictures and reading the captions.If you have any interest in museums in general, or this one in particular, read either or both -- you will enjoy the excursions, either in the library or before or after actually going there on tour.Robert C.

"Who knew?I've walked thousands of miles in New York City over the past 40 years -- the Bronx was only Yankee Stadium (both of them), the Zoo, the Botanic Garden, an Irish football stadium, Arthur Avenue for Italian cuisine, City Island, the Harlem River, the High Bridge, the Croton Aqueduct and Woodlawn Cemetery. Treasures all of course.But under Lloyd Ultan's superb guidance, just the tip of a wonderful world of wonders -- 25% of the Bronx is parkland, and there are miles and miles to walk before I truly have even a superficial understanding of this under-appreciated part of New York City.Based on another Review, here, I immediately bought a copy of The Beautiful Bronx 1920-1950,j and spent ten hours reading and making bucket lists of places to visit. Here is an author who not only loves his subject, but who has a superb ability to write about his subject well and with great passion and accuracy.The iBook works well enough on my iPhone for walking purposes, and I also carry the excellent The Encyclopedia of New York City: Second Edition on my iPhone to double check details, or to fill in additional information.A triumph, actually three triumphs, for anyone who loves New York City and each of its boroughs.Robert C.

"As a lover of New York City and a hiker who has walked several thousand miles over the years through its streets and byways, I have found that the best guide books have both great information and a personal point of view. In a few rare cases, an excellent guide is spoiled a bit by the intrusion of too much of the author's point of view; the excellent writer Pete Hamill weakens his otherwise superb guide/memoir in that way: Downtown: My Manhattan.Robin Lynn has triumphantly found the perfect balance for this reader. Her guide is filled with interesting, well researched information, some of it totally new to me, while maintaining a well expressed point of view, consistent throughout the book. She does it so well that I started to dip and sample, and then went back and read the entire book cover to cover.I can carry it on my iPhone as well, so that as I perambulate, I can dip into the relevant section after exploring what's on the ground and forming my own opinion. Sometimes we agree, rarely we disagree, sometimes I have to go back two or even three times to really understand what she is telling me -- my failure to read carefully almost invariably.I also carry the superb The Encyclopedia of New York City: Second Edition on my iPhone, and often check facts against Lynn against Ross -- a deeply satisfying experience that makes the miles melt away in a sort of urban wonder.Robin Lynn is a wonderful guide to the landscapes of this great city.Robert C.

"I accepted this review sample device out of curiosity rather than any real medical need, and found to my delight that my readings are all in the normal range -- ""all"" being 50 readings over a month of use.The instructions are terribly confusing and poorly written -- I went to Wikipedia and found a better description of how to use the device.One thing I cannot figure out -- does the device read correctly for people wearing fingernail polish?As a male codger, I don't often wear nail polish -- rarely a clear type for fancy dinners -- but I asked a manicurist to apply some red polish to one nail -- the before and after readings were somewhat different.

"We recently took a wonderful tour of the Hard Hat section of Ellis Island, and our tour guide through this abandoned hospital, once on a par with Columbia Presbyterian and Memorial Sloan Kettering, was wonderfully knowledgeable about lower Manhattan. He said that he found Hamill book essential for anyone wanting a very readable, fact filled, and exciting history of that part of Manhattan Island.I bought a copy as soon as I got home, it arrived in 24 hours, and I devoured it in about three hours. Wonderful stuff -- excellent writing and very reliable -- I checked it against the superb The Encyclopedia of New York City: Second Edition about 20 times. Incidentally, that encyclopedia comes in an ibook and I often check for more information when hiking around NYC or when reading a hard copy book like Hamill's -- an essential companion while exploring this fantastic city.I've taken off one star, a bit reluctantly, but I found Hamill's personal stories distracting. I think a more careful editor might have move those personal sections into either a Forward or preferably an Afterword, and referenced Hamill's experience with footnotes in the main text.Nevertheless, this is superb history, very well told, and highly reliable.Robert C.

"We recently took the grand tour of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the recently opened Hard Hat tour of the abandoned hospital on the southern, New Jersey sitde of Ellis Island.We had an absolutely splendid volunteer guide whose father had passed through Ellis Island when he was 18, and Doug gives the tours in memory of his father. He said that all of the volunteer and paid guides on Ellis Island consider this book required reading, and re-reading -- it is perhaps heavy on officials and a little light on individual histories. But that history is essential to understand how so many people were processed so quickly.On statistic: over 98% of the immigrants passed through to either New York or New Jersey; the great majority who were detained and sometimes returned to Europe were denied entry for health reasons. An average of seven seconds per immigrant, but they ""cheated"". After the baggage hall, and immigrants rarely gave up their worldly possessions for a slip of paper and a promise, the immigrants had to climb three flights of stairs.Doctors closely watched the flow and marked people who were laboring with chalk on their coats -- ""TB"", ""PG"", etc. The marked people were then examined more closely. And, if an immigrant was returned to Europe, the steamship company was forced to pay for the return journey -- so there was careful screening by the shippers in Europe before the ships sailed.An essential book for anyone planning a visit or for anyone to read after their return from this fascinating place so crucial to American history.Robert C.

"I have taken three one-week courses at the Culinary Institute of America on the Hudson River: Boot Camp, Appetizers, and Italian food -- all excellent and all of which made for significant improvements in my cooking.Each instructor gave us a 15 minute lecture on the importance of checking temperatures, and each had two thermometers aboard, just in case.They also used them many times a day, during demonstrations and when auditing our efforts -- proof that we should do as they said and as they did.They also taught us how to test our thermometers and suggested we should do so on a regular basis. Before testing, though, read this important note from a Commentator on my Review (many thanks):When calibrating using the boiling point method they should have told you that you need to take your altitude into account. This is because the boiling point of water is going to change dependent upon your altitude.For example, here near Denver, CO you would not be able to get the water to 212 because water boils here at 203º so any additional energy dumped into the water after that goes into evaporation. (That's why it takes longer to cook pasta up here) So if we calibrate using the boiling point method, we have to calibrate to 203º.Freezing method doesn't have this constraint as the freezing point stays the same regardless of altitude.The CIA technique:1. Ice Water MethodMaterials needed: one large glass, crushed ice and clean waterAfter filling a large glass with finely crushed ice, pour clean tap water on top of the ice and stir well. Dip the food thermometer stem two inches into the glass of ice water without touching the bottom or the sides of the glass. Wait 30 seconds to see if the thermometer reads 32 degrees Fahrenheit.2. Boiling Water MethodMaterials needed: one deep pot and water In a deep pot, bring water to a rolling boil. Dip the thermometer stem two inches into the boiling water without touching the bottom. Wait for 30 seconds and the thermometer should read 212º F.***This Thermometer passed the initial test with flying colors.Our instructors told us that the actual mechanism doesn't matter much -- this is a digital thermometer -- the crucial thing is that it easy to use and is accurate -- and accuracy is the most important.Nevertheless, this thermometer has several other bells and whistles that will make cooking even more fun. I've tested a couple and will revert in a month with more experience under my belt.I'll check for accuracy in a couple of months, but for now, this is a fine kitchen assistant. :)Robert C.

"Several people have complained about these Goji berries being too dry and tough.I sort of like this version, especially when hiking, when sucking on a berry or two -- they break my hunger pangs very quickly.But, for day to day eating, I soak them over night with my oat groats, and they plump up just as good as those that are more moist -- example my personal favorite supplier is Viva who sells Viva Labs #1 Premium Himalayan Organic Goji Berries, Noticeably Larger and Juicier.In a taste test, neither my companion nor I -- both fairly sophisticated foodies and food tasters -- could tell the difference.The only gnawing issue: goji berries are apparently being grown now in the US and in Canada. There have been some reports that the Chinese are using some chemicals to aid in growing their exported berries. But, I haven't found them from the US or Canada, either on Amazon or elsewhere.So, dry for hiking and these are fine. Soak them over night in cold water, and they are fine as well.Robert C. RossSeptember 2015Review 8 ounce sample provided by the Amazon seller for this Review.Addendum: I like to add these to a smoothie to add a bit of sweetness.Here's a basic recipe that I like playing with. If a guest doesn't like the taste of kale, this works great:Serves 1Ingredients 3/4 cup chopped kale, ribs and thick stems removed 1 small stalk celery, chopped 1/2 banana 1/2 cup apple juice or one small apple 1/2 cup ice 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juiceAdd Goji berries to taste, about quarter of a cupDirections1.Place the kale, celery, banana, apple juice, ice, and lemon juice in a blender.2.Blend until smooth and frothy.Leave out the banana and apple if you like the taste of kale as I do; substitute oat milk for water for better heart health.Let your imagination be your guide; you can't really go wrong. :)And, maybe you should move from a glass and straw to a bowl; the Cleveland Clinic makes the case:The authoritative Cleveland Clinic has some good advice:For on-the go meals, smoothies have been an option for years. From the franchises you see around town to the make-at-home versions you’ve tried in your own blender, these thick drinks — when made properly and enjoyed in appropriate portions — provide a healthy meal alternative.But lately the trend is shifting from portable glasses to hearty bowls — and from grab and go to sit and enjoy. The “smoothie bowls” you’ve seen on Instagram or Pinterest take basic components of a smoothie, add less liquid and more thickening ingredients, and are topped with nutrient-dense, fiber-filled superfoods. Swap the straw for a spoon, and you’ve got a hearty dish.“You end up with a combination of protein and fiber that leaves you feeling full without an intense spike in blood sugar.”Why choose a bowl?For one thing, making a smoothie bowl instead of an on-the-go drink encourages you to slow down and practice mindful eating.But perhaps more important, the bowl promotes variety in the form of toppings such as nuts, seeds and fruit. You end up with a combination of protein and fiber that leaves you feeling full without an intense spike in blood sugar.One note of caution: The toppings you’ll see below are nutritional powerhouses such as nuts, seeds and grains. Those are ingredients you need, but an accidental over pour can leave you with more calories than you want. To prevent over-packing your bowl, use recipes and measuring spoons to limit your toppings and know just how much is going in your body.Where to startIf you’ve made a smoothie, the basics below will look familiar.The biggest difference is that for a bowl, you’ll increase the amount of thickeners and decrease the amount of liquids. Start by following recipes such as the ones listed below. If you’re adventurous, you can tinker with recipes to get just the right texture for you. In addition, rather than blending in nuts, seeds or other items for added nutrition, you’ll add them on top of the blended base and proteins — and enjoy their crunch with a spoon rather than through a straw.Recipes will vary, but here’s a basic guide to bowls:The Base•Liquid: Unsweetened milk of your choice (almond, cow’s, rice, soy, coconut, [for me, oat milk])•Thickener: Plain, unsweetened yogurt (Greek is a great, high-protein option) or avocado•Sweeteners: Fruit (frozen provides a thicker texture, typically ¼ to ½ cup), dried medjool dates, pumpkin puree•Fiber: Veggies such as spinach, kale and carrots, or psyllium husks•Ice: Optional, based on how you like your textureProtein•Powder: Choose an option with no added sugar, such as spirulina powder or pea protein•Nut butters: Unsweetened peanut butter, almond butter, sun butter, etc. (2 tablespoons is a good rule of thumb)Toppings•Seeds: Chia, ground flax, pumpkin seeds, hemp hearts, pomegranate seeds•Nuts: Walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts•Grains: Granola, quinoa puffs, soaked oats, muesli•Flavors: Cinnamon, ginger, cocoa nibs•Texture: Unsweetened coconut flakes, raisins, goji berriesYou can experiment with turning your favorite smoothie recipes into bowls, but here are two recipes to get you started.•The Go Green Smoothie Bowl: This tasty bowl includes mango, banana and spinach as part of the base, plus superfood toppings such as hemp seeds and goji berries.•The Berry Bowl: Berries of your choice help form the base of this recipe, with a helping of chia and pomegranate seeds on top.health.clevelandclinic.org/2015/04/how-to-turn-a-smoothie-into-a-hearty-healthy-bowl/Robert C.

Thank you.""If she is happy, I am happy.I was very impressed with the way the little V hangs inside the bigger V.Addendum: another Reviewer has suggested that I add a note about my background in assessing jewelry. When my late wife and I were first married we were in debt and every penny counted. She loved small, hand crafted objects, and we went to 30 to 40 auction houses every year for the pre-viewings, where potential bidders are encouraged to handle the objects. We learned about many different types of art but in the world of jewelry, I am sure that I have handled over $500 million worth of jewels and jewelry, not only at the auction houses but at fine jewelers around the world. Always, I had a loupe on hand, used for postage stamps which I collect and other small objects like netsuke and jewelry. My current favorite is a Ade Advanced Optics Premium Lighted 10x21 Triplet Lens Color Jeweler's Loupe with Leather Case. My impressions of this jewelry is based on an examination under that glass and the expertize I have built up over the years.Robert C.

"I've used Wingtips as dress shoes for more than 20 years. I still haven't worn them out. I'll compare this new pair with my old pair of brown (I also have black ones).The old have at least twice the leather thickness and it is very stiff. The new ones are very flexible. The interior bottom is hard while the new ones are soft. The old ones have shorter but more gripping laces. The new ones come undone easily and are longer. The old style is much more elegant with bumpy instead of smooth sides and more defined small circles. The color of the new ones is one tone which is less eye catching then the multi-tone old style (of course this doesn't apply to the black wingtips).Conclusion: If you are wearing the new style for all day, your feet are not going to get tired and sore. If you usually buy a half size larger because you wear thick socks, you'll probably find this style better than the old ones. The new ones have slight stretchability but not the old style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23233P4V6GF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY5NMIY#wasThisHelpful","R23233P4V6GF7","A13WOT3RSXKRD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WOT3RSXKRD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UP2 by Jawbone Activity + Sleep TrackerI currently own a Basis health tracker. It does a fairly good job at tracking my sleep, steps, etc. But there are several things I don’t like about it e.g. it’s huge (like a man’s watch and band), I could get it to sync with my iPod, but not the computer, and the heart beat feature isn’t always accurate (which is probably why they discontinued it in favor of a newer model). So I decided to give the UP2 a try.The UP2 is different than the Basis in several ways - one being with the Basis, you can read the stats on the face of the tracker itself, whereas with the UP2, you need to go to your iPod etc. device to read all of the stats. Also, the Basis has a heart beat tracker but the UP2 doesn’t. On the plus side, the UP2 lets you log in what you have eaten for your meals and then gives you an estimation of your calorie count and the amount of calories you have left for the day.The UP2’s charging function is different - instead of a micro USB cable (which would be for both charging and data transmission), there is a 4” charging cable that attaches to the back of the UP2 via magnets. I have the cable permanently attached to a flat 4-port charging station and since the cable is so stiff and the magnets so strong, the cable stands vertically and the tracker remains attached (up in the air). BTW: the cable is only for charging, all tracked info is transmitted via Bluetooth connection.After a short charge that lasts a week, you must link the tracker to your iPod, Android, etc. device via Bluetooth (which is very simple to do). Afterward you are guided through the steps to set up an account on the Jawbone web site.Once you have an account, you must specify your gender, height, weight (later you can tell it your desired weight goal), and date of birth. Once everything is set up you can start wearing your tracker.If you wish, during the course of the day, you can input your Activity type, Effort level, Start time, and Duration. You can also enter your mood, though I don’t know how this effects your tracking.Every once in a while the UP2’s Coach will send you motivational advise on how to reach your goals. For example, today it advised me to eat a handful of Pistachios to boost my fiber intake. The Coach is a nice feature since it will mention things that you might not have thought about.After wearing the tracker for a day, you can go to your Bluetooth devise and see: the number of steps that you have taken, the amount of calories that you have eaten for that day, a graph showing your weight loss/gain (if you entered the new weight), the amount of time you spent sleeping (including showing sleep patterns - a bar graph that shows when you were sleeping sound or light throughout the night), and the percentages that you had currently reached in your daily goals.EvaluationI like how small the UP2 tracker is (it is about a third of the size of the Basis). I also like that the band is A LOT smaller than the Basis band. But on the negative side, I don’t like the rubber spaghetti straps e.g. the straps consist of a spaghetti sized bands (with loops at each end) that are permanently connected to the UP2. The end (of the first strap) has a small hook that you sting through the end loop of second strap and then fasten to an attached bar back on the first strap. Being rubber and very flexible, I find it a bit of a hassle to get them to stay in-place to align perfectly so I can hook them together. This isn’t a deal-breaker, just a slight irritant. For those of you that will leave the tracker on 24/7 - it shouldn’t be a problem.One more thing about the material used with the tracker - I am allergic to plastic so I was wondering if I would have a skin reaction to this band? I am please to say that I have used it for a while and I have had no itchy skin or any other allergic reaction.I like that it will track your calories. I just wish it would track your heartbeat, though in looking at the Jawbone web site I recently discovered that that feature is available with the UP3 tracker.Finally, I like that the UP2 iOS app shows the amount of days that you have left on your battery charge (I was wondering how to figure this out without a read-out on the UP2 tracker).So which health tracker will I use? I think for 99% of the time I will use the UP2 since it is much smaller and has the Coach and other nice features. I think I will reserve the Basis for any time that I need to keep track of my heart rate (hopefully never).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP05XAQO93ORH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIG8S#wasThisHelpful","RP05XAQO93ORH","A13WOT3RSXKRD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WOT3RSXKRD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband is jealous. He wants one in a man’s watch size. I keep sticking it in front of his face. LOLFor the last 30+ years I have used digital watches. I like how much information and things you can do with them, but they seem to be disappearing from the market. So I decided to give this dial watch a try. My first impression was that this is a nice looking watch, but I found it a bit heavy compared to my other watches. The size of the watch case and look of the thickness of the watch band seems reminiscent of a man’s watch, but the watch face definitely looks feminine.I was surprised at how long the band was when clasped. I could easily pull it over and then off of my hand (I would like to see the woman that has a wrist that large). This isn’t a deal-breaker since I have had to have links taken out of some of my previous watches for it to fit - but just not this many. I guess they made it this large so that there is no doubt that it will fit any woman’s wrist, no matter how large it is.Final thoughtsThis is a sturdy watch that is advertised as having a “water resistant depth of 165 feet”. Though I haven’t tested this statement, this is a real plus for the times you get caught in the rain or you wash something in a sink full of water and it goes below the surface. I think the old “waterproof” watches could probably make the same claim. So will I wear this watch - definitely, once I get the extra links removed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R47HC9ENKGNPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXGRLK#wasThisHelpful","R47HC9ENKGNPX","A13WOT3RSXKRD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WOT3RSXKRD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have quite a few gadgets that need to be powered using a USB port on my computer. I have to play a dancing game, switching out one for another to get them all charged. So when I came across this standalone 4-port charging station - I had to get it.The first thing I noticed was how heavy both the charger and the attachable power cord were. This was a sure sign that this is a heavy-duty unit versus those light-weight el-cheapo units on the market that have a hard time charging more than one USB gadget.Testing PhaseA true test of a charger is whether it will charge an iPad (since iPads require more power to charge). So not only did I attach an iPad Air 2 to the charger, but I also attached an iPod Touch, a camera and a USB power block. Both the iPod and iPad made the familiar charging chime accompanied with the green charging icon - so far so good. Both the camera and the charging block’s lights lit up - again a good sign. But how long would it take to fully charge all four items. Would it take all day - No! All four charged very quickly. In fact, the iPod finished charging before the others (it was already at a 50% charge before attaching it to this hub), so I detached its cord and plugged in the cord for my iPad’s keyboard. It started charging right away.EvaluationBoy, it sure is nice to charge so many at the same time! This is exactly what I wanted - it does a good job and frees a USB port on my computer.

"Besides being fun to play with, Play-Doh is a good creativity tool. Kids can make all sorts of one to six (or more) legged creatures, etc. If they have multiple colors, they can experiment with mixing the colors to create new ones, etc.This set comes with not only tubs of Play-Doh, but also cooky-cutter molds that kids can use to cut out little shapes.

And I’ve worked with adults who are scarred of tools. Since parents no longer teach their children how to do things, these kinds of “toys” fill a major vacuum in the learning process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29H5VQTGBN5MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1O6P8#wasThisHelpful","R29H5VQTGBN5MW","A13WOT3RSXKRD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WOT3RSXKRD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are easy to duplicate tutorials using geometric shapes and then adding details. After drawing a basic dragon, you add eyes, jaw, ears, horns, wings, scales, limbs, bridles, and saddles.Medieval dragons and Asian dragons are next. They are followed by drawing hatchlings and sea dragons. So there is a much larger variety then you may have been exposed to.The book provides views from all sides so you can get the overall proportions correct. If you are using a 3D graphics program that rotates your drawing, this will quicken your successful conclusion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIG3M0NPI6W5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440302529#wasThisHelpful","RIG3M0NPI6W5D","A13WOT3RSXKRD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WOT3RSXKRD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book begins with telling about how lacquer boxes are made by hand. Then it details the differences between the 4 villages who paint the scenes on lacquer boxes. The 19 stories related in the book show scenes that are painted on the boxes that depict episodes in the story. The photos are in color. At the back are other examples from each village.I love these very long stories. That would be great to read to children and then you can show the photos when you get to that scene so they can picture it in their mind.As an owner of a lacquer box, the real gold and silver glistens in the light.

It worked, but the sound was very faint - which is surprising since my other headset works fine with this adapter.Evaluation: It does what I want - recording dictation when it is plugged directly in to my Mac or iPad (with no adapter used).

"I particularly enjoyed the “Lost Episodes”. They were early shows in black and white with long melodramas. I’ve been to many live melodrama performances. Its always great when the actors say another’s line in mistake and they have to ad-lib to get the story back on track. And sometimes the lines crack up the cast. That’s what you will see on these episodes.Red’s guests who were leading men in the movies show you their versatile talents. After you see these programs, you’ll be aware of how much talent has been lost.

"I am always looking for that missing pen when I am at my computer desk. So I thought this would be a great way to keep track of my pens by attaching it the the side of my computer desk.The first thing I noticed when it arrived was how small it was - I was expecting a 6 x 8.9 x 1.4 inch cup (as mentioned in the Technical Details). In reality, it is only: 4 x 2.5 x 1”.I followed the instructions to adhere the sticky “Micro Suction” pad (with a nub on the reverse side) to the side of my desk and then waited an hour for it to set. Afterward I slid the cup’s back hole over the nub. It fit fine, so I grabbed a few pens and my Wacom stylus and placed them in the cup - instantly the weight of the pens and stylus made the cup top-heavy and tip to the side (but not enough for it to spill to the floor). So I had to reposition the pens so the weight would be balanced and the cup would remain vertical.Solution: I took a strip of cardboard, folded it in half, and shoved it behind the cup. So it’s nice and snug agains the side of my desk. Now it doesn’t tip when I place all of my pens in the cup - problem solved!Evaluation: The cup would be great for keeping track of short things like paper clips, erasers, etc. But for holding longer pens, pencils, full sized scissors, etc, I think Elmer should have made the hole/nub a little tighter so the cup wouldn’t tip to the side under the weight or made the cup deeper so it wouldn’t be top-heavy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H0HNYAFSAQXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G94G2#wasThisHelpful","R1H0HNYAFSAQXX","A13WOT3RSXKRD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WOT3RSXKRD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In this video, I show each component that comes in this solar light set.The solar panel is shaped like a sunflower or sun, depending on your perspective...There's a stake that slides into the back and allows you to adjust the angle to capture the most sunlight that you can.There's 8 modes that are super smooth and diverse...They can be still, dimming, dancing, sparkling, alternating or a combination of any/all of these.I highly recommend this cool white color--they look like snowflakes or stars...It's such a calming color that even my teenaged son loved falling asleep with cool white lights in his room.This color paired with the smooth (instead of jerky) rhythm of the lights easily makes this set one of the highlights of my holiday season.*Complimentary lights provided by Icicle for testing and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQXW8QB9VFPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0135O1O0M#wasThisHelpful","R1DQXW8QB9VFPM","A35NOFKHK8P2LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35NOFKHK8P2LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:20 Mins This is a heat resistant wig that is surprisingly very natural looking due to the cut and fullness of it. The look is sleek and stylish with a bit of softness that isn't typically easy to achieve with a synthetic black wig.I particularly appreciate that the bangs aren't cut straight across the forehead, but they fall in a feathered way. In the video, I show the inside of this wig and even drop it. Surprisingly, it maintains a very natural appearance. I've tried a couple wigs that could not achieve this.

"This is small packing cube that can hold only one pair of our adult sneakers at a time. So, the usefulness is limited for our upcoming move (unless you purchase the 3 pack). It comes with an illustrated card that shows you how to fold clothing to fit as much as you can inside of it.There's a triangle of mesh built into both the front and back that takes up a third of each side. It appears to be well made. It may be a good choice if you need to section off a small piece of luggage in a stylish way, like to separate baby clothes. For us, it would take the place of some of the disposable grocery bags that we typically use for separating shoes or dirty clothes.I give it a 4 for the quality construction and attention to detail.

" 4:23 MinsThis jump rope appears to be an updated version of the Aoneky that we already have, except ours has different handles and method of adjusting the height. It also has a built-in counter that keeps track of rotations.The blue ""rope"" appears to be the mostly the same (one is slightly thicker, which makes it feel a tad bit softer) but the handles are very different. Our old green handles are larger and lighter in color, so it's easier for dirt and oils to show (in one photo, my daughter used permanent marker to make the darkening ends look ""more pretty"").The newer black handles are more attractive with an ergonomic style. The look is sleek once set to a desired length, though it takes a little longer to adjust.You have to use your nail or some other object to pry off the black rounded caps on the bottom of the handles. This allows you to pull the rope through, knot and stuff the remaining length back in. These handles are more compact than the older jump rope, making the insides more narrow as well...The smaller you need to make the jump rope, the harder this process may become.This is something to consider if you'll be sharing with others and adjusting it often to accommodate different heights. Still, it's not too difficult to set the rope to one length and it's nice not having the excess bits flapping as you jump (like with the older green one).*Complimentary jump rope provided by Aoneky for testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13SSXD5Q7U4CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014YH7KPC#wasThisHelpful","R13SSXD5Q7U4CA","A35NOFKHK8P2LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35NOFKHK8P2LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 6 bag set is comprised of 3 extra large and 3 travel roll ups. Since I'm currently in the process of packing for an upcoming move, I appreciate how helpful they are in containing my wardrobe for shipping.These extra large bags are so huge that I was able to fill one of them with 7 jumbo beach-sized towels along with a good chunk of my summer clothes.  After unscrewing the top and sucking the air out with a vacuum, each becomes a heavy, condensed mass.In one photo, I show how you can even stand them up to lean against a wall. However, since I stuffed mine completely full, I did notice that some of the air seeps in when positioned this way.Also, the sliding clips are easier for me to use on the smaller bags. The larger bags require me to go back over with my fingers to reseal them. I've had similar bags in the past that had thinner seals (see photo of the clear older bag I compared with one of these blue double sealed bags). The wide blue double seals make resealing by hand much easier.I needed to completely fill the smaller bags with clothes, so I opted to forgo the rolling aspect.

" 3:35 Mins This is a wonderful 23 piece set that is a must-have for any of the beginner sets. I have a glow-in-the dark starter set and these are really ideal. In this video, I further explain how these pieces increase its playability.The prongs along the rim of the shallow molds make them extremely easy to form--just set them down flat and give the tops a tap for good measure...I have not had to redo ANY of the molds that you see here--they're that good. This high success rate is especially nice if you're working with children that seem to get quickly frustrated.I also demonstrate how different colors of Sands Alive! can heighten the fun when playing with related pieces (ex. blue ocean life and pink pastries).  The texture of this sand-like substance allows for such great control, that I was also able to selectively mix colors (keep mixed sand separate since the blend can't be undone).In addition to the molds, you get a number of interesting hand tools for cutting, rolling, mixing, moving...This is a fun, well-rounded set that helps to make your sand come alive.*Complimentary mold set provided for testing and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32YVJIO8OTQH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147WO3M2#wasThisHelpful","R32YVJIO8OTQH0","A35NOFKHK8P2LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35NOFKHK8P2LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:48 Mins I have come to appreciate these battery operated 40 LED stringed lights (permanently encased in clear cystal balls) for those times when I can't move my tree up against the window to get a good charge with my solar lights. The warm white/yellow casts the perfect glow...It's much easier to recharge the required 3 AA batteries in the wall. The battery box has a clear sliding panel that requires you to read a clear (raised) ""OPEN"" with an arrow going the opposite direction one would assume. It's a good deterrent for little ones that want to open the box.I love how these lights don't limit where I place the tree or how big a tree I use them on (our 4 foot tree is about the biggest I want to carry to a window to recharge solar lights). I'm not tethered to an outlet with plug-ins. It's wonderful being able to use this tree to illuminate a dark, windowless corner of our apartment that may not have an outlet nearby.This light strand is roughly 175 inches long, so I would recommend two for completely covering a tree this size (if the tree isn't being placed against a wall and you need the lights to go all the way around).*Complimentary light strand provided by Cmyk for testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENXNNNOUBCBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014G63YUG#wasThisHelpful","R3ENXNNNOUBCBA","A35NOFKHK8P2LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35NOFKHK8P2LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautiful set of maple leaf socks that looks great with our winter clothing. The socks perfectly fit both my daughter (women's 8) and me (9.5) with room to spare. They are comfortable with a good degree of stretch.Though I personally find this pattern more attractive than the wool/nylon blend from the same company, the inside thread is woven loosely enough to allow my pinky toe to occasionally catch on one of the inner loops when sliding them on (see photo of sock turned inside out after such an occurrence).When wearing a purple sock of each type on both feet (see pic where I'm comparing the two), the other sock seems to be a tad more dense/warmer--likely due to the greater percentage of wool in its blend.These socks are fine for lounging around the house when it's cold outside, but they may not be ideal for outside winter wear (hence the word ""fashion"" in the name on product page).

These socks seemed a bit thin, but surprisingly they keep our feet quite warm.The fit is perfect for BOTH me and my daughter (she is a women's 8 and I am an 9.5).

"These mugs are remarkable in that they have the ability to keep my hot food (usually soup) hot and my cold beverages very chilly.This is an especially decorative vessel that holds a good amount of food and drink. The rim is curled over, which lends a different feeling to get used to when drinking from it.The design of the handle has jagged ends that remind me of lightning (like it could be a cup from Thor's home in Asgard). However, I wish it was a bit more ergonomic. My hand gets sore when holding it by the handle, so I've been mainly resting it on a hard surface that will support the weight.An included picture shows how I am able to handle it.

Due to this, I appreciate that the black clips are flexible enough for me to fit them onto my phone case (this set goes even further by including two clips).Two out of the three lenses work fine for my Note 4. However, my camera can't figure out the wide angle lens when it's fitted onto my case.

This set is different than a nearly identical glowstick (8 inch 100 count) tube that I've reviewed in the past. Instead of orange, this set has RED (lightsaber color used by the Sith).Alternately, red is great for color coordinating for holidays like Christmas and Valentine's...This is my favorite way to wear the thick glowsticks (hanging by their hooks rather than having string threaded through). You simply snap these down the entire length of the stick, shake and connect ends with the included bits of plastic tube.I did notice a slight smell in the canister with these sticks compared to the other brand, but most of the colors appear identical: blue (starts off clear before activation), green (initially pale yellow), yellow (noticeably darker yellow) and pink (hot pink).Note: It's a challenge to clearly tell which sticks are red or pink in low lighting. If accurate nighttime color selection is a priority, you may want to carefully separate these beforehand and reinsert them in the tube sectioned off with a cardboard divider.Also, I recommend transferring connectors to a zippered baggie after opening to prevent them from spilling during the excitement...After an evening of fun, place activated sticks in the freezer to extend their glow time.*Complimentary glow sticks provided by Etekcity for testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39AHA3ED5BVU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CFQT3I#wasThisHelpful","R39AHA3ED5BVU7","A35NOFKHK8P2LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35NOFKHK8P2LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is truly the freshest container of coconut oil that I've ever opened. I'm in a colder climate, so naturally it arrived opaque. However, it wasn't as solid as a number of brands that I've tried in the past. It's soft and smooth...It tasted so delicious in it's BPA Free tub, that I spread it on a piece of bread and ate it plain! As much as I have use coconut oil in the past, I can't recall EVER doing that before. I couldn't wait to whip up a batch of wheat biscuits with it.I rely on organic, virgin coconut oil (cold-pressed) for SO many things. It's the best coconut oil that you can buy and a must-have in our home. Like shortening, it provides the same flaky texture in my cookies, biscuits and pie crusts. Yet, using coconut oil is MUCH healthier for you.In addition, I use this to maintain healthy skin and good dental hygiene. If you look up ""Oil Pulling with Coconut Oil,"" you'll find an incredible wealth of information regarding all the wonderful benefits of oil pulling.

" 5:40 Mins This face paint gives dramatic results without my face feeling heavy or tight. It's non-irritating, so I can wear it for extended periods of time (I've already worn the paint on half of my face for several hours). It is a perfect choice for sensitive skin since it's an FDA approved non-toxic, hypoallergenic food grade coloring. This doesn't even have any odor!I was thrilled that the set includes cosmetic glitter (it doesn't damage eyes--unlike our regular glitter that we use for art projects) and has both a flat and round brush. I explain how the sponges worked better for me over time (9 colors--at 2 dry grams a piece). If you immediately need the colors to be more intense for darker skin tones, I recommend using the flat brush to apply your base coat.The paint washes off with a wet washcloth or paper towel. However, COMPLETELY removing the heavy coat of paint from my face and white washcloth did require the use of soap instead of just water. This easily comes out of carpet or clothing, making it ideal for households with very young children.There are e-books and online video tutorials provided. Current video designs (also in e-book form) include: Batman, The Winter Princess, The Princess Crown, The Puppy and The Tiger.The new Halloween e-book is PACKED with impressive designs. It includes: Spiderman Eye, Inside Out:Joy, Wolverine, Pirate, Sugar Skull, Minion, Minecraft Creeper, Ninja Turtle, Purple Witch and Frankenstein.In this video, I reveal my version of their Tiger.

Our household has NEVER felt a softer cloth...Even after investing in Egyptian cotton towel sets, we've had to watch them seriously decline over the years. In this video, I show you two examples of this. You can actually hear the roughness of their textures through the mic at my mouth. I compare them with these bamboo washcloths.In contrast, these washcloths are are made of 100% natural bamboo fibre. I am told that the texture is supposed to improve with subsequent washes. They're already super soft and are free from chemical toxins and dyes, so it's hard for me to see how they can get much better.The 10X10 cloths are absorbent, yet they quickly air dry.

The crisp, bright colors POP instead of blur into hazy tints of green/beige...It's made with waterproof Oxford fabric and can be worn over one shoulder (the straps combine with a zipper) or over both shoulders as a traditional backpack. I love how it allows me to have quick access to my Note 4.I walked/ran with this (full) bag for several hours yesterday. It's definitely strong enough to take on any number of excursions. You're really only limited by the size and how the contents may sit on your back when combined with the stiffer Army-type material.In this video, I demonstrate both ways to wear it. I also fill it up with a couple of thick encyclopedias in order to show the strength of the bag.I consider this more of a casual backpack purse since it's nearly identical in size to the purse backpack that my daughter was using before.

" 5:27 Mins This is a quiet, attractive and efficient essential oil diffuser. It's a gorgeous light that rotates colors or you can set it at the color of your choice. With only one button (two in total), you can also pick between two levels of brightness for that particular color.This really helps set a mood for a corner of a room. It makes a VERY interesting night light that both children and adults can enjoy.The diffuser starts working almost immediately after pouring in the water/essential oil with the provided plastic pitcher. There is no heat involved--an electrical current agitates the water, providing a continuous mist. The 100ml water limit (1.5ml of it being the oil) lasts up to three hours before automatically shutting off.Aside from fragrance, this diffuser quickly fills our dry room with needed moisture. Depending on the oil, you can even use this to clean the air of harmful allergens. I love that it provides deep, colorful ambiance and can run as a light without misting.Clear instructions (with illustrations) are provided. I highly recommend thoroughly reading this beforehand.

"My husband and I have eliminated meat (except for seafood) from our diets. I thought that I would give this set a try in order to bring more variety into our cooking.Injector & Meat ClawsThe injector worked quite well with the eggplant and squash that I used. I recommend only cutting one (long) side of the disposable plastic holder that carries the syringe. This way, I can keep it to easily slide all the pieces back in for an enclosed, safer storage (the attachments are sharp).When I injected a small cup of soy sauce, I screwed on the single hole attachment. It works well when injected in uncut vegetables that are allowed to sit for a little bit before cooking--I cut the eggplant before stringing one of the two included kebab cables.To slice fresh pineapple for the kebab, I used a plastic ""meat claw"" to hold a large piece in place. Once can pierce a pineapple, but can't even begin to tear at its sides (so your meat should be tender if attempting to use them to shred).Kebab Skewers & BBQ SheetsThe two skewers make it easy to pan sear kebabs, which was a welcome change from serving up one of my bean-based recipes. I love that the skewer didn't get too hot to hold and manipulate in the pan (warning: it can get VERY hot on a grill), and that the ends weren't as sharp as my conventional stick skewers.Still, I could quickly thread a skewer with fruit, shrimp, injected veggies and squid patty pieces with no problems, whatsoever. I then arranged it all inside my large pan. The skewer also makes the kebab easy to store in a container INTACT for reheating the next day. I just threw the whole kebab back into the pan to warm it up. Since it was still intact, it seemed less like boring leftovers.The nonstick BBQ sheets are easy to clean since they're made with PTFE (like Teflon). They should never touch an open flame, because it starts to smoke and release a chemical smell. This also makes a darker black imprint on the material. ---------Silicone MittsThe biggest issue I've had with several other oven mitts, is that they eventually get nasty looking. Many washes in hard water fade them or they start to fray, or they get charred in some way...That's not a problem with these black silicone mitts. They don't need to ever look old--just rinse them off if they get dirty.However, they didn't consistently provide the best protection (it seems to partially depend on where you're clutching the pan)...The first time I used them to pull some toasted bread pizza out of the oven, I couldn't feel any heat--I was SO impressed. However, when I used one to grab a hot pan of brownies last night, my hand got surprisingly VERY warm. I should not have been able to feel that at all.They also each have a hole for easy hanging.

"I love how fragrant and long-lasting essential oils are. I am impressed to see that no chemicals or pesticides are used in Respire.The camphor-like smell was so pleasant, that I initially would dab a drop or two beneath my nose. I found that it immediately cleared my sinuses. However, I would then start getting headaches and queasiness. This happened a couple times before I made the connection.After diluting Respire with a good carrier oil (in my case, fractionated coconut oil), I spent several days online researching the different ingredients. Beyond the antiviral/antibacterial/mood altering benefits that many have listed, some oils included in this blend have definite side effects.Currently, there's only a warning for pregnant women on the product page. Infants and young children should be included on that list, since some of the individual oils included in Respire have similar warnings.I prefer child-friendly blends or single oils that I can mix myself by following one of many essential oil ""recipes"" online for improving respiratory health.For treating congestion, examples of essential oils that are safer for households with children include spruce, fir, cypress and pine.*Complimentary Respire provided by Living Pure Essential Oils LLC for testing and review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IHXE4C5J16X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012NZQD28#wasThisHelpful","R3IHXE4C5J16X5","A35NOFKHK8P2LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35NOFKHK8P2LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These large, two-panel curtains are stunningly beautiful representations of repeating castles that cast reflections in the water beneath. They come with silver and golden colored woven braid ties with tassels. These help to create a more mature, fairytale look.

These could be reversible--particularly during the holidays, when everything is shiny and bright.Unfortunately, I received a defective item that already had some snags/scratches. I recommend ironing these before hanging, so that you can clearly see the entire surface to be able to identify any irregularities (they initially blended into the folding wrinkles and lovely design). I used a cotton bed sheet in between the iron and the curtain to avoid burning the delicate material.Also, check that the material is securely tucked inside each grommet, especially before washing. Consider machine washing them on gentle and then only if your machine has NO agitator.

It has a lock and is totally leak proof.Though this bottle comes with a regular top and bottom in an attractive gray, I prefer the flip cap for the additional safety and convenience.

" 2:24 MinsThis is an incredibly well-made neoprene belt (with rubber lining) that is backed with a lifetime warranty. Both the 42"" length and 9"" width are perfectly suited for a wide range of sizes. The strength and placement of the velcro is ideal.The first time I wore it, it was so moisture wicking that I didn't take it off for SIX hours. I thought that it wasn't working because I didn't feel wet--even after jumping rope. When I took off the belt I found myself dripping with sweat beneath it. I draped the wet belt over a chair and it dried out VERY quickly.This belt does help me be mindful of my posture and reminds me that I need to tighten my abs. It also provides a degree of back support and seems to give the appearance of a flatter stomach (though it measures the same when I tape myself both before and after).However, if you are hoping that this can raise your metabolism without the aid of diet and exercise, then you'll be disappointed. Using this belt while exercising will heat up your core, which improves circulation and may lead to metabolic changes.Instead of shedding belly fat, expect to lose temporary water weight that will return once you rehydrate.Note: I'm only wearing the belt over my clothes for this video demonstration.

This burns an amazing amount of calories (it varies by your weight and jumping rate/time).The rope is made with nitrile butadiene rubber (what is commonly used in non-latex gloves). This material is less likely to degrade from extreme temperatures or cause an allergic reaction than with traditional rubber. It also has a higher tolerance of oils and acids.Each ergonomic foam grip covers practically the entire handle (except for the end cap). Being mostly black, it's harder to see the eventual darkening that occurs over time from oils and dirt when handling.The handles unscrew at the bottoms for quick access to adjust the rope. Theres two permanently fixed washers that serve as stoppers. I tie a knot where I want to shorten each side of the rope and then tuck the rest of that extra length back into the hollow handles.As a bonus, this comes with a ""no questions asked"" money back guarantee for an entire year.*Complimentary jump rope provided by Aegend for testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMDZZRTL5V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HHYDMS#wasThisHelpful","RWMDZZRTL5V7","A35NOFKHK8P2LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35NOFKHK8P2LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This well written and somewhat innovative survey of colonial N. America is the first volume in a projected 5 volume Penguin History of the USA.  I don't think other volumes are published yet.  Drawing on a great deal of recent scholarship, Taylor provides a considerably broader perspective on the early history of the USA by discussing the whole history of colonization in North America, including Spanish and French colonization, and a great deal of attention to the experiences of Native Americans.  As part of his effort to cover all of what is now the USA, Taylor also uses a larger temporal frame as he concludes in the early 19th century with some narrative of the Russian exploitation of Alaska, the Spanish colonization of California, and the early impact of Europeans on Hawaii.This book is divided into 3 sections; Encounters, Colonies, and Empires.  Encounters covers the early explorations and the history of the early colonizations by the Spanish and French.  This section provides concise but useful discussions of the native peoples of North America, the dynamics of early exploration and colonization, the European background of the European conquest of the Western Hemisphere, and the enormous impacts of the European invasion on Native Americans.  Colonies is a somewhat more traditional section describing the histories of the different British colonies, including New England, the Carolinas, the Middle Colonies, and also including the British Caribbean.  Taylor discusses the distinctive histories of these colonies, but also some of their common features.Empires includes much of the traditional history of British North America, including the effects of British politics and the expanding imperial state and economy, the great conflicts with the French Empire, and important cultural events like the first Great Awakening.  The experiences of native peoples and African slaves are important components of the story.  Taylor also includes good discussions of French North America, the great impact of contact with Europeans across the whole continent via the fur trade and other interactions, and sets the stage for the next volume on the American Revolution.In many ways, this is a very fine book.  The breadth of topics is impressive and the quality of writing, like all of Taylor's books, is excellent.  Each section is well worth reading in its own right and there is reasonably good integration of the sections.  Taylor's effort to broaden the perspective of early American history beyond a focus on the British colonies is successful.  Drawbacks include less specific political history of the colonies and the complex events leading to the great rupture of the Revolution.  This is probably an unavoidable consequence of Taylor's well justified decision to expand the scope of the narrative.  Each section has a nice bibliography for further reading.  My only substantial criticism is that this book should have finished with an overview interpretative chapter in which Taylor discusses some of the important themes - the impact of the European invasion on native peoples, the diverse and ambiguous relationships between colonies and their metropoli, the impact of successful colonization on the imperial success of Britain, and the colonization of North America as a specific example of the general phenomenon of expanding European capitalism-imperialism.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYARN8Y17YJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142002100#wasThisHelpful","RMYARN8Y17YJ6","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An very good and well written alternative history novel.  In this world-line, Byron becomes a successful politician, the crisis of 1830 leads not to modest electoral reform but to a bourgeois-technocratic revolution, and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine is built and becomes the cornerstone of an early information technology revolution.  Like all good alternative history books, there is an imaginative use of real historical figures and fictional figures.  The plot, focused on a search for what is essentially a piece of software, does a nice job of taking readers through the fictional world constructed by Gibson and Sterling.  The plot is a bit cryptic with its resolution presented rather indirectly. The authors introduce a quite a few relatively modern scientific ideas, such as Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and the Cambrian Radiation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQGWN1CXPOPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440423627#wasThisHelpful","R2VQGWN1CXPOPS","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This useful and concise book is an analytically oriented survey of the social and economic history of WWI Russia.  This book will be useful primarily to individuals with prior knowledge of the basic political history.  An important feature of this book is Gatrell's synthesis of considerable secondary literature, much of it in Russian and unavailable to English language readers.  As stated by the subtitle, Gatrell focuses on the effects of the war on Russian society and on the Russian economy.  Using a somewhat chronological approach, Gatrell addresses social and economic changes at each major phase of the war from the outbreak of hostilities to the aftermath of the Bolshevik takeover.  Social and demographic impacts are addressed for each strata of Russian society; the aristocracy, peasantry, urban workforce, and middle classes. There is a fairly detailed description and analysis of the economic changes and dislocations imposed by the war effort, resulting ultimately in disintegration of the economy.  Unlike many historians, Gatrell makes good use of tabular data, so this book has considerably more information than its length would suggest.Gatrell is a thoughtful and articulate analyst.  A major theme of this book is the way that the events of WWI exacerbated many of the social conflicts in Russian society.  The tensions between the Tsarist state and liberal-parliamentary reformers, between business interests and the state bureaucracy, and between classes were considerable exacerbated by the war, particularly with serial defeats and a failing economy.  Military and economic failure, and Nicholas II's disastrous decision to assume personal responsibility ultimately discredited the regime.  In a very nice comparative analysis that concludes the book, Gatrell makes the interesting point that the Tsarist state was the only one of the major belligerents not to make significant concessions to labor during the war.Gatrell also makes some other interesting points.  He discusses how aspects of Tsarist policy during the war tended to encourage ethnic-nationalist unrest.  He points also to some technocratic efforts to manage the economy that would be influential for the subsequent Bolshevik state.  Finally, in his concluding and comparative analysis, Gatrell has a particularly nice analysis of the common features of social and economic effects of WWI in all the major belligerents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZ7M2PIQLIVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0582328187#wasThisHelpful","R3AZ7M2PIQLIVQ","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably Anderson's most ambitious novel.  Its longer, has more characters, and a more complex plot than many of his books.  Set in a post Nuclear Holocaust world centuries from now, this books displays many of the best and worst features of Anderson's writing.  Like his best books, its quite imaginative.  The future world that Anderson sketches out is interesting with an imaginative depiction of future societies.  Like many of his books, the plot centers on an enjoyable adventure story that allows Anderson to explore several aspects of his fictional world.  The basic plot idea, an effort to develop a nuclear bomb powered spaceship, is clever and used well.  But, as is also the case with a number of Anderson's books, character development is not always particularly deep and Anderson has a fair amount of gushy prose.  Nonetheless, despite these drawbacks, this is one of his best books and an enjoyable read - much better than the usual run of novels in this genre.  I read this book when published in the early 1980s and recently re-read it, and its worth re-reading.This book is also a thinly disguised allegory containing Anderson's response to contemporary events, including a strong criticism of the environmental movement and a full-throated, but rather odd defense of nuclear power.  These allegorical aspects are handled relatively well and revealing of Anderson's ideological preoccupations, including his somewhat naive libertarianism and belief that expansion was needed to avoid social decay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6VGIFK1HKWN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671828428#wasThisHelpful","R6VGIFK1HKWN0","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This concise,clear book is primarily an interpretative analysis of the Weimar experience.  It is not a narrative introduction and to get the most out of this book, knowledge of the basic narrative history is required.  The book has a hybrid but effective organization, it alternates between chronologically organized sections covering the different periods of Weimar and sections discussing major themes in social, economic, and political history of Weimar.  The chronologically based sections contain some narrative but are primarily analytic is the sense that Peukert identifies major trends and features of events and ties them to his broader analytic sections.  Peukert also has some nice sections placing the Weimar experience in the larger frame of German history.This book has 2 major themes.  One is that the Weimar experience was partly a specific manifestation of general conflicts arising over modernization.  The turbulence of Weimar was partly the consequence of industrialization, urbanization, and massive social change.  The second is that this crisis occurred under particularly difficult circumstances in the aftermath of the German defeat in WWI.  Peukert demonstrates that the Weimar founders attempted to address quite a few of the challenges of modernization but that the constricted economic and political environment of the 1920s, culminated by the Great Depression, severely undermined the Weimar experiment.  Perhaps the most surprising point is that Weimar lasted as long as it did.Peukert has a large number of insightful analyses.  His discussion, for example, of the erosion of legitimacy resulting from the inability of the Weimar state to achieve the social goals set out in the constitution and the limitations of Streseman's foreign policy are really interesting.  I'm not sure that all of his analyses are on target.  I think some knowledgeable scholars would disagree with his discussion of the genesis of the Dawes plan.  At least one prominent historian has described Hitler's accession to power in more contingent terms.For readers interested in understanding the Weimar experience, I recommend reading a good narrative history and then this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCU2M7Q8ZT7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809015560#wasThisHelpful","R2TCU2M7Q8ZT7P","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A well written, conventional narrative of the success of Norman emigres in Medieval Southern Italy and Sicily.  In the 11th and 12th centuries, emigre Norman knights became involved in the chaotic politics of Southern Italy and Sicily.  Originally serving as mercenaries, a number of these emigres, notably the sons of the minor noble Tancred of Hauteville, became important and independent actors.  Two of them, Robert Guiscard (translated variously as the ""cunning"" or as the ""weasel"") and his half-brother, Roger the Great Count, became dominant figures in Southern Italy and Sicily, and important figures in the Mediterranean & European worlds.  Focusing on the careers of the Hauteville brothers, Norwich narrates their careers as warlords and eventual success.  Southern Italy and Sicily were politically complex and violent, with the Byzantine Greeks, local Italian lords, the Papacy, the Holy Roman Empire, and local Muslim emirs all important actors in this turbulent environment.  The literally crowning achievement was the establishment of the Kingdom of Sicily, encompassing both Sicily proper and much of Southern Italy by Roger II.  This remarkably tolerant, for its time, society was built in good part on Roger's continuation of Muslim administrations and his adoption of a Byzantine style of monarchy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STV4OEK73RTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006BR5KG#wasThisHelpful","R2STV4OEK73RTK","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A well written and interesting exploration of the nature of politics in the early American republic. Freeman focuses on the nature of politics prior to the emergence of the party system that is such an important and persistent feature of American life.  This is book is essentially a set of closely related essays on the role of a traditional conception of ""honor"" in political life.  Freeman's strategy is to select an interesting and often somewhat neglected text or set of documents, and use it as a point of departure to explore her theme.  John Adams' letters to the Boston Patriot, written in retirement and to justify his administration, are an example.Freeman argues very well that a traditional concept of personal ""honor"" was a crucial element of political life.  Inspired by traditional aristocratic ideals, the concept of personal honor strongly influenced political interactions, organization, and leadership in the early Republic.  She argues as well that this code had a specific ""grammer' that dictated certain forms of personal and political behavior, and that it is difficult to understand early American politics without knowing these structural features.  The most famous example is the fatal Burr-Hamilton duel.  Freeman makes the very interesting argument that the public and republican nature of American politics actually exacerbated aspects of the ""honor"" code.  Only with the emergence of a party system, a somewhat painful process, was it possible to dissociate some personal and public aspects of conduct, quenching the importance of ""honor.""  While this argument doesn't replace  the traditional interpretation of the importance of the development of a party system in the early Republic, it certainly deepens it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QM51F7SWD788/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300097557#wasThisHelpful","R3QM51F7SWD788","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well organized and well written book explores the basis for the often spectacular phenomenon of adaptive radiations.  Schluter, who has made major contributions in this area, adopts a useful approach to discussing adaptive radiations.  His point of departure is the basic theory developed by prominent biologists in the mid -20th century.  This theory is the ""ecological theory"" in which radiations are driven by selective advantages of adapting to differentiated environmental niches.  Schluter isolates the basic features of the theory and systematically moves through the recent evidence for or against these features.  This is often an impressive combination of basic theory, natural history, and some intervention experiments.  For generally all features of the theory, Schluter finds that the available data, though often incomplete, favors the initial theory.  He is successful as well in identifying future areas for research.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FN9BLNJXBO4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198505221#wasThisHelpful","R1FN9BLNJXBO4M","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very well research and well written history of radioisotope use in the post-WWII era.  Creager's goals are to illuminate the relationship between the major Federal vendor of radioisotopes, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the scientific community, and to illustrate the importance of radioisotopes as key tools in post-WWII biology and medicine.  This is, consequently and sensibly, an essentially topical though roughly chronological set of chapters on themes.While prefigured by some uses of radioisotopes generated by cyclotron technology in the interwar period, widespread use of radioisotopes was, likely many aspects of American science, a direct produce of WWII, the Manhattan Project, and the Cold War.  Wide use of radioisotopes was driven by a convergence of factors.  The AEC was eager to promote a peaceful use of nuclear technology, a number of prescient scientists recognized the potential of radioisotopes, and  a major reactor at what became the Oak Ridge National Laboratory had become redundant, allowing its use for radioisotope generation.  Creager discusses the AEC's efforts to expand use of radioisotopes, its entanglement with its military mission and Cold War politics, and provides some nice examples of the impact of using radioisotope tracers as tools in  basic research.  The latter include reconstructing the pathways of photosynthesis and the famous Hershey-Chase experiment.  Applications in medical research are discussed  as well - a much more ambiguous story featuring some real triumphs like the development of RIAs and some actually shocking experiments involving the unwitting participation of pregnant women.  Creager also discusses the role of the AEC in developing radiotherapy and to some extent, new imaging methods.  There is a good chapter on the importance of radiotracer methods in large scale ecological studies.An important aspect of several chapters is what was sometimes convergence and sometimes tension between the AEC's military mission and scientific-clinical work.  The AEC support for developing better radiotherapy methods was driven partly by military interest in the effects of radiation exposure.  Support for ecological experiments was driven in part by concerns about contamination secondary to weapons production.  Another important aspect is the often inconsistent and irregular approach (and lack of same) towards safety and ethics of experiments.  Many features of this work, not revealed until years later, will be very disturbing to modern readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QAFSVDMO94QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022601780X#wasThisHelpful","R1QAFSVDMO94QS","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A dystopian novel set in a near future USA, probably the early 22nd century, when many of the feared consequences of global warming have occurred.  The action takes place in an American Southwest in the grip of a megadrought and the background clearly includes much of the coastal USA lost to sea level rise.  This is a chaotic USA with states semi-independent and engaged in thinly disguised warfare over access to water.  Despite this, the basic legal framework of rights to water in the western USA, first in has rights in perpetuity, still governs access to water.  The plot centers around the pursuit of a long lost document that would markedly alter the legal balance of power.  This is a relatively conventional thriller plot with relatively conventional character development.  Bacigalupi is a competent writer and the overarching metaphor of the book, water (or more properly, access to water) as a source of social division is clever, but the plotting and character development are clunky and predictable.  As commented by other readers, there is a fair amount of rather stark violence in this book, arguably and perhaps unfortunately, the best writing in the book.  On the important criterion of the plausibility of Bacigalupi's projected future, I'd say the results are uneven.  The dismal future he describes is plausible but as seems to be common, he has China doing relatively well.  This is unlikely as China is even more vulnerable to water depletion, weather pattern changes, and sea level rise than the USA.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC238JTP0A126/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352875#wasThisHelpful","RC238JTP0A126","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A truly outstanding work of scholarship.  Miller set out to capture the world view of the dominant figures of the 17th century New England Puritan world - its theologians and ministers.  The thoughts of this relatively small and self-selected group is at the root of many important features of subsequent American history.  This is not a typical chronological survey but rather an attempt at a systematic description and synthesis of the fundamental features of Puritan theology.  Miller divides this book into 4 sections - Religion and Learning, Cosmology, Anthropology, and Sociology.  He proceeds from the basic conception of God through Puritan attempts to categorize and understand the natural world, then their conception of human nature, and as a final consequence, their essentially religious conception of society.A major theme is the Puritan effort to utilize the large and not always compatible intellectual heritage of Medieval and Renaissance Europe.  Miller starts with the essentially Augustinian-Calvinist view of an infinitely powerful and mysterious God, a corrupted humanity, and the unmerited gift of Grace.  At the same time, the Puritans aimed to avoid the abandonment of reason and drew on a varied intellectual inheritance to produce a rational way of understanding theology and the natural world.  He particularly emphasizes the role of the ""logic,"" really a system of classification, of the French scholar Petrus Ramus.  In their studies of scripture and attempts to erect a way to understand the world, they constructed an elaborate system that they believed reconstructed divine structure.  As Miller demonstrates, this was a not always consistent compound of Calvinism, medieval scholasticism, humanist scholarship, Aristotle, and Plato. With time, some of the contradictions of this system would become problematic but in its time, this was an impressive achievement.  The Puritan view of man was a similar effort to unify faith and reason, holding onto the Calvinist view of corrupted humanity and undeserved Grace but also describing ways in which reason and human capacity could participate in salvation.In the final section of this book, Miller provides a fascinating discussion of the major New England Puritan innovation; Covenant theology.  This approach pulled the sting of the remote Calvinist God by binding him in a voluntary contract that allowed some scope for human action.  Miller demonstrates how this system developed under the stimulus of other Protestant theological challenges, as well as the specific political circumstances of early 17th century England.  There is a particularly interesting following discussion of how the covenant concept was expanded to political and church government covenants, accounting for a number of the unique features of New England life.  As with other features of Puritan thought, this one contained some internal contradictions that would have ironic consequences in the future.While intellectually demanding, this book is a pleasure to read.  Miller was not only a remarkably insightful scholar but also a brilliant writer.  Among 20th century American historians, no one wrote better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R112CA8NT7KB62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674613066#wasThisHelpful","R112CA8NT7KB62","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is hardly a new idea and there are a number of books involving supernatural conflicts accompanying WWII, not to mention Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Richards introduces little that is novel.  The quality of writing is pedestrian.  It reads like a mediocre TV series, not surprising as the author has apparently written quite a bit for TV.  I suspect this book is a knockoff of a considerably more successful series pursuing the same general idea, Charles Stross' entertaining Laundry series.

"An interesting, very well researched, and generally solidly written book on the apparently narrow topic of musket manufacture in France before and during the French Revolution.  This is a very ambitious book.  Alder is interested in writing history of technology as a form of social and political history.  A recurrent and much discussed theme in this book is that technologies do not occur in a vacuum but rather reflect social and political realities and sometime embody the objectives and needs of their makers.  Musket manufacture in this context has several interesting dimensions.  Efforts to reform and improve manufacture was spearheaded by French artillery engineers, a early effort at a meritocratic managerial elite.  A good deal of this book is about the status and efforts of this group under Ancien Regime, and their interactions with traditional institutions of the Ancien Regime, including the royal bureaucracy and established craft-based manufacturing.  Alder presents this as an aspect of the Enlightenment in a military form.  These efforts continue after the Revolution, particularly in the form of what Alder terms techno-Jacobinism as part of an effort to transform French society, particularly under the threat of internal disunion and external threat.Intertwined with this story is another theme, that of recurrent and ultimately failed efforts to develop manufacturing based on mechanization and interchangeable parts, something that would only be achieved in the USA decades later under the stimulus of Ordnance Department efforts.  Alder argues well that the up and downs of these efforts were more related to social and political factors than technical obstacles per se.  Alder has some interesting discussion of the nature of proto-industrialization in France and differences with Britain and the USA.Parts of the book are somewhat repetitive as Alder revisits some issues from different perspectives.  Alder tends to belabor the social-political nature of the history of technology, making fairly obvious points repeatedly.  There is a bit too much discussion of theoretical-historiographic issues, again somewhat repetitive discussion of fairly obvious points.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2UH2IRNM6EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691026718#wasThisHelpful","R1H2UH2IRNM6EG","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This very interesting book is worth reading for 2 reasons.  First, the authors' list of major transitions in evolution concisely identified a series of particularly important research areas.  Second, the authors' discussions of each of these transitions are nice analyses of information about and potential explanations for each of the transitions.  The framework erected by the list of major transitions apparently has had durable value in guiding a good deal of research.  Some of the individual sections are now unavoidably dated, as their has been significant additional research and real progress in some of these areas.  The authors focus on major transitions that involve the development of or major changes in the way information is transmitted between generations, for example the emergence of chromosomes or sexual reproduction.  Another major theme is the emergence of increasing complexity, in particular, the recurrent phenomenon of independently replicating entities evolving into entities that replicate only as part of a larger whole.  Examples are the development of multicellularity and sociality.  All the transitions are discussed in the context of evolutionary theory and selective advantage, which is key to understanding the transitions.  For some of the transitions, such as the origin of compartmentalization, the discussions are about plausible reconstructions.  For others, such as the evolution of sex, there is considerable data to discuss.  While this book was written with biologists in mind (the authors also wrote a corresponding popular book), the arguments are laid out clearly and there are abundant, useful charts and diagrams to illustrate the authors' arguments.While it was written about 20 years ago, many aspects of this book have a strongly contemporary flavor.  The authors discuss, for example, the origins of eukaryotes and the root phylogeny of life.  An important discovery was recently made on this topic.  In their section on development, there is a discussion of Turing's model for development, which the authors discuss as a theoretical construct.  Evidence for the reality of Turing-like mechanisms in development was published in Science within the last couple of years.  In their discussion of the development of human sociality, the authors suggest that important social mechanisms emerged initially in the context of kin selection and then were extended to non-kin.  Again, this idea is supported by some interesting, recently published research.  Maynard Smith and Szathmary clearly identified a series of important research areas and provide a nice way of thinking about these problems generally, a substantial achievement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CFG6GC8B5VM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019850294X#wasThisHelpful","R3CFG6GC8B5VM6","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting and enjoyable collection of short stories. Death and historical memory are recurrent themes in these stories.  These are generally written in what might be called a Borgesian style, with a mixture of the fabulous and the mundane, pursuit of the themes in what might be called a metaphysical manner, pseudohistorical vignettes, and parodies of scholarship. The best stories, such as the one that provides the title for the collection, are very interesting.

"This well written, very well researched, and thoughtful book is an excellent biography of the great abolitionist leader William Lloyd Garrison.  One of Mayer's goals was to rescue Garrison from relative obscurity and demonstrate his central role in the great controversies that led to the Civil War.  Mayer succeeds admirably, partly because Garrison is a generally attractive and in important respects modern figure.  The child of a father who abandoned his family, Garrison had a somewhat difficult childhood and youth.  While he was the beneficiary of the New England commitment to primary education, the talented Garrison was very much an autodidact.  Apprenticed to a printer as teen, he acquired the skills that would permit his career as a pioneering abolitionist journalist.  Mayer is particularly good on the motivations for Garrison's commitments to human rights; a combination of heterodox and fervent religious beliefs with a Romantic belief in individual capacity.  Garrison's expansive view of humanity led him to the anti-slavery cause.  One of the few Americans who really believed in the equality of African-Americans, he followed this principles logically to become an early advocate of women's rights.Mayer shows Garrison's commitment and diligence in what must have appeared initially a hopeless cause.  Over the course of decades, Garrison and his colleagues, many of them the first women to be important figures in American politics, were significant factors in the transformation of Northern political opinion.  Mayer is particularly good on important and interesting aspects of Garrison's life and the abolitionist movement. Garrison aimed at a moral, not political transformation of American life.  His moral perfectionism drove his pacifism, his skepticism towards the established churches that he saw as compromising with evil, and his suspicion of conventional politics.  Garrison's famous attack on the Constitution and advocacy of peaceful disunion was a logical result of his perfectionism.  Garrison's life, which included participation in spiritualism and anti-sabbatarianism, was in some respects a characteristic manifestation of the radical religious experimentation of 19th century American life.  Mayer also narrates the complex internal politics of the anti-slavery movement quite well.Garrison was not, however, dogmatic.  With the outbreak of the Civil War, the life long pacifist supported the Republican government.  He saw the war correctly as an opportunity for emancipation.  Initially quite skeptical of Lincoln, over the course of the war, he became a de facto Radical Republican.  He was, however, deeply disappointed by the failure of Reconstruction and the collapse of the Republican commitment to equal rights for African-Americans.  His reputation suffered after the war as an increasingly conservative and racist America came to view abolitionist ""fanaticism"" as one of the causes of the war.While this is an excellent biography, I think there is at least one point that Mayer gets wrong.  He emphasizes Garrison's role in the gradual transformation of Northern opinion towards slavery.  I suspect this is correct but incomplete.  In some ways, Garrison's most important audience was not in the North but in the South.  Garrison and other abolitionists were regarded with actual fear by many Southerners.  The greatest act of censorship in American history was the ban, enforced by the Federal government, on circulation of abolitionist publications in the South.  Abolitionists were a fringe political movement in the North but apparently frightened Southerners in a manner out of proportion to their actual influence.  Southern insecurity about their Peculiar Institution drove much of the relatively aggressive political behavior of Southern politicians, leading to increasing resentment on the part of the Northern public. The transformation of Northern political opinion was partly an ironic result of abolitionist activities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SQ18JXBK3FE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393332365#wasThisHelpful","R2SQ18JXBK3FE5","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A well written and thoroughly researched account of the Zionist terrorist campaign against British rule in Palestine.  Hoffman, an authority on contemporary terrorism, is interested in rebutting the commonly held notion that terrorism inevitably fails.  Hoffman's clear and detailed narrative demonstrates well that the Zionist terrorist campaign played a significant role in undermining British rule in Palestine.  Initiated by disciples of the Revisionist Zionist Jabotinsky and later gaining considerable support among the Jewish community of Palestine, the terrorist campaign made Palestine harder to govern, become an enormous drain on scarce British resources, and considerably complicated the crucial US-British relationship.  The exhausted British eventually washed their hands of Palestine and turned the problem over to the nascent UN.  Hoffman is careful not to portray the terrorist campaign as decisive but it clearly had a significant impact.  He doesn't dwell on the irony of terrorism being part of the foundation of the state of Israel, but then, he doesn't have to.The strengths of this book, based on extensive and novel archival research, is the narrative of the terrorist campaigns, the detailed description of British policies, and the responses of the mainstream of the Jewish community in Palestine.  Hoffman is quite critical of British policies, faulting the British for lack of a clear strategic focus, poor tactics, and general incompetence in intelligence gathering and other aspects of counter-terrorism.  Hoffman's critique appears to be correct but sometimes a bit shallow.  He criticizes the British correctly for not being able to formulate clear policy but never explicitly links this fact to the basic contradiction of British rule in Palestine; the inherent impossibility of satisfying both the Jewish and Arab populations.  The very detailed focus is both the strength of the book and weakness as Hoffman doesn't include important context.  Zionist terrorism was not the first successful terrorist campaign in the British Empire - that would be the Irish revolt.  Nationalist terrorism was fairly widespread in the interwar Empire with successful terrorism in Ireland and some Indian nationalists pursuing terrorist activities.  Hoffman occasionally mentions the successful Irish revolt against Britain, which was broadly known and must have been influential.  Hoffman several times expresses surprise at fluctuating British troop levels in the interwar period but there is no apparent awareness of the strains faced by the British in the interwar period.  Is there any relationship between the uprising in Iraq, unrest in India, revolt in Burma, and widespread labor unrest in Malaya, and the oscillations of British troop commitments in Palestine.  Similarly, Hoffman omits a crucial fact about post-WWII British-US relations.  He presents the American lack of support for British efforts and frequent support for the Zionist cause as primarily a matter of internal US politics and success of Zionist lobbying.  These were undoubtedly significant contributing factors but its also true that the Roosevelt-Truman administration had a generally negative attitude towards colonial empires and supported decolonialization in the postwar period.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETXPDWR575W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594718#wasThisHelpful","RETXPDWR575W4","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book appears to have been marketed in the USA as a thriller or crime novel.  It is, in fact, a serious effort to examine the nature of evil.  It contains 3 components; a police procedural narrative of the hunt for a serial killer in WWII Berlin, a narrative of an effort to prosecute German war criminals in the late 50s and early 60s, and an autobiographical account by the principal character of his participation in numerous war crimes in WWII Minsk.  The latter is about 1/2 the book.  Inspired by an actual case of a German policeman prosecuted in the early 1960s, Thomas drew on the documentary record and other sources such as Christopher Browning's excellent books.  Thomas is a competent, as opposed to gifted, writer but his unornamented descriptions of atrocities are powerful.  Thomas is interested in the relationship between careerism and evil, how crimes are defined, and the amnesia of 1950s Germany.  None of these topics are explored in depth but this is a surprisingly effective book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU56VNCX1YSSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623658497#wasThisHelpful","RU56VNCX1YSSO","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well written  and thoughtful analysis argues convincingly for the emergence of a form of nationalism in France during the 18th century.  Bell demonstrates that French intellectuals and politicians, including many of the initial figures of the Revolution, had a conception of France as a nation in something approximating the modern sense and also appreciated that this was a goal, not the reality of the existing France.  Bell traces the roots of the emerging French conception of the nation to several sources.  Increasing irreligion, fostered inadvertently by the Jansenist conception of a remote God, led to a search of an alternative, secular way to organize political society.  Expanding commerce, urbanization, literacy, and a secular public sphere created opportunities for alternative, irreligious concepts of society.  The French monarchy cultivated nascent nationalism, particularly under the stresses of imperial rivalry of Britain, often using the British as the proverbial ""Other.""  In the greatest irony, when the Revolutionaries and others needed to actualize the secular nation, their primary organizational model was the effort of the Counter-Reformation Church to reinvigorate Catholicism, particularly in the countryside, often giving nationalism the structural features of a religious cult.  Bell's arguments for his analysis are generally convincing and based on analysis of primary documents, the large secondary literatures on the Revolution and 18th century France, and a thoughtful appraisal of the literature on nationalism.  There is a nice concluding section summarizing the arguments and emphasizing the subsequent continuity of French nationalism.  One thing that surprised me was relatively little discussion of Britain as a model for France.  My impression is that a useful way to think about the earliest phase of the Revolution is that it was an effort to mimic important features of the British polity.  An unregulated internal market, uniform legal code, legislature as an at least equal power for the monarchy, aggressive external mercantilism, church subordinated to the state - all features of Britain and implemented under the early Revolution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPD5TWATIISY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674012372#wasThisHelpful","RPD5TWATIISY","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An interesting, well written, and analytically strong book describing the emergence of the Gilded Age plutocracy as a self-conscious class.  Beckert describes this group as bourgeoisie, using the term in a restricted way to denote individuals possessing a significant amount of capital, and focuses on the epicenter of Gilded Age capitalism, New York City (NYC).  By the 1850s, NYC was the dominant American commercial center and contained a substantial bourgeoisie.  This group, however, was politically and socially divided.  Most important were the more traditional mercantile interests thriving on NYC's great success as an entrepot driven by booming American cotton exports.  These individuals were economically and politically aligned with southern slaveholders, and supported the Democratic party.  The smaller group of emerging manufacturers tended to support the Republican Party, its Free Soil-Free Labor ideology, and containment of slavery.  The outbreak of the Civil War transformed the NYC bourgeoisie, which became rapidly committed to the survival of the Union and crucial partners for the Federal government.  With the huge burst of Federal expenditures driven by the war effort and the Republican commitment to tariff protection and economic development, manufacturing boomed.  The manufacturers became increasingly important though the more traditional mercantile interests also found ways, particularly in finance, to benefit from the new political economy.  But increasing manufacturing brought increased proletarianization and class conflict, staring with the 1863 Draft Riots, contributing significantly to the class consciousness of the bourgeoisie.  Many of these trends continued after the war.  With the booming American economy and expanding industry, NYC became even more economically powerful, more populous, and socially stratified.  Beckert shows the ways in which the NYC bourgeoisie essentially co-opted the Federal government to become the dominant group in the US.  The account of bourgeoisie political and economic dominance is accompanied by interesting discussions of the other ways in which the NYC (and increasingly national) bourgeoisie developed as a self-conscious class, including local politics and cultural activities.  A good deal of the analysis is quite interesting.  Beckert makes the interesting point that in the absence of a native aristocracy, the American bourgeoisie has little competition in their efforts to dominate the central government.  Implicit in some of his discussions is the idea that the American bourgeoisie were particularly successful in suppressing the American labor movement and this may account for the failure of a strong socialist movement in the USA.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJWJINBIYI9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521524105#wasThisHelpful","R3EJWJINBIYI9D","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well written book is a fine overview of Hume's philosophy from a leading Hume scholar.  The book's organization is notable and effective.  Garrett opens with a nice biographical chapter and concludes with an equally nice, concise chapter on Hume's influence from his death to the present.  The intervening 8 chapters offer a very useful description and analysis of the major themes of Hume's philosophy.  Garrett stresses the unity of Hume's work throughout his life by avoilding a chronological approach but rather cites both earller (the Treatise) and later (the Enquiries) work as he works through the major aspects of Hume's philosophy.  Hume's empirical ""Science of Man"" is the starting point with chapters on Hume's analysis of how the mind works, followed by chapters on how the human (and Humean) mind generates normativity.  This is folllowed by chapters on Hume's well known treatments of induction & causation, skepticism, morality, and religion.  Garrett writes clearly, explains topics well, and is, I think, rigorous in his interpretations.  He particularly emphasizes Hume's naturalism as the key feature of his thought, downplaying interpretations that tend to emphasize skeptical aspects of Hume's thought.  I think this book can be read profitably by neophytes and those with some experience in reading Hume.  This is a well produced book with a nice introduction, a useful glossary, and solid bibliography.  My only criticism is that I wish Garrett would have included a chapter on Hume's other important writings, specifically political theory, political economy. and history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VC5KEGMBT6L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415283345#wasThisHelpful","R3VC5KEGMBT6L6","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Written for a broad audience, this is a very effective exposition of an interesting hypothesis put forward several years ago by the author.  Ruddiman argues that major anthropenic effects on the climate system system started millenia ago with the spread of agriculture.  He opens with a nice overview of oscillations between glacial and interglacial periods over the past several million years.  He then follows with a similarly nice overview of human prehistory.  Ruddiman then lays out his hypothesis; he argues that the natural history of interglacials is initial warming and greenhouse gas rise, followed by a slow decline in both and global temperatures until reglaciation begins. About 7K years ago, however, our interglacial deviated from this pattern with a rise in methane and CO2 interrupting global cooling.  He suggests that this greenhouse gas rise was due to the spread of agriculture and based on widespread deforestation and methane production secondary particularly to paddy agriculture and livestock farming.  Much of the following text is devoted to a critical evaluation of this idea in which Ruddiman discussing the implications of his hypothesis, supporting data, alternative explanations, and the general state of knowledge about this concept. Ruddiman has very nice and concise expositions, with generally useful illustrations, of a great deal of recent climate data and methods.  While Ruddiman is obviously a partisan of this idea, I think he is admirably fair in terms of discussing objections and alternatives.  He continues to refer to this idea as a hypothesis and suggests further analyses to test the idea.  Overall, I found his ideas convincing.  He also discusses some plausible extensions of the core idea.  He suggests that if the emergence of agriculture aborted a slide towards the next Ice Age, the more recent industrial increase in greenhouse gases has essentially ""reset"" the global climate sequence, derailing the oscillatory glacial-interglacial pattern.  He suggests also that some historically important climate fluctuations, the end of Roman Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, were the result of changes in human populations.I think there are a couple of relatively minor problems with this book.  Ruddiman ventures into philosophy of science by using his experience to examine different versions of scientific progression, essentially Popper versus Kuhn.  I think this section is misleading in the sense that he mischaracterizes both Popper's and Kuhn's arguments.  As is commonly the case with scientists, he latches onto the idea that his hypothesis represents a new ""paradigm.""  In fact, Kuhn's model is likely wrong and Ruddiman's work is a nice example of the functioning of Kuhn's ""normal science.""  I'm also a bit skeptical about his ideas that human population changes drove the end of the Roman Warm period and Little Ice Age, though he could be correct.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J3MFYJGL9MRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464107769#wasThisHelpful","R1J3MFYJGL9MRF","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A model of concise exposition and analysis, this well written and thoughtful book characterizes the essential features and history of the development of the concept of distributive justice.  Fleischacker's essential point is that distributive justice is a relatively new concept.  Fleischacker opens by developing a fairly strict definition of distributive justice, emphasizing its essentially secular nature and redistributive features.  He then shows, contrary to quite a few other assertions, that this concept differs considerably from Classical, Medieval, and Early Modern European concepts of justice.  These earlier concepts associate forms of justice with merit, emphasize forms of redistribution with charity, and generally exhibit a disparaging attitude towards the poor.  By the end of the 18th century, attitudes begin to change.  Fleischacker identifies Hume, and particularly Adam Smith, as key figures with their treatments of the poor as moral equals.  Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a variety of other thinkers, including Utilitarians and Marx, contribute different concepts that were later used to formulate the modern concept of distributive justice.  John Rawls is credited with both the initial modern formulation and the prominence that distributive justice assumed in subsequent discussions.  There is a nice discussion of subsequent criticisms of Rawls and further developments.  There are excellent endnotes and bibliography.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MK9VX3PGSINW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674018311#wasThisHelpful","R3MK9VX3PGSINW","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting but somewhat specialized short book, originally a set of lectures, by the great Classicist Arnaldo Momigliano on the topic of the Hellenistic encounter with other cultures.  To a considerable extent, this is an effort to maximize the information available from a relatively limited set of texts.  Its impressive how often Momigliano discusses authors whom we know only from fragmentary quotations in surviving works.  Momigliano's basic theme is the relative lack of interest displayed by Greek intellectuals in important surrounding cultures such as the Celts, Jews, Iranians, and even Romans.  This is despite a tradition of geographic and ethnographic works such as some of Herodotus.  Some of these non-Greek cultures, in contrast, most famously the Romans and even the Jews showed a significant interest in and ability to utilize the Greek intellectual tradition.

"An interesting and well written monograph on the antebellum Southern debate over re-opening the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  In the 1850s, a number of radical Southerners proposed allowing slave importation.  Takaki shows nicely that this was largely a debate among Southerners with pro-slave trade arguments motivated by different and sometimes conflicting impulses.  In general, the driving force was the general Southern insecurity and moral unease about the Peculiar Institution.  Some pro-slave trade advocates saw it as a way to generate an issue provoking a final division from the North, others as a way of boosting the waning political power of the South, others as boosting the economy of the South and reducing class tensions, and others, in a rather bizarre way, as a form of moral balm.  Takaki describes the motivations and arguments of both pro-slave trade and anti-slave trade Southerners quite well.  The latter included pragmatic arguments from those with a vested interest in the internal slave trade, as well as arguments that remaining within the Union was the best way to safeguard slavery.  Well documented, this book provides a useful view of antebellum Southern politics and life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25AMPSGTJOVUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0029324300#wasThisHelpful","R25AMPSGTJOVUJ","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An excellent combination of analysis, narrative, and revealing anecdote, this book is essential for understanding for the state of many American cities and of the fraught relationships between white and black Americans.  At the end of WWII, Detroit was a dynamic industrial center.  Emerging from the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, Detroit today is the epitome of post-industrial failure and is, to a considerable extent, an enormous ghetto populated by immiserated African-Americans.  Sugrue traces the downfall of Detroit, starting in the late 1940s, and emphasizing the synergistic effects of several negative factors on African-American Detroiters.  While African-Americans benefited considerably from the re-energization of the American economy during WWII, and anticipated continued progress in the post-WWII period, they entered the late 40s in highly disadvantaged positions.  Both residential and occupational segregation worked to the considerable disadvantage of African-Americans. A combination of formal, considerable bias in Federal mortgage support, and informal, frank racial prejudice on the part of employers and working class whites, restricted the opportunities of African-Americans.  Sugrue then points to a third crucial factor, the early de-industrialization of Detroit.  In a harbinger of things to come, the major auto firms began to automate to shed workers and also moved plants to areas with lower labor costs and less potential for aggressive unionization - particularly smaller cities in Ohio and Indiana, and the South.  African-American workers were hit particularly hard by these job losses, and suffered disproportionately as shrinking work opportunities restricted entry level jobs. Whites, with greater labor mobility, suffered considerably less.  Sugrue also shows the depth and dynamics of residential segregation particularly well.  White resistance to integration was a combination of overtly racist politics and frequent physical violence, explaining much of the subsequent bitterness of politics in Detroit.  The ultimate result was a self-reinforcing downward spiral, which while probably not inevitable, was likely hard to derail.  Two aspects of Sugrue's analysis are particularly noteworthy.  The first, mentioned above, is his identification of early de-industrialization.  The second is his recurrent point that to a considerable extent, this was an intramural conflict between different components of the New Deal coalition in which race trumped class.  Quite well written, this book is notable for Sugrue's smooth integration (no pun intended) of quantitative data, narrative, and telling individual stories.  His combination of primary archival research and analysis of prior secondary literature is excellent.  This edition contains a concise and thoughtful Preface that brings the story up to the recent bankrupcy and traces the continued effects of processes occurring decades earlier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4M0WV0FQPXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691162557#wasThisHelpful","R1H4M0WV0FQPXP","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting set of essays, presented originally as the Sather lectures in the early 1960s.  Momigliano explores how the work of classical historians like Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus, and others became the foundation of modern historical writing.  In particular, he credits Greek intellectuals with developing the critical approach that characterizes our conception of historical writing.  These essays deal mainly with nature of the work of classical historians, including the originator of Church history, Eusebius.  By his own admission, Momigliano doesn't really deal with why these Classical writers became so influential in early modern Europe.  A number of interesting aspects are discussed.  Herodotus as the founder of a tradition that included ethnography and a broader perspective on the past, Thucydides as the exemplar of what came to be in many ways the standard of political-military history, and the Romans as the originators of national histories.  These essays contain a good deal of insightful commentary and feature Momigliano's impressive erudition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXM5XVHAD2I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520078705#wasThisHelpful","RDXM5XVHAD2I0","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A really impressive work of scholarship from a leading expert on 17th century thought.  This is the first of a planned series of 5 volumes describing the emergence of modern scientific culture.  Gaukroger's goal is to understand how the Western natural scientific approach became the paradigmatic way of understanding the world, a decisive break with all prior forms of human approaches to understanding the world.  In this detailed volume, Gaukroger lays out the crucial intellectual developments that led to the emergence of modern scientific culture in 17th century Europe.  In particular, Gaukroger seeks to understand how this nascent approach developed and became legitimized.  It was not, he stresses, because it necessarily produces more useful technologies (though it would eventually).  Gaukroger argues that it developed as part of efforts to support Christian theology.  Looking back to medieval theology, and even farther back to Patristic and Classical thought, Gaurkroger argues that the Thomistic-Aristotelian synthesis encountered considerable difficulties in early modern Europe and ultimately became unsatisfactory as a prop for Christianity.  The Neoplatonically inspired competitor of Augustinian thought was also unsatisfactory and the increasing awareness of and interest in other Classical schools of thought such as Stoicism and Epicurianism fed considerable intellectual ferment.  These complex interactions began to incorporate other influences, such as a nascent experimental tradition and increased emphasis on quantification.  Emerging from these many complex interactions towards the end of 17th century was the precursor of modern science, including a whole new conception of the role of an active investigator.  In the long run, these processes would drive considerable challenges to religion but in the period discussed, religious motivations were a key to legitimizing this new approach to the world.Written primarily for other scholars, this is not an easy book to read.  Gaukroger is a clear writer but is discussing at a high level a lot of fairly abstruse early modern and premodern thought which will be unfamiliar to many readers.  Its worth persevering with reading this book because of the impressive depth of the analysis.  There is, however, a bit of losing the forest for the trees quality.  Because of his detailed analysis of many thinkers and their work, its easy to lose sight of the basic pattern of Gaukroger's argument.  I recommend reading his concise Conclusion section at the end first and then going on with the rest of the book.This is very much ""internal"" intellectual history and broader events only rarely make their appearance.  I'm not sure that the word Reformation is ever used, even though many of the thinkers discussed were embedded in the intellectual context of the Reformation.  A broader point that might be extracted from this work are the important roles of contingent events.  It appears that the Thomistic-Aristotelian synthesis had the power that it did in part because Platonic thought came to Europe later than Aristotelian thought.  Similarly, this book might be considered as evidence of the importance of intellectual conflict and interactions in European history - conflict between features of Christianity and the Classical heritage, and conflict between Aristotle and Plato.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6D81TO3AEED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199550018#wasThisHelpful","R1S6D81TO3AEED","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A generally strong and well presented history of slavery in the American South from 1783 to the outbreak of the Civil War and with a short coda on subsequent events.  This is a very ambitious book using a combination of original research and the extensive secondary literature on this topic.  Baptist's aim is to delineate the major features of American slavery, provide a narrative of its evolution over this period, and to address how it fits into the larger frame of American, and indeed, world history.  At the same time, he wants to give readers a more vivid impression of the actual experience of slavery.  The result is a combination of some reasonably quantititive analysis, narrative, and individual vignettes.  For the latter, Baptist draws on 19th century memoirs and accounts compiled by the WPA in the 1930s.  While generally following a chronologic sequence, each chapter explores a different thematic aspect of Southern slavery using a combination of analysis and anecdotes.  This is largely quite successful, as Baptist's analyses are often illuminating and the anecdotes are quite telling.  Baptist describes the many of the major features of American slavery very well.  The great importance of American slavery in the development of the US and emerging world industrial economy, the enormous domestic slave trade, the crucial role of slavery in the American political system, the brutality of the plantation regime (which Baptist unconventionally but accurately calls slave labor camps), and the nature of African-American resistance.Knowledgeable readers of American history will recognize much of Baptist's narrative and analysis from other works.  With some exceptions, a good deal of what he describes has been discussed in other work.  One of the virtues of this book is that he has synthesized a great deal of prior scholarship into a more coherent whole.  There is more, however, here than a synthesis of prior scholarship.  Some of his analysis, notably the discussion of slave productivity in cotton production and the nature of financing slavery expansion prior to the mid-1830s crash, strike me as relatively novel.There are some potential defects.  Its possible that Baptist has under-emphasized some points.  For example, he regards Southern arguments about expansion being necessary to diffuse slavery and reduce its impact as window dressing.  Perhaps, but it may be that many Southerners wished to avoid concentration of slaves in the Deep South because of fears of a Haitian type of slave insurrection.  He discusses that the drive for slavery expansion was prompted in part by Southern desire for additional slave states that could contribute to Southern power in Congress, which is certainly correct. Baptist doesn't mention, however, William Freehling's argument that the erosion of slavery in the Upper South was driving Southern insecurity and fears of border states becoming like Northern states.  An arguably bigger defect is Baptist's style.  Baptist is generally a clear writer but employs a self-consciously literary device; he uses Ralph Ellison's image of ""...American life as a drama enacted on the body of a giant Negro..."" to organize the book.  Individual chapters are titled, Heart, Feet, Heads, etc.  This works reasonably well but Baptist sometimes extends the metaphor too far, resulting in some fairly purple prose.  This is a matter of taste, but in my opinion, literary devices tend to obscure understanding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LQTEDPO9HZ1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=046500296X#wasThisHelpful","R1LQTEDPO9HZ1G","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A well written and somewhat polemical overview of the nature of empires.  Parsons, an expert on the British Empire, appears to have been motivated to write this book by disgust with the attempts of some intellectuals and pundits to justify our disastrous decision to invade Iraq by offering highly misleading versions of the benefits of imperialism In this book, Parsons presents a series of counter-examples by reviewing the histories of several imperial adventures.  Parsons' counter-examples include Roman Britain, Umayyad Spain, Spanish Peru, British India, Napoleonic Italy, British Kenya, and German occupied France.  Basic features of the imperial experience are conquest, subjugation, and exploitation.  Dependence of the imperial powers on local elites for governance, corruption of the imperial powers, and local resistance contributing to ultimate failure of the imperial power are recurring themes. All of this is quite different from the rosy picture of ""liberal imperialism,"" which is usually exploitation disguised as a civilizing mission, described by Bush II apologists.  Parsons finishes with a short chapter describing our experience in Iraq which he shows exhibits all the negative features of imperial adventures, with the added dimension that the Bush administration was particularly incompetent as a pseudo-imperial power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1413XTDFYKHSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195304314#wasThisHelpful","R1413XTDFYKHSS","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This concise book is a useful and surprisingly pertinent narrative of efforts by Anglo-American thinkers to develop an ethics based on evolutionary biology.  Farber begins with Darwin himself, who was primarily concerned with what we would now call the meta-ethical issue of whether human morality as a phenomenon could be reconciled with natural selection.  Farber then proceeds to the very influential Herbert Spencer who attempted to erect an actual ethical system on the base of his own, rather teleological and Lamarckian, version of evolution.  The efforts of Spencer and other Victorian thinkers who attempted to build evolutionary ethical systems to fill the void left by declines in religious authority were met with sharp and devastating criticism from several quarters, including prominent biologists like Huxley and Wallace.  Professional philosophers like Henry Sidgwick and TH Green, though coming from very different philosophical perspectives, offered particularly trenchant criticisms.  None of the evolutionary ethical formulations, for example, were able to escape the is/ought problem posed by Hume.  As Farber shows, efforts at evolutionary ethics continued among biologists and popularizers in the US and Britain, and continued to exhibit many of the same defects.  These efforts received a boost with the great success of the Modern Synthesis of evolutionary theory in the mid-20th century and elicited much the same kind of critical reaction from critical biologists and philosophers.  In his concluding chapters, Farber offers a sympathetic but critical discussion of the sociobiology controversy provoked by EO Wilson's famous book, which has similar features.  As Farber remarks, its as if no one has been aware of the prior discussion dating back to the second half of the 19th century.  The pertinent part of this book is that we're now seeing virtually identical discussions with some scientists and popularizers putting forth fairly naive arguments about ""evolutionary psychology"" and neuroscience as bases for ethics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26LBFL6IO874Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0520213696#wasThisHelpful","R26LBFL6IO874Q","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An interesting effort combining historical analysis and political theory, aimed at defending or perhaps modernizing the concept of equality.  The author is a well known French historian and political theorist.  I suspect this book is an effort to produce a shorter, more popular account of a larger body of work.  Rosanvallon opens with a short description of the concept of equality in the French and American Revolutions.  Rosanvallon argues well that equality was an important goal of both revolutions.  This was rooted in the Enlightenment attack on privilege and in Rosanvallon's analysis, aimed at producing a society of ""similars,"" characterized by individual autonomy and citizenship.  In this construct, market relations were crucial to undermining established privilege and producing a society in which individuals could interact on a more or less equal footing.  I was initially skeptical about some of Rosanvallon's analysis of Enlightenment equalitarianism but this book was favorably reviewed by a real expert on this topic, Gordon Wood, in the American Historical Review.  This interesting section is followed by 3 chapters on the historical evolution of equality.  Rosanvallon sees the Enlightenment-Revolutionary emphasis on and concepts of equality as undermined by the emergence of industrial capitalism (Rosanvallon uses the term capitalism) which led to novel forms of inequality.  In turn, this leads to what he terms of pathologies of equality; ideologies that attempted to use different aspects of the concept of equality to either justify (classical liberalism) or attack (Marxism) or defend (nationalism and economic protectionism) the inequalities of industrial society.  At the end of 19th century, there is at least partial success with attempts to restore important aspects of equality via progressive taxation, social insurance, and unionization.  These efforts are promoted, at least in Europe, by some of the traumatic events of the 20th century, notably the 2 world wars and the Great Depression.  The next chapter deals with the more recent neo-liberal erosion of equality.  I found this section to be the least satisfactory in terms of analysis. Towards the end of this chapter, Rosanvallon takes on what is probably his real target, the need for a new adequate theory of equality that updates the Enlightenment-Revolutionary concept and restores equality to its central position.  This analysis includes a critique of theories of equality like those developed by the American philosopher Ronald Dworkin.  Rosanvallon suggests, in particular, that existing ideas about equality don't take into account the importance of individuals developing their own unique capacities.  In a complement to the Enlightenment-Revolutionary concept, he suggests that the 3 pillars of equality should be ""singularity, reciprocity, and commonality.""  What does this mean in practical terms?  Rosanvallon is pretty vague, and while he states in the opening of the book that there is no going back to the older welfare state, I suspect this means the return of aggressively progressive taxation and more investment in the social safety net, important features of the welfare state.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UOO5E166WY6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674724593#wasThisHelpful","R2UOO5E166WY6J","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very good and mildly polemical overview of the Enlightenment.  In this well written book, Pagden emphasizes the Enlightenment pursuit of a ""science of man"" and its ethical, political, and social implication.  Major themes include the skepticism towards dogma, irreligion, naturalism, emulation of the methods of the natural sciences, and increasing emphasis on both the autonomy and power of human capacities.  Pagden uses a combined historical and thematic approach,  In initial chapters he defines the features of the Enlightenment and outlines its historical origins in the Reformation, the collapse of religious consensus in Europe, the destruction of the Aristotleian-Thomistic synthesis, and the emergence of modern science in the 17th century.  This is followed by a series of thematic chapters discussing moral psychology, ecularism, the unity of humanity, ethics, political theory, and other aspects of 18th Enlightenment thought.  A key concept for Pagden is cosmopolitanism, the recognition of universal human nature coupled with a healthy respect for many important varying aspects of human behavior and social organization.  Driven by intrinsic human sociability, cosmopolitanism involves the recognition of fundamental human equality, universal human rights, broad tolerance, and a liberal political order.  While Pagden defends many aspects of Enlightenment thought, he is not shy about criticizing failings of many important figures, such as Kant's notorious misogyny.  In the final chapter, Pagden offers a useful defense of the Enlightenment against some modern critics.There is an important aspect that Pagden may have omitted.  In some ways, this is a fairly traditional account with Pagden focusing on philosophers and literary figures, though the work of the great biologist Buffon is discussed.  Advances in 18th century science and some advances in technology should be considered an important aspect of the Enlightenment, and may well have played an important role in sustaining the credibility and power of the movement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMS17TF77F8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400060680#wasThisHelpful","R1VMS17TF77F8H","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A well written narrative and analysis of how the US and Canadian health care systems diverged in the 1960s.  Maioni points out the considerable similarities between the US and Canada in health care delivery and overall social structure up through the 1930s.  Why then were divergent paths pursued?  Maioni focuses on a set of structural features and at least one major contingent process.  The structural features are differences in political systems, notably the parliamentary system and relatively stronger degree of federalism in Canada.  These features favored the development of strong regional and third parties, with the consequent emergence of a viable social democratic party supported strongly by the Canadian labor movement.  Unlike the USA, where the Federal government was the most dynamic actor responding the crisis of the Great Depression, the Canadian Federal government was relatively inert during the 1930s, and emerging from WWII, there was considerable pressure across the political spectrum to pursue social welfare reforms.  With the social democratic CCF-NDP pulling the debate to the left and with the Canadian parliamentary system less susceptible to legislative lobbying, national health insurance emerged as a Canadian institution.  In the US, the labor movement and other advocates of more sweeping reform had to function within the broad coalition of the Democratic Party, which significantly constrained achievable goals, and led to the more limited implementation of Medicare and Medicaid.This book is interesting in the context of the recent experience of the Affordable Care Act, which appears in many ways to be a continuation of prior reform efforts focused on plugging gaps rather than any systemic reform.  Maioni's work also raises the old question of why the USA never developed a viable social democratic party or stronger reform movements within the Democratic Party?  There have been a number of answers to this question.  Many of these explanations point to long term trends in American life, others, like the historical analysis of Eric Rauchway, look to the experience of 19th century industrialization.  A very strong analysis by Ira Katznelson in his book Fear Itself points to more recent phenomena, specifically the constraining effects of Southern Democratic politicians committed to maintaining the racial and economic structure of the Jim Crow South.Finally, its been almost 50 years since the USA and Canada parted company in health policy, a long enough period to make some reasonable judgments about the outcomes.  It appears that the Canadians, overall, made the better choice.  Canada spends considerably less on health care, gets at least approximately equivalent aggregate results, avoids the deplorable consequences of inadequate access to care that is common in the USA, and probably gets an additional benefit in terms of a greater sense of social solidarity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZTD2G99VKKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691057966#wasThisHelpful","RSZTD2G99VKKO","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The next section deals with the 3 major components of ecological speciation; divergent selection, reproductive isolation, and genetic mechanisms linking these two.  The last section of the book discusses several important unresolved issues including the relationships between geography and speciation, genomics, and speciation, and the nature of the speciation continuum in relationship to ecological speciation.  Nosil identifies areas for future research.

"This very well written and exhaustively researched book is a first-rate narrative and analysis of the development of our modern economy.  Beckert focuses on what was arguably the most important industry in the genesis of the modern world economy - cotton textiles.  Because of the global distribution of suitable cotton species, cotton domestication and use was widespread in the pre-modern world.  The great majority of cotton production was handicraft production for local or at best regional consumption.  Over time, signficant proto-industrialization related to production of cotton yarn and cloth emerged in several regions with suitable climatic conditions, notably the Indian subcontinent and China.  As Beckert points out, Europe was something of an exception because of inadequate climactic conditions for cotton cultivation.  In the early modern period, however, expanding European-based international trade and prior proto-industrialization of cloth production for other fibers brought increasing amounts of cotton yarn and cloth production to Europe.The expanding cotton industry in Europe was based squarely on considerable success of European expansion and imperialism.  The ability of Europeans to insert themselves violently into the traditional trade networks of Asia, the acquisition of the ""ghost acres"" of the western hemisphere, and access to servile labor from Africa made possible the great expansion of cotton manufacturing.  This introduces one of Beckert's main themes.  This form of economic expansion was made possible the emergent powers of European states.  Beckert stresses repeatedly the importance of state backing and power in the European economic expansion, particularly the expropriation of the western hemisphere from its native peoples and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  Beckert terms this combination of expanding mercantile activity supported by the state ""war capitalism.""  A major theme of this book is the recurrent importance of state support for early modern, 19th century, and modern capitalism.  This interpretation is opposed to the common view of the emergence of capitalism as based on relatively non-interventionist states.  To the extent that cotton industrialization is typical of capitalist development over the last few centuries, and it certainly is, Beckert's interpretation is very well supported.This form of war capitalism then intersects with the emerging industrialization in Britain to create the beginnings of the modern industrial economy.  This cotton complex is based on aggressive imperialism-colonialism to produce cheap fiber, reorganization of labor in the form of early factories in Britain, and the increasing articulation of a sophisticated global system of transport and credit.  Beckert stresses the importance of state support in all these features.  The key role of the US South is stressed.  By the mid-19th century, American producers dominate cotton fiber production, forming the base for the most important European industry.  The US Civil War then precipitated a global economic crisis.  The loss of American cotton production and the end of American slavery resulted in wholesale economic changes.These changes are partly responsible for the transition from war capitalism to what Beckert terms ""industrial capitalism.""  The abandonment of slave labor, increasing mechanization in Europe, and formation of the modern working class are features of this transition.  Beckert produces a particularly interesting analysis of the international correlates of this process.  Again, with strong state support, there was a wholesale transformation of the countryside in many regions, India being a notable example, with the destruction of traditional peasantry and household production and its replacement by cash crops and rural consumers of factory goods.  Beckert shows the often negative consequences, particularly the loss of food security that accompanied this process.But, this process contained some of the seeds of its own destruction.  Proletarianization in Europe was followed by the development of labor movements and increasingly democratic societies.  This eventually results in rising labor costs and movement of factories to the low labor cost zones.  With some state support, Japanese industrialization being an excellent example, non-European states or proto-states (India) develop their own cotton industries.  Again, state support is a key to this process of the spread of industrialization.  In an ironic way, this is true even of the industrialization fostered by Communist states such as the Soviet Union and China, whose policies mirrored many aspects of the colonial transformation of the countryside in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Beckert concludes with an interesting commentary on more recent developments in the post-WWII era.  He makes the interesting point that the spread of global capitalism, with its relatively uniform legal and financial systems, allows large firms a certain amount of freedom from the state.As mentioned above, this is a very well written book and the depth of research is impressive.  Beckert's general interpretations are supported well and he has many shrewd observations about aspects of this process.  The bibliography is excellent.  There are a couple of minor points where Beckert is, I think, a bit off target.  He correctly stresses the role of aggressive imperialism in acquiring the lands needed for cotton cultivation in the western hemisphere.  He never mentions, however, that the European dominance of the Americas was a windfall made possible by the epidemiologic isolation of Native American peoples.  Partly because he is focused on the economics of cotton textiles and the development of modern capitalism, I think he underestimates the at least semi-independent role played by the western scientific tradition in the emergence of industrialization.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TK582NVT90H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375414142#wasThisHelpful","R6TK582NVT90H","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This very thorough book is an effort to describe the considerable crimes that were part of the Spanish Civil War.  Readers should be aware that this is not a general history of the Civil War but focused on politically-ideologically motivated killings during and after the war.  Preston is drawing on a large volume of scholarship, mainly from Spanish scholars, that accumulated over the past generation.  As can be seen from some of the comments posted about this book, this remains a controversial topic.  Preston attempts to present, and I think is largely successful in this respect, a fair account.  The book is organized in a mixed chronological-thematic structure.  He deals initially with some of the background of the Civil War, particularly the eliminationalist rhetoric and tendencies of the Spanish military and right.  His basic position is that this somewhat heterogeneous group was all unified in believing themselves in engaged in an existensial struggle with a Marxist-Jewish-Masonic international conspiracy aimed at exterminating traditional Spanish society.  This section is followed by a thorough account of the atrocities perpetuated by the military rebels and their numerous allies, which Preston presents as attempt to purge Spanish society of undesirable elements.  The latter often included members of leftist parties, Freemasons, political and economic rivals, unionists, Basque and Catalan nationalists, and even Protestant clergy.  Preston emphasizes the linkage between the brutal colonialism and counter-insurgency tactics practiced by the Spanish army in Morocco and their behavior in Spain.  These sections are followed by thorough accounts of the crimes committed by leftists, mainly but not exclusively by Anarcho-Syndicalist militias, in regions where the military revolt failed.  The narratives of events in Catalonia and Madrid, presumably because of good documentation, are especially systematic.  These have some clear analogies with the actions of Franco's troops and their allies.  The remainder of the book alternates similarly between events in rebel controlled areas and the shrinking portions of Spain in the Republican zone.  Each military conquest by Franco's troops was accompanied by new purges.  Preston describes aspects of the diminishing civil violence in the Republican zone as more moderate elements of the governing coalition asserted control (often with Communist-Soviet assistance), the civil war within the civil war between the radical and more moderate left in the Republican zone, and the Communist-Soviet campaign against the dissident communists.  Some episodes, such as the notorious mass execution of Spanish Army officers in Madrid, are discussed in great detail.  Preston concludes with an extensive discussion of the brutal post-war repression, including the Franco government's considerable collaboration with the Nazis.Preston has a clear interpretation of events and draws distinctions between the Francoist and Republican sides.  One major distinction is quantitative.  Older literature suggested parity between the Francoist and Republican sides in terms of these types of atrocities. See, for example, the concluding section of Stanley Payne's thoughtful book, The Franco Regime.  Preston points to recent estimates that the ratio of these types atrocities committed by the rebels and Republican elements is closer to 3 or 4 to 1.  Perhaps more important is Preston's argument that these types of crimes were deliberately encouraged by the leaders of the rebellion, sometimes with the explicit support of the Spanish Catholic hierarchy.  On the Republican side, the rebellion resulted in a collapse  of public order that allowed far left militias, usually Anarcho-Syndicalists, to carry out analogous purges.  Preston demonstrates that more moderate elements of the Republican coalition worked hard to restrain violence and impose public order, including a functioning judiciary.Overall, I think Preston's interpretation is a generally fair assessment.  There are some aspects, however, which are arguable.  Preston refers to the far leftist crimes as ""spontaneous"" which is correct in the sense that they would not have occurred without the collapse of order that followed the revolt.  Many aspects of the behavior the leftist militias in their efforts to purge the areas under their control were similar to the actions of the right wing death squads, to which Preston attributes strong elements of premeditation.  While Preston writes quite a bit about the eliminationist ideology of the Spanish right, he never discusses what must have been analogous ideology of the Spanish far Left.  In the opening sections, while Preston does mention the ""irresponsibility"" of some of the leadership of the Spanish Left, he puts the blame for the Civil War squarely on the shoulders of the Spanish Right.  Readers should know, however, that this impression isn't shared by all scholars in this field.  Stanley Payne, for example, has argued strenuously that the Spanish Left deserves blame for the Civil War.  My impression is that Preston's assessment is considerably closer to the mark than Payne's interpretation but I don't think he is completely on target.There are some defects in terms of construction of the book.  As is commonly the case, Preston primarily uses narrative.  There are some useful charts of atrocities, but they are at the back of the book and should be featured earlier.  Similarly, there are some useful maps placed at the back which should have been featured in the relevant narrative sections.  This could easily and arguably should have been a shorter book featuring a combination of the quantitative data with selected narrative examples.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243YYXMGVWDTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393345912#wasThisHelpful","R243YYXMGVWDTY","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is somewhat impassioned, if not to say angry, book.  Gotzsche is a well known clinical reseacher with considerable experience in large scale analyses of therapeutic interventions.  In this book, Gotzsche documents many of the serious misdeeds committed by the pharmaceutical industry, often abetted by inadequate regulation by governments and considerable complicity on the part of many physicians.  Many of Gotzsche's points, including serious problems with the construction and analysis of clinical trials, inadequate surveillance of drug complications, conflicts of interest, and generally poor regulation, are unimpeachable.  It makes no sense, for example, to allow new trials of ""me too"" compounds solely against placebos.  That said, the quality of this book is somewhat uneven.  Many parts, particularly those where Gotzsche can draw on his considerable research experience, are solid.  Other parts betray a lack of in depth knowledge.  I suspect this book was written rather quickly, as there are some careless errors.  Gotzsche some a number of suggestions for reform, which vary from the unlikely, such as eliminating for profit companies, to a number of sensible regulatory changes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HKGYHWF848LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846198844#wasThisHelpful","R1HKGYHWF848LF","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book is an extension of an essay published by the authors sketching out a future where nothing is done about global warming.  The authors use the fictional device of a historical overview written by a scholar some centuries from now.  This future history features some of the pessimistic but quite plausible outcomes including massive sea level rise, a bit of a Venus effect due to some unexpected feedbacks, and collapse of civilization.  Oreskes and Conway also provide some analysis of why we've had no response to the overwhelming evidence for global warming and parallel environmental problems, pointing particularly to neo-liberal ideology and political systems highly susceptible to lobbying from powerful industrial interests.  This is generally well done and fairly imaginative.  A false note is the authors' excessive focus on scientists' use of conventional statistical thresholds.  This is a real but relatively minor issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WNX47CWTD0T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=023116954X#wasThisHelpful","R2WNX47CWTD0T7","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is either too short or too long.  Tooze has set himself the ambitious goal of describing and analyzing the major changes in the world order that occurred during and after WWI.  The basic theme is the emergence of the USA as a hegemonic world power and its reluctance to fully participate in that role.  About 2/3s to 3/4s of this book cover the period from the middle of WWI to the early 20s with the remainder of the book devoted to selected important aspects of the 20s and the outbreak of the Great Depression and its impact.  To really do justice to this topic, however, Tooze would have had to devote as much text to the 20s and onset of the Great Depression as he does to WWI and its immediate aftermath.  A more coherent alternative would have been to end this book with the Dawes plan revision of the Versailles settlement.Tooze does very well in describing the dynamics of the American entry and the complex power politics around the globe.  He does very well in trying to provide a global perspective by discussing events in the USA, Russia, and China.  Many of these sections are excellent.  Tooze does particularly well with the financing of the war, complex events in Eastern Europe and the Brest-Litovsk process, the role of Japan, and features of post-war events, such as the deflation induced by the USA. In general, Tooze provides a nice analysis of how the USA supplanted the European powers as the major world power and the complexities of Wilson's diplomacy.  Its fair to remark, however, that little of Tooze's analysis is actually novel.  Much of what he describes is well known to scholars in this area and likely to knowledgeable readers as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBHH9QHB0GKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670024929#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBHH9QHB0GKN","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This relatively short and very well written book is an interesting history of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) responsible for the impressive cemetaries and memorials for Commonwealth soldiers in the afternath of WWI.  The book is built around the work of its guiding force, Sir Fabian Ware.  A successful journalist, educator, and colonial administrator in the pre-war period, Ware was an acolyte of the ""Liberal Imperialist"" and one-time proconsul of South Africa Afred Milner.  Ware developed the IWGC as a vehicle for Imperial solidarity and a certain type of democratic idealism.  As Crane points out, Ware pursued his objectives with what amounted to a sense of religious mission, a partial reflection of his upbringing in the Plymouth Brethen.  An unusually diligent and effective administrator, Ware was also a skillful bureaucratic politician whose connections in the British establishment provided him with the allies to out-manuever rivals and achieve what were sometimes controversial goals.  Ware was able to recruit an unusually talented group of architects, landscape designers, and other subordinates to to provide dignified and often quite beautiful burials and memorials for hundreds of thousands of casualties in locations around the globe.  While Ware's artists were a rather contentious team, they were also quite talented and shared a joint background in the Arts and Crafts movement.Crane does very well  in describing the essential features of the evolution of the IWGC, its relatively complex history, and its major achievements.  While this book is not profusely illustrated, enough good images are provided to give a good idea of the success of the IWGC.  Parts of this book also provide real insight into the enormous impact of WWI on British society and give some moving examples of the tragedies that affected so many British families.  Crane provides a nice analysis of Ware's personality and the relationship of his goals to pre-war liberal imperialism.  A point that Crane may overlook is that the Empire was under considerable strain in the aftermath of the war and the success of the IWGC should be seen against the background of the centripetal forces challenging the structure of the Empire.  Crane points to Ware's zeal as being to some extent a form of displaced religious commitment, which may be a feature of the way dissenting Protestantism spilled over into other aspects of British life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYY02I947MOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CR40OKI#wasThisHelpful","REYY02I947MOJ","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is primarily a narrative of the Thirty Years War with a significant analytic component.  The depth and breadth of scholarship are really impressive.  Wilson offers a detailed narrative of the complex military and political history of the Thirty Years War accompanied by analyses of the major underlying structural features of the war and even some historiographic analysis.  The comprehensive narrative of the Thirty Years War is complemented by appropriate narratives of important related and parallel phenomena such as the Spanish-Dutch conflicts, the Franco-Spanish conflicts, the Swedish attempts to dominate the Baltic, and even some information about the Ottomans.  Wilson focuses, however, on the Holy Roman Empire, especially its German component, and events within the Empire.  A relatively distinctive feature of this book is Wilson's emphasis on the constitutional structure of the Empire and the way it channeled or failed to channel conflcts in the years leading up to the outbreak of war, and the ways in which the traditional constitutional strucure contained to frame efforts to contain conflicts during the war, and set some of the structure of the eventual peace settlements.The constitutional structure of the Empire is shown to be particularly important in the outbreak of the war.  As with almost all important historical phenomena, there is a complex set of causes, incluidng confessional differences, dynastic concerns, and economic considerations.  The inability of the Empire's structure to resolve ambiguities inherent in the Peace of Augsburg coupled with Rudolf II's personal inadequacies as Emperor and inability to use the Imperial system competently, contributed significanlty to the ourbreak of the war.  There is also a particularly good discussion of the nature and consequences of the final settlement at Westphalia.Wilson's narrative sections are generally excellent.  These are clearly written and he makes considerable efforts to complement the narratives by discussing them in larger European context and with some critical analysis of prior work. The publisher has, as usual, skimped on maps, which is an obstacle to following much of the detailed narrative.  The endnotes, on the other hand, are excellent, though a separate bibliography would have been very useful  While the detailed narrative sections are a real strengh of the book, the narrative sometimes tend to be overpowering.  Wilson, probably unavoidably, does some cross-cutting between chapters, which also complicates the narrative.  An overview section laying out some basic periodization of the war and major themes might have been helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPM12U368YYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674062310#wasThisHelpful","R3PPM12U368YYX","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well written and illustrated book is aimed at presenting the history of geology to a broad audience.  Martin Rudwick is a leading scholar in this area and this book contains concise summaries of his outstanding work.  Rudwick provides a nice narrative of how the great sweep of geologic time was discovered and how sequence of Earth's history was reconstructed.  This is very much the story of the gradual accumulation of understanding over a period of centuries by an increasingly active and diverse scientific community.  Rudwick's major theme is the historical character of this reconstruction; not merely the expression of underlying, universal laws, but the existence of dynamic and contingent events leading to a unique trajectory.  Rudwick emphasizes the important role of historical investigations in early modern Europe as a model for geological inquiry and how the Christian tradition ""pre-adapted"" (exapted would be the more accurate term) European intellectuals to historical-progressive narratives.  Another major theme is Rudwick's persistent criticism of the naive and highly inaccurate model of scientific progression as an opposition between science and relilgion.  Indeed, he shows the close relationship between some aspects of religious scholarship and motivations and the history of geology.Rudwick opens with an interesting description of the efforts of early modern European scholars to construct chronologies of world history and how developments in historical scholarship and textual criticism, including biblical criticism, became a model for explorations of geologic history.  This is followed by the emergence of modern geology in the 18th and early 19th centuries, a story told superbly in his magisterial books, Bursting the Limits of Time and Worlds Before Adam.  Subsequent chapters deal with the development of geochronology, plate tectonics, the early history of life, and the modern understanding of the importance of catastrophic events.  The incremental character of the accumulation of geologic knowledge (in opposition to the popular and facile application of Kuhn's theories to plate tectonics) and essentially historical-contingent character of Earth's past are the major themes.  Rudwick concludes with a short and effective section on young Earth creationism, emphasizing its scientific inadequacy, relatively shallow historical roots, and theological shortcomings.The fine narrative is complemented with nicely chosen illustrations (a feature of all Rudwick's books) and good recommendations for further reading.  One minor deficiency stems from Rudwick's discussions of the relationship of religious belief to geologic research.  Overall, this is a strong feature of this book but Rudwick, perhaps in an effort to reassure theistically inclined readers, is excessively harsh towards contemporary atheists, whom he derides as dogmatic and tends to lump with fundamentalists, an unfair criticism of the intellectual strength of contemporary atheism.  Some of Rudwick's statements about 19th century Darwinism and its relationship to atheism are arguably inaccurate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18C4YOIP6WTU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022620393X#wasThisHelpful","R18C4YOIP6WTU3","A2UIXU97JYCPZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UIXU97JYCPZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was introduced to Magnesium several months ago. Not knowing anything about the benefits of it I set out to test it on my chronic aches and pains. I went through an entire bottle and concluded that Magnesium Oil does work to relieve those stressed out muscles and the chronic aches and pains associated with things like arthritis. How it worked was what I didn't know but set out to find the answer.First thing I discovered was that magnesium oil isn't actually an oil. It is magnesium chloride suspended in water. The mixture between the highly concentrated element and water happens to give it an oily feel. Magnesium oil has tremendous absorption properties and acts as a humectant that keeps the skin hydrated and flexible.Magnum Solace's Magnesium Oil is very effective in helping with several common skin and health ailments: - Helps manage pain- Combats fatigue- Relieves muscle cramps- Relieves symptoms of Fibromyalgia- Reduces inflammation - Speeds up recovery time from sports injuries- Benefits the hair and scalp by opening up clogged hair follicles and encouraging new hair growth- Helps control dandruff- Increases bone density- Helps in teeth formation- Helps the body absorb nutrients- Soothes the dry, itchy skin associated with Eczema and Psoriasis - Helps with the symptoms of Osteoporosis- Helps with the pain and inflammation associated with arthritisMassaging into or spraying directly on the skin is the most effective and quickest way to transfer magnesium chloride into the tissues and cells. Just 3-5 sprays is normally sufficient enough to provide relief from pain and inflammation and increase blood circulation to the treated area. It is also makes a great bath soak when added to warm bath water. It doesn't matter where on the body Magnesium Oil is applied, it goes directly to the bloodstream and is carried where the body needs it most. Magnesium is a mineral that the body needs, and it can be taken in supplement form or applied directly to the skin.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this Magnesium oil works to soothe aches and pains. It works quickly, and I especially love using it as a bath and/or foot soak or both. It is very soothing to tense muscles and is great for unwinding after a long day. I have never experienced any uncomfortable side effects of applying this directly to my skin or by soaking in a tub with it. It does make the skin feel alive and tingly, but I didn't find it itchy.I ordered this product for little to no cost for the express purpose of testing and evaluating it.

That means trying on those clothes again to be sure they still fit, especially the outerwear, coats and jackets. Inevitably some things have to be replaced, some handed down. With kids you almost always have to replace their coats every year.

You have to label everything kids have nowadays, especially if they go to school with them. This just makes labeling easier. I also love the easy care instructions letting me toss it in the washer and dryer and it doesn't need ironing. The no ironing is a BIG plus.This is a very nice and comfy polar fleece jacket.

"Luseta Macadamia Hair Oil Treatment Macadamia trees grow at a height of 30 to 40 feet and thrive the best in full sun, although partial shade is tolerated in the hotter climates. They grow in a wide range of soils but prefer rich soil with balanced a pH. Macadamias do not tolerate high salt concentrations in the soil or water. The bark is rough-textured and is dark reddish-brown in color. The oil is extracted from the macadamia nut and is used in shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers and cosmetics and presents in an amber-colored liquid. The oil is very amenable for use in cosmetics and personal products.Macadamia Nut Oil is versatile, rancid-resistant and non-greasy oil and is very beneficial for things like:- Strengthening dry, damaged hair- Conditioning dry, rough skin - Use as a carrier oilWhile I am suffering from a temporary scarcity of hair, I have been using this as an overnight scalp treatment. I am spending these bereft of hair moments as a time to condition my scalp and make it a very healthy environment for my hair to regrow in. I am working to give myself the best chance of regrowing a big, full, healthy head of hair. Those with hair may want to use this Macadamia Oil a hot oil treatment (like this recipe listed below), or as a part of their normal healthy hair routine. If you have extra dry hair you may want to apply on freshly towel-dried hair and use as a leave-in treatment. For my normally fine, thin hair, I condition only from the back of my hair to the tips, not the top. I use hot oil treatments once a month to maintain my normal hair. I'm cautious about leave-in conditioners because my normal hair is susceptible to being easily weighed down. For those with heavier hair, weighing down the hair should not be a problem. For my normal hair routine, I use a few drops of this macadamia oil added to my shampoo and conditioner because this oil revitalizes my hair and gives it shine.... well it just makes my hair happy (when I have hair.) *********************************************************      HOT OIL TREATMENT FOR THE HAIR Heat 1 cup of oil in microwave for approximately 40 seconds (will vary by microwave) Let oil set until it is cool to the touch yet still warm Massage oil through hair and into the scalp Leave on about 30 minutes Rinse as usual, like most hot oil treatments. *********************************************************This oil has a bit of a nutty fragrance so I also use it on those rough patches on my elbows and heels. As a side effect of some current harsh treatments, I've had trouble with peeling skin on my hands and feet so I'm slathering everything I can all over them.This oil makes a great carrier oils for those potent oils that must be diluted like Tea Tree Oil.  I've found this oil to play very well with others. I ordered this product for little to no cost for the express purpose of testing and evaluating it.

It is also a good carrier oil for several essential oils.Jojoba oil is the only oil that closely resembles human sebum, the oily substance naturally produced by the oil glands below the surface of the skin. It acts as a natural skin conditioner. These make Jojoba Oil a perfect choice for use on hair and skin.Pure Body Naturals Jojoba Oil is great for things such as:- Moisturizing the skin - Controlling hair loss - Taming dry, frizzy hair - Controlling dandruff - Controlling oily skin and acne - Healing chapped lips- Healing dry cuticles - Helping heal cracked and dry hands and feet- Helping heal eczema and psoriasis- Reducing the effects of sunburnJojoba oil has antibacterial properties that help control bacterial growth in the hair follicle. It acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, soothing the irritated skin. When I think of Jojoba Oil I always think of uses for the hair and scalp, but after researching uses for Jojoba, I was surprised to find that it is excellent for the skin as well. It is a great skin moisturizer, leaving skin hydrated and soft. I love the feel of my skin when I use Jojoba on it. I apply it right out of the shower and wear it under my makeup. It is not oily, and I've never had any shine-through. I like to save my heavy hitting moisturizers for nighttime when I'm donning a freshly cleansed face. I have used this both in the morning and at night. It works either way so I've found it to be personal preference that decides when you use it...and also how you use it. Currently I am making use of one of the most common benefits of Jojoba Oil, that for the hair. Since I am currently slight on hair using something that is highly effective, like Jojoba Oil  to combat the signs of hair loss, is of supreme importance. Every woman's hair is important to them, and I'm no different. Hair is a big part of my appearance and having none is not something I ever wanted to deal with. I am discovering how well this oil works on the hair and scalp, despite the side effects of current medications. Little sprigs everywhere; it's like cultivating my garden. Spring has sprung on my head. It's exciting to see progress. When it comes to essential oils, this is a great basic oil for handling the basics of skin and hair care. This is a highly recommended essential oil for those wanting to see real benefits from an all natural product free from chemicals and toxins. This Jojoba Oil is pure, organic and unrefined. This one deserves the top rating of 5 stars.I ordered this product for little to no cost for the express purpose of testing and evaluating it.

"Tea Tree Oil, also known as, Melaleuca alternifoliais, is an essential oil that is extracted from a plant native to Australia. It is made from steam distillation of the plant's leaves. Radha Beauty's Tea Tree Oil is a 100 percent pure, natural and therapeutic grade essential oil that is: - Soothing- Detoxifying- Cleansing - Antibiotic - Antifungal - Antiseptic- Unfiltered- Undiluted It is contains NO- additives- toxins- fillersSome of the problems Tea Tree Oil can help with are: - Skin tags- Sunburn- Athlete's foot- Dandruff- Rashes- Acne- Skin infections - Toenail fungus - Yeast infections- Cold sores- Ringworm - Warts- Scabies- Insect bites- Ticks - Lice With only a few drops of Tea Tree Oil you can solve many common household problems and ailments. I have a problem with those stupid skin tags. I never had any until after I had a child. I asked the doctor about it, and she said that hormones do play a role in skin tags so it isn't uncommon to see them appear after childbirth. Though they are technically harmless, to me they can be very unsightly. I hate having any and have tried much to get rid of them. Having the doctor remove costs hundreds of dollars, so I never really gave that any merit. I've always looked for other less costly means to handle this issue. Tea Tree Oil is what I've chosen to treat them, it works and it's very cost effective. For animal lovers and owners, this oil can afford protection from fleas. I spray TTO on my dog's bedding to keep fleas from making a home there, too. Fleas don't like TTO so they stay away from my dog and my home. When school is in session, that problem no one likes to talk about...lice...can be a problem too. By adding a few drops to your shampoo, you can eliminate that problem... and the embarrassment everyone feels when their kid gets sent home from school with a note about lice. Tea Tree Oil is a very cost effective way to treat this and many other problems. I personally use Tea Tree Oil in my home for:- an all-purpose cleaner- a flea killer- a skin tag remover- a remedy to treat my psoriasis- a remedy for itchy, scratchy skin - soothing a sunburn - freshening my bathroom - freshening my carpet and laundryThis is an essential oil with tremendous benefits for things from common household problems to healing many health concerns. The list of benefits is long and varied. This gets two thumbs way, way up! I highly recommend this oil to be a part of every medicine cabinet, first aid kit or both. ***********************CAUTION*************************Tea tree oil should NEVER be ingested and is only to be used as a topical remedyDo not use on babies younger than 6 months, consult your physician. ********************************************I ordered this product for little to no cost for the express purpose of testing and evaluating it.

"Skinology Rosehip OilRosehip oil comes from the seeds of a specific variety of rose, Rosa aff. rubiginosa or Rosa moschata. Manufacturers press and extract the oil from wild rose bushes that grow in the southern Andes.Rosehip Oil is natural source of essential fatty acids Omega 3, 6 and 9, which help repair and regenerate damaged skin tissue. Rosehip Oil is a natural source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that brightens the skin and helps improve the skin's tone and appearance. It is also a source of natural Retinol, Vitamin A, which  is well known for its skin benefits.This moisture-increasing skin oil benefits the skin by:- Rejuvenating the skin- Reducing fine lines and wrinkles- Repairing sun-damaged skin- Healing dry, cracked lips- Eliminating dry skin on the elbows, knees and heels - Soothing Burns- Fading Scars and stretch marks- Ridding the scalp of dandruff- Soothing and healing a sunburn- Nourishing dry, brittle nails - Refreshing dry, damaged, dull hair - Protecting skin from premature aging - Correcting hyperpigmentation- Fading age/sun spots I love to mix a spray bottle of Rosehip oil and water to spritz on my skin to rehydrate and keep my skin moist and supple. This is an excellent moisturizer that is rich and luxurious. You can feel its moisturizing effects as soon as you make contact with it. Though you will immediately notice the oiliness, it absorbs completely and leaves no oily residue behind. You will quickly learn to love this Rosehip Oil. It is one of my favorite essential oils for the skin. With my fine, thin hair I am careful not to use too much conditioner on my hair because it weighs it down, but this Rosehip Oil hasn't done that. I warm it up a little and apply prior to washing my hair, then just shampoo as usual. It leaves my hair soft and very shiny. I love it! Another thing I use this Rosehip Oil for is regularly massaging a few drops onto my nails and into my cuticles to prevent hangnails and broken, split, cracked nails. I've never had good nails so I need all the help I can get. This helps strengthen my nails...a huge plus for me. ************************NOTE**************************Store in a dark bottle because overexposure to light can reduce the potency of its ingredients*********************************************************I ordered this product for little to no cost for the express purpose of testing and evaluating it.

"Avo Essentials Lavender OilLavender Oil also known by its scientific name ""lavandula angustifolia."" Lavender is an herb and its flower is used to make the essential oil used in so many things from perfumes to medicinal remedies. Its aroma is calming, relaxing and balancing, both physically and emotionally. This will quickly become a favorite!*******************************************************ALWAYS DILUTE WITH A CARRIER OIL, LIKE COCINUT OIL, WHEN USING FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN AROMATHERAPY. THERE ARE SEVERAL CARRIER OILS THAT CAN BE USED.*******************************************************Lavender Oil also known by its scientific name ""lavandula angustifolia."" Lavender is an herb and its flower is used to make the essential oil used in so many things from perfumes to medicinal remedies. Its aroma is calming, relaxing and balancing, both physically and emotionally. Lavender Oil is one of the most popular of the essential oils and can be used in many ways including, but not limited to:1. CalmingI love rubbing a few drops into my hands and deeply inhaling to soothe and calm me. I also like to apply to my wrists, temples, back of my neck to relieve stress. 2.  Bath Time This is a great stress reducer and oh so relaxing added to a bath. I love soaking in a Lavender oil bath. It soothes my aching muscles and helps me unwind. My favorite time to use a Lavender bath is just before bedtime. A soothing bath coupled with Lavender scented pillows, sleeping feels great. It is also great to add to baby's bath, especially if you have a fussy baby. It will relax and soothe them and make for a better night's sleep for the whole family. 3. Massage OilThis oil feels great massaged directly into the tensed up muscles in my neck and shoulders where I carry my stress at. I use several drops directly out of the bottle onto my skin. It relaxes those tensed up muscles and joints. 4.  Sleep aidI love to spray on or put in my hands to rub into my pillowcases at night to help me relax my mind for a more restful sleep. It is a definite mood enhancer! 5.  Bee stings and Insect bitesLavender oil works very well in soothing insect bites and stings and reducing side effects like swelling. I use this often for bites since the mosquitos love to gnaw on me. As a mosquito magnet, I have this oil in my bag in a small spritz bottle so I can immediately apply when I'm engaging in outdoor activities, especially in the evening when mosquitos are really swarming. 6.  Minor burnsA few drops of Lavender oil works great on minor burns. I spilled hot water on my hand while cooking and since I had Lavender oil on hand, I applied it immediately, and it really did help decrease the pain. What a great find for minor burns I didn't know about before I added Lavender oil to my collection. Plus it smells so good that it helps calm the stress associated with a minor medical emergency like that. 7. Minor CutsI never knew that Lavender oil could be used on cuts to stop the bleeding, clean the wound, and kill bacteria. I now use it in this manner for my family and my dog's nails when they get nipped too close or she tears at them and make them bleed8. Eczema and/or DermatitisI dilute several drops of Lavender oil with Coconut oil and apply to severely dry skin. My skin loves it and just laps it up. It soothes those dry, cracked winter skin issues like itching and dryness. 9. Nausea and/or motion sicknessI use Lavender oil to soothe nausea. I put it behind my ears to help chase away that awful, nagging nausea I'm frequently plagued with. It also is supposed to be great for  the symptoms of motion sickness, though I have not personally tested that theory. Since motion sickness is nausea related I can deduce it would work well for that as well. 10. NosebleedsThe tip I learned for using Lavender Oil to stop a nosebleed is to put a drop of lavender oil on a Kleenex or paper towel and wrap it around a small piece of ice and hold beneath the nose until the bleeding stops. The tip says NOT to freeze the lip or gum. 11.  Chapped and/or sunburned lipsI rub a drop of lavender oil directly on my chapped on or sunburned lips to soothe and heal them. 12. Hay fever and/or allergiesI just rub a drop of lavender oil into my hands and inhale to help the symptoms of my allergies 13. DandruffMy son has suffered with a dry scalp and flaking so I've advised him to rub several drops into his scalp daily to help heal the dryness. He reports that it is helping heal his dry scalp. 14. Cold soresMy sister has suffered with cold sores from time to time due to medications so she just rubs a drop of lavender oil right into the cold sore to aid in its healing.  15. Add to Drinks or RecipesI love adding a few drops of lavender oil to my sparkling water and/or hot or iced tea. It is so smooth, especially in tea. It can also be added to food recipes, which is something I haven't tried yet. 16. AromatherapyThis is one of my favorite oils to put in one or all three of the aromatherapy diffusers I have spread throughout my home. I use this oil all the time in the diffuser in my bedroom. It is a great way to unwind before bed. Curled up with a good book it is a great way to induce a good night's sleep. This is a highly recommended oil for those wanting a great oil for their collection. It quickly became a favorite of mine and is easily still in my top 3 most favored essential oils. It is an all-around winner. Two thumbs way up!******************CAUTION*************************Please be sure to read and follow all package directions closely.

"Best Bully Beef Lung PuffsThis is my girl's favorite one yet. She sits by the bag and whines for me to give her another. These are light trests, easily chewed and digested, especially for senior dogs like my 10 year old girl. My 2 year old granddog loves them too, but his 110 pound frame devours them in seconds, making me realize he could eat the whole bag in one setting..so not the best treat for his his jaws. He loves the 12"" Best Bully Sticks made for the big boys. This bag of Best Bully Beef Lung Puffs feature:• ONE INGREDIENT ONLY....EVER!•  Made from all natural cow lung• Made of 100 percent natural ingredients ONLY• Have a nice, crunchy texture• Have a smell dogs L-O-V-E• Make excellent treats or training incentives• Great choice for older dogs and puppies• Comes in a convenient 1 pound bagThe reason I'm a fan of Best Bully Treats now and feed them as my dog's only exclusive treats is because they ALWAYS come with one ingredient. There are no artificial ingredients, fillers and chemicals. That is good for my girl and my beloved big boy granddog. Best Bully does not make the treats for those looking for the cheapest treats to feed their animals. They provide top quality products, and  you absolutely get what you pay for. That is not to say that these are price prohibitive, far from it. They are certainly in line with all natural treats on the market. I like having the choice to buy ala carte for a few dollars per piece and create a set of dog treats for my beloved 4-legged friends or buy their favorites in ready-made bags of varying sizes. They also run great sales. I stick with Best Bully Sticks for their superior products and exceptional customer service. I have always been greeted with professionalism and respect, and my order rushed to me post haste. I also appreciate the free shipping all my orders have gotten. This is a far above average company making excellent products that I am secure in safely feeding their products to my guys. If you are a discerning dog owner who really wants to feed your dog the best, then this comes hands down highly recommended. And it's not just my opinion, my girl sits by the bags whining for me to give her more and when my granddog visits he goes right to the treat bags waiting for his favorite handout. We've made my son, his owner, a believer, too. Four thumbs and 8 paws way, way up for Best Bully!I received this product for the express purpose of testing and evaluating it.

"Silva Salt and Pepper Grinder SetI purchased a set of these individual grinders because I wanted a separate salt and pepper mill. I had a single one that can be one or the other, but I really like the idea of having them separate. I've found that spices really do taste better when they are freshly ground. There's nothing quite like it.This Silva Salt and Pepper Mill Set features include: • High Quality Ceramic Grinders  • Clear containers that allow you to see how much spice is left • Individual grinders for grinding fresh sea salt, Himalayan salt and/or whole black pepper • Adjustments for fine or coarse grinding to suit your taste • Doubles as an herb grinder too  • Fresh grind every time  • Wide mouths for easy filling  • Ultra Sharp for Ease of Use  • Easy Care Instructions • Dishwasher Safe  • Built Never to Rust or Corrode  • 30 day Money Back GuaranteeWhat I like about these grinders, other than being separate grinders, is how easy they are to use and clean. I just have to flip them upside down and turn to get me the perfect texture and amount of spice I desire on my dish. The luds fit tightly so they don't come loose at the most inopportune time. Nothing worse than a plate full of salt or pepper to ruin an otherwise delicious dish. One thing I always look for when purchasing kitchen tools is how eady are they to clean. I don't want things that are complicated to take apart to clean, and clean tools in the kitchen are a must for my family's health. I had no worries with the cleaning of these; cleaning them is a snap. I also love that I can pop these in the dishwasher. However, I never put them on the bottom rack of the dishwasher, always top rack, just for safety's sake. They also clean easily with plain soap and water, if that is your preference or if you don't have a dishwasher at your disposal.I purchased a set of these individual grinders because I wanted a separate salt and pepper mill.

It really does taste better fresh. As the holidays approach faster than ever, I have someone I know who would love this set, actually 2. I have no qualms about gifting these this holiday season because the clear, see through containers with the stainless steel lids make them an easy match for an decor, mine or as a gift for others, and that's a big plus. I don't have to worry about whether someone I gift them to will hate them because they do not match. I ordered this product for little to no cost for the express purpose of testing and evaluating it.

I love that it is wireless so I don't have to worry about tangled cords or worrying if they will reach as far as I need them to.Pomstream's Wireless Cooking Thermometer has some very innovative features.

Do not use in microwave.***********************************************I also like that it is stainless steel and matches my updated kitchen. The cradle holds it in place when not being used. There is no cord to drag across the kitchen or get near the heat of the stove. All I had to do was touch the thermometer probe on the meat that was cooking, and I got a temperature reading. The max temperature of 475 is more than enough to cover all my cooking needs. It is fast and reliable too. If temperature doesn't register you may be beyond the thermometer's range of 65 feet; for me 65 feet is plenty sufficient. This is a very nice kitchen helper.

"I took interest in Alpha Lipoic Acid after being told by a friend how it helped her. Since it was a natural supplement the doctor was not opposed to me trying it.Alpha-Lipoic Acid is a naturally occurring vitamin-like chemical called an antioxidant. Alpha-Lipoic Acid is a powerful antioxidant made by the body. It is found in every cell in the body where it helps turn glucose into energy. Antioxidants attack ""free radicals,"" waste products created when the body turns food into energy. Other antioxidants work only in water or fatty tissues, but alpha-lipoic acid is both fat and water soluble making it a valuable asset throughout the body.Amazing Nutrition's Alpha Lipoic Acid is a high potency supplement with 600 mg per capsule. This bottle contains 120 capsules per bottle with an recommended daily allowance of (1) capsule twice a day with a meal, that gives you a full 60-day supply.There are several foods that are rich in Alpha Lipoic Acid including:• Yeast• Liver• Kidney• Spinach• Broccoli• PotatoesThis product is FREE FROM any of these potential allergens and it has:• No wheat• No gluten• No soybeans• No dairy• No egg• No fish• No shellfish• No peanuts• No tree nutsThis supplement helps me with my energy levels since it changes glucose into energy. Since I have an abundance  of glucose all the time I thought surely that meant I had a lot of energy but it doesn't work that way, at least not my body anyway. I guess it's what they say ""too much of anything isn't good for you,"" at least too much glucose in the blood isn't.

My sister and I tackled this challenge and against all odds we put it together and it's still standing, with clothes hanging on it, too. Hallelujah!One thing I particularly like is the amount of storage space there is beneath the clothes, in the middle of the rack. Not only do my sister's clothes fit but she can store a lot of things in the space in the middle of the rack. That's definitely a plus!This has been a livesaver for my sister and I as we navigate this new reality of staying together in my place.

"Water bottles are all the rage. There are a ton of choices and it comes down to personal preference whether you like glass, plastic or both. In the case of this Kanrel Water Bottle it is apparent that no matter what your preference is, you have to agree that this is a very, very nice water bottle.This Kanrel Glass Water Bottle features:• Premium Grade Borosilicate Glass• Blue Safe Grip Silicone Sleeve• Eco friendly• Dishwasher safe• 20 ounces• Reusable• Leak proof• Easy to clean• BPA and BPS freeWhat I like is that this bottle is SO secure in my hands. When I'm holding it it never feels like I'm losing my grip and that is a VERY good sign. I am not sure handed at all and dropping things is not uncommon for me due to my numb fingertips. This bottle seems to have been made for klutzsy hands like mine.Obviously the secure grip is great if you have kids because inevitably they want a drink of what you have, and they will eventually drop it. Of course, you wouldn't put a breakable glass bottle in a young child's hands, but I feel safe with this one in a child's hands while I'm with them, with older kids no problem at all. The silicone sleeve does a good job of protecting the bottle and your hands. Because this bottle is BPA and BPS free, you won't get any odors or unpleasant tastes.This Kanrel Glass Water Bottle is good for activities like:• Gym• Yoga• Biking• Camping• Office• Sports• Tennis• TravelingIt makes a great bottle for the older kids, teens to take to their practicesfor:- Football- Soccer- Baseball- Martial arts and moreI really like this bottle specifically for the non slip grip. It holds 20 ounces which is a good amount to carry with you.

"My first impression of this butterfly necklace was that the blue color looked a lot like my March birthday stone. I like mine, it is light in color and very pretty. The only drawback is that I can't decide which color I like best, the purple or the blue; they are both very pretty.This necklace by Mikiy is an eye-catcher, and it is very dainty and pretty. It is not what I would call unisex; this is definitely for the ladies, girls, women. Due to the sparking colors it looks great with a lot of things. When the light hits it it really sparkles. I really felt that this is something I could see on me.Mikiy's Women's Alloy Diamond Butterfly Crystal Pendant Necklace features:• Necklace is made of Alloy• Design is shaped like a Butterfly• It is 40-45 cm in length• It weighs a mere 11.5 gramsThe chain is also dainty, but not what I would consider easily broken.

This is not one I'd recommend for the guys; it's too dainty and pretty for a guy to wear; ladies this one's for you.It does make a nice gift from the guys to that special lady.

"Arron Kelly Oval OrganizerThis is one handy device. I've been reusing my plastic grocery bags to line my bathroom and bedroom trash cans, as well as, using them as potty sacks when I take the dog outside. They didn't need to fine me $.06 cents per bag to spur me to recycle them. I've been doing that for years.This Arron Kelly Oval Organizer is helping me to keep these bags all in one central location so I always know where they are.This Oval Organizer features include:• Size is 6 x 6"" Width x 17"" tall• 27 Oval openings• 5 sides• High quality plastic• 2 color choices (black is pictured)• Fingerprint resistant• Smart, stylish designYou can think outside the box on what this can hold. Some of the ones that easily come to mind are:• Plastic grocery bags• Reusable cloth bags• Scarves or soft belts• Dish and cleaning rags• Umbrellas• Bath toys• Shower clutter• and so much moreI like that it comes in red or black because red is a bold kitchen color that is showing up in lots of kitchen items lately. I personally like the red trend in kitchen products.These are ideal for the:• Kitchen pantry• Refrigerator• Laundry room• Closet• Bathroom• CampersThough there are a lot of uses for this versatile organizer, but I took the obvious route.  I'm using it to store my plastic grocery bags, which I've been reusing for years. This dispenser holds a lot of bags. I counted nearly 70 plastic grocery bags I managed to stuff in there.I really appreciate the design that allows you to access the contents by pulling them out through one of the openings up and down the organizer. You are not limited to only grabbing one from the top. There are a lot of choices which means I can grab one more quickly for the task at hand. Everyone knows that if something is complicated then it gets shoved back in the cabinet and never gets used or stuffed in a closet to be discovered when I do Spring cleaning. For me, this one is handy and it does get used. I could see having a few more of these around the house.I highly recommend this item, not only because it's useful, but becausethe 2-step installation process is a breeze. You just roll it up and snap it into place, then stick it on the wall or fridge or wherever you choose for it to be.Your Oval Organizer comes with 12 free-hanging parts, including 4 strong suction cups and (4) one and 1/4"" inch screws with anchors.

"Sun Essentials BergamotThis is one essential oil that I was familiar with the name but knew nothing about it. Was it a flower or what....I had no idea. This one I had to read up on before I could make up my mind.One surprising use I found but wasn't expecting is that Bergamot is commonly used in black tea. In fact when Bergamot is added to black tea it is called Earl Grey.Well my search turned up a lot about Bergamot. I found out the Bergamot is a citrus fruit, and the rind is used for extracting the Bergamot Essential Oil.  It is considered to be a tropical plant, but it commonly grows in Europe as well. It is very aromatic so it commonly graces many of the bottles that crowd our perfume counters and in our stores we shop at regularly today. Bergamot essential oil is attained through cold compression, where a lot of essential oils are extracted by the steam distillation method.Bergamot Oil has a very sweet smell and is used in a number of medicinal ways, as well as, industrial uses too. There are many uses some of which are:• DEODORANT• VULNERARY• VERMIFUGE• ANTIBIOTIC• ANTISEPTIC• ANTISPASMODIC• SEDATIVE• ANALGESIC• ANTIDEPRESSANT• DISINFECTANT• FEBRIFUGE• CICATRISANT• DIGESTIVE SUBSTANCEI have to admit I was intrigued by the use of it as a deodorant. It has a strong scent so I figured that was what made it good as a deodorant, but it also dissecting so it kills germs too. It's hard to break a decades long habit of using a gel, stick or roll on deodorant but I'm intrigued enough to look into making my own homemade deodorant that I know would be 100 percent safe to use.I also like to put this in my aromatherapy diffusers. I like this was most in the bedroom because it smells sweet. This is a good choice if you are looking for a versatile, widely used oils.

"There is no denying that every room we're in needs to have a smoke alarm. I think personally every room where people reside or work should be protected by a smoke alarm.Gotideal® Battery-Operated Smoke Detector is suitable for:• HOMES• WORKPLACES• FACTORIES• SHOPPING MALLS• HOTELS• RESTAURANTS• OFFICE BUILDINGS• SCHOOLS• BANKS• LIBRARIES• WAREHOUSESThis battery-operated smoke detector is very easy to operate. First you should test the alarm when you first take it out of the box to be sure it is in proper working order.Easy to follow instructions that anyone could follow:1. Select place to mount smoke alarm2. Fix the mounting base3. Put the smoke detector into the base and turn it.4. Press the test button for 5 seconds until detector gives out a sound5. Blow cigarette smoke or other smoke near the alarm6. You should see a red light flash several times followed by a loud beeping sound(NOTE: The testing must be done in an enclosed environment. If there is too much air the alarm won't sound)Notice:1. Clean with a soft brush every six months2. If smoke detector is idle for a period of time take the battery out of the alarm and safely store it in a cool and dry place. not used for a long time, remove the detector, take out the battery from the cabinet3. Never solely rely on smoke alarm for your safety. Keep things away from open flames and don't overload outlets.4. Always have a family escape plan in case of emergency and practice it oftenThis Gotideal® Smoke Alarm box includes:• (1) Smoke Alarm• (1) Users ManualI know one thing that made me think of smoke alarms was always cleaning the dryer's lint filter because I had a friend whose dryer caught on fire while she was in the shower because the lint trap had never been cleaned. That is a cautionary tale and lesson I never forgot.Of course this comes highly recommended. We should all have one wherever we go.

"I recently acquired several bamboo items for my kitchen like a trivet set and a butcher block set and they all call for oil to be applied to them before the initial use and then routinely thereafter.

I love ""simply"" great products and this is certainly one of those type products. My bamboo butcher blocks have never looked so beautiful.

"First off I love the name of this for file. It is very creative and I love creativity.There is nothing for me like running barefoot. In fact if I never had to wear shoes I would never put another shoe on my foot. As a kid I was always barefoot but unfortunately the grocery store and the restaurants frown on being barefoot. Even barefoot me would be grossed out by someone in a place like that a la bare of foot.If you want to be barefoot like me then that means you have to take extra special care of your feet. That includes lot of buffing and sanding and grinding those calloused places that we all have, if we don't take care of it. Foot care is important to all but especially so for the diabetic who heals more slowly than the average person.Agony of D'Feet features:• HEAVY DUTY FIRM FOOT FILE• CALLUS REMOVER• CORN REMOVAL GRATER• DIFFERENT TEXTURES ON EACH SIDE• ERGONOMIC HEAD• LARGE HANDLEThe Agony of D'Feet works by:• REMOVING DEAD SKIN• REDUCING CRACKED HEELS• SMOOTHING FEETThis is as easy to use as A, B, C• Grab a foot (doesn't matter which one because both need to be done)• Turn the foot over• Grab your Agony of D'Feet• Start moving it in back and forthmotions, up and down, side to side• When foot is smooth, buff it• Grab other foot and REPEAT• Follow with your favorite lotionIt doesn't get any easier than that. I personally like that it is a non-electrical unit because I never worry about having to replace the batteries or having a dead battery just when I need it most. This is a great backup to those machines or when you have a certain spot that needs some extra attention outside of your normal ""pedi"" time.The extra long handle is great for those with back issues like me. If you have trouble getting your foot up there and upside down, then this long handle helper can be your saving grace. It doesn't take a lot of elbow grease to get great results. You can get great looking feet quickly and easily. Plus you can go shopping with that $100 a month you've been paying to get those salon pedis.I had the unfortunate lesson of skipping a ""self pedi"" and then ending up in the hospital. I gave the Drs and nurses an eyeful of feet desperately ""in need of a pedi"" sticking off the end of the bed for all to see. I was sure they might never be the same again. That taught me that skipping a maintenance pedi wasn't such a great idea, if at all possible.You may be packing away your strappy sandals in favor of boots for the cooler fall and winter months but feet can't be packed in a box in the closet; they don't get a holiday. The winter months might allow us to get a bit lax about our maintenance pedis but people can still see our feet. I personally don't want mine to look like some hairy-toed hobbit out of Lord of the Rings.I ordered this product for little to no cost for the purpose of testing and evaluation, and subsequently providing my unbiased opinion.

"A.M.Curiel and Daniel M. Arroyo craftily spin a fanciful tale of intrigue that keeps the pages turning and those bed lamps burning to the end of the very last page. No matter what your age you will enjoy this story. I found myself flipping page after page and I'm nowhere near the book's targeted age group. The age group targeted by this book will be on the edge of their seats with anticipation as they go with Lemed on his futuristic journey from planet to planet with the help of his animal friends.It is a fascinating story about a king, a queen, their young prince, his animal friends and a newly discovered fairy princess that help them along their adventures to save the planet from a surprising evil. Lemed, the young prince, is faced with an impossible choice that requires him to face his fears and move into action even in the midst of those fears. He has to face evil and decide what he can do to change the hate that is evil into love and acceptance.Lemed takes a journey through his world learning important life lessons along the way. Lessons that all human beings should embrace. He faces uncertainty and evil but does he have the courage to tackle evil and get the result they all want.The Magic Butterfly is a very intriguing, thought-provoking, wild ride with Lemed going from one world to the next and back again in his race to complete the journey in time to help the people of Ark.This book weaves a tale that touches on the emotions we all must deal with in your lives from love/hate, sad/happy, scared/brave, to help/not help, suspicion/trust and leaving us with the greatest of all of these being L-O-V-E.I highly recommend this children's book.

"I am the first to admit that I am not a wine connoisseur but I know quality products when they are before me. This is one very very nice mopener. I was intimidated at the thought of an electric wine opener since I'm not a drinker.I wasn't going to let a little fear stop me so I went out and bought a bottle of wine so I could give this bad boy a test run.This is the easiest electrical appliance I think I've ever used of a product of which I was not a normal partaker of.

I like the little rubberized feet that keeps it stable while you operate it. There is no worry about it sliding and causing the bottle to fall.Whether you like to drink alone or with lots of friends, this is a great thing to have when you have guests over. Great for those upcoming holiday parties because it can open multiples of bottles on a single charge.

"I am new to this supplement and admit I'd never heard of it before seeing it on a label and decided to investigate it.I found that there are 2 types of brown seaweed, Fucus vesiculosus (also known as bladderwrack) and Laminaria japonica are used in traditional medicine to treat various health conditions. Both seaweeds contain iodine and fucoidan.BRI Nutrition's Fucoxanthin is made with a trifecta of 3 ingredients:• Brown seaweed• Pomegranate• HoodiaThis trifecta of ingredients is what makes this Fucoxanthin supplement beneficial for:• Promoting metabolic rate• Supporting weight loss• Lessening fatigue• Helping with stomach ailments• Reducing headaches• Hypothyroidism• Menstrual problems• Cough• Asthma• Cellulite• HemorrhoidsThis supplement interested me because of its support of metabolic function. I have issues with metabolic function where it relates to energy levels. I recently started taking this supplement so it's too soon to tell if there has been a real shift in my metabolic function but I'm continuing to take with the best in mind. I also was intrigued by the claims of help for headaches, which I am very frequently plagued with.I take this according to the RDA on the bottle, which is 2 at a time, twice daily for a total of 4 capsules per day. I do not ever exceed the RDA of 4 total per day. The bottle pictured contains 60 capsules, a 15 day supply.At this time I give this product 4 stars with the possibility of 5 stars being awarded in the future.-------------------------------------------PLEASE CAREFULLY READ AND FOLLOW ALL BOTTLE AND PACKAGE INSTRUCTIONS.

"GABA, otherwise known as Gamma Aminobutyric Acid, is an amino acid that occurs naturally in the body's brain and eyes, which means it regulates brain and nerve cell activity. GABA is designed to help your brain activity from moving too quickly, thereby causing stress, anxiety and tension, and it acts as an all natural sleep aid.Amazing Formulas' GABA supplement is an all natural helper that:• Promotes a calming effect• Promotes a healthy memory• Improves concentration• Lessens impulsivity• Lowers hyperactivity• Improves mood• Reduce mood swings• Relieves PMS, cramps, bloating• Relieves headaches• Eases nervous tension• Reduces and stress and anxiety• Promotes lean muscle growth• Maintains healthy blood pressure• Relieves dull pain• Increases exercise enduranceGABA works in the neurotransmitters in the brain helping it to remain tension free.GABA's formula is made with:• 5-HTP-precursor to serotonin and is one of the most widely used mood enhancers• L-Tyrosine-amino acid found in many protein-rich foods• Suntheanine L-Theanine-amino acid commonly found in tea• Passion Flower-plant native to the United States• Ashwagandha- extract used to support mental health, anxiety levels and overall quality of lifeI started taking this a couple of months ago for the relief of tension and grinding my teeth. I am bad about clenching my jaw and grinding my teeth at night, neither of which are good habits. They not only cause headaches but jaw and teeth pain too. That was my reason for choosing GABA; I didn't want another medicine with its side effects. I was looking for an all natural supplement that would work with my body's natural rhythms. That is how I came upon GABA and decided to try it. It is still new to me, but I can say I feel calmer overall.

"Got this for our dog and he loves it.  It is funny how something so simple as this chew toy can keep him busy but this does. I think he likes it cause it looks like a stick which he usually gnaws on, but its safer. It is actually made with calcium and minerals so its designed to last and help your dog work their teeth in a good way. Would make a great gift for a dog in your life! It is not super huge but my big dog enjoys it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PCEL89PH2W7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X591CH8#wasThisHelpful","R3PCEL89PH2W7X","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly there is not much I can say about Fish Oil pills other than I use them and appreciate that these do not have a fish taste. It is recommended that you take two pills a day so this bottle will last about 2 months, not bad for the price. Fish Oil is good for so many things that I usually look for one that is affordable and has a good amount of EPA and DHA, which these do. I didn't really notice the Lemon Flavor as I swallow them so fast but I would say that would be a plus if you usually taste the fish oils.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC88Q175DQXBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG6ZFSM#wasThisHelpful","RC88Q175DQXBG","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids are often jealous of the gadgets I get and curious about them. I admit though sometimes I am jealous of their gadgets and wish I had more time to sit and just play with them. A recent gadget I got for my kids to check out is New VTech Kidizoom Action Cam.  Seriously it is super cool!  Think of it like a GoPro built for kids!Features of the Kidizoom Action Cam:Video capturePhoto captureGamesBuilt-in Rechargeable Li-ion Polymer BatteryExpandable Memory via a MicroSD card up to 32GB (you will definitely want to have one of these on hand)Comes with lots of fun accessories including a waterproof case, mounting kit and wrist strapBuilt to withstand drops and bumps1.4 inch color LCD screenBefore I even got this out of the box, my kids were excited just looking at the box. I was impressed first off with all the accessories included. Usually accessories are extra but not with this camera.The camera is perfect for kids. I honestly keep the waterproof case on it all the time, for extra protection and my kids take the camera everywhere. I love seeing what they created! The Kidizoom is both a camera and video camera in one, and its very easy to know which button to click as there are pictures on the buttons. My kids had this camera figured out before I had everything out of the box. They knew exactly what to push, how to add fun stuff to the pictures, how to play games and they even figured out how to mount it to their bikes by looking at the box! My one son had the idea to tie string on it so they could wear it around their neck rather than mounting it to their bike or something flat.And the waterproof case, that I use for extra durability overall.For a flat mount like a skateboard, you do need to use the adhesive sticker included and they didn’t want to do that. The string works great for us and the waterproof camera case does have two spots where the stick fits through perfectly. I will say that is the only thing I wish the camera came with is a way to easily (and more neatly) wear it, like a strap or necklace chain (which would be a lot better than the string I used!)Overall though this camera is awesome for its price of $60.  We have a big VTech camera my kids use but honestly never really take it anywhere because of how bulky it is. Now I don’t know how the megapixels on this camera compares to the megapixels on the bigger VTech cameras but I do think they are good enough. My kids are happy and this camera is built to withstand their abuse. We are even bringing this camera with us when we go on vacation soon as my boys can’t wait to use it on the cruise we are going on and with the waterproof case, I feel even better with using it! Definitely worth the price and perfect for summer fun!I received this to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10V1IFS95KJEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRDHG36#wasThisHelpful","R10V1IFS95KJEB","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I love about the Potty Surprise Doll is she does not require any liquids. You feed her the included food which is a dough and twist her belly button for her to poop. There are even different shapes you can turn it into for magical surprise fun. You get three containers of food and you can just keep reusing it. The dough is very lightweight and kinda like moon dough. I didn't think to try out other doughs but it would definitely be something to consider as I don't think they sell refills. I did read in a review that Play-Dough can be used but I can't say first hand.We didn't have any trouble with feeding her or cleaning her up. She worked fine and has continued to work fine. I definitely see my daughter playing with this doll for awhile especially since she thinks its hysterical that she poops sparkly gems. My daughter is 4 years old and had no problem using her.Super silly and with no liquids she is definitely one of the lesser messy potty dolls.I received this to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBRI9RONDB6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMSUSP2#wasThisHelpful","R1NBRI9RONDB6B","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my son to use as a body spray. I don't really feel that deodorant sprays work, or maybe its just the sweaty men in my house need something more. I don't feel this would work as a heavy duty deodorant if you sweat a lot but for a body spray it works great. It smells just like Calvin Klein cologne and does seem to last throughout the day. Its not overwhelming but a nice manly scent. Perfect to spray for a pick me up or if you use an unscented deodorant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19WZ723QZ5TDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M2WYUS#wasThisHelpful","R19WZ723QZ5TDT","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bags come at a great price and work great. I love that I get so many bags in this as I tend to go through a lot of them in my house. They are durable and the slider makes them so easy to open and close tightly. My kids can do it on their own which is nice as they can never get the other non-slider bags sealed. These are not freezer bags but rather regular size sandwich bags. Perfect for snacks or small toys. I did put a liquid in them to test and it did leak out a little while upside down but I usually double bag liquids anyways as I don't trust a bag that can get easily punctured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWJRIBKDYRF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMVYPEG#wasThisHelpful","RAWJRIBKDYRF3","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this razor for my husband who is always complaining about his electric razor and disposables. He loves this razor. First off, it cleans itself which is amazing. No more dingy razor sitting on my bathroom sink. You just put in some water and it cleans it while in the holder - it does make some noise but its quick. As far as the shave goes, my husband has not had any nicks and his skin is so smooth afterwords. He does say it doesn't do his neck as well as he would like but he says all razors are like that and this one does say to give it 30 days so your skin gets conditioned to it. Our kids love that their daddy does not have itchy face anymore. I am amazed watching him shave with this and how fast it works and so efficiently. He doesn't have to go over and over in spots as it gets the hair the first time.This razor can also be used both wet and dry which my husband has tried both with no problems. Overall, he doesn't have any issues and I appreciate how well it works. I am not sure how well it will be for traveling as it doesn't include a traveling container but it is pretty compact. It comes with additional attachments as well but my husband hasn't needed to use them yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RC2JYEYJ3R6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R2RC2JYEYJ3R6R","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never used Essential Oils before and figured this was a good starter set. It seems like a great set for both starters and experienced users. You get 6 popular essential oils and even a few reed sticks. The bottles are typical size and they will last awhile because you only need a few drops for use. I like though that you get a good assortment of the popular oils.You get: Peppermint, Tea tree, Lavender, Eucalyptus, Lemongrass, OrangeI can't compare these oils to other ones as I haven't tried other brands but these work and I have no complaints.

"This is a package of two thin Loofah Pads. I like how easy they are to scrub especially the rough skin I have from the weather changing. You even get a suction cup to stick in your bathroom to hang this up. There are straps on the back to make it easy to hold while you scrub. These are simple but efficient. It is a little pricey especially for something so small and not very rough, which I was hoping for.

"Honestly for the price these headphones are great.  Now don't expect superior sound or bass through them, they are basic headphones but honestly I am totally fine with them. I actually would recommend them if you need an extra pair of headphones. My favorite feature is they fold up, this is perfect since I travel a lot and these take up less room, and no I don't like earbuds. I plugged these right into my phone and tablet and they worked great. I also used it while i was on the phone which is a little strange but it worked and my husband couldn't even tell I wasn't holding the phone to my ear.

"So we have a lot of parties at my house year-round and I have quite the collection of trays and containers to store and display the food. Winter usually isn't bad because we are inside but summertime means the food is outside along with bugs. One year we had a huge pig roast but it was so buggy and gross outside that we had to keep all the food inside. While the party was supposed to be primarily outside, we had people going in and out for food. I tried keeping it outside but the plastic wrap was a pain to keep covering up the trays of food.Then I heard about ""The Cater Dome"" and I seriously was amazed. It is a simple container but it has so many great features it makes you think ""Why didn't I think of that?""Stay-open lidDurable acrylic buildCan hold a half-sized aluminum pan (yep like the ones from catering companies)Microwaveable and freezer safe food grade inner tray (BPA Free)StackableEasy to carryComes in a variety of colorsEasily washed, even in the dishwasher!When I saw these trays I immediately envisioned how easy a picnic and BBQ would be thanks to The Cater Dome. I absolutely love that I can pop aluminum trays in them and that I can have the lid easily opened and closed. It is such a genius invention! There are times when its just the five of us and we bring some food to eat outside on the deck but again I have to worry about keeping it bug free - these would be perfect for that too!While these may seem like a summer product I can see them being useful year-round as well. I am thinking for Christmas it will be nice for displaying our Christmas cookies. The Cater Dome is not sealed around so you can't leave food in it that might get stale but for a party it is easy enough to pop out and wrap for storage.The Cater Dome would make a great gift too for those that often host parties or even for someone to keep if you bring a dish to their house for the holidays. Its priced at just $20 a container and it is definitely worth it.I received this product complimentary in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3AUHWKFFT7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Q8K7IK#wasThisHelpful","RS3AUHWKFFT7E","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well Osmo is a unique accessory for the iPad that has not only changed the way iPads are used but also how kids can learn. Osmo includes a tablet stand and mirror piece and then game pieces. You just download the free apps and then your ready to go with Osmo. There are currently five games with three of them requiring pieces you get with the Osmo Genius Kit and the other two you use pieces you already have at home.So I will say at first, when I heard of Osmo I wasn't sure my kids would get the hang of it or it would be a lasting ""toy"" for my family. Osmo has become that and more for us. My three kids all use Osmo and I will say even my husband and I have been found playing on it. It is hard to describe just how awesome Osmo is but I will try.Osmo uses a mirror that clips onto the top of the iPad. You use the pieces on your table and they reflect onto the screen of the iPad. It is pretty amazing how it works and seems so high tech!I received the Osmo Genius Kit as I mentioned. It is a kit that features everything you need, other than the iPad and free apps you need to download.I cannot believe I hadn't heard of Osmo until recently, it is something I really think everyone with kids and an iPad should own. There is so much you can do with Osmo and they do have plans to create more games and an Android version eventually. For now though the five games are keeping us busy and my kids don't even realize they are learning. From exploring creativity to engineering to problem solving and even words and math. My kids think they are just playing games but they are learning so much and the games seem to grow with them starting with Easy and then moving up.Overall though I cannot say even good things about Osmo. You can even make your own Osmo experience by uploading your own words and pictures! I really like though that you don't need to put pieces on or touch the iPad screen, which sometimes makes me nervous with my kids. These pieces are used strictly on the table rather than on the tablet.I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WOAKQHNK58OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ELZCJS#wasThisHelpful","R1WOAKQHNK58OF","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Friend Cayla is a new doll that is actually the world’s first real talking doll.  She knows millions of things, once you connect her to the app via bluetooth. Her knowledge is based off a cloud based encyclopedia and she can also answer over 1,000 questions about herself. Cayla can even spell words and solve math problems!My Friend Cayla is not just an online-connected doll. She can be used offline as well, perfect for if your on-the-go with her without an internet connection. Offline she can still talk and interact, play games, tell bedtime stories and more as long as she is connected via bluetooth to your tablet.Honestly My Friend Cayla is a pretty amazing doll.  She can do so much that I feel like we haven’t even scratched the surface of her yet. My 4 year old is amazed every time we use her and thinks she is the coolest doll ever. I did obviously have to get her set up for my daughter but otherwise she can do everything on her own. She kind of reminds me of Siri for Apple devices but in the form of a doll that can really interact with someone rather than just answer a question here and there. She is not always 100% perfect but I think that is more of a communication mis-understanding of what my daughter is asking. I haven’t had a problem with anything I have asked yet.To set up My Friend Cayla you do need to pair her with your Android or Apple device (tablet or a smartphone) just like you’d pair a bluetooth headset or speaker. Most of Cayla’s conversational features can be used while she is offline but other features like asking specific questions and such do require a WiFi connection. Cayla herself also required 3 AA batteries but other than that she is ready to go.It did take me a few tries to pair her correctly but ever since she has connected just fine automatically, it was just the first initial setup that I had to try a few times. Her necklace even lights up when she’s connected and ready so you know.Now the one thing I really couldn’t believe about My Friend Cayla is that there is no monthly service fee to use her. I assumed that in addition to the cost of the doll there would be a monthly fee to pay but nope she is free after you buy her! The app is free as well. This is nice because too often I find something super cool only to realize there is a monthly fee that I wasn’t anticipating.Cayla really can be a great friend for a child and keep them socially engaged. I haven’t heard anything inappropriate from her and I like that I have the option to be able to add words I’d rather her not mention or answer questions about. There is a dictionary-type page on the app you input words in you want Cayla to say are inappropriate. Not necessarily for swear words but even if you don’t want your child to ask about something like guns or war. Cayla does have a kid-safe proprietary software called Violet installed that protects your child from any offensive or sensitive words.Cayla can even be customized right down to her name which you can change and you can input personalized items that are your child’s favorite so Cayla can have a “real” conversation with your child. My daughter’s favorite feature is the story time. She can read stories aloud and display on the device for your child to follow along.Looking for a Spanish? You can download the My Friend Cayla Spanish version on your smart device as well!Want to change her clothes? My Friend Cayla is a standard 18 inch doll size and can wear most of any 18 doll’s clothes if you have any. She basically is like other 18 inch dolls from her appearance but she has the added bonus of the app and talking.I think My Friend Cayla is going to be a hot Christmas item this year so I would definitely pick it up sooner than later as Christmas is going to be here before we know it! I will say too that I tried Cayla both via an Android device and an Apple device and there were less hiccups with the Apple device via bluetooth. Not sure if it was just my connection or phone in general but our iPad Mini worked better with her rather than my Android smartphone. For $60 she is definitely a very cool and amazing doll that like I said we have barely scratched the service of because there is so much to her.I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VDIWSHXXLPIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T4JV5G#wasThisHelpful","R3VDIWSHXXLPIN","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It even comes with a Mini Lalaloopsy character: Surprise Party Curls.My 4 year old daughter loves this silly set. She sits with all her Mini Lalaloopsy dolls and they play all around it. You do only get one Lalaloopsy Mini doll so you may want to pick up a few extra, especially if you are giving this as a gift.

"While I am not pregnant, my youngest is 4 years old, I do like everything you get from a pre-natal vitamin. These are jam packed like a multi-vitamin but I love that they are geared towards women, especially women pre/post baby. The gummy taste is good and easy to chew. The dosage is 2 a day so this bottle will last just over a month which is not bad for the cost.

"Well Rockboard Scooters are nothing like we have ever tried. They are a traditional kick scooter but with more uses and actually features increased exercise. They are the perfect alternative to bikes, roller blades, and skateboards.What makes the Rockboard Scooter unique?Well instead of using the same foot and leg to move forward by kicking off the ground, the rider rocks back and forth on the board to achieve a forward motion. So the rider is exercising both legs aerobically! It sounds complicated and strange but it is seriously fun. Yes I have tried ours and I didn't even feel like I was exercising.Propulsion is achieved with each rock, wasting zero energy and allowing the scooter to reach speeds up to 10 mph.Can't decide between a traditional scooter or Rockboard?Well the Rockboard Original offers the best of both worlds. You can use it as a Rockboard Scooter where you rock back and forth to go or lower the board with a few knob twists to a traditional scooter mode.You can even fold up the scooter for easy storage and transportation! It even came with a bag for storage.Wether you want a scooter for fun or transportation, Rockboard has you covered and there is one for all ages starting at 5 years old. Rockboard Scooters offer a way to get around, burn off a few extra calories and have fun. I will say it did take me a few tries to get used to it but now I don't have a problem. My boys had absolutely no problem from the get go and fight over this scooter! It is such a smooth and amazing ride and we get lots of looks when riding around the neighborhood. It is 100% rider-powered, no charging it. There is just nothing like it! It is more expensive than traditional scooters but if you think about how it is like two scooters in one then it really is a good deal and you will be the envy of others by how cool your ride is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H213KZ0S2BU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0059KUK4W#wasThisHelpful","R2H213KZ0S2BU1","A2RVCF21L2NPU5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RVCF21L2NPU5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an adorable DVD where the Lalaloopsy girls star as a band who go on tour and of course has some fun adventures. The animation is adorable and the songs are super silly and cute. The movie is about 45 minutes long. There are even some new characters in this movie that my daughter was excited to see. With this DVD you also get the Digital copy which you can add to your account and watch anywhere - TV, computer, smartphone or tablet.

"My kids have wanted a marble playset forever and now at ages 7 and 8 years old I got them one. This set comes with 82 plastic pieces to build a marble run and then 50 marbles so right out of the box you are ready to go. I love that it comes with 50 marbles because of course we will loose them. Inside is an included guide for building the marble runs although my kids like to create their own. I would post a video but so many reviewers have already. I really appreciate how the pieces are easy enough for my kids to snap together. We've never owned a marble set before so I don't have anything to compare it to but I am happy with this one.

"For the $10 you get 8 razors, which is a good price especially since you'll be throwing these away. This is 8 actual razors rather than razor refills so it is perfect if you prefer whole razors rather than dealing with changing the razor heads. The BIC Flex 3 is the lowest on the quality of BIC Flex razors but they do the job. There is only 3 blades whereas more expensive ones usually have at least five. It does have a nice lubricating strip for an easy shave. I have used these on my legs and underarms and they work just fine.

"This is a disposable razor with 12 razors that after you use up all the razors you throw the razor handle away. It is a three blade razor which honestly is fine.

With this set being disposable it is not the best quality but for the affordable price it does the job. For $12 its like getting 12 razors in one so even if you only use it for a few days before changing the head its worth it.

The ideas in this book are a little of everything from cars to creatures to desks and even food! The creations are amazing. They go from simple to complicated.

I haven't had any problems with them and actually buy them as baby shower gifts.

The base game includes just two colors (red and blue), and you will need additional/different colors action markers (and additional quickcast markers) if you want to play with more than two players. This set includes 10 markers of each color, plus 2 quickcast markers). As others have noted you also need another board for the 3-4 player game, but if you are playing with someone else who has the game that will not be a problem (but, you'll definitely want additional colors to play with more than two players regardless).(2) You like the color purple. As noted above, the base set only includes the colors red and blue (and you can get green and yellow in the first action marker set). But, if someone else has already selected green (my favorite color), I like to use the color purple (my backup choice when possible).  So, this was a must have for me. The other color it includes is gray, so I suppose the same could be said if you like to play gray.Note, you only need one extra set of action markers to play with 3-4 player.  So, if you like green and/or yellow the first one will be a better choice for you, if you like purple and/or gray, this one will be a better choice.

"Tzolk'in is a wonderful game. It has great components, and I especially liked the innovative dynamic worker placement mechanic (i.e., players put their workers on connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots). I also liked that it comes with enough building, monument, and starting wealth tiles to add lots of replayability to the game. And, if you add the Tzolk'in: Tribes and Prophecies you get even more tiles, and more importantly, a few NEW ways to play (see my review of Tribes & Prophecies for a list of what it adds).The main thing we did not like abut it is that it has a pretty steep learning curve (both in terms of the mechanic and good strategies for winning).  To give you a few points of reference, I think it is harder to learn than both Lords of Waterdeep: A Dungeons & Dragons Board Game and The Castles Of Burgundy -- two other fairly complex board game that we also love (and, it is much harder to learn than Stone Age Board Game, another worker placement game that is less complex that we also like quite a bit). So, it's not a great candidate for novice board game players. But, if you like Castles of Burgundy or Lords of Waterdeep (or similar games), and don't mind spending a little more time than usual learning a new game, I think you'll find Tzolk'in is definitely worth the effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20281D09W3UNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XBA390#wasThisHelpful","R20281D09W3UNZ","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zombie Dogz are an interesting addition to Zombicide.  You get 20 dogs total, or 5 each in 4 different poses. You also get 12 spawn cards to add to the zombie deck so you'll know when to place the dogs. As usual, the minis look great, but like their Dog Companion set, the dogs come off of their bases pretty easily (all of mine have come off their bases at one point or another; not ideal, but not a huge deal either since this can be fixed with a little glue).Zombie Dogz are fast and vicious.  They get three actions so they can (1) move, move, move, (2) attack, attack, attack, or (3) just about any other move / attack combo you can think of.  They are also targeted LAST in the target priority order (one of my lease favorite parts of the game in general, and something that makes the dogs particularly nasty).I find the base Zombicide game to be a tough game to win that can be very chaotic. Neither of these things is bad in and of itself, especially since that's what you'd expect from a zombie apocalypse game.  But, Zombie Dogz made it harder and more hectic (especially given the target priority rules mentioned above), which took a little too much away from the game for me to use them very often or at all at this point (thus the reason for my 3 star rating, which on Amazon means, ""it's ok"").I've bee told using the Zombicide Box of Dogs Set #6: Dog Companions expansion with Zombie Dogz can help even things out at least a little.  But, while I have used them separately I have not yet used them together so cannot say for sure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGT5E0A5OKYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4C9X6A#wasThisHelpful","RGT5E0A5OKYJ","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set comes with 6 dogs... 2 German Shepherd (2 attack dice, 3+ to hit, 1 damage), 2 Blue Heeler (3 attack dice, 4+ to hit, 1 damage), and 2 America Bulldog (1 attack dice, 3+ to hit, 2 damage).Some key dog rules: (1) Dogs do not get actions -- instead their handeler can spend their actions to command a dog do do something, (2) dogs can move (up to 3 squares for an action -- or freely with their handler), melee attack, make noise, and get into or out of a car (and the German Shepard and Blue Heeler can also search), and (3) dogs die when they receive their first wound. Also, You can put dogs in the equipment pile and draw them at random, or you can assign dogs to survivors at the beginning of the game.In sum, companion dogs add some nice variety to the game, and also make the game a little easier because they can reach and attack zombies before they get to the survivor's zone, can take damage instead of a survivor, can draw zombies in a different direction, or slow zombies down while they attack the dogs. These are all good thing in a game that is otherwise very tough to win.  The minis look great, but as others have noted they fall off the base pretty easy (all of mine eventually came lose from the base); not ideal, but not too had to fix either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUKPVMN2M0ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4CDK78#wasThisHelpful","R3NUKPVMN2M0ZI","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After playing Zombicide and Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak several times, I've decided to give it 3 stars (which on Amazon means ""It's ok"").I know lots of people love this game and I mean no disrespect to anyone by saying this. I liked the idea enough to play the original multiple times, and also to buy and play Season 2 multiple times in hopes that it improved upon the original. And, as is often the case with many games people feel differently about, I imagine others might value some of the very things I did not like about it. It's definitely got some things going for it (see next paragraph), it just has a few things that took some of the fun out of it for me (and, I've read reviews on other sites like Board Game Geek that suggests at least some other people feel the same way).  So, I thought people might want appreciate an alternative point of view so they could make a more informed decision.  That said...There is no doubt that the minis are awesome, and the fact that it is co-op is a major plus. I also liked this zombie mechanic better than the Last Night on Earth zombie mechanic (i.e., Zombicide zombies are dumb and move/attack using a predetermined algorithm, where as LNoE zombies seemed pretty resourceful and strategic given all the cards they can play to mess with the survivors).Unfortunately, there were many things I also disliked. For example:(1) The targeting priority system does not make any sense to me. It is crazy that you have to attack other survivors first -- especially without a save. And, why would I attack the lowest threat zombie when there is a higher threat zombie standing right next to it? I wouldn't, but the game makes me!(2) It is very easy to run out of zombies, which gives those zombies you run out of an extra activation (an effect that is cumulative, and makes the game harder still). I have yet to play a game where we don't run out of one or more types of zombies on a regular basis.(3) Some of the zombies are very hard or nearly impossible to kill. In fact, just about the only way to kill the abominations is with a Molotov cocktail (of which there are only 2, and they are very hard to make as you have to find a glass bottle and gas card first, and make sure the same person has both of these cards).(4) Survivors die way to easily. Lots of people house rule this, but I would very much have preferred the survivors to have a fighting chance to begin with. And, there are not lots of ways heal in this version (so, once you take a wound it's hard to get rid of it... which is pretty bad since you only need two wounds to die).(5) The game is very random and requires very little skill (in fact, most of the decisions are very obvious). The zombies you draw are random, the equipment cards you draw are random (which is problematic since many of them are also useless), and while the zombies always hit, survivors must roll a D6 to see if they hit. And, as mentioned above, you cannot always chose what zombie you attack and are sometimes forced to attack a survivor before a zombie.On the one hand all this means it really has a chaotic zombie apocalypse feel to it (we all know the odds are against you in a zombie apocalypse). And, given that the game is so popular in general, the above issues are obviously not a big problem to many (and I mean no disrespect to those who love the game by saying any of this). On the other hand they made the game a bit boring since it doesn't involve much strategy and there is not much you can do besides search for better items that increases your chance of successful attack vs. a zombie you may not want to attack anyway.

"I played Zombicide Base Game a couple of times and decided to buy this version after hearing it was better than the original in many ways (and finding it on sale for 50% off, which seemed like an especially good deal to me).  After several plays I've decided to give it 3 stars (which on Amazon means ""It's ok"").I know lots of people love this game and I mean no disrespect to anyone by saying this.

Some were things I also disliked about the original game, and some were new issues (or issues that were made worse by the new game).  For example:(1) The targeting priority system does not make any sense to me.  It is crazy that you have to attack other survivors first -- especially without a save. And, why would I attack the lowest threat zombie when there is a higher threat zombie standing right next to it? I wouldn't, but the game makes me!  And, since there are more types of zombies in this set, the targeting priority system seems even more out of whack.  I think the game should think for the zombies, and let the survivors/players think for themselves.(2) It is very easy to run out of zombies, which gives those zombies you run out of an extra activation (an effect that is cumulative, and makes the game harder still). This problem is bad in this edition because while you get more zombies total (78 in Prison outbreak vs. 65 in the first game), you actually get fewer regular zombies (only 49) and fewer still berserker zombies (only 29).  I have yet to play a game where we don't run out of one or more types of zombies on a regular basis.(3) Some of the zombies are very hard or nearly impossible to kill. In fact, the only way to kill the abominations is with a Molotov cocktail (of which there are only 2, and they are very hard to make) or the concrete saw (of which there is only 1, and thank god for it as it is a new addition to this version of the game).(4) Survivors die way to easily.  And, I'm not a fan of the zombivore system they came up with in this edition to deal with this. I would very much have preferred the survivors to have a fighting chance to begin with.  And, there is no way to heal in this version (so, once you take a wound there is no getting rid of it... which is pretty bad since you only need two wounds to die).(5) The game is very random and requires very little skill (in fact, most of the decisions are very obvious).  The zombies you draw are random, the equipment cards you draw are random (which is problematic since many of them are also useless), and while the zombies always hit, survivors must roll a D6 to see if they hit. And, as mentioned above, you cannot always chose what zombie you attack and are sometimes forced to attack a survivor before a zombie.(6) And, if all that were not enough, the rules are not very well written and include some important omissions. The one that comes to mind right now is that they never explicitly state when you should draw regular zombies and when you draw berserker zombies.  After groping around the components and looking around online I was finally able to figure out that the cards with knives on them mean you draw berserker zombies and the cards without the knives on them mean you draw regular zombies.  But, why did I have to spend any time on this at all (that is, why didn't they just state this in the rules)?  This is just one example.On the one hand all this means it really has a chaotic zombie apocalypse feel to it (we all know the odds are against you in a zombie apocalypse). And, given that the game is so popular in general, the above issues are obviously not a big problem to many.

"Tzolk'in: Tribes and Prophesies is like getting four expansions in one (or five if you count that it lets you include a fifth player).1. There are 13 tribe tiles that give each player a unique special ability.  You are dealt two at random and get to pick which one you want to keep. Examples include (a) getting to star with five rather than just three workers (but you also have to pay more corn to feed each worker, and there is a greater penalty for each worker you do not feed); (b) getting to pay less to place workers (i.e., it used to be 0 corn for 1 worker, 1 corn for 2 workers, up to 15 corn for 6 workers... now you might pay 1 less to place 0-4 workers, and 2 less to place 5 or 6 workers); and (c) letting you take workers form one wheel but using an ability of the same level from a different wheel (i.e., you would treat Tikal and Uxmal the same, or Yaxchilan and Palenque the same).2. There are 13 prophecy tiles that add short term goals for each quarter of the game (i.e., before each food day). Each one has a negative and possibly a positive effect.  For example, you might have to pay a corn or resource to go up a level on a temple, but you get or lose extra victory points for doing so (i.e.,  you might go down a few points if you haven't achieved at least three levels, or go up 13 points if you achieved at least 10 levels). These are a little too punitive for my taste (so we don't use them as much as the others), but they do add a new dimension and short term goals to the game that some might find interesting.3. There are 8 new buildings (4 Age 1 Buildings + 4 Age 2 Buildings).  And many of these buildings add a new dimension to the game like providing a reward (corn, wood, stone, gold) each time you feed your tribe, or allowing you to trade in an existing building to use the resources used to build it to upgrade (or renovate) to a different building or even a monument.4. Finally, it introduces ""Quick Actions"" that you can select instead of or in addition to the already existing actions. These are randomly placed on the main gear (and there are 7 for Age 1, and 6 for Age 2). A quick action might give you corn, a resource, or allow you to advance a level in technology by paying the usual cost.  You pick up workers from the Quick Action Spaces at the end of your turn (similar to how you would if you selected the first player space), rather than waiting until the next turn.  This makes them available immediately which can come in handy.All that, and it includes everything you need to play with 5 player rather just 4 from the base game (i.e., 1 orange score marker, 6 orange meeples, 7 orange technology/temple markers, plus an extra player board, plenty of extra wood/corn harvest tiles, and 30 wooden resource tiles -- wood, stone, gold).When you consider that you can use each component separately, or add two or more together in many different combinations, this expansion really does add a ton of replayability to an already fun game.  But, it also adds one or more layers of complexity, which might be too much for some people given the base game already has a steep learning curve.  But, if you have figured out and like the base game, you should have no trouble figuring out these additions, too (especially since some -- like tribes -- are pretty easy to incorporate).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HO7FLH47CTYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HESHFPO#wasThisHelpful","R1HO7FLH47CTYH","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally wrote this review for and you can get it a little cheaper here: Rivals for Catan. So, please excuse me if you read it twice (but, I thought I'd include it here as well since I didn't know where folks would start).As noted in many of my other game reviews, I'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance. She is what some would call a ""reluctant gamer"" whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to. She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session). And, while there are definitely some luck and strategy components in The Rivals for Catan, after four plays including one with the Era of Gold theme, this game really felt ""just ok"" to us (and on Amazon three stars = just ok).Luck components come in the form of (1) the production dice -- which tells you which resources you get; (2) the event dice -- which lets you know what benefits or drawbacks might occur in that round; and (3) which cards you draw from the draw stack. Strategy components include (1) what you decide to add to your principality -- and when; (2) when you play various action cards; and (3) how much you complete for Strength Advantage, Trade Advantage, Skill Points, and Progress Points.After our four games, things felt a more luck than strategy based (i.e., a lot is out of you control and depends on both random dice rolls and mostly random card selection). And, we really didn't feel there was need for much interaction or many real / non-obvious decisions to make, both of which took quite a bit out of the game for us. And while we liked the game enough to keep it and give it an occasional spot in our rotation (in the hopes there is more there than we saw after our first four games), I doubt it will see much regular play.As a side note, the instructions say it comes with 2 wooden game pieces -- 1 hero token and 1 trade token. However, ours came with acrylic game tokens. More importantly, the symbol on the new acrylic hero token does not match the hero symbol on the cards or in the rulebook. That is, the hero symbol in the rules and in on all the cards is a battleaxe (this was also the symbol on the old wooden token which is still included as an illustration in the rules). However, the symbol on the acrylic token is a knight on horseback carrying a flag (not sure why it couldn't have at least been a battleaxe). This is a bit confusing/annoying in general, especially since the symbol for trade is a scale on the old token, the new token, and the cards. None of this is a huge deal for a game we didn't love anyway, but a bit of a turn off that they changed the components but not the instructions (and that in the process some of the symbols no longer match).","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38YILG6VA39QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BK7I8M#wasThisHelpful","R38YILG6VA39QK","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ticket to Ride 10th Anniversary Edition is a wonderfully and beautifully redesigned version of the original game.  It includes everything from BOTH the original Ticket To Ride, PLUS the Ticket To Ride 1910 Expansion  (which is the way it really should have been released in the first place in my humble opinion).  Game play is exactly the same, but the components are different.  Here is a list of the key differences:BOX: The box is noticeably bigger and much heavier.  It includes an extremely well-designed insert to keep everything nicely in place.MAP: The map is also bigger (it measures approximately 38 x 26 inches, whereas the original measures approximately 31 x 22 inches) and uses a new/different artwork. The routes on the map are the same as the original.TRAIN CARS: On of the nice parts of this edition is the new plastic train cars. Instead of being the same just in a different color, each train uses a completely different design -- red circus car, blue passenger car, green caboose, yellow stripped barrel car, and black coal car. Each type of car comes with its own clearly marked tin for storage. However, one reason I'm giving this 4 rather than 5 stars is that I must admit that the cars, while nice, feel lower in quality/more fragile than I hoped. I've included a couple of photos in the customer's images page so you can compare the old cars to the new ones, and see how they fit on the old boards.TRAIN CARDS: The front of train cards use new/different artwork, and are marked ""10th Anniversary."" The back of the train cards looks like the box cover (i.e., black with the ""10th Anniversary"" logo). Also, these are FULL-SIZE cards (like the ones that came in the 1910 expansion), not the smaller cards that came in the original USA game.DESTINATION TICKETS: The front of destination tickets also use new/different artwork, and are marked ""10th Anniversary.""  Plus, each cards is still marked ""Classic"" or ""USA 1910"" to denote where the card originally came from. Ditto regarding the larger card size.SCORE MARKERS: It includes five larger (about 1 inch) square-shaped wooden score markers -- they come in red, blue, green, yellow, & black.The MSRP of $99.99, but you can get it for between 20% off on Amazon at the time this review was written, and sometimes more if you shop around online (for example, I got my copy for $70). This is the other reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars (still seems a little pricey in general, especially given the quality of some of the components).  But, we are big TTR fans (we own the original with the 1910 expansion, Nordic Countries, Alvin & Dexter, plus Map Collections 1-4), and remain excited to have this addition in our collection.That said, if you just want the experience of playing the game, the original version plus the 1910 expansion will probably do (these two together were going for about $55 on Amazon at the time this review was written -- though you can get them for at least a little less if you shop around online).  But, if you want to celebrate the 10th anniversary of a great game and have something a little out of the ordinary, I think you'll find this to be a worthwhile edition of the game. It's a great set, and the only reasons I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish the quality of the train cars were a little better, and/or that the price could have been a little lower. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it.EDIT: One quick addition based on a review I read below (in case you don't also read that review). The rules for the 1910 expansion were somehow omitted from this edition.  This is a pretty big and unfortunate omission, and a little embarrassing form Days of Wonder, I'm sure. For those who don't already have the 1910 rules, you can download them for free from the DoW web site (just do a search for ""Ticket to Ride 1910 rules.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CCR835O7EYG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG4BBBO#wasThisHelpful","R2CCR835O7EYG5","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:55 MinsThe TIE Defender is one of four ""Wave 4"" expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game. I think there are some good reasons to add one or maybe two TIE Defenders to your Imperial fleet (since the least expensive one cost 30 points, you'll not be able to use more than three in a 100 point game).To begin with it has some pretty good basic stats: 3 attack, 3 defense, 3 hull, and 3 shields. It can perform thee different actions (barrel roll, target lock, and focus), and be upgraded with up to three cards depending on which version you take.  Plus, it is the first ship that can do a WHITE K-Turn (and being able to take an action after a K-Turn -- or doing multiple K-Turns in a row -- will come in pretty handy).Pilots include:(1) Delta Squadron Pilot, a level 1 non-unique pilot that costs 30 points.(2) Onyx Squadron Pilot, a level 3 non- unique pilot that costs 32 points. This is a good example of what I mean when I say they are a little pricy for what you get.  The Firespray -31 Bounty Hunter is also level 3 and can take three actions and even more upgrades, but costs 33 points and has 3 attack, 2 defense, 5 hull, and 5 shield.  It's a little less maneuverable but has both fore and aft firing arcs to make up for this. It's a little harder to fly because of its large base, but it gets easier with practice.  So, I'm not sure why I'd take this over a Bounty Hunter in most instances since neither of them have a special ability.(3) Colonel Vessery, a level 6 unique pilot that costs 35 points, with what seems to me to be only an o.k. situational special ability that reads, ""When attacking, immediately after you roll attack dice, you may acquire a target lock on the defender if it already has a red target lock token.""(4) Raxler Brath, a level 8 unique pilot that costs 37 points, with another o.k. situational ability (i.e., requires you have a focus token left after you attack) that reads ""After you perform an attack that deals at least 1 Damage card to the defender, you may spend a focus token to flip those cards faceup.""It also includes one previously released upgrades (Ion Cannon), three upgrade that also comes with other Wave 4 ships (Ion Pulse Missiles -- a 3 point which can assign TWO ion tokens to a ship, Munitions Failsafe -- which lets you keep a secondary weapon if it doesn't hit, and Outmaneuver -- a 3 point elite talent that reduces your targets agility by one if you are not also in their firing arc), plus one that was exclusive to this expansion at the time it was released (Predator -- a 3 point elite talent that lets you reroll 1 attack dice, or 2 if firing vs. a pilot skill 2 or less).As with all expansions, this one includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play).While this is not my favorite ship in Wave 4, it does add a few nice new things in and of itself to the game, plus some new upgrades that can be used on it as well as other ships.  So, I think getting one is definitely worthwhile, and more than that may be worth it depending on your style of play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFI6Z3GNCKFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616617721#wasThisHelpful","R3GFI6Z3GNCKFK","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The item description says this item contains six double sided terrain tiles, but that's not quite true. It does contain six double sided sheets, but four of them break out into multiple (between 5 and 13) smaller double sided tiles. All in all there are 38 double-sided tiles in this set (for a grand total of 76 images). Here is a brief description of what's on each tile:TILE 1 (one 8x10 square tile): Empty grey tile floor/room on one side, and open brown grate tile floor with two computer consoles (low objects/hindering terrain) on the other side.TILE 2 (one 8x10 square tile): Empty grey tile floor/room on one side, and grey tile floor/room with some low objects/hindering terrain on the other side.TILE 3 (five tiles ranging from 2x4 squares tiles to 4x8 squares): Empty grey tiles on one side (to expand the size of rooms or for hallways), and steps and shaft with walkway on the other side (mostly for hallways/walkways).TILE 4 (five tiles ranging from 2x4 squares tiles to 4x8 squares): Empty grey tiles on one side (to expand the size of rooms or for hallways), various hindering terrain (pits, low objects) on the other side.TILE 5 (thirteen tiles ranging from 1x1 square to 2x8 squares): Empty grey or grate tiles on one side (to expand rooms or for hallways/walkways), and various hindering terrain (doors, pits, low objects) on the other side.TILE 6 (thirteen tiles ranging from 1x1 square to 2x8 squares): Empty grey or grate tiles on one side (to expand rooms or for hallways/walkways and some hindering terrain), and grates (to expand rooms or for hallways/walkways) and various other objects (doors, turbo lifts, etc.) on other side.On the plus side, the images are high quality, and they are printed on a very thick, high quality card stock that should hold up for many uses. I also like that there are several smaller tiles rather than just six big tiles. Because of this, the set is fairly versatile and can be used to create numerous maps. Three sample complexes that can be made with these tiles are provided on the inside package, but I see many possibilities - especially if you buy more than one pack. So all in all, you get a fair amount of bang for your buck.On the minus side, the various types of terrain are not marked (walls, low objects, hindering terrain, pits, etc.), so these tiles cannot be used with the Star Wars minis game. I recognize these were designed for the RPG and not the minis game, but it would have been VERY easy for Wizards have given us a (Ploovo) Two-For-One by also making these tiles usable with the minis game (after all, that's what they did with the D&D minis cards -- they put stats/info for both the minis game and the RPG on each and every card). I'm very disappointed they didn't do something like that here.In sum, if you play the Star Wars RPG and want an easy way to create your own maps, I think you'll be happy with this item. But, if you were hoping to use them for the Star Wars minis game (i.e., Rebel Storm, Clone Strike, etc.), I would pass on these tiles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8KK3HEFN518/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Q7X55G#wasThisHelpful","RY8KK3HEFN518","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As noted in many of my other relevant game reviews, I'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance. She is what some would call a ""reluctant gamer"" whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to. She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session).Ra was a real pleasant surprise that we both ended up liking quite a bit. We have played a few games by Reiner Knizia (and I have played several others without her), and this is one of the few we (or I) have really liked. We decided to try it because it was a dice game and we hadn't really done any of those at the time we purchased this one. Since it is a dice game it involves a fair amount of luck. But, it also has some very clever and easy to grasp strategy components that we have both enjoyed. The game-theme fit is ok at best, but the game mechanics more than make up for it in this instance. I believe it is out of print (hopefully they'll consider reprinting it again at some point), so I bought a gently used copy. I'm glad I did as we play it on a regular basis and always enjoy it when we do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VURUFRC9XGCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MNH9QQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VURUFRC9XGCA","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't normally write negative reviews. And, if you look at this and similar products on Amazon.com, it seems that 72% of the people who write comments gave it 4 or 5 stars, while 20% of writers gave it 1 or 2 stars.And, mine worked well for the first couple of months. The sound wasn't great, but was fine and better than expected for $30, which is what it was selling for when I bought it. If I rated it right away I would probably have given it 4 stars. Curious to know how many folks who initially gave it 4 or 5 stars do and don't still feel that way a few months later.But, I thought it worth adding my voice to the smaller chorus of folks who had a negative experience with these speakers. Again, they worked well at first, but after a couple of months the battery barely held a charge and the bluetooth and volume control were so flaky that it just wasn't worth the trouble anymore. I knew the risks from the other reviews when I bought it, and it wasn't overly expensive, so I'm not particularly upset by any of this. I just wanted folks to know so they could make an informed choice.At best it is unreliable, and there seems to be at least a 1 in 5 chance you'll have a bad experience with yours. Only you can decide if it is worth the risk to you (turns out, I chose unwisely).

"The 28 Days Later comic/graphic novel series is one of my favorite zombie-themed stories (slightly below the Walking Dead, and well above the rest of the zombie themed graphic novels I've read). The series covers the time period between the two movies 28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition) & 28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition). The Omnibus contains ALL 6 volumes/24 issues from the series.  The story is top notch, and the artwork is wonderful.  It contains a familiar character (Selena) as well as some solid new ones.  All that, and the Omnibus is a great deal for $32 (the price it was listed on Amazon at the time this review was written).

"I live in AZ and we drive to the grand canyon a couple of times each year when we want a particularly challenging hike (usually the South Rim). This is by far the best map of the Grand Canyon we have come across, and it is the only map we use at this point.Just to give you a point of reference, we have hiked (1) down and up the Bright Angel -- to Plateau Point; (2) down and up the South Kaibab -- to Skeleton Point; (3) ALL the way down the Bright Angel and up the South Kaibab; and (4) ALL the way down the South Kaibab and up the Bright Angel.  Plus, last summer we did our best hike ever: RIM-TO-RIM-TO-RIM (one day each way, with a one day break in between).  And, a few weeks ago we went down the South Kaibab, across the Tonto Trail -- which is about 3/4 the way down, and up the Bright Angel. So, we've hiked just about every trail in the main area of the South Rim, plus a little of the North Rim.  And, this map accompanied us every step of the way.Our favorite things about the map include (1) it is VERY easy to read -- much easier than any other I have of the area; (2) it includes distance information for each trail segment which you can easily add together to figure out how long your hike is going to be or how far you have left to go, (3) it indicates where there is fresh drinking water along the trail -- though you should keep in mind that some of this water is seasonal; and (4) it is printed on waterproof plastic/paper so even though I've used it for the past several years it is still in very good shape. In sum, I highly recommend this map if you are thinking about hiking any part of the Grand Canyon that this map covers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGT3ZGYEG3FQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0966550846#wasThisHelpful","R1HGT3ZGYEG3FQ","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in AZ and do day hikes in the Superstition mountains many times each year.  We usually hike the Canyon Lake, Peralta, First Water, Lost Dutchman, and others. We prefer loops but also do a few there and back round trips.  We usually hike 8 or so miles at a time, but have done trails in the area ranging from 4-17 miles (and we've done many different loops of various distances from the Peralta and First Water trailheads... which is one of the best parts of hinking in this area -- there are LOTS of options). So, I think it is fair to say that we have used this map, and used it a lot. Unfortunately, I purchased several maps of the area before I happened across this one (all were ok but not great).  But, since I found this one I never use any other.  This one is VERY easy to read (much easier than any other I have).  Everything is very clearly marked and easy to follow.

"I looked high and low for a circle punch that cut 1.75 inch circles for a project I am working on.  Lots of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 inch, but few 1.75 inches.  After finding this one on Amazon and reading the great reviews, I decided to give this one a try.  I'm glad I did.  I cut mostly card stock, and this punch has no trouble cutting through even thicker paper.  Plus, there is a view finder on the bottom so you can see what you are cutting (which is very helpful to me since the circles I needed to cut are marked and I need to cut them in precisely the right place).  I also like that it locks when I'm not using it (keeps it a little flatter and makes it easier to store). All things considered I'm very happy with this item, and knowing what I know now I'd buy it again without hesitation.8/12/14 update... Downgraded from 5 to 4 stars because it is already having trouble cutting through thinner paper.

"This is an abridged version of the Star Wars: A New Hope story.  The story itself is about 25 pages (with about 10-30 words per page in an over-sized font, and lots of pictures). They do a wonderful job using Lego minifigures and sets to tell the story (relying mostly on scenes from Tatooine and the Death Star).  And, I'm actually surprised they managed to capture the essence of the story in so few words and images.  Keep in mind that this is their Level 1 reader, which is designed for kids in grades K-2.

"As far as the mini expansions go, I place Cursed somewhere between Small World Grand Dames Expansion Board Game (2nd Printing) (which I gave 2 stars because we don't use it anymore) and Small World Be Not Afraid Expansion Board Game (which I gave 4 stars because we like most of the races and banners quite a bit).I'm giving this one 3 stars mostly because it only includes 2 new races (Goblins & Kobolds) that we have found to be good but not great. It also include 5 new special powers (Cursed, Ransacking, Hordes of, Were-, & Marauding), a couple of which we liked quite a bit.  ""Cursed"" in particular adds a nice twist to the game if you like that sort of thing (which we sometimes do).  It doesn't actually give you a special power or extra race tokens, but you have to pay 3 gold to skip it instead of 1 (so by the time someone takes it it could be worth quite a few points in and of itself). We also liked ""Were-"", which works during the day (even number turns) but not during the night (odd number turns). The others fell into the ""just ok"" category for us (which is what 3 stars means on Amazon).In sum, we do like it enough to use it sometimes, but not enough to use it every time we play.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R40FH2WRWPBL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WDKA6W#wasThisHelpful","R40FH2WRWPBL2","A3VSBJEA4KBGBP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VSBJEA4KBGBP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Another great game from Elephant Games via Big Fish.  Great spooky atmosphere, easy to navigate haunted school.  There is a detailed map that allows teleporting but I didn't need it as much as in some other games.  There were a few times when inventory items had to be hauled back and forth across many screens (which is a good time to use the map!) but not all the time.  I got moderately stuck once or twice, but managed to get out of it without using a hint.  There are not too many hidden object scenes, a major plus.  The mini-games varied from a bit too easy to quite hard, with a good mix in between.  There are a few short clip scenes, but emphasis on short, and the dialogue screens, also not many, can be clicked through if you are a fast reader and impatient (!)Although I experienced no glitches within the game on my HDX 8.9 Fire, I did have a few issues with the Fire after I was about halfway through.  Specifically, if I exited the game and shut off the screen (without actually turning the Fire off) when I turned the screen back on I sometimes had no carousel, just a blank screen.  Or I had the carousel but nothing worked.  Turning off the Fire and turning it back on always resolved the issues and this only happened when I played the game.  Going into ""Settings"" after you have finished a game session, and doing a Force Stop on the game will also prevent the problem if it happens on your device.  Not a big deal, but I mention it because it scared the heck out of me when my Fire seemed to be acting up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCINYXJ6GN0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NM05PO#wasThisHelpful","R3TCINYXJ6GN0N","A2UQGGK8VJPUH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGGK8VJPUH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unbelievably, this game is still available on a different page for full price of $2.99!  Why anyone would bite on that now is a mystery.  Why Amazon still has the full-price listing is another mystery, but that seems to be the way of it with these ""Actually Free"" games.  While it's true you pay no money, and they are the same as the full-price versions, you are required to go into your Fire settings and turn on the setting that allows Amazon to snoop on everything you do.  This may or may not bother you.  It doesn't bother me that much, but being a persnickety person, I make sure to change the setting back when I'm not playing one of these free games.

"I used to enjoy Playtinium Games.  When this one first came out back in 2013, I couldn't buy it because it was not compatible with either Kindle Fire I owned at the time.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't compatible with the 8.9"" HDX Fire I bought last year either -- until now.  I had trouble going left just like everybody else, but then the glitch with going left was fixed.  Admittedly I was surprised it WAS fixed, being that this is an old game released long ago.  Anyway, I was able to get on with the game, but I was not impressed with the touch response and with the graphics in general.  I didn't mind the math problem near the beginning.  Some of the mini-games I thought were a bit tedious with needing to remember complicated symbols set down elsewhere in the game.  A piece of paper and a pencil was a necessity for me and I don't like this in a video game -- give me a journal or a camera or something to remember clues.  It's no fun to have to backtrack several screens for a complex clue and then remember it all when you get to the puzzle.The mini-game that was the last straw for me was the one that involved remembering numbers and symbols that covered a whole page of a ""book.""  You had to plug the numbers into a puzzle, while also remembering the numbers in a story in another ""book.""  I really didn't feel like copying all that stuff down just to do a silly mini-game, and I decided to call the whole thing quits.  Life is too short.

"I am SO glad I did not bite on actually paying money for this game!  And in fact, if you are not paying attention, you can still spend money for the game if you come across it on another page, which is the way of it with all the ""Actually Free"" games.  This game has the most irritating narration I have ever encountered.  Not only that, it holds your hand at every step, and seems to be mostly some variation on hidden objects.  Plus every time you change screens, and I do mean EVERY time, you are subject to a ""Loading"" screen for several long seconds.Just as a heads up, there is one difference between the ""Actually Free"" and the paid versions and that is the fact that if you are doing the free version (which I highly recommend you do!) Amazon requires you to adjust a setting on the Fire that allows them to snoop on your activity.  This may or may not bother you, and to be fair, they do warn you of this when you try to open the game.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAD2RPUZKXJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119U55E0#wasThisHelpful","R2QAD2RPUZKXJ8","A2UQGGK8VJPUH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGGK8VJPUH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the better run of the mill, door escape games.  You still don't get labeled inventory but at least the screens are brighter and more interesting.  It's not hard though, and like the others of this type, the hardest thing is figuring out what the inventory objects are because the graphics are pretty sub-par, compared to games from developers like Alawar and Big Fish  -- which often run about the same price or only a little more.

"I am completely baffled by all the four and five star reviews.  This book is terrible.  As others have noted, Holmes and Watson are NOTHING like Conan Doyle's creations.  They don't talk or behave like Holmes and Watson, and it's not just the anachronistic dialog.  Holmes would NEVER say some of things he says here.  The stories themselves are dull, dull, dull.  It seems like the author got bored with them herself and just ended them abruptly whenever she had something better to do elsewhere.  There are lots and lots of great Holmes and Watson pastiches.

"I probably would have given this game five stars if the hidden object scenes hadn't increased so much after roughly the halfway point.  Up until then I was quite pleased that there weren't too many, but later on it seemed like they were around every corner.  Some of the items were hard to find too.  I used hints for the last few objects in many of them, but then I never have much patience with hidden objects.  Once in a while the tap response wasn't the best in those scenes either.  The map wasn't the worst one I've ever seen but it wasn't as detailed as many.  It did allow you to teleport, but not necessarily into the exact scene you wanted.Otherwise, the game was pretty good.  The story was a little different from what's been out there lately; there was no animal helper and the clip scenes were not too long or annoying.  The graphics were quite good.  The puzzles were a mix of the old chestnuts and a few moderately new ones.  There were several of the jigsaw puzzle type and they were no snap to do.The game is on the short side, but not excessively so, and there is an, also short, bonus round.  I had no problems playing it on an HDX 8.9 Fire, not a single glitch aside from the  aforementioned occasional sluggish tap response in the hidden object scenes. All in all, this game was better than what I expected from Artifex Mundi, which is not my favorite game developer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHEJ0BF3TG9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015520EOE#wasThisHelpful","R2LHEJ0BF3TG9Q","A2UQGGK8VJPUH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGGK8VJPUH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was also expecting great things from this game, based on the ""Brink of Consciouness"" label.  The last Brink of Consciousness game was great, one of the best.  This one is sadly lacking.  First of all, the obnoxious, ever-present long drawn out clip scenes and dialog.  Game Developers:  Here's a hint - I want to play the game!  I do not want the game to play itself!  The adventuring was very by-the-numbers.  The game map was a joke.  Just circles that looked like molecule diagrams - no labels or graphics to tell you where you are or where you are going.  The further you get in the game, the more blank circles.  Even if you could teleport using it (which you can't) it wouldn't help because you would have no way of being sure where you were going.  Oh, and there were no levels of difficulty to choose from either, you take what the game makers give you, which were sparkles and no mistap penalties in the hidden object scenes.  Speaking of the hidden object scenes, at least there weren't an awful lot of them, and they were easy to get through, being the old fashioned no frills kind.This was obviously an older game, maybe spiffed up a little, and re-released.  It just screamed first generation game, with its afterthought map and endless dialog.  One of those games when you're sorry you bought the unlock.  No glitches though, playing on a Fire HDX 8.9.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277XOFMJKNLRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DDJ3PQ#wasThisHelpful","R277XOFMJKNLRO","A2UQGGK8VJPUH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGGK8VJPUH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game got better as it went along, which was a good thing because at first I regretted buying the unlock.  I didn't think the graphics were that good, although they weren't terrible.  I've just seen better.  There were a lot of clip scenes at the beginning, which I always find kind of boring if they are too long.  I don't like the game playing itself!  There were fewer and shorter ones later on.  The hidden object scenes were fairly easy and not as many as some other games.  I don't mind having to manipulate things in HOS, I even like it if there are a lot of puzzles within the HOS.  I just don't like having too many HOS and objects too hard to find.  In this game the HOS didn't bug me too much.Like its predecessor, Serpent Creek, this game had an oddball thing going on, where you had to find nine objects of interest within a regular (not HO) scene.  Since you generally had no idea in advance what objects would be of interest you just tap on anything that looks like anything.  If it's one of the objects of interest, it sparkles.  Then the ""objects"" turn into nine tiles that you must arrange in the order of what you think happened before you arrived on the scene.  I found the tiles hard to decipher and so I usually arranged them according to the colors of their frames and the pink ""ribbon"" running through them.  After you got the tiles right, you were treated to a clip scene in silhouette of what happened before you got there.  I found this as tedious and boring as it was in Serpent Creek, but happily the developers seemed to get tired of it too, and it only was done in probably the first half of the game.During the early mid-part of the game I had some screen change delays that resulted in a black screen for a few seconds.  This went away after a while.  Otherwise there were no glitches on my Fire HDX.  The adventuring was VERY easy, with found objects being almost always used in the same scene, or the one next door.  There is a useful map with enough detail and labels to let you know where you are, and to teleport you if needed.  I found that the asylum was easy enough to navigate that I didn't need to consult the map much.I appreciate that this game was not another fairy tale and there was no animal helper.  The story line was fine, and in the end I was glad I bought the unlock.  I got it for $2.99 though; don't know if I would recommend paying $4.99 for such a short game with no bonus round.  Maybe wait for a sale again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WS4RB6N90GOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158V07EE#wasThisHelpful","R1WS4RB6N90GOH","A2UQGGK8VJPUH5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGGK8VJPUH5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I must say that I have never had earrings with this exact type of setting (a wire that clips into a hook at the bottom) and I don't like it.  To me, from the front, the wire assembly is very apparent and detracts from the appearance, especially since the earrings hang oddly and stiffly.  I would not buy earrings made like this again.

"I don't usually read this kind of book (I'm more of a short story,  classic cozy or Sherlock Holmes type) and I only took it because it was free.  However, having said that I found it to be a page turner that kept me reading despite some flaws in characterization.  The writing style and dialog were fairly natural and good, or at least not annoying (more than I can say for a modern ""cozy"" that I just finished.)  I didn't find the plot all that implausible although perhaps it could have been tightened a bit.  I liked the fact that the book was only around 200 pages, rather than the bloated messes that are popular now.  I'm afraid I did guess the villain rather early on, and the ending was a bit rushed, but not bad.

"This is a horror version of the supernatural.  A coven of five had convened with other supernatural agents to overthrow this world and allow the seven fallen angels to take over the Earth.  The two noble members turned on the common folk who were given over to the Church authorities for torture and burning.  This book follows the descendants and those who have come across them across the years following.  The book pulls no imagery.  The specifics of witch terror and torture are specified.  Also discussed in harrowing detail are the activities of these agents of evil and the picture is disquieting.  For all of this,  the prose is strangely lyrical and evokes another world beyond our ken.  The characters are in fact multidimensional for all the emphasis on the other side.

"Anne Rice is arguably the founder of the plethora of vampire stories now deep on the ground.  Many of these have merits, but Rice continues to be the master of  the genre. Anne Rice fills  her writing with literate and well thought out philosophy of the meaning of immortality.  She does it in an unassuming manner that never intrudes on the sense of suspense and breathlessness that the plot demands.  Her language is lovely and her dialogues effortless.  I think due to her popularity, this skill has been underrated by the critics.When Rice began to the accounts of the modern vampires, I was swept away by the premise of a rock star, Lestat, emerging with his nocturnal ways, fashionable figure and entrancing pallor.  It was a breathless idea to link the two identities.  Over the years, I have wondered how she could maintain the level of invention with this story line, but she has always risen to the occasion.  This book is another penultimate achievement.  I think it is because of the underlying quest of our vampires for meaning that the books retain their vitality.This book enmeshed me from the start.  Some little reasons are the skill she uses to describe the details of his world.  She is a master of ""rich porn"", describing the opulence of the unimaginable wealth without tipping into the common mistake of allowing it to overtake the story.  Her characters are described physically that one can imagine them easily.  Her settings are lush and chosen with care to resonate with the otherworldly character of the action.  She also does not overdo the vampire ""gifts"", keeping their souls as the real center of their stories.In this book, LeStat has been in hiding, depressed and tired of the world.  After the full activity of his 200 years, relatively young, he has found his life a burden.  One by one, the central characters of the preceeding years, and books, emerge to becken him from his slumber.  It is as if a great slumber had been interrupted by the peril now in the world.  Two of my favorites, Jesse and David of the esoteric students of the supernatural emerge and more secrets emerge of their founding and they search once more for answers to the nature of the ""blood"".  This is a book to enjoy on any number of levels. Those steeped in the stories of the Prince Lestat will be pleased with this new chapter, but those people who are new to the series will be able to follow the story and understand the premises. Please read this book, and enter a finely constructed fantasy well rooted in the ponderings of our world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Q9AHX532Z4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307962520#wasThisHelpful","R38Q9AHX532Z4R","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful book that swallows the reader whole.  Deb, our narrator is witty, and darkly humorous.  By the time she has told us about her wedding, and her slightly antisocial approach to life, we have fallen into her view of the world.  The next chapter, she has gone on a honeymoon with her husband Chip and has seen a mermaid.  And the reader seems to seamlessly go with the assumption that this is true and that the real issue is keeping her safe and secret.Deb is a cranky young woman.  Under the sway of her friend, she is way too obsessed with the obesity epidemic for my taste, but that would be my single problem with her.  The rest of the way she views our race with spirited distrust is endearing to me.  Then having fallen for the whole assumption about having seen the mermaids, it seems logical to be involved in a race to save said mers, which apparently is the politically correct way to refer to them.As far as I am concerned, any book that refers to a politically correct form for mermaids is a keeper.  The quirky point of view enhances the package, and the jaundiced view of society wraps it up.

"This isn't a pornographic novel, nor is it only for math geeks.  But it does illustrate the rarified existence of those who deal in ""pure"" reality who try to live in the world.  This novel is written in alternating chapters on the story of Godel's life as seen by his widow, and her life today being interviewed by the a new generation of intellectual elite.  Adele Godel has lived at the side of a neurasthenic genius through the upheavals that have arguably shaped today's world.  They had started in Nazi riddled Austria and fled to the new European intellectual capital, Princeton.  Godel as a friend of Einstien and a peer of Oppenheimer existed in the rarified atmosphere of the intersection of pure science in the world of the atom and relativity and the nuclear age.The discussions cited between the great geniuses are intricately researched and many of the conversations are quoted from life.  Adele is a girl from a merchant home, lacking in education, and convinced of her dislocation in the world of Princeton.  She misses the dirt and the elegance of Vienna, at the end of WWII no longer in existence.  But she is the goddess of small victories and finds her happiness in yeast and sweeping.  She is the eternal nurse of the hypochondriacal and paranoid Godel who rarely turns his attention from his proofs to her.  Yet as his widow, she is repository of extraordinary insight and memories.  Her discussions with the new student seeking archives are are witty and wry.  Her speech is ironic and sincere in cycles.  She has much to say to this generation.I found the book to be engrossing sand thought provoking.

"Dorrigo concluded that ""a good book leaves you wanting to reread the book.  A great book compels you to reread your own soul.""  This then is a great book.  It is stunning in the true sense of the word, bringing the mind to a bewildered stop over and over.  In telling the story of of Dorrigo's life against the backdrop of a world gone insane, it forces the reader to broken conclusion after broken conclusion.  The gathering focus of the story is the construction of the ""Line"", an impossible railroad built by slave labor through the jungles of Siam by the Japanese rulers of the Australians POWs.  The life of Dorrigo before, during and after his captivity is interwoven with those of fellow prisoners and jailers both.At many points I was sure I understood the arc of one of these lives and the clear demarcation of good and evil, only to have the next chapter enter from another point of view.  This is not to say that this book deals with relativity or circumstance of morality.  Rather the author successfully addresses the futility of ever knowing all the elements needed for a judgment.  I have always know there is no real return from a war, but this book brings the truth home with a vengeance.The layers of meaning and the subtlety of language make this book that rare novel that challenges my view of the world. In stark contrast to the lightness of touch in many scenes then is the brutality of the life within the slave camp.  Yet neither is this shocking imagery anything but vital to the story being told.  I believe this book is very rightly the winner of the Man Booker Prize.  It belies the despair of its characters in believing their truths would die with the moving of the years.  The haiku in the title summarizes the conundrum proposed, and hints at the depth of the writing on hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CV58OOISXDHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMEAYA#wasThisHelpful","R3CV58OOISXDHI","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Vines"" invokes the haunted land of the Southern estate Spring House.  As a plantation, it was the scene of a bloody past written on the backs of its slaves.  While all the familiar elements are present, Christopher Rice has taken a masterful touch to the ghosts of people used beyond any sense of morality.  Virginie was born to a strange power over the fields but as a slave she suffered the same fate of horror.  Now the estate is the home of an effete family that is nonetheless mired in rage and secrets.  This setting is fleshed out so totally that even the smells of the place come to the reader.Very early we see the vines begin to take their due, starting with the immoral and cheating husband of the present owner, Caitlin.  Her childhood friend becomes embroiled in the mystery, and the past plays the leading role.  The suspense is played beautifully and the writing engages the reader from the start.  Right at the point in which I was sure I knew all the answers, another twist brings the plot forward.  The characters have that southern cache of intertwined fates and characters, and in this sense the book is character driven.To me, the most interesting issue is how the victims are chosen for attack.  Everyone has sins to a greater or lesser degree.  The question of who is spared, and for how long, is left open till the end.  This is the world of morality soaked into the soil.  Can the site of great evil ever clear?  The punishment itself is horrible and beguiling.  The descriptions of the attacks are not gory in the classical sense, although they certainly invoke some nauseating scenes.  Even in the midst of the most supernatural of attacks, the victim's reaction i dominant.  It takes a skilled hand to blend a story of revenge and a tale of horror without stooping to the obvious, and Rice has achieved this task.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ265HPIQMBO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBSP050#wasThisHelpful","RQ265HPIQMBO2","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These two people are wildly unlikely to find each other in the world.  But this is a small town in Maine in the midst of a blizzard, an atmospheric phenomenon that quickly redraws the lines of daily life.  I have lived in a small town in Maine, and found the unseen setting to be spot on.  But you do not need to understand the tiny cabin that keeps our  two characters barely safe through the storm.  The snow is so impelling as to serve as a third character.Eric s a small town lawyer who has come to save the quirky Danielle.  ""sooner of later she would be in trouble, either victim or perpetrator"".  Hiking down to see to the safety of his passenger, he has found himself at the mercy of an impersonal storm.  He has been left by his wife who is due to make an unlikely appearance and she is bespoken to her Army Reserve husband.  His wife is distant and rejecting; her husband is possessive and intrusive.  Together they seem to make a dimension of the terrifying world.As the title suggests, they are drawn to each other from their not so separate worlds.  The reader knows, as they do not or will not tell, that the absent spouses are gone and have really never been present.  The description of these two awkward misfits to the world of love is precisely pitched to reveal the people living apart from the world.  The prose encases the reader in the raging storm, exposing us to the elements that strip the superficial.  Its a perfect book for autumn in a cozy chair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2XTRFH8U5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNCWLMK#wasThisHelpful","R1L2XTRFH8U5D","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the premise for the book.  The idea that a blood plague has left some small group of survivors with special powers is a huge relief from the late flood of zombies.  The story fails for me with the extreme nature of the powers that these young people have developed.  Adelina Amouteru is our first character who has come to her understanding of her new self on the day of her attempted execution.  She has endured a lifetime of abuse from her father.  And here is my second problem, society has reacted exactly as is depicted in XMen with terror an shunning.  Many of the passages are fascinating, but my final problem hit at the end of the book, which is only the starting point for a new trilogy.

"This book starts with a lovely premise.  I like magical realism, but this book disappointed me.  The chapters are interwoven with time changes and with fairy stories.  Set in the chaos before and during World War II, Josef is based on the doctor who inspired and participated in the birth of psychoanalysis.  He has had a new patient brought to him by his servant Benjamin.  Lillie was naked and mute at first.  She was battered.  With the return of speech, she insists she has traveled through time as a machine to destroy the monster.  Krysta in another thread is the spoiled daughter of a Nazi camp doctor.  Set in Austria and Germany, the fairy stories are the scary German based tales of terri invoked upon the children, and the psyche, of the German state.I found the execution to be clumsy.  Often instead of deepening the suspense of the story, the turns of the chapters were very confusing  I have a high tolerance for confusing, but this problem seems to be rooted in poor writing and not in furthering the plot.  In addition, I found the fairy tales to be annoying.  They became repetitive and tedious. They really didn't add anything to the understanding of the Nazi horror.  Despite using the scarier stories, I think they belittle the setting.Of the characters, I like the young apprentice Benjamin the best.  This is probably not a coincidence since he is the single character not given to telling fiction.  I also enjoyed the evolution of the character Lillie.  I did not care for Krysta.  Her brattiness was magnified.  Her language was not convincing.  Her speech seemed exactly as if an adult had written an imaginary child, and this was irritating.  The contrast with the words in her fantasy with the ones she spoke was stark.I did find the mystery compelling despite the stops and starts.  And I did in fact like the ending very much.  I am sad with this book because I waited for it with anticipation.

"Perhaps I cannot be blamed for returning over and over to thoughts of the Holocaust as this darkly brilliant novel unravels the fabric of a society determined to forget the past by law.  No one is to remember the great brutality of a war gone by as if to examine it would resurrect more hatred in the opposing views of thought and blame.  There are dark references to trains and selections, ruined cities, and toppled economies of greed and affluence.In Kervin's small town, the people congratulate themselves on their distance from the turmoil of the past and of the large cities.  In the Ishmael law, itself a gifted riff on a doomed pseudonym, everyone has taken a new name.  Heirlooms are limited.  Everyone says sorry all the time.  Yet the village is haunted with violence and unions are rarely monogamous.  Fights are common.  No one says J without a gesture across the lips.  No one notes history.  Kervin is a remarkable man, a Cohen unable to drop the significance of this made up name.  He has fallen in love with Ailleen and it is their very temperance that does not allow them to give lip service to the inanities of the new civilization, thus cursing themselves in their small world.The writing is perplexing and often labyrinthine.  The sense of unease and of being followed never abates.  The irony of a society willed to a civility that never holds is ironic in the extreme.  Yet this is a novel that brings to mind every denier, every person who is determined to bury the past, and every book that shades hatreds of history.  It is not so very far to venture from this book to any determinedly pleasant day in the many blood soaked sands of the world.  Yet the main characters remain vibrant in contrast and their determination to be human brings balm to the reader.  I find this to be an inspired piece of fiction and one I will not forget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J6Z6YIO09OHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD31E#wasThisHelpful","R2J6Z6YIO09OHN","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been written with Gawande's perpetual insight and care.  It is one gloomy book filled with necessary facts that are particularly depressing for someone like me now full into my sixties.  Surely it can come as no shock that medicine is ill prepared for the ambiguities of elder care.  It is a numbing task to pursue  often opposite goals of safety and self identity.  Much of this book consists of the presentation of the problems of caring for an aging population who as a whole do not wish to be warehoused no matter how comfortably or safely.  The answers are not always palatable and the social motivation in government is not all that available.  Nonetheless, this book presents the realities of life ahead of us, and does it with grace and precision.

"This is the second much anticipated novel in as many years that has just failed to arouse much interest in me.  The opening consists of pages and pages of the subjective experiences of young Frank  He has been born into a conservative, salt of the earth family in Iowa and I cannot truly tell you why it never came to engage me.  The progression f the family growing and growing up remains gained to me by the minute details of young Frank from the days of his being the only child.  Now I love Smiley's writing, I am a fan of the slow paced detailed character study, and I dote on stories of the very young.  For some reason these elements failed to work for me this time.  This book is published to critical acclaim so I suspect it is my own shallowness that has left me cold.  You should probably red it for yourself.

"This is a surprisingly lyrical book written by a woman with schizophrenia.  I had picked it up to refer to a patient, but I found myself mesmerized by the prose that the author uses to describe her perceptions, both reality and non-reality based.This is a woman with deepened insight on the human condition after her long struggle to come to terms with her illness.  Schizophrenia is badly misunderstood by most people, and I think this book highlights many of the extraordinary insights that can occur when the usual associations on thought are loosened.  Not to misunderstand, these visions are ones that Kristina would willingly abandon in exchange for a freedom from voices and questionable judgment.  Her discussion of her recovery in AA stands as a solid addition to this book and one that is a testament to the AA movement.  This is well worth reading for those effected, those who are related, and those who wish to understand their fellow human.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2BRW9A0Z76S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOE0I12#wasThisHelpful","RO2BRW9A0Z76S","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her husband prefaces all her work stories with warning I chose for my title, ""Remember this can only end badly.""

Still I have a decidedly morbid streak, and knowing details about death is how I keep my own anxieties in check.  This book fills my purposes quite well.

"Lila voices that part of us that is fundamentally alone, and preternaturally outside the the bounds of society. I love this character.  She is not the least cuddly in her wildness, and she knows only how to stand in the world she has learned.  Marilynne Robinson has mastered that archetype of the loner ruled only by the internal truths of her ties to nature.  Robinson has returned to Gilead, a poor town on the verge of collapsing to the surrounding wilderness, resisting only with the basic decency of its citizens.  Robinson has woven a moral fiber which embraces the Bible as it is woven into the rules of empathy and natural order.Lila was born into the  ultimately neglectful family.  She was found by Doll, alone on a porch and half dead at age of four.  She and Doll wander the world in the days preceding the Dust Bowl.  ""Doll my have been the loneliest woman in the world, and she was the loneliest child.""  They were ruled by  ""Whatever happens, just be quiet, and it'll pass, most likely.""  We find her years later, aged by the places she has seen, drawn to the world of Gilead.  She has found a savior in the kind, old minister who has fallen in love with her.  The courtship is the loveliest thing I have read in years.  They come to value the comfort of the other standing by her shoulder.  She has come to care for the kind old man and finds him beautiful.  Their marriage is lyrical to me.The ethical code in Robinson's books is a rather lovely one.  The old minister says, ""Any judgment of the kind is a great presumption.  And presumption is a very grave sin.""  Lila come to believe that the  search for meaning  is like knowing a song. ""In a song a note follows the one before because it is that song and not another one."".  This is a book in which to linger.  I would honestly read a recipe written by Marilynne Robinson, but this is because she writes such wonderful language.  She has found a way to put words to thought that surpasses the rule of silence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YALKE6A0J5HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6U7K62#wasThisHelpful","R1YALKE6A0J5HM","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has an intriguing premise.  Nanobots are minuscule robots that control such processes as disease prevention and sharpening perception.  This is a concept not new to dystopian literature, and it is usually dystopian and not hopeful literature that describes their use.  As in every brave new world, the cost of such luxury is the surrender of freedom.  Certainly as in the of decades of writers, this technology means the essential end of personal privacy.This novel combines this concept with that of the search for complete artificial intelligence, and it does so in the life of our narrator, Ella.  She is surviving daughter of the genius of this science.  She is an appealing voice with an unswerving sense of ethics and an unusual ability to enter other people's minds during her mother's trademark lucid dreaming service.The lucid dream, a controlled visit to one's best world of the past, is the gold standard in psychological services.  It is in this technique that the novel's impetus leaves that of its similar relatives.  I really liked the complexity of Ella's voice.  The world building was done with a masterful touch as well.  The technology of this future is beguiling.  I didn't like the prolonged hunt and seek sequences, but I do not like these in any format.  This may be a personal tic on my part.  For me it weakens the web of the story when the intrigue is drawn too long in the mechanics of flight.  Overall however, this is a book that I recommend.  It held my interest and sparked some new thoughts which is a big part of what I demand from a novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZN7RYKKAW3JU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW0MTGE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZN7RYKKAW3JU","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Crimson Dawn"" is an entirely satisfying conclusion to the Exilon 5 Trilogy.  Eliza Green has chosen not to include a summary of the trilogy to date, but the book is doable as a stand alone.

Despite the existence of a colony already there, bombs were set off.  The humans who survived mutated into the indigenes who are one of the most fascinating people of a scifi work that I have read.This book explores what it means to be human.  The indigenes are ""other"", but they are the superior other.  They may be an answer to mortality.  As a possible future of our race, they provide fascinating commentary on our weaknesses and strengths.  The main characters are caught in the interplay of Exilon a a new Earth and Exilon as a home to the indigenes.  The writing engages the reader from start to finish.  The world building on Exilon is intriguing.  The characters are well developed and multi faceted.  Newbies will be immersed in this enterprise, and readers of the first two books will be gratified.

"""I am no longer fearless.""  She is a new mother who finds that the most perilous thing we may do is to bear children.  No longer an entity contained within her skin, she sets off to determine the real risks inherent in inoculations, among other interventions in the modern world.  she notes in a lucid voice, that to act is to start the future in motion, and to do nothing still sets that future in its course.I found this to be an amazing voice who has placed the fears and and anxieties of our modern medicine in the context of our existence as true beings in the whole of our world.  Her various observations of the philosophy of immunizations are truly startling and clear in her well researched discussions of the role of science in our world.She makes a cogent  argument for out inability to rationally assess true risk in the face of fear. In another instance,  her discussion of ""herd immunity"" point to the obligation that those who have access to care have to those who do not.  The risk of contagion is much higher for one person who is inoculated among many who are not than for a person not inoculated  in a crowd of those who are.  The more people who are protected, the more protection for those who are not protected.  She also explores the continuum of our bodies with the world around us, and notes that toxicity to a scientist is one of degree of exposure.  While she does not address the evils of high fructose syrup, plastics bleeding toxins or other villains in definitive terms; she does point out that each threat must be taken in context.This is a book that challenges the mind without torturing the reader with obscure or overly technical writing.  The education on risk, immunity, ad the role of medicine in our world is succinct and at times lyrical.

"The premise of this book is unusual and interesting.  It starts with our narrator who has been sent to a special school for fragile teens after she has lost her boyfriend of 41 days.  The loss has been so traumatic that she has withdrawn from the world only to re-engage with a gifted teacher.  She and four other hand picked students enter the Special Topics English class.This is one YA book which I believe is really much better suited to the target audience than to the adult reader.  The sentiments are the mundane fare of adolescent life, with which I have no quarrel.  But even with the magical realism, it felt like a story told a mile too far away for me.  The main characters are too formulaic to escape to exceptional literature, and the teen boarding school has been thick on the ground as a setting in recent years.

"In this masterpiece, Amis makes a fresh assault on the ability of a people to launch such concentrated hatred toward the annihilation of the Jews.  My title is taken from the report of an American reporter in Berlin in 1918.  From that point, ""hallucinatory anti-Semitism and world historical flair for hatred"" is sparked to culminate in the Final Solution.  The world was saying ""alas to less and less"" (Auden) One of the characters wonders aloud about the conference where the idea was unveiled.  Eight doctorates, and not a flinch or a protest emerged.The ""Zone of Interest"" unveils the story of ""Who somebody really is.""  The narrators are a foppish consultant, Thompson; a Jewish worker or Sunder, and the Commandant, Doll,  himself.  The world is the fictionalized Auschwitz where the air has grown foul with the stench of the dead and the staff lives in pleasant surroundings.  We are lulled at the outset by the story of Thompson falling in love with Doll's wife.  The language is prosaic until shortly his best friend has to depart to partake in selection at the railroad siding as a punishment for his lack of discipline.What follows is the forced look each person must endure of their true selves in the mirror of the KZ.  This is a story told many times with numerous views and commentary, yet this book is a fresh and deeply tortured visit to the world of the dark side of the soul.  His prose is darkly, spry and sometimes disturbingly humorous.  As the limits of what is forbidden are pushed further and further, the enterprise has moved in horrifying fashion from the taking of the ""Jews off their high horse.""  Most poignant to me is Szmul, the Jewish man whose forced slavery work has rendered him vital to the working of the camp.  He argues endlessly with himself over the issue of his own survival and his role as a witness.  To Doll, this renders him  a primary target for the gas chambers.Doll being the sole main character who believes his brief, has descended into madness.  The others teeter perilously on their views of themselves searching for ways to escape the depth of their own involvement.  This brings the current question, is anything less than full rebellion to the Reich a total damnation of the soul?  Many a vignette involves the small resistances that ensue in the camp.  Where does the reader stand in the mirror of the soul?  I am deeply impressed with the scope and depth of this novel within the frame of a novel assessable to the reader and engaging to the mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G718MSSQ2SBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JI54HGG#wasThisHelpful","R2G718MSSQ2SBT","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each of these stories combines Mantel's trademark elegant turns of phrasing and her sly, bleak humor.  Narrators regard the world with a jaundiced eye.  Young or old, they have been jaded by the adults in their world whose incontinent views of right and wrong have skewed their perceptions.Readers of ""Wolf Hall"" may be startled by the wry wit on display, but Mantel has written in this vein before: notably ""Beyond Black"".My perverse favorite is ""Comma"" in which two marginally accepted children on the fringes of society watch a wealthy home for glimpses of a child with severe birth defects who appears to be a ""comma"".  The physical metaphor is taken in a arc of brilliant writing until one of the girls come ""full stop.""  All of these stories bear these twists, subtle and otherwise, of the observed judging those at the same margins as themselves.

"this must be one of the most visceral accounts of the meaning of being a soldier of war that I ever read.  It is not long on bloody detail or of gore.  Without hyperbole, this account renders the story of how a human being is turned into a soldier.  While Ash is in fact a woman, the story is not really a story of feminism.  Ash had gone to war instead of her husband because she was strong while he was not.  One of them had to serve the Union, so she dressed as a man and left.  But long before Ash wandered far from Ohio, she had left herself.  In training and drilling for her new role, by the time she said good bye, her husband no longer saw her for herself.Ash remembers the first man she killed in combat.  Then little by little she only remembers a litany of orders, followed by her, and blurred to an inhuman machinery.  The story of any soldier is whether home can exist again after the world has changed to a universe of killing.  The lyrical prose and beautiful writing flows without a touch of flowery hyping.  Each minute that she describes can be felt viscerally, and this makes this novel essential in the understanding of the way people come to declare a war and go off to kill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUPHAR7EV2OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ2N0D4#wasThisHelpful","R3LUPHAR7EV2OK","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aristotle gave much of his life to biology.  He has broken with Plato to declare that there is value in the understanding of all living things.  He leaves the study of ideal forms in philosophy to explore the reality of nature, ""where there is nothing accidental.""  Leroi searches for his works in texts extant, in commentary of the age, and in exploration of the locations where certainly Aristotle searched for ""truth"".Many of the books of Aristotle have been destroyed or are missing, but Leroi has based his work on an extant encyclopedia among Aristotle's work.  While he celebrates all that Aristotle had found, he doesn't veer from discussing those areas in which Aristotle misses the mark.  The prose is is entrancing in its obvious love of the topic at hand.  Leroi has made this search a labor of love.  The ""known"" animals of this world, reported back from travelers in the field, can be bizarre, but are illuminating nonetheless.  The vignettes that set the scene of his study assure us that much is still the same from antiquity.  The author assists us in our interpretation with his retrieval of modern understanding of the animal in question.I find it exciting and humbling to view the research of a man so long before our time.  He had excited the interest in the natural world simply by his insistence in its value and his courage to deviate from the norms of his age.  This book has much to offer to those of us who find the learning of new things of highest order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BEY50LPRM4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026743#wasThisHelpful","R29BEY50LPRM4G","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely piece of prose.  The premise is a lyrical story of souls that have come to inhabit the place of their deaths  in replacement for a body.  The newly bereaved family of the last owner of the house have come to assess the property, handle the estate and bury him.  They are his divorced ex-wife, her two children, and her daughter's daughter.  Each of them are fragile in their own way.  It seems the younger the living person, the more attuned they are to the whispers of the dead, but each person has some perception of the living house.I think that the reader's reaction to this work will depend highly on personal preference.  Of course that is always the case, but particularly for me in this novel.  The stories of the two reigning ghosts are confusing despite the clearly labeled chapters.  The intertwining of the living and the dead becomes knotted through the story.  One of the main plot devices is fairly artificial.  All in all, the plot is not particularly well articulated.  Yet I enjoyed the book for its prose and its evocative sense of the world of memory and time.  Several passages are startling in their clarity of expressed longing  that survives time and circumstance.  The memories of the living and the dead are told in lovely terms, and this made the book one I really enjoyed reading.  So being a fan of atmosphere and prose, I liked this book a lot.  Those pursuing a strong plot line will probably be disappointed.I think anyone who picks this book to consider already has some predilection to consider the fate of the person after death, and from this point of view, I recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PYQ7OGMRLC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLISR3G#wasThisHelpful","R27PYQ7OGMRLC6","A8710RWTFG3IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8710RWTFG3IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice mask fin and snorkel set.  It contains a pair of snorkeling fins, a mask and a dry snorkel with a mesh drawstring bag.Fins:These fins are short-bladed fins meant for more precise control when snorkeling; scuba fins have longer blades while free diving fins have very long flexible blades.  The fins have an open heel meant to be worn with a neoprene bootie/sock (not included) and can be easily adjusted from men's foot size 9-13.  While all straps are standardized, it is not clear whether there are replacement buckles for this brand.  If your feet are inbetween sizes, order down as things tend to loosen up in the water.Mask:This is a scuba-quality medium volume mask, featuring an excellent horizontal view with tempered glass.  It is single-skirted black silicone that help reduces glare and is preferred by photographers.  To fit the mask properly, put the snorkel in your mouth, and place the mask on your face without the strap on while holding your breath. Make sure there are no stray hairs and such under the skirt of the mask. with your hands, attempt to pull the mask away from your face gently while holding your breath.  It should form a good seal. If it does not stick to your face without the strap, then this mask does not fit your face and this is not the set for you.  The reason the snorkel has to be in your mouth during this process is that the shape of your face changes slightly when something is in your mouth and sometimes that is enough to change the fit, and seal, of the mask.Snorkel:This is a dry snorkel.  It has a vertical drain on the bottom of the silicone mouth-piece and a wave protector on the top.  I prefer the vertical design of the drain because the water runs directly down and none of it collects anywhere.  Some other dry snorkels have a U-bend and then a drain, but those tend to collect a bit of water.  Always buy a dry snorkel instead of one without.  It makes snorkeling so much easier in the open water regardless of swimming ability.Mesh Bag:This is just a simple polyester-mesh drawstring bag.  It is unfortunate that there are no handles or straps. However these can be easily sewn on.  Just make sure to sew a backing/re-enforcement piece on both sides of the mesh for longevity.  The size of the bag fits this set and not much more.Conclusion:The fit of the mask is the most important. If it does not fit this is not the set for you.  The sizing of the set is for the fins and not the mask. So ordering a smaller listed size will only get fins for smaller feet and not a smaller mask.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMVGENJT2LOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLE3GMA#wasThisHelpful","R1DMVGENJT2LOY","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smith's is known for their knife sharpeners and subsequently a small selection of accompanying blades for their extended consumer kitchen line.  It makes sense that they've introduced a survival tool following the popularity of Survivorman and survivor type TV shows.While most all-in-on survival tools are gimmicky and fail to offer any real use to the outdoorsman during a hobby walk much less during an actual survival situation, this 10-in-one tool does offer a few exceptions:1) Knife bladePocket-knife sized blade comes with a decent edge.  Due to the fact the other components of this system are stored in the handle cavity like a Swiss army knife, the knife blade is not full tang.2) Saw bladeAgain as expected with Smith's, this holds a decent edge.  However the handle cavity is almond shaped and there are no finger guards in this design. Fingers can slip on to the blade and accidentally be cut.  Shaping the handle to have fingerguards on both ends would not decrease its looks and honestly is baffling as to why its not there.3) SharpenerThis is Smith's specialty.  The carbide sharpener gives blades a sharp edge.  These sharpening blades can also be replaced and interchanged easily.  It stores inside the handle cavity.  It is part of the whistle and the firestarter.4) WhistlePealess, but sadly tiny. It is built into the sharpener part with the fire starter. It's also not very loud.5) Fire starter pulls out of the sharpener piece that can be stored in the handle cavity.  It is a simple ferro rod that one strikes the spine of the blade against to create sparks on to flammable materials.  This does produce a respectable amount of sparks although it is much slimmer than the ferro rod by Light My Fire.6) TweezersTiny with ungrounded edge.  Larger fingers or gloved hands, might drop this. Still if you have steady hands this is better than nothing.7) Removable LED light with clip.  It is bright enough and again better than nothing. It removes from the handle easily.8) CompassA very small water-filled compass similar to the type found on zipper pullers.  It's better than nothing but it better suited for figuring out which direction to turn out of a subway exit rather than navigating a densly wooded canyon9) ParacordIt's only 2 feet so it depends on what your situation is.10) Signal mirrorVery small but it should work.Overall this is very cleverly designed to be lightweight and fit into a small space.  All the items are nice to have and better than nothing if there is a situation.  However just like other multi-tools, no piece (with possible exception of the sharpener and the fire starter) can truly stand on its own the way a fully functioning independent piece of kit would.  For a true BOB bag, I would recommend buying each component separately. For EveryDay Carry, this would be ideal as it is lightweight and compact.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBSXMWTTCV8QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTO5FLK#wasThisHelpful","RBSXMWTTCV8QV","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have very sensitive combination skin.  Frequent travel for my job often irritates and stresses my skin and I often break out in my T-zone and sometimes oddly in the middle of my check, chest or at a certain spot on my neck or chin.  When this happens, it's usually an angry, ugly zit that is too deep to be drained and requires a visit to a dermatologist to decrease the potential damage.  Without treatment, it often leaves a red angry spot that takes months to calm down and another few months to fade after that.  I found that using ProActive masks help prolong periods between these nasty angry blemishes.This mask is your basic Kaolin mask infused with peeling acids and disinfecting botanticals, texturizing agents and unfortunately fragrance.  It absorbs extra oil, plus works to shed the outer layers of dead cells to prevent and clear clogged pores.  I like to use this as a spot treatment since I mainly get random angry spots, but sometimes I use this as an area mask for my entire T-zone from my chin, nose and forehead to prevent a  breakout just after a very long trans-Pacific/Atlantic flight.It does work to absorb the oil and to decrease pore size.  I use it as needed when traveling which is twice a week (outbound and inbound).  The recommended dosage is not more than three times a week as the face can be overly irritated by over drying and over peeling.  For travel, I put a bit in an contact lens case and keep it in my 3-1-1 baggie.If you haven't tried this, and there is a mall with a ProActive kiosk near you, I would recommend asking for a sample to try out first.  It is a bit stronger than your drugstore/supermarket peel and mask and would be an expensive mistake if it doesn't work out.  If it does work, then it would be worth the splurge.When the package was delivered I was a bit worried as it was packed in a simple padded envelope.  Upon opening the mailing envelope the product box was crushed and I was afraid that the product would have spilled and leaked.  Luckily, ProActive shrink-wraps their products before putting them into the retail box as a tamper-resistant measure that also prevents product spillage during shipment.This is a a sulfur-based acne treatment that luckily does not smell like sulphur (rotten eggs).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GCT5ZABRP9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6TSF0#wasThisHelpful","R4GCT5ZABRP9C","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This inflatable hot tub was surprisingly nice considering the number of unfavourable reviews on Lay-Z-Spas.  However, this is the newest model that seems to be manufactured of a heavier duty thicker vinyl and a different single piece baffled construction.  I have listed the Pros and Cons of this model (Palm Springs 4-6 person) as well as Logistics and maintenance on what you need and what is nice to have for a better experience.  As a side note, we used to have the co-branded Coleman Lay-z-spa which is equivalent to the Miami 2-4 person spa.  We sold/left it at our old house at the request of our former landlord.Pros:+ This inflatable hot tub is non-permanent and much easier to get it placed and moved where you would like it.+ Low entry price makes it more affordable to have a hot tub.+ 120 air jets help create a soothing massage.  Air jets are not as drying to the skin as water jets.+ Inflatable vinyl-leather cover has easy to use clip-on straps, and is supposed to help prevent heat loss.+ The inflatable hot tub comes with a cushioned floor mat (giant vinyl bubble-wrap) which is supposed to help with protecting the hot tub and also help with insulation. It is also more comfortable when in the hot tub.+ This is a good sized hot tub that can fit 4-6.  The interior diameter is approximately 57"" The walls are approximately 9"" thick.  Lesser quality inflatable hot tubs have walls 7-8"" thick.+ Lay-z-spa also makes a co-branded unit with Coleman based off their Miami (2-4 person) model.  This Palm Springs model is an improvement in both sturdiness and design for the inflatable part.  The motor unit and all accessories are otherwise identical.+ This unit can be directly plugged into an 110v outlet.  There is no need for hardwiring.  There are 220v versions but I think that they are  primarily marketed in Europe.Cons:- The hot tub is inflatable and getting in and out could be tricky for the infirm.- Hot tubs and jacuzzis are noisy.  This one is no exception.- This style of hot tub is more of a sit upright type of hot tub instead of a lounging type of hot tub.  Adding ($) an inflatable pillow for neck support does make it better.- The nature of inflatable hot tubs is that they are not very good insulators so expect the water to loose heat much more quickly than a regular hot tub.- Inflatable hot tubs also generally don't heat the water as warm as traditional hot tubs. The Lay-z-spa is no exception and only heats to 104F (40c)- Inflatables do leak air slowly, so expect to detach the hose and top-off the air every 7-14 days.  This is normal.- The inflatable cover also leaks air and needs to be topped-off. Again, this is normal but nonetheless annoying.- Maintenance cost and effort is similar to that of a traditional tub.- Chlorine tablets are needed for the floating chemical puck are available online but not easy to find in brick and mortar shops.  These tables are also more expensive than regular chlorine.- Emptying the water from the hot tub (to change water) via the garden hose drain attachment is just as slow if not slower than filling it up.  To speed up this process, additional submersible pump is needed.- As the material is vinyl, there is a certain amount of off-gassing.  The scent will be more noticeable when the hot tub is heated.- The safety and auto-shut of thermostat is set for the lowest external operating temperature of 40F (lower than 40F water starts to freeze).  So this Lay-z-spa is not meant for winter time use.  However the season can be extended by warming up the air around the pump with a heater to encourage it to work.  Once the water is heated, the surrounding temperature will rise slightly and help keep the pump going.- It seems that the pump unit can be used for bubbles or for heat but not both at the same time.  The solution is to alternate heating and using the bubbles.Logistics:* The product box is 90-lbs so be prepared to have a hand truck or help moving it to where you would like to open it.* The box includes: an instructional DVD, emergency patch kit, floating chemical puck, monometer, Filter (size IV).* Spa chemicals are not included.* Things that are nice to have on hand to start are Bestway's Chemical Starter Kit, a study step tool to help get in and out of the hot tub, a folding tray table for outside the hot tub or a floating tray for inside the hot tub for beverages and snacks and an inflatable hot tub pillow for neck support.* Some sort of sturdy platform to put the Lay-z-spa on: floating deck, wood patio tiles from Ik*a, foam tiles, kitchen gel mats to help distribute the weight a little more evenly and to provide a little bit more cushion and insulation.* Maintenance requires Bestway Lay-z-spa filters (size IV) that roughly need to be cleaned or replaced every 2 weeks, chemicals (bromine or chlorine), hot tub/pool scent crystals/salts to decrease the chlorine smell if it bothers you.* Round patio table covers also fit the hot tub as temporary covers.* Weber Smoker cover and standard chimnea covers fit the pump unit.* All hot tubs take a while to heat up the water.  The Lay-z-spa takes the same amount of time to heat up the water (overnight) as a traditional spa.  Filling with warm/hot tap water will decrease the time it takes to heat the water.Conclusion:This is a very good inflatable hot tub.  It is built of heavier duty materials than its predecessors and competitors.  It is attractively priced and convenient to set up, take down and move.  However it does require almost as much time, effort and money for its maintenance as a regular hot tub.  There are other additional hidden costs for accessories to personalize your hot tub.  However, I would still recommend this Lay-z-spa for those that need something non-permanent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P31XRPGIF50W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3U5ABY#wasThisHelpful","R1P31XRPGIF50W","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a few of these knives for ourselves and as gifts.  These are perfect for what they are: a sharp knife that keeps its edge paired with an effective and easy to use ferro rod.  Everything is where it's needed.Pros:+ Knife is sharp and made of a proprietary stainless formula that helps it keep its edge.+ The design of the blade is perfect for precision slicing at the pointy end and more robust slicing on the elongated end.+ Ferro red is securely twist-locked into the handle but can be easily removed and used when needed.+ Ferro rod still sits securely even after extended use because the attachment relies on the shape of the handle and not on the size of the rod.+ Grippy handle helps prevent accidental slips.+ Variety of subtle and bright colours of the sheath and ferro rod holder to suit almost everyone.+ Gap between knife and sheath prevents an unclean knife from sticking to sheath+ Knife clicks securely into sheath.+ The ferro rod holder has a matching cord to help prevent loss.Cons:- Knife is not full-tang (More on this later)- Knife is secured in sheath via tension. There is a click when it is securely inserted.- There is a gap between the knife and the sheath. While this enables an unclean knife to not stick to the sheath, it also allows grit and dirt between the sheath and knife to abrade the knife.I personally feel that there is no need for a full-tang in a knife of this size.  There is no way I am going to be sawing or prying something with a 3.75"" blade in such a way as to require a full tang.  If this were a much larger knife meant for other purposes then the full tang would be important.  For hammering things such as tent stakes I would use a rock rather than risk messing up my knife or accidentally cutting myself.  There are plenty of 10-in-1 ""survival tools"" on the market and sadly they all fail to preform well in any one of their ten purported functions.  This Fireknife has 2 functions: basic small scale cutting and firestricker.  It excels in both.For those that really do need a big knife, add a hatchet or a machete to your bag.  Small knives, full-tang or not will not do that job.We have used ours for a few years and love the convenience of having everything right where we need it.  We have also put an extra in our hurricane go-bag.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24Q7PQLKBEAB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NGFD06#wasThisHelpful","R24Q7PQLKBEAB1","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Can be secured to use yet easily removed without marking the car and re-used repeatedly with the same performance.+ Can be easily adjusted safely even whilst driving+ The rubber prong in the back have a wider side and a thinner side so that it fits most car vents+ The entire back prong can be turned so that the phone position can be adjusted.Cons:- Only available in black or white.  So it can be easily missed/forgotten in rental cars.

"This is a seamless one-piece tummy and thigh shaper.  It has a 360-stretch that fits most body types.  I'm petite and the waistline hits just a little above my belly button.  However as this entire shaper is like a firm fitting pair of semi-opaque control-top hose, I can adjust it so that there is minimal roll-over at the waist.  The thigh does not have a silicone-latex strip but does not roll up.  The edges are smooth and woven over into itself seamlessly so there are no obvious bumps and lines.  What little roll over there is at the waist (for me) does not encourage the entire shaper to roll all the way down or create weird bumps and lumps like my mother and grandmother's old fashioned shapers.Despite being like thick control-top hose, this feel much more breathable than it looks.  The shaper has a special ribbed weave in the tummy area for extra control.  This ribbed area is also seamless and does not show.  This shaper is matte but smooth.  As it is not shiny it should not show too much through the clothes in photographs the way satiny shapers do.Note that the crotch does not have an added cotton layer nor it is a split crotch for easy ""bathrooming"".Overall I really do like this shaper even though I hated my mom's.  It does add a lit of confidence when wearing a tighter dress and smooths everything down.Maidenform rates this as 2 out of 3 on their scale of amount of control.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ83H8MTCCZE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUUAE0U#wasThisHelpful","RJ83H8MTCCZE0","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a big fan of Miele vacuums for their performance and reliability.  However this little Shark Hand vac's performance is on par with Miele and Dyson handvacs for a fraction of the price.What I like:+ This is extremely lightweight. I have tendonitis and carpal tunnel in my right arm and hand and find carrying things for a period of time results in numbness and pain for the next few days.  This vacuum is lightweight enough to not aggravate my old injuries.+ The hose itself is flexible and the attachments are perfect for small tasks such as vacuuming stairs, sofas, chairs, headboards and in the car.+ The cord is 15-ft long is is long enough for most tasks in my house.  I have an extension cord if I need to do something such as vacuuming the top of kitchen cabinets or the ceiling fan blades.+ Because this vacuum is corded, there is no heavy battery to carry around or to charge.+ The corded unit provides maximum power and suction for the entire time you need to vacuum. There is no battery/power running low problems.+ The TruePet brush attachment is motorized. Motorized brushes for handheld small units are usually a feature of machines retailing at higher prices.+ Washable cups, bags and filters.+ All this performance is available for a fraction of what Miele and Dyson's cost.What I don't like- This is a bagless vacuum which is both a pro and a con. For allergy sufferers this is bad because emptying the vacuum using means exposing oneself to lots of dust in the process.  There is also the vacuumed-up critter carcases that are icky.- Bagless means that there are no additional costs for bags.Performance:We volunteer at several dog rescues and foster a number of dogs throughout the year.  There are approximately 3 dogs in addition to our own dog at any given time.  This equates to a once a day minimum schedule of vacuuming everything from floor to sofa to drapes.  This little vacuum effectively removes pet hair from our upholstered velour sofa, the fuzzy faux fur papasan, silk drapes and of course all the dog beds.  We also vacuum our car as it is used to transport a number of pets to and from vets, the rescue and other foster events.Recommended for anyone who needs to vacuum small spaces such as cars, sofas, stairs and drapes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36WQOO15F0HSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9Z36T8#wasThisHelpful","R36WQOO15F0HSM","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OtterBox cases are usually the bulkiest of the all the phone cases so when I received this I was pleasantly surprised.  This case from their ""symmetry"" collection is about the size of other hard cases on the market and much much slimmer than the traditional OtterBox phone case.I love how this case is smooth and does not catch on the edges of pockets in my bag where the bumps on the traditional OtterBox cases did.  I also love how while being much thinner it does not sacrifice protection.  While it will obviously not be as protective as their traditional clunky case, it seems more than enough for everyday active use.Note the edges at the front of the case wrap in more than your usual case so if you have a screen protector it needs to be of the case-friendly variety.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZGXHMG20GDCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYTDOBA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZGXHMG20GDCC","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice case that protects your Iphone from bumps, scratches and splashes while being active.It fits my Iphone 6 well, however I had to remove my current screen protector so that the built-in screen protector would make full contact with the screen.  Apple Touch ID works and the screen itself does not seem to have lost any sensitivity being in the case.  Sound from the speakers and the ear-piece are slightly muffled as expected.  Use of the speaker is also slightly muffled when I attempted to make a call on speakerphone.The case is waterproof as claimed.  I tested this with some rolled up tissues in the case and dropped it into the pool and left it there for 15-20mins.

"The smallest and most concise offering by Lonely Planet!This is a new way of organizing travel by Lonely Planet.  The guide is presented in a spiral-bound semi-hard cover with Moleskinesque elastic to keep the book shut.  There is a slip pocket inside the back cover next to a fold-out removable map of Tokyo.  The guide is organized by dividing the day (page) into thirds, morning (orange), afternoon (red) and evening activities (blue) that one can mix and match by flipping through each section and customizing your day.  Once your choices are made there is an attached ribbon to bookmark your choices.In addition to the pull-out map at the back of the guide, which can be used either attached or removed, there is smaller fold-out map in the front that shows one where all the colour-coded attractions are around the city.  This is very convenient for planning your day so as to not ping pong all over the city with a poorly constructed schedule.The LP bits we love such as ""3 perfect days in {name your city}"", and the logistics section are still there but adapted to the new presentation format.This small guide is perfect for shorter trips and for those that are comfortable with not over planning their days.I just used the Paris version of this guide a few weeks back and love the new format. As a former expatriate resident of Tokyo, this guide seems perfect for a return visit and for newer tourists to the city as well.Note: this guide includes access to online content on the LP app via a smartphone (Iphone or Android)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX4G44X30ZBPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607016#wasThisHelpful","RX4G44X30ZBPQ","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the perfect ice cream chiller and cooler for a pint of ice cream whether it be bought from a store (a Ben & Jerry's pint, in its own container, fits in perfectly) or homemade.  I have a few of these in different colours for homemade ice cream from my Cuisinart ice cream.Notes and tips:+ The ice cream tub is designed to be pre-frozen and kept in the freezer.  It can then be filled with ice cream.+ An entire store bought pint fits in.+ The standardized pint size is convenient for recipes.+ Chilled tub helps ice cream set evenly for a smoother texture with fewer ice crystals+ The matching scoop curls the ice cream into perfect balls.+ Matching tub is perfect for holding and rinsing the scoop between scoops.+ The lid should only be closed finger-tight and the seams wiped clean of any residue otherwise the lid can be difficult to get off once frozen.This is the perfect set for someone who has their own ice cream maker or who enjoys eating ice cream pints directly out of the package on a hot summer day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DXCYWXNX282J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QC71A40#wasThisHelpful","R1DXCYWXNX282J","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Baby Alive dolls are dolls that come with internal plumbing where it can be ""fed"" and the liquid trickles down and comes out of its crotch area into its diaper which can then be changed.How it works:The liquid is just water.  There are little packets of  ""tea"" mix which is just simply a colouring agent you add to the water to make your ""food"". This then goes into the teapot or directly into the tea cup which as a nipple that you put in the doll's mouth.  after ""feeding"" the doll the liquid makes its way down and dribbles out the crotch area of the doll into its diaper.  The diaper itself is just a doll panty with what seems to be tissues as an absorbent liner.What I like about this series of dolls:+ It features feeding and diaper changing for kids that want to have a more realistic experience whether you want them to or not.+ It enables safe play.+ There are a variety of accessory ""foods"" from milk, to tea to juice.+ The dolls are available in both blonde and brunette.+ Mix refills, diapers and diaper liners are easily available.Cons:- The diaper liner is the equivalent of 1 - 2 squares of toilet tissue folded up.  A child that ""overfeeds"" their doll would cause it to overflow its diaper very easily.  A simple solution is to use actual newborn baby diapers or even cut up pantiliners or pads.- The mix contains colouring that may stain some materials although it is mostly washable.Overall this is a very realistic doll that my nieces love to play with.  She's excited that there is one at my place for her own doll to play with when they visit on weekends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLB593Q3M8H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBVTKII#wasThisHelpful","R2CLB593Q3M8H8","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you feel any resistance when pulling a scarf or brushing your hair. You might just accidentally break the chain.- The spring-clasp is very small. you might need help and definitely patience (and fingernails) to put this on.- The ball is hollow as expected but it seems to weigh almost nothing.- The chain-end is large enough to prevent the ball from slipping out so the chain cannot be used with another pendant","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IJ2GM5OVI8H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LLQBMO#wasThisHelpful","R1IJ2GM5OVI8H0","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bird feeders fall into 2 categories: 1) practical no nonsense (and often more economical) feeders and 2) Fancy decorative feedersThis bird feeder definitely belongs in the first group.  I filled this up with seed bought at my local Audubon Society store and placed it across the yard from my other finch feeder.  The golf finches in my yard use this as much as they use my more decorative one.  Multiple perches mean that more than one bird can feed at the same time as long as they are not too territorial.  The off-set spacing of each perch and feeding area help prevent this.  The main compartment is clear plastic so it's easy to see the amount of seed decrease.  The yellow plastic top just slides on.As this entire feeder is plastic, I wold recommend using a twist tie or a bit of string to help secure it to where its hung to prevent squirrels or large birds from swinging it off and breaking it on the the ground.  The long narrow shape of this feeder is a bit more tippy.Overall a very inexpensive and functional feeder.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMKXSMCGUK3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q52TA6#wasThisHelpful","RSMKXSMCGUK3H","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a leave-in hair conditioner so a little goes a very very long way.After shampooing, spread a very tiny pea-sized amount in your hands and apply to damp towel-dried hair focusing on the ends working towards the scalp. Avoid actually putting any on your roots or your scalp to avoid weighing your hair down.  If there is not enough product, repeat again in tiny pea-sized increments.  Style as usual.I love this particular leave-in conditioner not only because it plays well with heat and dryers but also because it is equally effective at smoothing frizz without help.  I have combination Eurasian hair: my mother's Asian dead straight and fine hair plus my dad's curls so I end up with a somewhat frizzy messy-looking crop with its own mind.  My hair's personality varies with humidity and since products meant for curly hair weighs it down due to the straight bits and straight hair products just don;t cut it, I'm always in search of something in between that will work.

"This is a heavy duty cable for USB 3.0 (interior has a blue stripe). Despite the wire covering being thicker than your average cable, it is not that much stiffer and can easily be rolled and stowed. The ends where the wire connects to the ends is usually where these things start to fray is also reinforced.  Overall this is a very well thought out cable.  Whether it is worth the surcharge depends on how hard you are on your gear and how much you value reliability.

"This thing is huge! The delivery box is approximately 5-ft tall and close to 4 ft wide.  It is also very heavy and was delivered by a freight company rather than UPS.  Shipping and receiving logistics aside, once this was moved close to where we wanted to install it, the assembly was quite straight forward and simple.The main reasons why I like this Basketball system:+ The height is adjustable.  The range is from 7ft to just over 10ft so all the kids can play.+ The base is compact and sturdy.  There are 4 containers that can be filled with either water or sand that help anchor the base. Each container can hold 50-lbs so the total weight-anchor is 200lbs in addition the the weight-balance of the unit.+ The base has wheels that help with moving and positioning.+ This system is free-standing and not permanently mounted.Cons:- While this is advertised as ""portable"" it just means that it is not permanently attached to anything and can be stored inside the garage during the winter months.- If you like to dunk and hang more weight is needed on the base to keep this from tipping over the closer you are to 200lbs or more.So far, the kids and cousins are having fun playing in the back driveway.

"This is a very different format and NEW format for LP.  While all the same great content is there in the same LP style, the way this guide book is organized and meant to be used is very different.To start, the guidebook is spiral bound with a semi-hard cover that has a moleskine-esque elastic strap to keep it closed.  The back cover also has a slip pocket.  There are 2 maps.  One pull-out map at the back, cleverly folded, that may also be used while attached and one at the front that is printed on thin cardstock at the front.  The map at the front can be partially pulled-out and shows all the colour-coded and numbered attractions.The guts of the guidebook is printed on thin cardstock and colour-coded by morning (orange), afternoon (red) and evening (blue)  activities and attractions.  Each page is divided into thirds (top, middle and bottom) and each attraction is printed on its 3rd.  Physically it resembles a small and thin version of those message log books used in offices.The concept is that one would use this guidebook as a quick reference tool. each attraction is printed on its own ""slip"" of card and by flipping through the book, one can assemble their own personalized combination of attractions for a particular day.  There is a ribbon bookmark that helps one bookmark their selectionsFor those that like Moleskine and Levenger Circa organizers, this guidebook is right up your alley. My only complaint about this new format is that the individual cards cannot be ripped out and carried because the photo on one side does not match the information on the reverse.  The guide book is not meant to be ripped up into chunks but is to be used as a whole.Overall I like how organized this guidebook is.In addition to this guidebook, there is an App by the same name that you can download for free with the purchase of this book.  This is the most concise and pared-down of all the LP guidebooks. It contains only 39 attractions (more than enough) and none of the hotel or restaurant information contained in the Discover series nor the Classic Series.  It contains even less information than their Pocket series.  This guide does contain the briefest of information for logistics, and a few itinerary suggestions. There are a few lined pages in the back for notes.Perhaps this is where guidebooks are heading? If you own a smartphone or do the bulk of your research online, then this is all you really need to help finalized your day to day activities.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6BMKV13ZM9M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743606982#wasThisHelpful","R6BMKV13ZM9M2","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This ""Discover"" series by Lonely Planet contains full colour glossy photos yet maintains the information integrity of the LP brand.  While this full coloured series does not contain as much information as the tradition LP guides in bluescale, it more than makes up for it by using this colour to its full advantage both in enticing one to get out there and do things (LP-style) and also to help organize information in a logical and easy-to-access way.  For the average tourist this full-colour version contains more than enough information, and there is no need to additionally buy the bluescale classic version.The information contained is as up-to-date as printed guides can be.

Disposable is very convenient.  I love bandage-style masks for travel as they do not count as a liquid.  Do bring a ziplock for resealing in case a TSA does want one of the packets opened so they can make sure that it is not a liquid.In short:Pros:+ Convenient+ Effective with continuous use (especially on long haul flights)Cons:- Convenience can be more expensive that just a jar of your favourite night cream","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PNE765BX1RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWYOG4#wasThisHelpful","R19PNE765BX1RA","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several sets of similar cutlery made by different brands from high-end (Richartz) to low-end no-name brands.The main difference is how these are finished, how easy they are to open and close and to attach and detach.  If there is a chance that you may hurt yourself, it would be during the opening and closing of the blade.For this particular brand ""made by Humans"", the utensil set is well -made enough for regular use.  My main complaint is that in 1 or the 2 sets I bought, one knife is particularly hard to close. i.e. hazard. On both sets, the can opener-blade is not sharp.  I have not tried opening a can with either of them yet as they seem as sharp as a butter knife.The fork spears well enough, but if you require a fork that is wider for scooping then the Coleman utensil set is a better purchase.Overall, this is a handy tool for an emergency kit or for a backup in a lunch bag.There are printed diagrams and instructions on the back of the package that who one how to safely and efficiently separate this utensil into fork and knife or into fork and spoon (the knife and the spoon are on the same side).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAPIRLWA80UN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V6EPVU#wasThisHelpful","R3UAPIRLWA80UN","A2NUBL2UYWPBWR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NUBL2UYWPBWR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Honest Kitchen makes 2 main categories of food.  There is Complete Food which is basically what is claims and then there is also Food Supplement/Food Base which just needs a protein source of your choice added.  For each of these categories there are Whole Grain and grain-free versions.  Both versions are wheat and corn free.This is a very highly rated dog food.  It is basically freeze dried real food that is then ground down into a coarse powder.  All that needs to be done is to mix a few scoops of this ground up food with warm water to form a paste.  We use this as a supplement to our dog's kibble although it is a Complete Food.  Our dog is a picky eater and we find that this keeps her healthy.  We also like bringing this as a travel friendly food. Warm water is available almost everywhere and this food is easier and much lighter to carry around than kibble or canned food.

The sound quality is good but obviously not as good as a permanently installed professional sound system.  It sounds better on a solid surface than it does partially submerge (for obvious reason per laws of physics).What we love about this is that it is actually water proof and is designed to float in a pool or hot tub and is rated to be submergeable for 3ft .  It is not not merely splashproof so we don't worry that it can be accidentally knocked into the hottub or pool by the dog or the kids.  We tested this in our neighbour's hot tub, our kitchen sink and also in the tub for the kids' bathtime.The BT range is the usual 25-30ft limit so your phone or laptop can be placed safely away from the edge of the water.

"Sterling Silver Swarovski ""Peridot"" Crystal Pendant and Chain.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this sterling silver chain and sterling pendant with crystals.  The size is small: the clover measuring  approximately 1/2""; the stem itself elongates the total height measurement to approximately 3/4"". The chain is very fine and thin in the style of the barely-there/""invisible"" chains that were popular in the late 90s.Pros:+ This chain and necklace looks very classy+ Swarovski crystals really sparkle and stand out.+ Sterling Silver is clearly marked ""925"" on both the pendant and the chain.+ Delicate chain included with pendant.Cons- Chain is very delicate- Chain prone to tangling and can break easily.- Lack of information indicating that this pendant contains Swarovski crystals.- ""Peridot"" is the colour name of this Swarovski crystal as indicated on a Swarovski Crystal Colour Chart. It does not really resemble the colour of an actual peridot (other than being in the green colour family).Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this sterling silver pendant and chain.

Most of the specialty ingredients can be bought in your local supermarket in the international foods aisle, ordered online and of course in specialty markets if you have one near you.

The worm should go smoothly into the cork and the arms on the side should rise.  Then push downwards in the arms and the cork should pop up.The best versions of this type of corkscrew have pointed worms that penetrate the cork easily and smooth (sometimes non-stick) worms to slide into the cork easily.  This corkscrew is easy and effortless to use.  A big plus is the sturdy hinge that should last many years.A nice addition is the matching bottle stopper.

I use it for light painting patterns (cool in the fog) and projecting on models.  Simple to use and setup. The keystone control is basic, but works (adjusting the distortion caused by the projector pointing in an angle up or down.)  There are even small stereo speakers built in.

There are also flaps over all the pockets and reinforced stitching in stress areas - nice touches.Very comfortable, well designed pants that are suitable for any winter activity, from riding to snow-blowing, hiking to skiing.

The sides and bottom expand to allow you to stuff an unbelievable amount of stuff in here.

"Setup: Easy. Unbox, remove the protective tape, turn on, install the included ""initial"" cartridge (translation: almost empty, enough for a demo.)  Install via USB or wireless. I used wireless, followed the prompts, used WPS.  From unboxing to up and running - 5 minutes.Now we need to add it to the network. Go to Epson's page and download the driver - I Googled ""Epson PictureMate PM-400 and found it in a couple of clicks.  The installer does the rest. From downloading to printing - under three minutes - and that included an automatic firmware update.  You can also set up printing from email and the cloud. I selected both options. One annoyance for me - you can't copy and paste a password.  I prefer to store passwords in a file, this way I can make them as complex as needed. Epson requires an ""Epson Connect"" account - hence the password.  After creating the account, your printer has it's own email address.  Registration, etc. - another 5 minutes. You'll also receive a verification via email. Actually, I received three emails, one for 10% off on supplies.A verification page is printed. Since I had 4x6 paper in the printer, I have a beautiful 4x6"" test page.Everything was 100% painless, no problems at all.  Since the printer is so new (as of 11-5-2015) there were no drivers in Windows or Windows update. But the Google search took care of that.  After the driver is installed you're also prompted if you want the software to automatically check for updates. I always answer ""No"" to that - I have enough stuff running in the background.Ink, the bane of all printer owners, that can cost more than the printer.  The ink for this printer (Epson calls the ink a ""Printpack"") comes in two varieties: With 100 sheets of paper 4x6 glossy paper - T320P, or just the ink - T320.  Each cartridge is good for 100 prints.  With the paper the retail is only $6 more.  This is one of those printers you should NEVER use generic ink in.  Most ink cartridges have the print heads built in the cartridge. Not here - the ink is just ink.  I can guarantee that generic ink will cause problems - AKA, clogging your print heads beyond repair.The photo quality is amazing - better than an inkjet printer or laser.  The ink is dye based, so you have very vivid colors on photo paper. Amazingly so. That's also why the resolution is so good - 5760x1440 DPI.Papers supported include glossy, plain, and various photo papers. Also double sided (manual only.)The printer is also a stand-alone print lab, making it ideal for photo booths and on-site photos.  You can print via USB, wireless or SD card.  The printer has some basic editing capabilities built-in: auto photo correction, red-eye removal, crop, rotate and enlarge.  There's a small screen that displays menu choices as well as preview images. Print speed is a snappy 36 seconds on default settings.This is an amazing little printer, very portable and very affordable - prints - at retail supply prices - would be 38 cents each.  No wait, no fuss, no mess.  Perfect for portable studios and events.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341SNPT1DJNRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KU0RIA#wasThisHelpful","R341SNPT1DJNRU","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmmm. No Star Destroyer - that would have really made the set.What you  get (what I received, assuming it's not random):Rebel SnowspeederBoba Fett's Slave 1Millennium FalconX-Wing FighterGhost (from the Rebels cartoons)Tie FighterMisses: Some models are really top heavy and topple over is you stare at them strongly. Especially the Falcon. ""Die Cast."" Welll, mostly. The Tie Fighter is 90% plastic. Only the body is die cast. Falcon? The top is die-cast, the rest plastic. X-wing? The body is metal. The wings, plastic. The weapons - rubber - and bent at bizarre angles from being packaged poorly.  Slave 1 - 70% plastic, including the wings - and those don't move. Snowspeeder: top half, metal. Bottom - plastic. Weapons - rubber. And again, pointing in strange angles from poor packaging.The gems are the Tie Fighter and the Falcon. Then the X-Wing. The Snowspeeder and Ghost seem like fillers. You get Slave 1 instead of the Star Destroyer. Not a good trade. Slave 1 is a couple of $$ more than the Star Destroyer.The X-Wing and Tie Fighter are the same scale, so you can have mock battles.The ""Flight Navigator"" is a cute idea, but the opening is sized for kids - hey - adults like these as well. My pinkie finger *just* fits.Overall it's a fun set, with good quality and detail. Calling them ""die cast"" is a stretch. It's like calling a car ""carbon fiber"" when only the hood and roof are Carbon Fiber.  The crooked weapons drive me crazy.

"I can't believe this watch is so inexpensive. It has a Japanese movement - not Chinese, is water resistant to 99 feet, and has a sophisticated style that's not *too* dressy.It's also the first watch I have that came with it's own gift bag that's color matched to the watch.It's definitely a man's watch - it's 1.75"" inches wide (including the bezel), and only 3/8"" thick.  So it's slim enough to slip under a shirt cuff.Unlike many watches, the second hand actually moves in one second ticks - it's not a continuous sweep. This really adds to the classic watch look and feel.  The strap is leather, stamped with an Alligator skin pattern.If you have thick wrists, the band may not size large enough. I have average wrists, 7.5"" - there's only two holes remaining on the strap (one if I wear it a little loose) - that's slightly less than 1"" remaining.It's also light, like any decent watch. You can wear it and forget it. It is NOT designed to be used in the shower, pool, etc.  That's because the crown does not screw in, meaning it's only a soft seal.It just presses in.  It's fine for the rain, but not prolonged use in the water.For the price you can't go wrong.

"My GF told me today that I have something wrong with me - I'm way too into flashlights.  It's a habit I developed in my days as a SCUBA instructor for wreck, cavern and cave diving.  A light was literally a life saver.  This was before LED lights, when a hard tap could kill the light, bulbs burned out, and lights often just failed - bad batteries, flooding - you name it. I developed the practice of carrying several lights.  Even today, if I'm exploring, hiking or out at night, I'll often have several lights.Every company seems to make LED lights today, but there are too few manufacturers that pay attention to quality.  Instead of soldering wires, they're pinched or twisted. Battery connections are flimsy and cases could double as aluminum foil.  When it comes to LED lights, you really do get what you pay for.The R20 is bright. Blindingly so. There's three brightness settings. At the brightest you can actually feel the heat it produces from a foot away.  The max brightness of 900 lumens lasts about three minutes, then drops to 450 lumens - it lasts 2 1/5 hours there.  The light comes with a 2600 mAh (9.6 What hour)  18650 battery. Olight also sells other capacity batteries.  Olight's batteries are top notch and true to their ratings. They even give the Watt hour rating for their batteries.  Their 2600 mAh batteries last longer than many manufacturers ""4000"" mAh batteries.Other features: There's an internal ring on the lens that's luminescent.  The battery is removable. The lanyard is thick and very comfortable. The lens is glass.  IPX8 rating to two meters.  It's rechargeable and uses a micro-USB cable to charge.The light is durable, reliable and bright.  I've used it working in our pond with the light in and out of the water, Carried it for several days and used it nightly and to inspect in drop ceilings, etc. It's still on the first charge.I've included several photos. One on the deck - you can see it's a wide beam but still has a lot of throw.  It was a foggy night, so there was a lot of backscatter - but the beam looks cool.  I also took it to the park across the street and took a photo on high and low.  Finally, there's a shot of the glowing ring.  This is one fantastic light.Free sample provided for honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9JQN8OUT4G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NX37WQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9JQN8OUT4G1","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I Love this eyelet tool! Very easy to use. We did some wedding cake boxes for a friend - we used this to add eyelets to the boxes for a ribbon to go through.  Anywhere you need an eyelet, this is one handy tool.  There's a setting for the eyelet hole punch position, up to .75"" in. Punch the hole, slip in the eyelet, and crimp.A bag of eyelets is included.  One eyelet is used per punch (unlike grommets that need two sections.)

"Each time I check out an Olight flashlight, I continue to be impressed. Yes, they cost more than the ""generic"" LED's you see all over Amazon. You know - the same light sold by 20 different places, the only thing that;s different is the name printed on them and the prices. Sure, I've got a few of those - heck, $6 plus batteries/charger? For under $10 you get a decent, bright light. BUT (and that's a big but) there's the question of reliability.  I have a LOT of flashlights.  Some friends joke I have an addiction. I had over 125 at last count. I purchased most, received some as review items.  Many are the cheap $5 and $10 lights.  I do a lot of urban exploring (Urbexing) - delving into long abandoned buildings, usually pitch black, often with basements. Lights are important - and a reliable light is a must.  The problem with those $5 and $10 lights? The reliability sucks.  I have to carry a few of them, and hope I can get 20 or 30 minutes from a light. Drop one? half the time it dies - many don't solder connections - it's just wires pinched between parts.  For example, there's often a lead pinched between the reflector and the housing.  Drop of bang the light, the reflector often pops out and the light dies.  Yea, a quick fix at home, but not in a pitch black warren 10 feet underground.Reliability. *That's* the #1 feature I like about Olight flashlights.  Well, that and you can go blind looking at the LED.  The throw this light has is incredible. It's only 5""x1"" and gives of as much light as many headlights. Put the S30R a couple of inches from your hand and turn it on bright - the beam is actually hot. That's one reason it has a glass lens - plastic would eventually melt.Other observations: The reflector is textured - this creates a beautiful, smooth pool of light - no ugly gaps and mottled hot spots.  Every seam is O-ring sealed. The pocket clip is heavy duty and won't scratch the light when you remove or replace it (I usually take mine off.) You need to actually READ the manual, as the soft-touch switch has several functions. The light includes an 18650 2600 mAh / 9.6 Wh battery.  You can use higher capacity batteries as well - but be sure it's a quality battery - Olight sells these as well. There's no lanyard and no place to string one.  No loss there.  The light has a nice feel and weight, with texture and ribbing for heat distribution and grip. The tail is magnetic.I have a lot of 18650 batteries. When a light dies, I swap the battery (I always carry spares), I usually charge them a day before my outings.  This light has an included charging stand and it's really cool.  The magnetic tail clicks onto the base and the light charges via a USB cable attached to the base.  The base is non-slip, but also includes an adhesive pad in case you want to permanently mount it somewhere. With the base glued down, you can drop the lite onto the base and remove it with one hand (the base stays stuck down.)The battery that is included is a 2600 mAh battery (a true 2600 mAh.)  You can use an 18650 up to 3600 mAh and increase the run time by about 30%. Another versatile feature - say you're 18650 battery is dead and you don't have time to charge it. You can just pop in two CR123A batteries!  Most lights would fry if you tried that.The light is waterproof to two meters, so is fine for marine use, in the rain and so on.This is one well thought out and designed light that's also blindingly bright.  From my back porch it lit up my entire deck and a tree 250 feet away!  I've included several photos.  This light is ideal for security, exploring, light painting and more.Free sample provided for honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWR6C4AIP1TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016PZ7FOW#wasThisHelpful","RQWR6C4AIP1TS","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun toy for little ones, but personally if they're into the ponies they'll outgrow this fast.  The four year old we babysit already has - seriously - 300 ponies. ""Old School"". ""rainbowified"", ""glittery"", ""black"", ""clear"" and more.  At 55, the last thing I thought I'd learn were the cutie marks and names of, er, My Little Ponies.  ""Can you bring me Fluttershy?"" ""Do you know where Applejack is?"" ""I can't carry the box with the old school ponies..."" and so on. OK, yea, it is fun playing with her. My GF jokes that the four year old and I have the same mentality.  Not sure it that's an insult aimed at me, or a compliment for her.Anyway, this is a nice set for toddlers and maybe up to age three. Once they get their hands on ""real"" ponies, there's no going back.  The ones in this set are simplified - the ponies are colorful single piece of molded plastic. No individual legs, but decent features. You can look at a pony and recognize it - ""Yep, that's Pinkie Pie.""The structure/toy is well made, has a few parts to assemble (maybe five minutes) and will keep Pony fans engaged for ages.  The recommended age is 18 months and up. I put the upper end at three years, but our little one started playing with ""old school"" ponies around 2 1/2.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GF7QNPO5L6SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENR9W#wasThisHelpful","R3GF7QNPO5L6SW","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's a lot to like about these phones, both in functionality and looks.Looks: Cute, solid pink color with black accent rings. Gray controls on the right earpiece, KidWavz logo on the left. Older kids may not appreciate that.Functionality/comfort: In Bluetooth (not when using the cable) there's a volume limit of 85db (considered safe for 8 continuous hours.) Each earpiece is on a pivot and has a height adjustment for comfort, plus has comfortable padding.  The overall width is sized for kids, not adults, and the top is well padded. In other words, very comfortable.  They *will* fit an adult, but may be a little snug.The Kidwavz headphones are 100% designed with kids in mind, with the volume limiter, smaller size, less bass and clearer vocals (of course any kid can adjust that in the EQ or EQ app), and light weight. Prompts are spoken, not just simple chirps.They also produce great audio and sound very realistic.

"Love the cube, can take or leave the clamp. Details later.I own several laser levels. Single line, multi-line, 360 and cross. Dealt, Bosch and others.  Price ranges from $40 to $450. At $100 this is priced right where it belongs.  The more affordable lasers, like this, use a simple pendulum for the laser - it's a balanced laser head array than hangs from a ring (or similar arrangement.) The expensive ones use electronics to stabilize the laser, the inexpensive ones have no stabilization, and mid priced models often have some type of mechanical stabilization. Why do you want that? If you bump the laser, the whatever it's on, or walk on a floor that's bouncy, the laser swings on the pendulum.  With less the stabilization, the more - and longer - it swings. I've seen cheap lasers take as long as 15 seconds to stop moving. My high-end Bosch is almost instant.  The cube takes about three seconds.In a well lit room measuring 12x12 feet, the laser was clearly visible.Mounting options: The cube base gas a 1/4-20 threaded hole - the same on your camera tripod.  So you can use any camera tripod to mount this. The clamp included is identical to ones sold for holding camera accessories - I have a few of them. It's a decent clamp but has problems - first the rubber on the jaws constantly falls off - I automatically glue them on. Next, the ball head is often mounted incorrectly - mine was. The knob that secures the ball  is over the clamp handle, making it impossible to use the clamp. The ball head has to be removed and re-positioned (with a 3mm Allen key.)  The cube cab also be set on a surface. It has a rubberized base just for that purpose.Other features: The cube warns if it's unable to level with a loud beep (it's at too much of an angle/slope.)

"I've only been using this for a couple of weeks, so can't honestly report results.  I'm in Illinois, and many portions of our back yard are dry. We had a dog pen between our shed and a large tree. After trimming the tree and removing the pen, we had a 14x14 foot area of dead, bare dirt, dry as a bone, cracked.  I've done a lot of reading on late season planting of seed, and thought I'd give it a try this year.I cleaned up the area removing weeks, rocks, dried rock-like pieces of mud and so on.  Then surface raked a few times to try and loosen something up - just ended up with a lot of dust.  So I spread this over the area as well as some shade grass seed, then tossed on a little dirt - more to keep the seed from washing away in a light rain.From what information I've found, this should give us a nice, green area next spring. I look at this as a long term project. If this works, I'll do the same thing to any bare spots before next winter.The product has no expiration date and is supposed to be used every four weeks. I tried to do some research on the ingredients. You need to be a chemist to understand it. From what I can find, this type of product  is called a ""soil wetting agent.""

"I've only been using this for a couple of weeks, so can't honestly report results.  I'm in Illinois, and many portions of our back yard are dry. We had a dog pen between our shed and a large tree. After trimming the tree and removing the pen, we had a 14x14 foot area of dead, bare dirt, dry as a bone, cracked.  I've done a lot of reading on late season planting of seed, and thought I'd give it a try this year.I cleaned up the area removing weeks, rocks, dried rock-like pieces of mud and so on.  Then surface raked a few times to try and loosen something up - just ended up with a lot of dust.  So I spread this over the area as well as some shade grass seed, then tossed on a little dirt - more to keep the seed from washing away in a light rain.From what information I've found, this should give us a nice, green area next spring. I look at this as a long term project. If this works, I'll do the same thing to any bare spots before next winter.The product has no expiration date and is supposed to be used every four weeks. I tried to do some research on the ingredients. You need to be a chemist to understand it. From what I can find, this type of product  is called a ""soil wetting agent.""

"All I can say is wow.  I have a few laser tapes, including another Bosch. What sold me on this was the Bluetooth feature.  I have an older tablet - Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and the pairs with no issues.To take advantage of the Bluetooth, you need to use the free ""Bosch Floorplan"" app. I've tried other apps, but none support the Bosch GLM 50 C. I'm sure that more apps will support it in the future.The tool itself is cool. Bosch took ideas from a smartphone and added them to the GLM 50 C. The display is a screen - not just an LCD or LED. This means there are colors, the display changes depending on the mode, the menu is a real menu, and it rotates in 90 degree increments. So the display is always easy to read. The level readout goes to one decimal place - 6.5, 2.1, 22.5, etc.  The lever starts from 0 when laying flat on it's back, or on either long edge.  There's no audio, so if you're using it to level something, you won't hear a ""beep"" when you're level.  But it's not primarily a level.Observations: It's a Class 2 laser - same as laser pointers, so you don't want to stare into it. The back has a 1/4-20 thread for tripod and clamp mounting. The included sheath is very snug - the tool won't fall out, even if the flap is up.  Batteries and a lanyard are included.  Auto powers off after inactivity. The rubber protection is a little strange. The edges are protected, but it does not extend to the back or sides - so this will slide around. It extends past the face a *little*, but the soft-touch buttons extend almost as far. About all the rubber is good for is a better grip. The screen is bright and easy to read, even in sunlight. It is glossy, so *reflections* could make it difficult to read. It does not appear to be weather proof - I say this because there is no gasket on the battery door (it actually rattles), so water can get inside.Bosch has several free apps, but from what I can see, only one - the free ""Bosch Floorplan"" app works with the GLM 50 C.  It's a pretty powerful app with a lot of cool features, but also some annoyances.  You can zoom in and out unless you're in ""wall"" view. Then all you can do is move at the default zoom level. Since this is the area you add doors, windows, etc., not being able to zoom is really annoying.  It's also where you measure wall height, vaulted ceilings, etc. I hope they fix that soon.The app can create basic blueprints with outlets, windows, doors, openings, etc.  It will also calculate areas, angles and so on.  Of course, the tool can do all that as well, but seeing it on the screen is a big difference, especially if you're using it to measure windows and doors, flooring, paint, etc.  The app is obviously designed with professionals in mind, and there is a learning curve - you'll be accomplishing the basics in under 30 minutes.  There are a couple of ways to input the measurements - manually and via the Bluetooth connection.  You can take a bunch of measurements that are stored in a table in the app, then transfer these to your plan, or tap a measurement on the plan, then use the GLM 50 C to enter it directly.  Bluetooth is only ""on"" in the tool when transmitting, so this saves batteries. When a measurement is received, the app notifies you.Finally, this is a marvel of compactness.  It's about 4x1x1.75"" and weighs just 3.5 oz with the batteries. It's a great tool to add to your arsenal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDYXB63Z7F3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FCJTEA#wasThisHelpful","R1WDYXB63Z7F3L","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We all use power strips. Or power strips attached to power strips and extension chords. One reason for that spaghetti-like mess is the collection of USB cables and adapters. Mini-USB, micro-USB, specialty camera cables, bluetooth earpiece chargers - the list seems endless.  The only common factor is that the majority have a USB connection.  I have a really heavy duty power strip - it has 16 outlets. I have this power strip plugged into that one. Yea, yell at me, but I need the outlets.  Not all are used at the same time and I'm way under the load limits.Several of my devices still require adapters - can't use USB - those are plugged into the other power strip. You know how it goes - some adapters cover two outlets, long narrow ones can cover three.  So those plug into the big strip.  This strip gets the smaller adapters, plus the power hungry devices.  Of the six USB ports, two are 2.4 amp, four are 1 amp.  So you can charge two fast charging devices.  If you have more fast charge devices, you can plug in an adapter and add your own. That's basically what I did.  Between my GF, family members and myself, we will literally have as many as 10 devices charging at one time. Three cell phones, iPad, Droid tablets, headsets, speakers, battery packs.  They all add up fast.This strip alone is perfect for most people - six outlets and six USB ports, all in a sleek package.  There's a power switch on the strip that lights when it's on. My only complaint - it can't be mounted unless you use heavy duty Velcro or VHB tape.Free sample provided for honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VOXFKUM8SWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ST788Y#wasThisHelpful","R17VOXFKUM8SWY","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the cutest bath toys. Ever. The critters light up - bright enough so your child could also play with these in the dark.  Glowing bath critters at night - imaginations can run wild - yea, three or four year olds can have fun with these as well.  There's no openings like squirty toys , so you don't have to worry about mold.  There's also no way to change the batteries when they die - but these are LED and I would expect them to have hundreds of hours or glow timeThere are two contacts on the bottom of each critter - same concept as those chirping plastic chicks that sit on your hand.  The surf board is a cute and fun addition to the set. Fun at bath time, wash time, wading pool or water table.  Even without water - a slightly moist hand will illuminate them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEE3SKLIWVC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CBGND2#wasThisHelpful","R2MEE3SKLIWVC5","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was not really sure what to expect when I ordered this - we had an older wooden step ladder that needed replacing.  Amazingly, they weigh the same - my 30 year old wood ladder and this aluminum ladder. The differences are obvious though - this ladder is tall. A lot taller than I expected.  I had to take it out of the box to fit it across the foot of my back seat.  If I need to change bulbs, reach the ceiling, get on the top shelf - no problem. My GF loves it - the ladder weighs so little that she has no problem using it (she's a skinny 100 lbs.)Unlike most ladders, you CAN use the top step. The handle extends 18 inches above the top step.  The two treads are 3"" deep - plenty to comfortable step or stand on.My one complaint is that the ladder does not latch or lock closed. Not a big deal when stored, but when picked up it tends to open.  I wound up putting a Velcro strap around one side near the middle to keep it closed.  The top step/ledge latches in place, so the ladder is locked open when in use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TYX76XS2OIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM5IJGE#wasThisHelpful","R36TYX76XS2OIM","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd never heard of one of these bowls until I was offered one free to review. I showed a photo to my GF and she announced that it was hers once it arrived.This is PERFECT for Pistachios and smaller nuts.  Personally I think it's too small for peanuts - you'd be lucky to fit more than a couple of dozen. But Edamame or Pistachios? Enough to keep you snacking for a while.  It's great on our office desk - when we snack on Pistachios it's always two bowls - on a crammed desk, that's a pain.You can also use this as two individual bowls, say one for Fritos and the other for Queso. Lots of uses and a fun set.I don't know it it's made from plastic, melamine or what - but it is synthetic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ARW67RQPCM2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169TEN8K#wasThisHelpful","R2ARW67RQPCM2G","A3LGT6UZL99IW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGT6UZL99IW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Forty years after Eugene Ormandy's death, the conductor is dismissed as a lightweight by many critics.But this was not always the case.The World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Jean Sibelius was an admirer of Eugene Ormandy.Ormandy's reputation as an interpreter of Sibelius (1865-1957) went into decline following the death of the World's Foremost Authority (in 1957)Overdue for re-evaluation.Almost all of Ormandy's stereo Columbia and RCA recordings of Sibelius are in this box (recorded 1957-1980)-- Sony forgot Ormandy's 1959 Columbia stereo recording of the Violin Concerto with David Oistrakh *Two later versions (with Isaac Stern and Dylana Jensen) are included.Also missing are the mono recordings (1935-1954).This is a shame - those are the recordings that Sibelius was so enthusiastic about.COLUMBIA + RCA STEREO RECORDINGS (in this box):Symphony 1 = 1962 Columbia, 1976 RCASymphony 2 = 1957 Columbia, 1972 RCASymphony 4 = 1978 RCASymphony 5 = 1975 RCASymphony 7 = 1960 Columbia, 1975 RCAFinlandia (standard version) = 1968 ColumbiaFinlandia (choral version) = 1959 Columbia, 1972 RCAOceanides = 1976 RCAPohjola's Daughter = 1976 RCAEn Saga = 1963 Columbia, 1975 RCATapiola = 1976 RCAValse triste = 1959 Columbia, 1973 RCAKarelia Suite = 1968 Columbia, 1975 RCAKarelia Overture = 1977 RCALemminkäinen Suite: Swan of Tuonela = 1960 Columbia, 1973 RCAViolin Concerto = 1969 Columbia (Isaac Stern), 1980 RCA (Dylana Jensen) - MISSING 1959 Columbia (David Oistrakh)EMI STEREO RECORDING (not in this box)Lemminkäinen Suite (Four Legends from the Kalevala) = 1978 **COLUMBIA + RCA MONO RECORDINGS (not in this box):Symphony 1 = 1935 Minneapolis, 1941 PhiladelphiaSymphony 2 = 1947Symphony 4 = 1954Symphony 5 = 1954Finlandia = 1940, 1950Oceanides = 1955Pohjola's Daughter = 1955En Saga = 1955Tapiola = 1955Lemminkäinen Suite (Four Legends from the Kalevala) = 1951Lemminkäinen Suite: Swan of Tuonela = 1940, 1950Lemminkäinen Suite: Lemminkäinen's Return = 1940PACKAGING AND SOUND:Eight CDs in cardboard jackets (not original jacket format) in a cardboard box.No booklet - this is one of Sony's super budget boxes.Track listings and recording dates are on the back of each jacket - the identical photo of Ormandy is on the front of all eight jackets.Unimaginative.The box claims ""24-bit high resolution audio"" - no information on who did the remastering.The RCA recordings are probably the existing 24-bit Japanese XRCD transfers (I can't be certain without the identity of the remastering engineer).Everything sounds fine to me.POINTS OF INTEREST:-- FINLANDIAThis release clears up some confusion about Ormandy's three stereo recordings of Finlandia.Finnish poet V.A. Koskenniemi added lyrics to Finlandia in 1941, turning it into a patriotic anthem.Sibelius gave it his blessing in 1942, so the ""choral version"" is technically legit.Ormandy recorded the standard orchestral version in 1968 (CD8, track 1)He recorded the choral version twice - Most impressively with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in 1959 (CD8, track 8)By comparison, the unnamed choir used by RCA in 1972 (CD2, track 7) is pretty bland.All three are in this box.English Text used by Ormandy (deleting reference to Finland):""On great, lone hills, where tempests brood and gather,Primeval Earth, against primeval sky,We, faring forth, possessed by fervent longing,Have found a throne, eternal and high,Have knelt at last in wordless adoration,Till fire and whirlwind have both gone by.With ardent song we greet the golden morning.By faith upborne, remember not the night.The whole wide world, triumphant hails the dawning.God walks abroad in garments of might,The hills, behold, are now a path of splendor,Transfigured all, and all crowned with light.""[see the Comment dated November 13, 2015 for the original patriotic text.]Odd - In 1959 Ormandy and the orchestra recorded Finlandia in Philadelphia.Columbia engineers then took the tape 2,000 miles west to record the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in Utah.Surprisingly, this is Not a World Record:In 1976 DG engineers recorded Saint-Saens' Organ Symphony with Daniel Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony.The organist was recorded 4,000 miles away in the Chartres Cathedral.-- One work of  Sibelius was new to Ormandy's repertoire in the 1970s: The Karelia Overture Op.10 (not to be confused with the better known Karelia Suite Op.11)An absolutely gorgeous performance and recording (1975 RCA).Every other recording of this rarity sounds anemic by comparison.--  The sound of the RCA recordings is a lot better than I remembered.The 1970s were a bad decade for RCA: Dynagroove + Dynaflex LP pressings. Yecch.I now find most of the RCA stereo recordings an improvement over their Columbia predecessors (no need to take my word for it - Sony gives you both versions).Where there is duplication, the 1972-1980 RCA recordings (Symphonies 1,2,7) are two to four percent slower than the 1957-1969 Columbia recordings.Barely noticeable.Exception: the 1980 Violin Concerto with Dylana Jenson is a lot slower (in the first two movements) than Ormandy's 1969 recording with Isaac Stern (see next paragraph)-- Dylana Jenson was a child prodigy - a student of Nathan Milstein.Tchaikovsky Competition Silver Medalist at age 17, playing the Sibelius Concerto.She made her adult debut in Carnegie Hall at age 19, playing the same Concerto - Ormandy conducted.Three days later, she and Ormandy recorded it (the only DDD recording in this box).Compared with the Stern/Ormandy recording from 1969, Jenson stresses the lyricism - at least in the first two movements (the first movement is daringly drawn out).The 1959 Oistrakh/Ormandy recording (not in this box) is in the middle.Timings for the Finale are virtually identical.Stern ------ 14:16 -- 7:35 -- 7:21Oistrakh -- 14:53 -- 8:20 -- 7:26Jenson --- 16:22 -- 8:33 -- 7:17-- Three Sibelius specialists:Herbert von Karajan never recorded Symphony 3.Sir Thomas Beecham never recorded Symphonies 3 and 5.Eugene Ormandy never recorded Symphonies 3 and 6.What's wrong with Symphony 3?--  With the exception of the Karelia Overture and two of three Finlandias (1959 choral and 1968), none of these recordings are my absolute first choice, but everything is in the top ten percent.Eight CDs for $15. Hard to resist.Ormandy was not a high profile Sibelius interpreter (unlike Late Bernstein and Late Karajan).These are fairly straightforward performances by a spectacular orchestra.Rachmaninov and even Shostakovich shared Sibelius' enthusiasm for Eugene Ormandy.Two more boxes that Sony could give us.I hope they include booklets this time.------------------------------------------------------CONDUCTORS RECOMMENDED BY SIBELIUS:In addition to Ormandy, eight additional conductors received the blessing of the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Sibelius:(which ought to count for something)See my comment dated November 13, 2015.------------------------------------------------------* Oistrakh/Ormandy 1959 Columbia stereo recording of the Violin Concerto = Beethoven / Sibelius: Violin Concertos** Ormandy's 1978 EMI stereo recording of the Lemminkäinen Suite  =  Sibelius: Lemminkainen Suite, Tapiola - or - Sibelius: Four Legends from the Kalevala","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D866IXMB26JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129YC2NM#wasThisHelpful","R3D866IXMB26JZ","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"56 CDs + One DVD for $143 NewRemarkable bargain.Back in 1991, Sony issued the 22 CD ""Igor Stravinsky: The Edition"" -  Igor Stravinsky: The Recorded Legacyreissued in 2007 as ""Works of Igor Stravinsky"" - Works of Igor StravinskyUnlike that one, this new box is absolutely complete- Every recording that Stravinsky  made for Columbia Records (US) between 1940 and 1967- one quarter of the contents of this new box are the mono recordings that were slighted in 1991.- some performances are conducted by Robert Craft ""under the supervision of Igor Stravinsky"".- Stravinsky had approval of the solo and chamber recordings:--- Charles Rosen played most of the piano works.--- Gold & Fizdale played the two-piano works (but not the two-piano version of the Rite of Spring, which has only become popular in the years following Stravinsky's death).The new box includes both the mono and stereo recordings of Oedipus Rex and The Rake's Progress, plus the ballets and symphonies.PACKAGING AND SOUND:""Original jacket"" format with original cover art and album notes on the back of each cardboard sleeve, plus a 254 page hardcover book.The book is a tribute to Stravinsky the man.For information about the music, you mostly have to read the original jackets (use a magnifying glass).Surprisingly, everything was newly remastered for this new collection (24bit/96kHz)22 CDs remastered by Sony regulars Andreas Meyer and Jeanne Montalvo33 CDs remastered by Martin Kistner1 CD remastered by Richard KingAbsolutely no complaints about the soundPOINTS OF INTEREST:-- Both the 1940 mono and 1960 stereo recordings of the Rite of Spring feature the New York Philharmonic, but in 1960 it was recorded under the pseudonym ""Columbia Symphony""Recording session photos show the same musicians who participated in Leonard Bernstein's 1958 Philharmonic recording (also same recording venue - The St. George Hotel in Brooklyn).Columbia actually paid the musicians more to record as the ""Columbia Symphony"", but saved money on future royalties.There was also a California-based version of the ""Columbia Symphony"" - mostly Los Angeles Philharmonic musicians-- Several editing errors have been corrected.Movements for Piano and Orchestra (with Charles Rosen) is now correctly edited for the first time on CD (the repeat is included).-- The DVD is not a comprehensive look at Stravinsky's career.It concentrates on his brief flirtation with Hollywood.Interesting.-- The 1953 recording of ""The Rake's Progress"" was recorded at the Metropolitan Opera shortly after the American premiere, with the original Met cast (Hilde Gueden, Eugene Conley, Mack Harrell and Martha Lipton).The American premiere was prepared and conducted by Fritz Reiner.The actual world premiere was in Venice in 1951, conducted by the composer (with Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, Ottakar Krauss, Robert Rounseville and Jennie Tourel) *-- The 1991 box included a selection of pre-1940 chamber music recordings with Stravinsky and violinist Samuel Dushkin, but they were borrowed from EMI and are not in the new box. **-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This new collection was an extravagant decision on Sony's part, but I'm glad they did it.I'm not sure how they will ever recoup the cost at the low price asked - they will have to sell a lot of boxes.I have only one complaint - There are no texts or translations for the vocal worksThey were included with the 1991 box (but not the 2007 reissue).Surely Sony could at least have posted them on their website.I will have to keep my booklets from the 1991 boxed set.* The 1951 Venice world premiere of ""The Rakes's Progress"" is available on Igor Stravinsky: The Rake's Progress** Pre-1940 EMI recordings:  Composers in Person: Igor Stravinsky","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKFKRRGSCBO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH53056#wasThisHelpful","R1XKFKRRGSCBO9","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are no new recordings in this box - everything has been issued before (see Buyer's Guide at the end of this review).Riccardo Chailly is the only conductor to have recorded ALL of Brahms' orchestral music.The Four Symphonies, four Concertos, two Overtures and Variations on a Theme of Haydn have been recorded hundreds of times.The two Serenades are also easy to find.To these Chailly has added some RARITIES:-- Liebeslieder Waltzes Op.52, No.1,2,4,5,6,8,9,11 and Op.65, No.9In 1868, Brahms composed 18 waltzes for vocal quartet accompanied by piano four-hands.The following year he orchestrated nine (for orchestra alone - no singers).Also recorded by Gary Bertini/Vienna Symphony and Thomas Dausgaard/Swedish Chamber Orchestra.-- Two Intermezzi for Piano: Op.116, No.4 and Op.117, No.1 - ONLY RECORDINGThis is a ringer - Not orchestrated by Brahms.Orchestrated by Paul Klengel (1854-1935), a German conductor and composer who was a friend of Brahms(the notes don't say when Klengel orchestrated them, or if Brahms approved).-- Symphony 1: Original version of the Second MovementThis version of the second movement Andante premiered in 1876 with the rest of the Symphony, but before publication Brahms dropped five bars and added some transition material.This is the second recording of the original version - Charles Mackerras was first, with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.-- Symphony 4: Revised opening to the First Movement - ONLY RECORDINGSome time after the premiere, Brahms added four bars to the opening of the First Movement, but quickly changed his mind.The Symphony was never performed this way.These introductory bars are over in a mere eight seconds, but Decca allots it 46 seconds.Brahms based his introduction on the final bars of the same movement, so the first movement now begins and ends with the same music.To illustrate this, the track opens with the final bars of the First Movement (13 seconds),then after a brief pause, you hear the new introduction (8 seconds) leading directly into the familiar First Movement (which fades away after 15 seconds).I don't much care for it, but may feel differently after I've heard it a few hundred times.I think it would have made a better impression if Decca had included two complete performances of the first movement - with and without the introduction - instead of just a fragment for the revised opening.This is the only recording of the revised opening of Symphony 4.I am informed that back in the 1960s, it was featured during the intermission of a Cleveland Orchestra radio broadcast.Apparently George Szell was interviewed and the orchestra performed the music.I'm not sure if Szell or his assistant Louis Lane conducted.It would be nice to have as part of a future ""George Szell Edition"".-- Hungarian Dances No. 1, 3 and 10Not exactly rarities, but not usually included with the symphonies.Brahms composed 21 Hungarian Dances for piano duet in the 1860s, and orchestrated these three in 1874 (other composers orchestrated the rest)These are fine modern performances - the Symphonies are an improvement over Chailly's first set with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw,but the competition in the major Brahms works is fierce.The primary attraction of this set is it's absolute completeness.All the rarities are included with the Symphonies - this part is an essential purchase.Depending on personal taste, you may or may not need Chailly's CDs of the two Serenades and four Concertos.You can save some money by buying just the 3 CD (or one Blu-Ray * ) collection of the Symphonies.(see Buyer's Guide)------------------------------------------------------BUYER'S GUIDE:[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]This 7 CD box is currently selling for $30 new on Amazon.Versus $43 total for the 7 CDs in previous editions:Symphonies + Orchestral Works + All the  rarities = Brahms: The Symphonies = $19 (3 CD set) *Serenades = Brahms: Serenades = $7Piano Concerti = Brahms: The Piano Concertos = $11 (2 CD set)Violin + Violin & Cello Concerti = Brahms: Violin Concerto;

"This nifty 1947 B-Movie film noir from Monogram (aka Allied Artists) features Barry Sullivan as small-time gangster ""Shubunka"".No first name.Unless ""Shubunka"" is his first name.Faithful  to the Uni-Name spirit, Shubunka's girl friend is played by the actress ""Belita"".""Belita"" was actually Maria Belita Gladys Olive Lyne Jepson-Turner, born in Nether-Wallop, Hampshire, UK.She first came to public notice as a thirteen year old figure skater on the 1936 British Olympic Team, before her parents took her to Hollywood.Blond and blue-eyed, she does not fit my image of a ""Belita"".Nevertheless, not a bad actress.A very talky movie.The dialogue is a bunch of characters reciting their inner monologues out loud to each other.Sort of like a film noir written by Eugene O'Neill.Bizarre and pretentious, but always interesting.Released on a DVD-R from Warner Archive Collection.I watched it on Turner Classic Movies, where it had English subtitles, and a helpful introduction by film noir expert Eddie Mueller.Based on my experience, Warner Archive Collection DVD-Rs do NOT have subtitles.No extras either.Still a fun movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2708M010WB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043FZZKS#wasThisHelpful","R3F2708M010WB2","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not Season Four of ""Sherlock""It is a single 90 minute adventure titled ""The Abominable Bride"".This is not Episode One of Season Four.The BBC series ""Sherlock"" is set in modern-day London.“The Abominable Bride” will be a traditional Sherlock Holmes adventure set in Victorian London (see photos below).Sounds like it should be fun.The first three seasons aired on the BBC at two year intervals -Season One in 2010 -- Season Two on New Year's Day 2012 -- Season Three on New Year's Day 2014Season Four is running late. We will have to wait until New Year’s Day 2017.To tide us over until then, the BBC and PBS are offering us this interesting stand-alone experiment.Presumably the story is based on  ""The Case of Ricoletti of the Club-foot and his Abominable Wife"" one of Dr. Watson's cases for which the public is not yet prepared - mentioned in ""The Musgrave Ritual"".Set to air on PBS January 1, 2016, with DVD and Blu-Ray release on January 11, 2016.I can't guarantee that the PBS Masterpiece broadcast will be uncut.I plan to wait for the Blu-Ray anyway.---------------------------------------------------------------------I found the following article on the Entertainment Weekly website dated October 24, 2015See my comment dated November 4, 2015 for a link to their website.(it includes the trailer)""The BBC and PBS Masterpiece just announced premiere dates for the UK and the U.S. debuts of the eagerly awaited Victorian special edition of the acclaimed detective drama. And for the first time ever, those dates are the same day.The Sherlock special – titled Sherlock: The Abominable Bride – will air in both territories on Friday, Jan. 1, 2016.It’s been a very long wait for more Sherlock. The international sensation starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman had its third season debut in January 2014. PBS’ agreement has required that the show first air on the BBC, and UK networks tend to announce premiere dates much closer to when the show will actually air compared to U.S. networks (which often announce premiere dates many months in advance as part of a marketing campaign). Sherlock also used to have wide gaps between its UK and U.S. air dates, but fan lobbying and widespread online piracy have considerably shrunk that window in recent years, and for the upcoming special the gap has basically been eliminated entirely.In addition to the one-off episode set during Victorian times, producers are also working on a fourth season of the regular, modern-day Sherlock. Filming of season 4 was originally announced for this year, but is now expected to begin in early 2016.Here’s the Victorian special official description courtesy of PBS:“Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the acclaimed modern retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic stories. But now our heroes find themselves in 1890s London. Beloved characters Mary Morstan (played by Amanda Abbington), Inspector Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and Mrs. Hudson (Una Stubbs) also turn up at 221b Baker Street.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LK7QBVNSXBSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JBJ7EG#wasThisHelpful","R2LK7QBVNSXBSC","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Universal, the legendary horror studio of the 1930s and '40s, also produced the Abbott and Costello comedies of the 1940s and '50s.In 1948, they had the genius idea of combining both franchises in the wildly successful ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"".More than Frankenstein - the movie also included Universal's other horror stars Dracula and The Wolf-Man.Dracula was Bela Lugosi ....

No problem there..Frankenstein should have been Boris Karloff .... but he wasn't.Karloff played the Frankenstein Monster in the first three films (1931-1939).Chaney took over in 1942 (""Ghost of Frankenstein""), followed by Lugosi in 1943 (Frankenstein Meets the Wolf-Man"").Glenn Strange finished off the series in 1944 (""House of Frankenstein"") and 1945 (""House of Dracula"").Universal would have liked to cast Karloff in the Abbott and Costello film, but he was either tired of the role or held out for too much money.Since Lugosi and Chaney were already in the cast, the role of Frankenstein went by default to Glenn Strange.""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" was an enormous hit in 1948, which caused Karloff to have second thoughts.in 1949, he agreed to co-star in ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff"",probably the most awkward movie title ever -- see movie poster below.""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff"" is not in this collection.A justifiable decision – it’s not really a horror comedy, more of a mystery comedy (and it’s not as funny as “Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein”).But it does have elements of the supernatural, and it does have Boris Karloff.Karloff plays sinister mystic Swami Talpur, but in the end he turns out to be just a crook, not a real Svengali.I do wish Universal had included it in this collection, since it is unavailable outside of big multi-disc collections.*Boris Karloff returned once more for 1953’s “Abbott & Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” (in this collection).[“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” was not part of the Universal horror franchise - MGM produced the two previous versions, with Frederick March (1931) and Spencer Tracy (1941).]Two additional entries (without famous co-stars) are in this box:- “Abbott & Costello Meet the Invisible Man” (1951)I wish Vincent Price had been cast (he had a cameo as the Invisible Man in “Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein”).Instead they chose the unmemorable Arthur Franz.- “Abbott & Costello Meet the Mummy” (1955) with Michael Ansara as the Mummy – another role originated by Boris Karloff.[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]These films (and their special features) are not new to DVD.-- ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" has even been given the Blu-Ray treatment: Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein [Blu-ray] **-- ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Invisible Man"" is in The Invisible Man: Complete Legacy Collection-- ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Mummy"" is in  The Mummy: Complete Legacy CollectionBut the new two-DVD set is the easiest way to acquire ""Abbott & Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr, Hyde""I only wish Universal had coupled this film with ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff"",thereby giving us a convenient coupling of the two films that Boris Karloff made with Abbott and Costello.* ""Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff"" is in The Best of Abbott & Costello, Vol. 3 (Abbott & Costello Go to Mars / Abbott & Costello in the Foreign Legion / Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein / Abbott & Costello Meet the Invisible Man / Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer / Comin' Round the Mountain / Lost in Alaska / Mexican Hayride)** ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" is also available on DVD in three different ""Complete Legacy Collection"" boxes from Universal::Frankenstein: Complete Legacy CollectionDracula: Complete Legacy CollectionThe Wolf Man: Complete Legacy Collection","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291INI2K1HXFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR3W3M8#wasThisHelpful","R291INI2K1HXFJ","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"D.C.I. George Gently (played by Martin Shaw) debuted on British television in 2007.The first episode was set in 1964 .The final episode of Series Seven takes place during the final week week of 1969.All seven series have English SDH subtitles, and are uncut - Unlike the PBS Masterpiece Mystery broadcast versions.Extras: Season Seven has three brief interviews with cast members.He was Inspector George Gently of Scotland Yard when his wife was killed by a hit-and-run driver.Overcome by depression, he retreats to a small city in Northern England *, where everyone speaks in a bizarre pseudo-Scottish dialect (children = ""bairns"").Gently is appointed Detective Chief Inspector of the local police.DCI Gently is a big fish in a small pond.The police force he joins is remarkably corrupt (as was the force he left).DCI Gently does not approve of local policing methods, but he is not above looking the other way if it will advance his investigation.His sergeant is D.S. John Bacchus, young and trendy and thoroughly unlikeable (played by Lee Ingleby with a Beatles haircut).Sergeant Bacchus' goal in life (frustrated by DCI Gently) is to drive his sports car to Swinging London and join Scotland Yard.I'm not sure why Gently keeps him on, but they are still together after seven seasons.Sergeant Bacchus did mature a bit following the traumatic events of the Season Five finale (""Gently in the Cathedral"") -the best episode in the series.It featured a guest appearance from Kevin Whately (better known as Inspector Lewis) as George Gently's old friend Inspector Don McGhee.Season Six introduced a new character: WPC (Women's Police Constable) Rachel Coles, (played by Lisa McGrillis).Unfortunately she brings out the worst in Sergeant Bacchus, who is jealous of the [professional] attention paid to her by DCI Gently.I'm worried about Sergeant Bacchus.Season Seven struck me as the best writing so far (though episode two - ""Breathe in the Air""-  is incredibly manipulative).There is some re-thinking of the series:-- George Gently has health worries and is drinking too much. Ominous.-- On DCI Gently's recommendation, there are two promotions:Detective Inspector John Bacchus and Detective Sergeant Rachael Coles (could a sequel be in the works?).The Season Seven epilogue indicates that another Season is planned, but I am worried.George Gently, a World War II veteran, is in his fifties.The actor Martin Shaw just turned seventy and can't keep this up forever.I will miss him when he goes.* The largest city in the area is Durham (population 50,000), home to Durham Cathedral - featured in the Season 5 finale.Rev. John Bacchus Dykes (1823-1876) was a famous Nineteenth Century clergyman from Durham (thanks Wikipedia).Seasons 3-7 were filmed in several locations in Northeast England including Durham - Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed in Ireland.-------------------------------------------------------BUYER'S GUIDE[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]The first five series occupy a year each, 1964 through 1968.1969 is spread over Seasons Six and Seven.Seasons 1-4 are available singly, but I recommend you purchase the mega-box of the first four Seasons.You get all four seasons for less than half the cost if purchased separately.(also, for once the Blu-Ray version costs less than DVD).Blu-Ray or DVD - GEORGE GENTLY COLLECTION: SERIES 1-4 (BLU-RAY)Each series is individually packaged in its own plastic case (with original artwork), all of which which slides neatly into a cardboard slipcase.Season Five:Blu-Ray or DVD - George Gently, Series 5 [Blu-ray](with the great final episode)Season Six :Blue Ray or DVD - George Gently 6 [Blu-ray]Series Seven: Reviewed on this page..Four years before he played DCI George Gently, Martin Shaw was Inspector Adam Dalgliesh in P.D.

"Bulldog Drummond is not a private eye.He's a retired Army officer who finds peacetime Britain too tame, so devotes his energies to the fight against crime.Very much a modern vigilante.Twenty sound films with eleven different actors were produced between 1929 and 1969.OnesMedia will be presenting the complete collection on DVD for the first time, in two volumes:RONALD COLMAN- 1929 Bulldog Drummond- 1934 Bulldog Drummond Strikes BackPicture and sound quality for the 1929 film are surprisingly good for an early talkie.It's also a pre-code film: When a villain threatens to rape the heroine, Bulldog Drummond immediately strangles him to death.Picture quality for the second film (co-starring Loretta Young) is not as good - it appears to be copied from a VHS tape, and there is a slight glitch every thirty seconds.But this is this film's only listing on Amazon, so one can't be too picky.RALPH RICHARDSON- 1934 The Return of Bulldog DrummondAside from Hitchcock, one does not expect much from pre-war British films, but this curiosity is of exceptional interest.Bulldog Drummond is more than a vigilante - he is the commanding officer of his own private army.Drummond's militia wears black shirts and leather helmets (1934 viewers would not miss the reference to what was happening in Germany - apparently not everyone thought it was a bad idea).Picture quality is pretty good, the sound less so.JACK HULBERT / ATHOLL FLEMING- 1935 Bulldog JackAtholl Fleming as Bulldog Drummond is hospitalized early in the film.British comic Jack Hulbert impersonates him to finish the mission.A successful mix of comedy and thriller.[this is Ralph Richardson's second Bulldog Drummond film - he plays the villain this time.]A British film with an American Damsel in Distress (Fay Wray)Picture and sound are both good.JOHN LODGE- 1937 Bulldog Drummond at BayThough a British film, the lead roles are played by American actors (Victor Jory is the villain).Picture quality is only OK - the competing Alpha Video version is brighter but not more detailed.JOHN HOWARD or RAY MILLANDBetween 1937 and 1939, Paramount filmed eight B-Movies starring John Howard or Ray Milland,with an ensemble supporting cast:- Reginald Denny as Algy, Drummond's best friend- E.E. Clive as Tenny, Drummond's butlerAll eight films have been in the public domain for a long time.Of The five in OnesMedia Volume One, three are a significant improvement over the Alpha Video prints (Bulldog Drummond Escapes, Bulldog Drummond Comes Back, Bulldog Drummond's Peril)Ray Milland:- 1937 Bulldog Drummond EscapesJohn Howard:- 1937 Bulldog Drummond's Revenge- 1937 Bulldog Drummond Comes Back- 1938 Bulldog Drummond's Peril- 1938 Bulldog Drummond in Africa------------------------------------------------ end of Volume 1- 1939 Arrest Bulldog Drummond- 1939 Bulldog Drummond's Secret Police- 1939 Bulldog Drummond's BrideJOHN BARRYMORE never played Bulldog Drummond,even though he was billed as the star of Bulldog Drummond's Revenge, Bulldog Drummond Comes Back, and Bulldog Drummond's Peril.Paramount hired him to play Col. Nielsen of Scotland Yard (a supporting character) in the first three John Howard films.Unfortunately Barrymore's alcoholism forced the studio to cast a different actor as Inspector Nielsen for the remaining films.RON RANDELL- 1947 Bulldog Drummond at Bay- 1947 Bulldog Drummond Strikes BackTOM CONWAY- 1948 The Challenge- 1948 Thirteen Lead SoldiersWALTER PIDGEON- 1951 Calling Bulldog DrummondRICHARD JOHNSON:- 1967 Deadlier than the Male- 1969 Dome Girls DoThe Ronald Colman, Ralph Richardson, Jack Hulbert, Ron Randell, Tom Conway  and Richard Johnson films are extremely hard to find outside of these two inexpensive volumes from OnesMedia.Seven DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).Picture quality ranges from just OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problems with playback.Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.For the OnesMedia website, see my comment dated July 26, 2015.------------------------------------------------------------------GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVDA-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves.

"I was surprised to learn that this was the first complete stereo set of Sibelius' Symphonies.Maazel's Vienna Philharmonic box was completed a year later, followed by Barbirolli/Halle Orchestra. *The first two symphonies in this set are among the most extrovert in the catalog, almost a caricature of the young Lenny (even though they were recorded fairly late in his New York tenure).Vigorous and exciting.""Hot"" performances of a ""Cool"" composer.Symphonies 3-7 are more conventional performances.Symphony 1 - rec.1967Symphony 2 - rec.1966Symphony 3 - rec.1965Symphony 4 - rec.1966Symphony 5 - rec.1961Symphony 6 - rec.1967Symphony 7 - rec.1960Violin Concerto with Zino Francescatti - rec.1963Finlandia - rec.1965Pohjola's Daughter - rec.1964Swan of Tuonela - rec.1973Valse Triste - rec.1969Luonnotar Op.70 with Phyllis Curtin soprano - rec.1965SOUND QUALITY:All recordings are newly re-mastered (24-bit/96khz) in 2015 by Andreas K. Meyer (Meyer Media Mastering LLC)These recordings now sound infinitely better than they did on LP.The CD remastering is also an improvement over the Royal Edition, or the Bernstein Century Edition, or the Bernstein Symphony Edition.This is the second time that Andreas K. Meyer has had a go at Bernstein's New York Legacy.Five years ago he was responsible for the critically acclaimed fourth CD remastering of Bernstein's Mahler. **Let's hope he keeps at it.Unfortunately, the bulk of these recordings were made in New York's Philharmonic Hall shortly after it opened in 1962.An acoustic disaster and a major scandal at the time.Management refused to admit that there was anything wrong with it. ***Symphonies 5, 7, Pohjola's Daughter, and Finlandia were recorded at the Manhattan Center, a New York ballroom with a much warmer acoustic.If this set had been recorded a few years earlier, Columbia Records could also have used the excellent St. George Hotel ballroom (scene of Bernstein's first and Stravinsky's last recordings of the Rite of Spring)or even Carnegie Hall(but Carnegie management was feuding with the New York Philharmonic over the orchestra's decision to build its own hall).Conundrum: Either the 1960's Symphony Hall master tapes of Mahler and Sibelius contained much better sound than anyone suspected, or Andreas K. Meyer has discovered the secret of alchemy.PACKAGING:Seven CDs in cardboard mini-LP jackets in a cardboard box, but only four CDs get original jacket notes.Symphonies 2,3,4,6 and 7 were first issued as part of a boxed set - Sony foolishly just reproduces the promotional blurb from the back of the LP box on three CD jackets.A 34 page booklet, but only a three-page article, ""Bernstein's New York Sibelius""There is an English translation of ""Luonnotar"" on the back of the mini-LP jacket for CD 1.-- In the 1980s, Leonard Bernstein started a second Sibelius cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic for DG, but never lived to finish it.The 1986-1989 remakes of Symphonies 1, 2, 5 and 7 were significantly slower, but no less passionate than the 1960s cycle.In his later years, Bernstein tended to wallow in the music.This is not a criticism - I love Old Lenny, and you need not fear duplication when you buy his early and late recordings.They are not just remakes, they are re-thinkings.But the earlier performance remains equally valid.BONUS ITEMS:Since the original jacket format is used, some additional works by other composers are included:-- Grieg: Peer Gynt Suites 1 & 2 - rec. 1967 in Philharmonic Hall-- Bruch: Violin Concerto 1 in G Minor with Zino Francescatti - rec. 1962 in Manhattan Center (conducted by Thomas Schippers)-------------------------------------------------* More accurately, Bernstein's was the first Western stereo set.John Berky points out that, contrary to the booklet notes, the first stereo set of the Sibelius Symphonies was Akeo Watanabe/Japan Philharmonic.Before Bernstein, Columbia seemed to be well on the way to a complete set with Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra: but only Symphonies 1,2,4,5 and 7 were completed.Ormandy re-recorded these five symphonies for RCA, but apparently he was allergic to 3 and 6.Too bad: Even though the critics didn't think much of Ormandy, Sibelius was very fond of him.**  Andreas K. Meyer's Mahler remastering: Gustav Mahler: The Complete Symphonies &  Kindertotenlieder - also available in Mahler: The Complete Symphonies*** In 1973, electronics pioneer Avery Fisher donated $10 million to fix the acoustics (it helped a little).Philharmonic Hall was renamed ""Avery Fisher Hall"".Breaking News:On November 13, 2014, Lincoln Center officials announced their intention to remove Avery Fisher's name from the Hall and sell naming rights to the highest bidder.Pop music mogul David Geffen bid $100 million to rename it ""David Geffen Hall"".Progress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPWLR03H4BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOFIUDK#wasThisHelpful","R2LPWLR03H4BH","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First the complaint.DG has given us a 37 CD collection of vocal works, including twelve operas, without texts or translations, or even a synopsis.Aargh.Back in 2012, DG issued a 43 CD box of all thirteen Wagner operas.*The booklet included a detailed synopsis of each opera,plus a link to a website where the complete texts and translations can be found.Not as nice as having them in booklet form, but much better than nothingAnd Fricsay gets nothing.I was tempted to penalize this box one star, but I respect Ferenc Fricsay too much.Maybe four-and-a-half stars.CHORAL  AND VOCAL WORKS:- Bartok: Cantata Profana - 1951 mono (Krebs, Fischer-Dieskau) - sung in German- Brahms: Alto Rhapsody - 1957 mono (Maureen Forrester)- Haydn:------ Die Jahreszeiten (The Seasons) - two performances, 1952 mono (Trotschel, W.Ludwig, Greindl) and 1961 mono/stereo broadcast (Stader, Haefliger, Greindl - Part 4 ""Winter"" is released in stereo for the first time)------ Te Deum in C major - 1961 stereo- Kodaly: Psalmus Hungaricus - two performances, 1954 mono and 1959 stereo broadcast (both w/Ernst Haefliger) - sung in German- Mahler: Rückert-Lieder - 1958 stereo (M.

It was customary to perform all operas in German.Three operas in this collection are sung in the wrong language:--- Bluebeard's Castle sounds OK - To my ears, German doesn't sound all that different from Hungarian.--- Orfeo ed Euridice doesn't sound half bad either, probably because of Fischer-Dieskau's mellifluous baritone.--- Carmen: French Opera does not travel well. This Carmen just sounds strange - Joseph Metternich is positively villainous as Escamillo - Interesting.--- Verdi: Falstaff: ""Brav, alter Hans"" (""Va, vecchio John"") is a 17 minute scene from Act 2 - Josef Metternich sings Falstaff, Fischer-Dieskau sings Ford.Verdi sounds surprisingly natural in German.The Audite label has an interesting series of Fricsay broadcasts, including an excellent German-language Rigoletto from 1950.***--- You can also find a DVD of Don Giovanni sung in German by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, conducted by Fricsay in 1961 (the CD performance in the DG box is sung in Italian).****- Two operas appear in unusual editions:--- Orfeo ed Euridice: Baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings the role of Orfeo.Gluck wrote two versions:An Italian version for castrato (usually sung by a mezzo or countertenor - castrati being hard to find), and a French version for high tenor.But not a German version for baritone.Fischer-Dieskau also recorded Orfeo in Italian and in stereo (Karl Richter conducting).I have no problem with a baritone Orfeo, but I'm not a musicologist.--- Idomeneo: Mozart left two versions, but Fricsay conducts a hybrid version by Bernhard Paumgartner.Recorded live at the Salzburg Festival in 1961.- Four works were recorded twice.Fricsay was diagnosed with cancer in 1958.This had an effect on his late performances (Fricsay conducted his final concert in 1961).Fricsay was a Hungarian patriot and a devout Roman Catholic.The late broadcast performances of Kodaly's ""Psalmus Hungaricus"" (1959) and Verdi's Requiem (1960) are are both slower, heavier and more emotionally heart-on-sleeve than the earlier recordings from 1954.This also applies to the 1953 and 1959 performances of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony in Volume One of DG's Fricsay Edition.-- The early and late performances of Haydn's ""Seasons"" and Mozart's ""Exsultate Jubilate"" are not that different, but this is basically cheerful music.--------------------------------------------PACKAGING:126 page booklet with an article by the producer, and a reminiscence by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, plus an  index to the contents.Modified ""original jacket"" format - the original LP cover is on the front of each jacket,but there are no program notes on the back, just a general list of contents.For tracks and timings, you have to look in the booklet.Wait, multi-disc sets do have track listings on the inside of the jacket fold.Reviewer BP Mills on Amazon UK is correct in noting that ""the booklet has an issue in that the binding eats some of the words on the page; the type runs into the binding so much that you cannot pry it open without breaking the spine (see photo with his Amazon UK review dated July 10, 2015) .My booklet was not so bad as Mr. Mills - I can read everything (just), but I see his point.There is no indication in the booklet that anything has been newly re-mastered.The stereo recordings sound fine, as you'd expect.DG's mono recordings have never been sought out by Audiophiles, but these are honest transfers that do not hinder your enjoyment of the music.------------------------------------------- This box is a companion to Volume One: Ferenc Fricsay: Complete Recordings on Deutsche Grammophon, Vol. 1, Orchestral WorksDevoted to orchestral works and concertos.* DG Complete Wagner: Wagner Complete Operas** 1942 Carmina Burana recording: Vienna State Opera Series - Vol 21 )*** 1950 Rigoletto in German: Verdi - Rigoletto (Streich, Klose, Schock, Metternich/Fricsay)**** 1961 Don Giovanni in German DVD: Mozart: Don Giovanni [DVD] [2011] [NTSC]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0OUW12XA0MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6ET93W#wasThisHelpful","R1W0OUW12XA0MC","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Meyer remastering (24-bit/96kHz) is an enormous improvement over the first three.It was originally prepared for SACD release, but those Japanese SACDs are very expensive- in the Amazon search bar look up ""Bernstein Mahler SACD""Meyer's CD remastering is available in version 4a or 4b.There is a slight difference in contents:-- 4a) The 2009 ""Carnegie Hall Presents"" version included the audio documentary ""Gustav Mahler Remembered"" and  Das Lied von der Erde.-- 4b) The 2013 box (reviewed on this page) omitted those two, but added Janet Baker's 1975 Kindertotenlieder.Advantage 4a (2009) = ""Gustav Mahler Remembered"" (48 minutes) is a very well-done documentary (a 22 minute version can be found in the Kaplan Mahler Edition - see below).Alternatively, the 48 minute version is also on YouTube.See my comment dated July 13, 2015 for the web link.(Meyer's CD remastering of Das Lied von der Erde is available separately at low cost.)Advantage 4b (2013) = Less expensive, and packaged in ""original jacket"" format for the first time.Attractive and nostalgic for geezers like me.(plus Meyer's remastering of Janet Baker's 1975 Kindertotenlieder is very expensive outside of box 4b.)Disadvantage 4b (2013) = No texts or translations for Symphonies 2, 3 and 8 in the 32 page booklet (the ""Carnegie Hall Edition"" has them).This may not matter for experienced Mahler collectors.Texts and translations for Symphony 4 and Kindertotenlieder are on the back of the ""original jacket"" in fine print (Kindertotenlieder is on the jacket for Symphony 5).The additional works are available separately:-- ""Gustav Mahler Remembered""Documentary by William Malloch.There is a 22 minute version of this documentary in: The Kaplan Mahler Edition: Symphony No. 2 in C minor- ResurrectionIf you don't already have it, The Kaplan Mahler Edition is an indispensible purchase (cheap too).Not just for the performances, but for all the extra stuff that comes with it.The 48 minute version is on YouTube.

"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli's recorded legacy is a mess.Warner should at least have assembled the material in chronological order so we could trace Michelangeli's development.As it stands, everything was thrown together haphazardly.Also, the booklet is a disgrace.Just a three-page essay entitled ""Il Gattopardo"" (The Leopard) + a lot of photographs of the pianist looking molto suave.The ""Warner Recordings"" come from four main sources:- Italian EMI and German Telefunken recordings made in Italy during World War Two (yes, the bad guys)- EMI recordings 1948-1975.- The March 4, 1957 Royal Festival Hall recital previously issued on Testament.- Italian Radio broadcasts 1959-1963, once issued on the Fonit-Cetra label.Three-and-a-half CDs of early Michelangeli (1939-1943), age 19-23Eight-and-a-half CDs of prime Michelangeli (1948-1963), age 28-43Two CDs of late(ish) Michelangeli (1972-1975), age 52-55Chronologically assembled, this would be: CD 1, 2, 9, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 7, 8For detailed contents of each disc, see the photo of the back of the box at the top of Amazon's webpage.Part One - Wartime recordingsCDs 1,2 - Italian EMI 78rpm recordings (1939-1942) on ""La Voce del Padrone"" - ""His Master's Voice""CDs 9,10 - Telefunken 78rpm recordings (1942-1943)Recorded in Fascist Italy under wartime conditions.Mostly encore pieces by Albeniz, Chopin, Granados, Grieg, Marescotti (1902-1995), Mompou, Scarlatti & Tomeoni (1729-1816),but also Bach's Italian Concerto and Beethoven's Piano Sonata Op.2 No.3,plus Piano Concertos by Grieg and Schumann with the La Scala Orchestra conducted by Alceo Galliera (contrary to Warner, Antonio Pedrotti is usually credited as conductor of the Schumann).The sound quality is only fair (the Schumann Concerto is terrible)The wartime recordings have also been issued on three Naxos CDs with scholarly notes and in cleaner sound.See the footnote at the end of this review. *Part Two - CDs 1,2,3 - EMI Mono recordings (1948-1953)In 1948 Michelangeli traveled to London's Abbey Road Studio where he recorded the Bach-Busoni Chaconne (CD 1) and his own version of Brahms Paganini Variations (CD 2).(he omitted a few variations and re-ordered the rest)He also recorded Galuppi (CD 1) and Debussy (CD 2) in London at this time - Warner is mistaken about the dates. *In 1951 and 1953, he recorded three Mozart Piano Concertos for the Italian branch of EMI (K 415 in C, K 450 in B-flat and K 488 in A) conducted by Franco Caracciolo and Ettore Gracis (CD 3)Decent mono sound.Part Three - CDs 4,5 - The Royal Festival Hall recital from March 4, 1957This is Michelangeli at his absolute best.Acceptable mono sound.Includes thirty minutes of rehearsals and ""sound checks"" - a lot of noodling around at the keyboard (Debussy and Schumann)  plus barely audible conversations with no printed text (or translation for the Italian segments).Previously issued on Testament. **Part Four - EMI Stereo recordings (1957, 1972-1975)The only stereo recordings in this box.CD 6 has the famous 1957 recording of Rachmaninov's 4th and Ravel's Piano Concerto with Ettore Gracis and the Philharmonia Orchestra.CD 7 has the 1975 recording of two Haydn Concertos conducted by Edmond de Stoutz.CD 8 is an all-Schumann LP recorded in 1975: Carnaval (played a lot more slowly than at the Festival Hall in 1957) + three excerpts from Album fur die Jugend.Plus released for the first time is an incomplete 1972 recording of Schumann's Faschingschwank aus Wien (first 3 of 5 movements - he played the complete work in 1957).Part Five - Italian Radio broadcasts in mono soundCDs 11,12 Concertos:- Haydn Piano Concerto 11 conducted by Mario Rossi (1959)- Beethoven Piano Concerto 5 ""Emperor"" conducted by Massimo Freccia (1960)- Liszt Piano Concerto 1 conducted by Raphael Kubelik (1961)- Schumann Piano Concerto conducted by Gianandrea Gavazzeni (1962)CD 13: Debussy recital (1963)CD 14: Chopin recital (1963)--- Next to Sviatoslav Richter, Michelangeli is the most bootlegged pianist in history.But unlike Richter, who had an enormous repertoire, Michelangeli obsessively concentrated on a few works that he polished to perfection.In the '70s and '80s - according to his critics - it was a sterile perfectionism, but the live recordings in this box, from the '50s and '60s, capture the pianist at his very best(only two CDs were recorded in the '70s).Michelangeli also cancelled more performances than any other pianist of his stature.Despite shyness and stage fright, he responded well to an audience - see the 1957 Royal Festival Hall recital in the Warner box.[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]--- By the time Michelangeli made his final recording for EMI in 1975, he had already signed a new contract with Deutsche Grammophon.This produced eight CDs worth of recordings between 1971 and 1990: The Art Of Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli (DG Collectors Edition)For some reason, the DG box also included two Schumann performances recorded in the BBC studios in 1957, concurrent with Michelangeli's appearance at the Royal Festival Hall.The live 1957 performances of Carnaval and Faschingschwank aus Wien in the Warner box are more spontaneous than the BBC studio recordings in the DG box.And both are a great deal more spontaneous than the 1975 EMI studio recordings.The overall sound quality in the DG box is a lot better than the EMI/Warner box, and Michelangeli added some new works to his repertoire.Plus the DG box was assembled with more thought than the Warner mish-mash.Despite this, there is still good reason to buy the Warner box.The young Michelangeli was a force of nature.In his fifties, he tended to become more introspective and metaphysically inclined (OK, slower).Not coincidentally, his favorite concerto accompanists in the Seventies and Eighties were Carlo Maria Giulini (documented in the DG box) and Sergiu Celibidache (MICHELANGELI IN CONCERT - and - チェリビダッケ+ミケランジェリ共演集 ラヴェル、シューマン:ピアノ協... )Aside from the new Schumann excerpts on CD 8, nothing was newly remastered for this box.The ten year-old Great Recordings of the Century remasterings were used for the EMI material.The World War II and Fonit-Cetra transfers date back at least twenty years.Recommended despite its faults.-------------------------------------------------* Naxos squeezed the wartime recordings + the 1948 EMI recordings onto three CDs versus four in the Warner box (CD 1,2,9,10).Contents are identical, but Naxos' scholarship is infinitely better than Warners'.Naxos also benefits from superior transfers by Ward Marston.There is some disagreement about recording dates.Naxos claims that the Galuppi and Debussy on Warner's CD 1 and 2 were recorded in London in 1948.Warner claims Milan in 19?? (the question marks are Warner's).Naxos also provides the British EMI matrix numbers, so I am inclined to believe Naxos.Warner credits Alceo Galliera as the conductor of both the Grieg and Schumann Concertos in 1942.Naxos (and previous Telefunken reissues) credit Antonio Pedrotti in the Schumann.Naxos:-- Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli The Early Recordings 1939 - 1948 volume 1-- Michelangeli: Early Recordings 2 (Including Mozart: Piano Concerto No.15/ Beethoven: Piano Sonata No.3)  -- Grieg/ Schumann: Piano Concertos (Early Recordings Vol. 3) (Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli ) (Naxos Historical: 8111396)** First issue of the 1957 Royal Festival Hall recital on Testament: Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli: Schumann / Chopin / Debussy / MompDoes anyone know if the Testament booklet included a printed transcript of the conversation during the ""sound check""?I can only make out about ten percent of the conversation on the CD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M34G2PRG6MNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH9SYYG#wasThisHelpful","R3M34G2PRG6MNG","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1960's saw three important recordings of Mozart's ""Magic Flute""- 1964: Karl Bohm, Berlin Philharmonic (DG)- 1964: Otto Klemperer, Philharmonia Orchestra (EMI)- 1969: Georg Solti, Vienna Philharmonic (Decca) - there is no recording date listed in the booklet. The arkivmusic.com website claims October, 1969.The Bohm and Klemperer are classics and have tended to overshadow the Solti (which was even overshadowed by a second Solti recording twenty years later).But I am rather fond of the 1969 Solti - not for the conductor, but for two of the singers (Solti is fine, but not in the same Mozartean league as Klemperer or Bohm).I judge the success of any performance of the ""Magic Flute"" based solely on two characters.I'm not interested in the plight of Tamino, Pamina or Sarastro- cardboard characters in the Masonic Ritual (though Otto Klemperer - my favorite conductor - excelled at this stuff).The Queen of the Night doesn't have a lot to do in this opera - just two arias and she's gone.Despite this, her two arias are sufficient in themselves to justify the price of a night at the Opera.They are spectacular.The obvious casting choice for the 1969 Decca recording would seem to have been Joan Sutherland.'La Stupenda' was the best-selling Coloratura Soprano in the world, and she and Solti were both under contract to Decca.A recording session would only take one day out of her busy schedule.A guaranteed best-seller for Decca.But it was not to be. *In her place, Decca cast a rising young Dutch soprano, Christina Deutekom.She had a novel approach to coloratura.Eager and uninhibited: it almost sounded like she was yodeling.I am not the first person to point this out.I remember reading it in one of the classical music magazines when this recording was new.That critic had reservations, but as a twenty year old with no preconceptions, I found it tremendously exciting.Still do.Its certainly worth a listen if you haven't heard it (unfortunately her career tapered off in the Seventies).Roberta Peters on the Bohm set is too careful - the opposite of Deutekom.Lucia Popp, the Queen of the Night in Klemperer's recording, was the most acclaimed modern singer of the role in the final third of the Twentieth Century.No complaints here (though I sometimes miss Deutekom's craziness).Papageno is the only character I have an emotional investment in.The three leading German baritones of the 1960s:- Walter Berry: Papageno in the Klemperer recording. Too cold- Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau: Papageno in the Bohm recording. Too hot.- Hermann Prey: Papageno in the Solti recording. Just right.My apologies to Mother Goose.Walter Berry had a great voice, but his interpretation is too generic.Hermann Prey had a great voice and the perfect personality for the role.Prey always struck me as being more naturally boyish than other baritones.This meant he wasn't good at playing villains, but was perfect for Papageno,and he's a good reason to buy the Solti recording.If anything, Fischer-Dieskau had too much personality.His is an ""interesting"" performance.Klemperer has by far the best supporting cast, down to the smallest role (Elisabeth Schwarzkopf is the First Lady), though Bohm scores by casting Fritz Wunderlich as Tamino (I just wish Tamino wasn't such a stiff).One plus in the Solti set's favor is the decision to cast actual boys as the Three Boys.I think this was the first time anyone thought of it.A successful experiment (Vienna Choir Boys).The chorus is important in the Masonic Ritual.The Wilhelm Pitz-trained Philharmonia Chorus (Klemperer) is the best on record (Pitz spent his summers directing the chorus at Bayreuth).Scorecard:Conductor = 1) Klemperer, 2) Bohm, 3) SoltiQueen of the Night = 1) Deutekom/Solti or Popp/Klemperer (depends on which I heard last), 3) Peters/BohmPapageno = 1) Prey/Solti, 2) Berry/Klemperer or Fischer-Dieskau/Bohm (tie)Supporting cast = 1) Klemperer, 2) Bohm, 3) SoltiThree Boys = 1) Solti, 2) Klemperer, 3) BohmChorus = 1) Klemperer, 2) Bohm or Solti (tie)Wild Card: Klemperer omits the dialog.This was an EMI tradition - the 1950 Karajan also omitted dialog.Bohm and Solti (and everyone since) include a lot of dialog.I may be a Philistine, but I hate dialog in opera.Once you know what the plot is about, Emanuel Shikaneder's prose just slows everything down.Phooey.So which to get? - 1) Klemperer and Solti (tie), 3) Bohm.Better yet buy all three - they're on budget labels.- Klemperer 1964: Mozart: Die Zauberflöte - or - Mozart: Die Zauberflote (Home of Opera) - or - Mozart: Le Nozze Di Figaro/Don Giovanni/...- Bohm 1964: Mozart: The Magic Flute* Joan Sutherland left us only one recording of the Magic Flute, a live Covent Garden performance available on Testament:  Mozart: Die Zauberflote","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V26CL8P07CIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018NUM5G#wasThisHelpful","R3V26CL8P07CIJ","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The private eyes in ""I Love a Mystery"" are a pretty bland lot compared to Boston Blackie or the Lone Wolf, but I am a sucker for all B-Movie Detective series.And I love a mystery.Back in the 1940s, Columbia Pictures produced overlapping B-Movie Detective series.The studio was competing with itself:-- The Lone Wolf: fifteen films 1935 to 1949 - nine starring Warren William-- Boston Blackie: fourteen films 1941 to 1949 - starring Chester Morris-- Crime Doctor: ten films 1943 to 1949 - starring Warner Baxter-- The Whistler: eight films 1944 to 1948 - seven starring Richard Dix-- I Love a Mystery: three films 1945 to 1946 - starring Jim Bannon and Barton YarboroughWarren William, Chester Morris, Warner Baxter and Richard Dix had been Hollywood stars in the early Thirties.But their careers were clearly on a downward trajectory by the time they signed with Columbia.In contrast, the stars of ""I Love a Mystery"" - Jim Bannon and Barton Yarborough - were anonymous radio actors whose film careers were virtually non-existent outside of these three films.""I Love a Mystery"" was a detective serial on radio from 1939 to 1944.Jack, Doc and Reggie were three soldiers of fortune who joined forces to form the A-1 Detective Agency.Their slogan was ""No job too tough, No adventure too baffling"".Unfortunately, the actor who played Reggie committed suicide in 1942, but Jack and Doc carried on without him.The screenplays are pretty intricate, with a strong element of the gothic and supernatural - In the first two films, the victim is beheaded; the third film is a haunted house mystery.I imagine these scripts would have worked equally well for any of the other detectives on Columbia's roster.Three films, each slightly longer than an hour, on one disc.Picture quality is only fair, but the sound is good.DVD-R, but it played fine.No subtitles.As an unadvertised bonus, OnesMedia enclosed a copy of a 1973 ""I Love a Mystery"" made-for-TV movie.Horrible.Former ABC newsman Les Crane was cast as Jack.Future ABC newsman David Hartman (first host of Good Morning America) was cast as Doc.Also Ida Lupino and Don Knotts.Grotesque.For the OnesMedia website, see my comment dated July 8, 2015.-------------------------------------------------------GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVDA-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss.

"I can report that if this disc won't play, the fault is NOT with your Blu-Ray player.The first batch of Blu-Rays were faulty,but Decca re-mastered it to correct the problem.Unfortunately some defective discs are still on the market - as I found out.I have been the proud owner of both.From the packaging, there is no way to tell them apart (though the good one had a sticker marked ""Made in France"" on the cellophane).When you load the disc you will get one of two Menus.Each Menu splits the screen into two halves:-- on the left side of the BAD MENU is the photo of Ricardo Chailly from the cover.Underneath it are the words:""PURE AUDIO FORMAT""-- on the left of the GOOD MENU is the same photo of Ricardo Chailly.Underneath it are the words""PURE AUDIO FORMAT""""2.0 pcm 24-bit/96Khz / 2.0 dolby trueHD 24-bit/96Khz""-- on the right side of the BAD MENU are the words ""Johannes Brahms 1833-1897"".Underneath it is a blank screen.-- on the right of the GOOD MENU are the words ""Johannes Brahms 1833-1897"".Underneath it are the words:""THE SYMPHONIES -

The Chailly Brahms Blu-Ray plays for 3 hours, 54 minutes.My only complaint about the Blu-Ray is that it is two channels.An alternate 5.1 Surround mix would have been nice.Perhaps Chailly is a purist.You don't need a special Blu-Ray Audio player.Blu-Ray Audio plays on any Blu-Ray Video player.Keep the video output connected to your TV to read the disc menu.Connect the audio to your Hi-Fi system.------------------------------------------------------Riccardo Chailly is the only conductor to have recorded ALL of Brahms' orchestral music.The Four Symphonies, two Overtures and Variations on a Theme of Haydn have been recorded hundreds of times.To these Chailly has added some RARITIES:-- Liebeslieder Waltzes Op.52, No.1,2,4,5,6,8,9,11 and Op.65, No.9In 1868, Brahms composed 18 waltzes for vocal quartet accompanied by piano four-hands.The following year he orchestrated nine (for orchestra alone - no singers).Also recorded by Gary Bertini/Vienna Symphony and Thomas Dausgaard/Swedish Chamber Orchestra.-- Two Intermezzi for Piano: Op.116, No.4 and Op.117, No.1 - ONLY RECORDINGThis is a ringer - Not orchestrated by Brahms.Orchestrated by Paul Klengel (1854-1935), a German conductor and composer who was a friend of Brahms(the notes don't say when Klengel orchestrated them, or if Brahms approved).-- Symphony 1: Original version of the Second MovementThis version of the second movement Andante premiered in 1876 with the rest of the Symphony, but before publication Brahms dropped five bars and added some transition material.This is the second recording of the original version - Charles Mackerras was first, with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.-- Symphony 4: Revised opening to the First Movement - ONLY RECORDINGSome time after the premiere, Brahms added four bars to the opening of the First Movement, but quickly changed his mind.The Symphony was never performed this way.These introductory bars are over in a mere eight seconds, but Decca allots it 46 seconds.Brahms based his introduction on the final bars of the same movement, so the first movement now begins and ends with the same music.To illustrate this, the track opens with the final bars of the First Movement (13 seconds),then after a brief pause, you hear the new introduction (8 seconds) leading directly into the familiar First Movement (which fades away after 15 seconds).I don't much care for it, but may feel differently after I've heard it a few hundred times.I think it would have made a better impression if Decca had included two complete performances of the first movement - with and without the introduction - instead of just a fragment for the revised opening.This is the only recording of the revised opening of Symphony 4.I am informed that back in the 1960s, it was featured during the intermission of a Cleveland Orchestra radio broadcast.Apparently George Szell was interviewed and the orchestra performed the music.I'm not sure if Szell or his assistant Louis Lane conducted.It would be nice to have as part of a future ""George Szell Edition"".-- Hungarian Dances No. 1, 3 and 10Not exactly rarities, but not usually included with the symphonies.Brahms composed 21 Hungarian Dances for piano duet in the 1860s, and orchestrated these three in 1874 (other composers orchestrated the rest)------------------------------------------------------Chailly also provides spirited performances of the Four Symphonies, two Overtures and Haydn Variations, but here the competition is fierce.My all-time stereo favorites are Otto Klemperer/Philharmonia Orchestra (recorded 1954-1957) and Bruno Walter/Columbia Symphony (recorded 1959-1960).I am a sucker for Nineteenth Century conductors conducting Nineteenth Century music.Otto Klemperer (born 1885) was twelve years old when Brahms died.Bruno Walter (born 1876) was 21.Both lived long enough to record Brahms in decent stereo.Klemperer is Grand and Majestic.Walter is Warm and Comforting.Klemperer: Otto Klemperer- Brahms: Symphonies / Overtures / Deutsches RequiemWalter: Bruno Walter conducts Brahms [Box Set]Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra recorded Brahms two Serenades a year later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R237JIHDY1DOG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3IVE1Q#wasThisHelpful","R237JIHDY1DOG4","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nazis were infamous for banning music by Jewish and politically dissident composers and performers.This 10 CD box, imported from Germany, contains the original recordings that the Nazis found so offensive.176 individual recordings - Ninety percent recorded between 1930 and 1933, the final years of the German republic.Half of it is German popular music of the Twenties and early Thirties.The rest are classical selections, with a lot of Operetta crossover.The transfers from ancient 78rpm records are very well done.There is a 64 page booklet (32 pages in German, 32 in English) with detailed notes about the composers and performers.A bit disorganized, but with so much information this is inevitable.Some musicians (Marlene Dietrich, Comedian Harmonists, Friederich Hollaender) make as many as ten appearances each, but to save space they get only one biographical entry.A lot of cross-referencing and searching back and forth in the booklet.No texts or translations for the vocal works.They are sorely missed - especially in the cabaret songs, but this seems inevitable in a box of this scope and at this price.CD 1: CULTURAL BOLSHEVISM - DEGENERATE MUSIC ""And the shark's teeth may be lethal""Political Theater by Kurt Weill, Friederich Hollaender, Hans Eisler, Ernst Krenek, and Mischa Spoliansky.The 1930 excerpts from Weill's ""Dreigroschenoper"" (Three Penny Opera) document the original cast (Lotte Lenya, Kurt Gerron) of a Twentieth Century masterpiece,plus Otto Klemperer's conducting of Kleine Dreigroschenmusik from 1931.Additional excerpts are available on other labels. *FOUR CDs OF CABARET AND POPULAR SONG:CD 2: CABARET, CHANSON ""It's always the fault of the Jews""CD 3: LAX MORALS ""The versatility of love""CD 4: TOTAL LICENCE ""Falling in love again""CD 5: HIT SONGS AND FILMS ""What y'doin with your Knee""-- ""It's always the fault of the Jews"" (""An allem sind die Juden schuld"") - CD 2, track 1.Lyrics by Friederich Hollaender set to the Habanera from Bizet's Carmen (rec. 1932) - Truly Bizarre.The next to last line sounds like ""und Herr Einstein ging vorbei"" which I think means ""and Mr. Einstein goes away"".I would dearly love to find a translation of whole song.-- ""What y'doin with your Knee"" (""Was machst du mit dem knie, lieber Hans?"")  - CD 5, track 1.A translation of this could also be interesting.CD 6: OPERETTA ""You are my heart's delight""CD 7: OPERETTA ""There is a land of fancy""This was the ""Silver Age"" of Operetta: Benatzky, Fall, Kalman, Lehar, Stolz, and Oscar Straus, plus some ""Golden Age"" stuff from Johann Strauss.-- Emmerich Kalman and Oscar Straus were Jews who left Germany (Leo Fall was Jewish, but he died in 1925). Their works were blacklisted.-- Johann Strauss had Jewish ancestry, but rather than blacklist him, the Nazis forged documents covering this up.-- Franz Lehar was married to a Jewess (this term is used in the booklet) and his preferred interpreters were Jewish.Lucky for him, he was also Hitler's favorite composer.-- Unexpected delight: All this German schmaltz is interrupted by Otto Klemperer's joyous romp through Offenbach's La Belle Helene Overture (CD 6, track 6), recorded in 1929.If nothing else, Otto Klemperer is the most interesting conductor of the Twentieth Century. **CD 8: OPERA ""Ah, I sense that it has vanished""CD 9: OPERA ""I know a violent race""New York's Metropolitan Opera was the unintended beneficiary of Hitler's persecution of Jewish singers.Most of these 78rpm records will be familiar to collectors.Jewish composers were also blacklisted: Meyerbeer from the Nineteenth Century, Erich Wolfgang Korngold from the Twentieth (his ultimate destination was Hollywood)Everything is sung in German: ""Der Bajazzo"" = ""Pagliacci""CD 10: CONCERT ""On wings of song into exile""Classical music performed by exiles - most of this has already been released on other labels:Mahler conducted by Bruno Walter and Jascha Horenstein, plus Paul Hindemith, Erich Kleiber, Artur Schnabel, Fritz Kreisler, Adolf and Fritz Busch etc.Even Robert Schumann's 1840 setting of Dichterliebe was banned because the poet Heine was Jewish.-- Confession: I normally go to great lengths to avoid listening to German Cabaret Songs,but I'm glad I bought this collection.Depressing at times, but educational.Recommended to students of history and music alike.And its doesn't cost a lot.----------------------------------------------------------* Here is the fullest selection of the 1930 Dreigroschenoper excerpts recorded by Telefunken:Weill: The Threepenny Opera - Berlin 1930 - orDie Dreigroschenoper (The Threepenny Opera); Berlin 1930(contents are identical, and both versions include texts and translations).Lotte Lenya re-recorded Die Dreigroschenoper in stereo in the late '50s.But by then her voice had lost it's girlish soprano, and had evolved into a manly contralto (too many cigarettes):  Weill: The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper)[ She also played SMERSH agent Rosa Kleb in the second James Bond film ""From Russia with Love"" (1962). ]** Otto Klemperer's (born 1885) career lasted until 1971, well into the stereo era.He re-recorded Kurt Weill's Kleine Dreigroschenmusick in stereo in 1961: 20th Century MusicEvery bit as decadent as his 1931 recording.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMEDB668STPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5RRGCC#wasThisHelpful","RYMEDB668STPJ","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This box contains most of the recordings that Karl Bohm made for Deutsche Grammophon during the last decade of his life - mostly with the Vienna Philharmonic.Missing are the 1970's sets of Beethoven and Brahms Symphonies.Plus DG forgot their pairing of ""Peter and the Wolf"" with ""Carnival of the Animals"". *23 CDs in cardboard jackets, but not original jacket format - DG designed new covers for each cardboard jacket, with a different photo of Bohm on each.Really quite attractive design.The back covers are used for track listings - no mini-program notes.Plus a 60 page booklet (with texts and translations for the Beethoven and Mozart choral works).The 1980 recordings of Beethoven's 9th and Tchaikovsky's 5th were the 86 year-old conductor's final recordings, and are the only DDD recordings in this box.There is absolutely no information about the mastering of these discs.Just a copyright date of 2015.Everything sounds fine to me, but I may not be the best judge. My ears are 66 years old.-----------------------------------------------------One surprise:The booklet states that""When Fritz Reiner stepped down as principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, he expressed the desire that Karl Bohm - a kindred spirit thanks to their shared love of Richard Strauss - should succeed, but the orchestra chose Jean Martinon instead.""I was 90 percent certain that this was in error.Hard to believe that Fritz Reiner, a Hungarian Jew, was an admirer of Karl Bohm.Bohm was never a Nazi, though like all German musicians of a certain age, he was tainted by the circumstances he found himself in during the Nazi period.(Norman Lebrecht was not so kind in his evaluation of Bohm.)I wondered if the author (Christoph Schluren) hadn't confused Karl Bohm with Hans Rosbaud, a frequent and well-loved guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony.I contacted Don Tait, formerly of radio station WFMT in Chicago, and expert on all things Chicago Symphony.His reply:""Yes ...in 1955 while Reiner was in Vienna to conduct the Vienna State Opera during the opening festivities of the rebuilt Opera House, [he invited Bohm to guest-conduct the Chicago Symphony].Reiner was in Vienna at the invitation of Bohm, who was the Opera's Music Director at the time.Bohm's Chicago Symphony concerts were:January 3-4, 1957: Hindemith, Stravinsky, BeethovenJanuary 10-11, 1957: Mozart, Berg, R. StraussThe concerts were Bohm's North American conducting debut.Regarding Reiner's choice for a CSO successor ... Hans Rosbaud was a regular guest conductor of the CSO during the early 1960s, and I know from conversations with CSO members of the time, including principal trumpeter Adolph ""Bud"" Herseth, that the orchestra virtually worshipped him and wanted him to be Reiner's successor.When the orchestra's manager, Seymour Raven, told them during a rehearsal break that Reiner had resigned for reasons of health, Raven said that everyone wanted Rosbaud to follow but that Rosbaud too was seriously ill and that his health made such a step impossible ...The author of the program notes is correct that Reiner recommended Bohm as his CSO successor but that Martinon was chosen.I think it says something about Reiner's regard for Bohm as a conductor that he considered him the most qualified to continue his (Reiner's) extremely high conductorial standards.""- Don Tait (June 21, 2015)I was about to accuse Christoph Schluren of sloppy research.My thanks to Mr. Tait for saving me from this embarrassment.----------------------------------------------------Karl Bohm always reminded me of Otto Klemperer, but without all the baggage.In addition to extreme physical disabilities, Otto Klemperer had a life-long struggle with mental illness.Bipolar Manic-Depressive at a time when no one had a clue how to treat it.Both conductors had the same pre-World War I training and musical instincts (Klemperer was born in 1885, Bohm in 1894)Klemperer in top form was unsurpassable, but you never knew what to expect on a given night.Bohm produced performances that were steady and reliably excellent.Karl Bohm was a great conductor.Otto Klemperer was a great conductor.But Otto Klemperer was the more interesting conductor.I miss the baggage.Anyway, this review is supposed to be about Karl Bohm.There is still a lot to be said for sanity.After World War II, Bohm shied away from musical politics (except for a brief unhappy stint at the Vienna State Opera), and preferred the life of a guest conductor.He was popular with fellow musicians - on good terms with both Karajan and Bernstein (their only mutual friend?)In 1971 Karl Bohm, age 77, turned most of his attentions to the Vienna Philharmonic,where he shared the podium (and Deutsche Grammophon) with Leonard Bernstein(always remembering that the Vienna Philharmonic has no principal conductor).The Dresden recordings in this set (Beethoven and Richard Strauss) are a nostalgic reunion with the orchestra he had conducted from 1934 til 1942.He also had a late-in-life connection with the London Symphony, which elected him their honorary President (Tchaikovsky Symphonies).-------------------------------------------------------CONTENTS:(Vienna Philharmonic 1971-1980 unless otherwise indicated)- Beethoven: Symphony 9 (Norman, Fassbaender, Domingo, Berry)- Beethoven: Overtures Egmont, Coriolanus, Prometheus (Vienna PO) + Fidelio, Leonore III (Dresden Staatskapelle, 1969)- Beethoven: Missa Solemnis (M.Price, Ludwig, Ochman, Talvela)- Bruckner: Symphonies 7, 8- Dvorak: Symphony 9- Haydn: Symphonies 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, Sinfonia Concertante- Mozart: Symphonies 29, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41- Mozart: Sinfonia Concertante k 297b- Mozart: Masonic Funeral Music k 477- Mozart: Eine kleine Nachtmusik k 525- Mozart: Requiem (Mathis, Hamari, Ochman, Ridderbusch)- Schubert: Symphonies 5, 8 (Vienna PO) + 9 (Dresden Staatskapelle, 1979)- Schumann: Symphony 4- Johann Strauss: Perpetuum Mobile, Polkas (Annen-Polka, Tritsch-Tratsch, Thunder & Lightning), Walzes (Blue Danube, Emperor, Roses from the South)- Richard Strauss: Ein Heldenleben- Tchaikovsky: Symphonies 4-6 (London Symphony, 1977-1980)- Wagner: Overtures and Preludes to Rienzi, Fliegende Hollander, Tannhauser, Lohengrin (Acts 1+3), Meistersinger, Parsifal, Tristan (Prelude & Liebestod)----------------------------------------------------* The missing recordings are available in other boxes:Beethoven: Symphonies (DG Collectors Edition)Brahms: 4 Symphonies;

"[There is an error in Amazon's listing - this is not a 16 CD/DVD Combo - it is a 16 CD + 1 CD-R combo]The virtues of Decca's 1958-1965 recording of Wagner's Ring are well-known.Later stereo recordings have their advocates, but this is the standard against which all are judged.A classic, and pretty much beyond criticism.This is the third time this recording has been remastered for CD - and the second time this particular 2012 remastering has been issued on CD.Contemporary with this, a Blu-Ray remastering was also created.It has also been issued twice.Decca/Universal has issued the Solti Ring in six different packages, though only three CD remasterings are involved:[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]1) 1984 remastering: Wagner: Der Ring Des Nibelungen, Das Rheingold, Die Walkure, Siegfried, Gotterdammerung2) 1997 remastering: Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen (Ring Cycle)or 1997 remastering: Wagner: The Operas  (part of a 36 CD box of ten Wagner operas)3a) 2012 remastering on CD + Blu-Ray: Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen (Super Deluxe)3b) 2012 remastering on Blu-Ray only : Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen [Blu-ray Audio]3c) 2012 remastering on CD only: Wagner: Der Ring Des Nibelungen [16 CD/DVD Combo] reviewed on this pageSOUND QUALITY:The overall consensus view is that Version 3 (2012) is the best-sounding remastering.There are dissenters (read the other reviews).That being said however, there is not a great deal of difference between the three CD remasterings.But Version 3a also included a separate Blu-Ray Audio remastering: the entire Ring on one Blu-Ray (versus 14 CDs).Version 3b is the Blu-Ray, but no CDs.Version 3c is 14 CDs, but no Blu-Ray.It's not uncommon to find ordinary CDs remastered at ""24-bit/96 kHz"", but the CD medium is incapable of accurately reproducing everything on the master.Compromises are made in the conversion to CD.You need SACD or Blu-Ray Audio to realize the full potential of the original master tape.The only real advantage of Blu-Ray Audio over the older SACD technology is a longer playing time - The single Blu-Ray Audio disc of Solti's Ring plays for fifteen hours.You don't need a special Blu-Ray Audio player..Blu-Ray Audio plays on any Blu-Ray Video player.Keep the video output connected to your TV to read the disc menu.Connect the audio to your Hi-Fi system.The 14 standard CDs sound fine.Blu-Ray Audio is almost certainly an improvement, but it's hard for me to judge.My landlord won't allow concert hall realism in his building.Playing Blu-Ray Audio with the volume turned down is self-defeating.CD RECOMMENDATION:If you want Solti's Ring on CD, you have a choice between Version 1, 2, 3a or 3c.Version 3c (reviewed on this page) is your best buy:Most critics prefer this CD remastering, plus it costs less than the others.+ Libretti and translations in CD-ROM format.+ 2 CDs devoted to Deryck Cooke's ""Introduction to Der Ring Des Nibelungen"".+ Excerpts from John Culshaw's 1967 book 'Ring Resounding'.If you have a lot of money and want the Deluxe Edition, buy Version 3a.The CD remastering is identical, plus you get a lot of extras (including the Blu-Ray, just in case you are curious).BLU-RAY RECOMMENDATIONIf you want Solti's Ring on Blu-Ray, you have a choice between Version 3a or 3b.Version 3a is the Deluxe CD + Blu-Ray Edition: 14 CDs + 1 Blu-Ray + 3 bonus CDs + 1 DVD+ Libretti and translations in book format.+ John Culshaw's 1967 book 'Ring Resounding'.+ 2 CDs devoted to Deryck Cooke's ""Introduction to Der Ring Des Nibelungen"".+ 1 DVD of ""The Golden Ring"", the 1965 behind-the-scenes BBC documentary about Decca's Ring project.+ 1 CD devoted to Solti's Vienna Philharmonic recordings of orchestral Wagner + ""Kinderkatechismus""+ a selection of contemporary advertising material (32 pages) from Gramophone Magazine, recording session photos, and Solti's annotated score of The Ride of the Valkyries.Version 3b is the Basic Blu-Ray Edition: 1 Blu-Ray+ Libretti and translations in book format.If you are under age 50, I recommend you look into one of the Blu-Ray versions (3a or 3b).If you are over age 50, your hearing is not as good as it used to be, and 3c is good enough.One exception: I am 66 years old, but obsessive compulsive.I need to know that I am listening the best possible version even if I can't tell the difference.Aargh.Two drawbacks to Deluxe Edition 3a:1) It's expensive2) It's big and bulky - practically the same size and weight as the 1960s LP mega-box.

I especially recommend the Time-Life version (available singly and in a slipcase with other books about Wagner). It comes with a lot of extra  photographs.2) Two-CD set of Deryck Cooke's An Introduction To Der Ring Des Nibelungen (2 CD) (already included with Version 3c - reviewed on this page)3) DVD of The Golden Ring - Solti's nickname in the 1960s was ""the Screaming Skull"" - watch this DVD to find out why.4) Solti's 1962-65 Vienna Philharmonic recordings of Wagner: Overtures / Siegfried Idyll5) Wagner's ""Kinderkatechismus"" which may or may not be conducted by Solti: Wagner: Overtures & Preludessee my review of this dated May 27, 2015 for more information about ""Kinderkatechismus"",and who I think the conductor really is.COST:As of May 2015, these are the lowest prices on Amazon:Version 3a = $206  (CD + Blu-Ray Deluxe Edition)Version 3b = $55  (Blu-Ray Basic Edition)Version 3c = $36  (CD Basic Edition)----------------------------------------------------------Decca's English translation of Kinderkhatechismus:SOLO: Tell me, children, what is it blossoms in May?CHILDREN'S CHORUS: The rose, the rose, the rose in May.SOLO: Do you know, too, what blossoms at Christmas?CHILDREN'S CHORUS: The cosy, the cosy, the cosy Mama Cosima!SOLO: If the rose of May has faded, it blossoms anew in the bosom of Christmas.CHILDREN'S CHORUS: Rose in May, cosy in May, dearest loveliest Cosima!Yecch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5S1VQM4HLDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVZUXRS#wasThisHelpful","R3H5S1VQM4HLDW","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Philo Vance was the first private detective of the sound era.He appeared in thirteen films between 1929 and 1947.Four were produced by Paramount, three by Warner Brothers, three by MGM, and three by PRC (Producer's Releasing Corporation).[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.If there is ever a problem with a OnesMedia link, go directly to their website - see my comment dated July 8, 2015]The Paramount and PRC titles are in the OnesMedia box, reviewed on this page.For the OnesMedia website, see my comment dated July 8, 2015.The Warner  and MGM titles are in a box from Warner Archive: The Philo Vance Murder Case CollectionIf you want all thirteen Philo Vance movies, you need to buy both boxes.There is no overlap.Eight actors played Philo Vance:1) WILLIAM POWELL:The great William Powell (five years before he played detective Nick Charles in The Thin Man) was the first actor to play Philo Vance.The OnesMedia collection has his first three appearances in the role - the Warner box has his final effort:- 1929: THE CANARY MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)- 1929: THE GREENE MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)- 1930: THE BENSON MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)- 1933: THE KENNEL MURDER CASE - Warner Bros. (Warner Archive box)The first three are extremely difficult to find.Picture quality is not great, but I could understand 98% of the dialogue, which is rare in early talkies.These are not great films, but they are historically important.The CANARY MURDER CASE started out as a silent film in 1928, but Paramount decided to re-shoot several scenes with sound, and to dub sound onto existing footage.The result is awkward.Early sound technicians were worried that overlapping dialogue would confuse the audience, so actors were instructed to insert lengthy pauses between lines.Very slow going.Silent movie legend Louise Brooks is the murder victim in THE CANARY MURDER CASE.She was in Germany making silent films when Paramount cabled her to return to Hollywood to dub her scenes with sound.She refused.Her voice was dubbed by a different actress and Louise Brooks' Hollywood career was over.- Eugene Palette was comic relief as Sergeant Heath in all four films.- Future star Jean Arthur was a supporting player in the first two films.2) BASIL RATHBONE:- 1930: THE BISHOP MURDER CASE - MGM (in the Warner Archive box)The great Basil Rathbone (nine years before he played Sherlock Holmes) was the second actor to play Philo Vance.His portrayal is closer to the Philo Vance of the novels - not very flattering - basically an upper-class twit, but a very clever one.Technically, this 1930 MGM talkie is a considerable advance over the 1929-30 Paramount films.It has a surprising amount of outdoor filming, including an automobile ride which appears to have been filmed on the back of a flatbed truck in actual traffic.3) WARREN WILLIAM:- 1934: THE DRAGON MURDER CASE - Warner Bros. (Warner Archive box)- 1939: THE GRACIE ALLEN MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)The great - I think he's great - Warren William was the third actor to play Philo Vance.He's one of my all-time favorite actors, but I'll admit that he is an acquired taste.Warren William had a remarkable face -He looked like Satan - which should have stereotyped him as a screen villain, but his personality and sense of humor overcame this obvious handicap.This Philo Vance is not as serious as Powell or Rathbone, but he is devilish fun to watch.THE GRACIE ALLEN MURDER CASE is not a cheesy as it sounds.S.S. Van Dine actually wrote a novel with that title in 1938 (George Burns and Gracie Allen were friends of the author).Gracie Allen is wonderful - Warren William as Philo Vance basically takes over George Burns' role as Gracie's straight man.Warner Brothers also cast Warren William as Perry Mason in four films (starting in 1934).In 1939, he moved to Columbia and made the first of nine appearances as The Lone Wolf - basically playing the same character in all three series.All are available on DVD. See the GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD at the end of this review.4-8) B-MOVIE ACTORS:Unlike the first three, these five actors never quite made it past supporting parts in A-Movies.But they were leading men in B-Movies:- 1935: Paul Lukas in THE CASINO MURDER CASE - MGM (Warner Archive box)- 1936: Edmund Lowe in THE GARDEN MURDER CASE - MGM (Warner Archive box)- 1940: James Stephenson in CALLING PHILO VANCE - Warner Bros. (Warner Archive box)- 1947: William Wright in PHILO VANCE RETURNS - P.R.C. (OnesMedia box)- 1947: Alan Curtis in PHILO VANCE'S GAMBLE - P.R.C. (OnesMedia box)- 1947: Alan Curtis in PHILO VANCE'S SECRET MISSION - P.R.C. (OnesMedia box)The B-Movie units at MGM and Warners made some quality low-budget films.P.R.C. (Producers Releasing Corporation) had a less exalted reputation (well-deserved), but their films are not without a certain charm.I just like B-Movies.EXTRA: OnesMedia includes an unsold TV pilot - PHILO VANCE, DETECTIVE - which turns out to be a severely edited (18:33) version of PHILO VANCE'S SECRET MISSION.LOST FILMS: There were two additional Philo Vance films from the 1930s that are not in either collection:- 1936: THE SCARAB MURDER CASE with Wilfrid Hyde-White as Philo Vance.No prints of this British production are known to exist. The British Film Institute has placed it on its 75 Most Wanted list of lost films.- 1937: NIGHT OF MYSTERY (Paramount) with Grant Richards as Philo Vance(remake of The Greene Murder Case).Not a lost film, but apparently the only print is in the Library of Congress, which doesn't regard restoration of this B-movie as a high priority.Does anyone have more information?--------------------------------------------------OnesMedia has produced the only available collection of seven rare Philo Vance movies, and is selling them at a very nice price.Seven DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).Picture quality ranges from pretty bad to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.These are DVD-Rs, but so is the Warner collection.I had no problems with playback.Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.P.S. There was an early production problem: PHILO VANCE'S GAMBLE was missing the ending - it stopped mid-sentence at 49:35. The corrected version runs 1:01:07.I was an early buyer and found OnesMedia's customer service to be very helpful in supplying the corrected DVD.E-mail OnesMedia if you have any problems(for their web address, see my Comment dated July 8, 2015)------------------------------------------------------------------GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVDA-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves.

Ann Hood (of the D'Oyly Carte Opera)Third Boy ..................... Josephine Veasey ............ Marion RobertsIn January, 1962 Joan Sutherland sang Mozart's Queen of the Night for the only time in her career - in Covent Garden's new production.She never recorded the opera commercially for Decca.She would have seemed the obvious choice for Solti's 1969 recording, but Decca gave the role to Christina Deutekom(a controversial singer - I admire her Queen of the Night, but admit that what she does with the coloratura sounds awfully close to yodeling).Sung in German as Die Zauberflote.Prior to this production, Covent Garden had always performed the opera in English translation.Thirteen of the fourteen cast members were native English speakers, so this may not have been such a good idea.Contemporary British audiences and critics were not enthusiastic about the change.Otto Klemperer was recruited to conduct (and direct) the performance, but most of the excitement was about Joan Sutherland,a member of Covent Garden since 1952, who had burst onto international fame three years earlier as Lucia di Lammermoor, and was a very hot property indeed.Her only rival on the classical charts was Maria Callas.Of the supporting cast - Joan Carlyle, Monica Sinclair, Josephine Veasey, Geraint Evans and Richard Lewis all had respectable international careers, but their work was in the main confined to Great Britain.Josephine Veasey was the only singer who also took part in the EMI recording (she was demoted from Second Lady to Third Boy).The only singer in the Covent Garden performance who I would rate preferable to his EMI counterpart is Geraint Evans as Papageno (his only recording of the role).Nothing wrong with Walter Berry's singing, but Evans had the stronger personality- my favorite Papagenos are Erich Kunz in mono, and Hermann Prey in stereo.But this was very much Joan Sutherland's show.That being said, she was something of a disappointment.I was expecting to have chills running up and down my spine.But it never happened.Decent performance, but no fireworks.I could never understand this - until I read the booklet and discovered that Joan Sutherland insisted that her two arias be transposed down:- ""O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn"" by a semitone, and- ""Der Hoille Rache kocht in meinem Herzen"" by a whole tone.This definitely throws a wet blanket on the fireworks.""La Stupenda"" was famous for her high notes.Why would she duck the challenge in this most famous of all coloratura roles?The booklet offers no explanation.Was she not feeling well?Some psychological barrier?Why did she never record this opera in the controlled conditions of the studio?Decca would have had a best-seller on their hands.Aargh.English critics in 1962 blamed the relative failure of this performance on Klemperer's slow tempos (I don't find them all that slow) and on the decision to sing the opera in German.I think they were just making excuses for their hometown Diva.All that being conceded, this is still an essential purchase for all lovers of singing in the Twentieth Century.This is Joan Sutherland.These Testament CDs are the first authorized release of the BBC's original tape.The sound is mono, but pretty clear.The booklet offers an article and some photos, but no text or translation, not even a synopsis.Otto Klemperer's work is better appreciated on the the 1964 EMI recording with an all-star international cast(even in the smallest parts - Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was the First Lady).Recorded in beautiful Kingsway Hall stereo.That recording omitted the dialog, which some people objected to, but I don't miss it - Emanuel Shikaneder's prose is not great literature.Other recordings mentioned in this review:Klemperer 1964: Mozart: Die Zauberflöte - or - Mozart: Die Zauberflote (Home of Opera) - or - Mozart: Le Nozze Di Figaro/Don Giovanni/...Solti 1969: Mozart: Die Zauberflote (DECCA The Originals)- this has the complete dialogue (bah!)+ my all-time favorite Papageno in Hermann Prey+ Christina Deutekom's always interesting Queen of the Night.Even so, my favorite is still the 1964 EMI Klemperer studio recording(best conducting and overall cast - yielding to Solti only for Papageno + none of that tedious dialog)P.S. The photo on the cover looks like a scene from ""Frankenstein Meets the Queen Mum""- except Frankenstein is wearing Dracula's wardrobe.Otto Klemperer basically had one facial expression - an intimidating scowl.When he tried to smile, he just looked weird.Not his fault - he underwent surgery for the removal of a brain tumor in 1939 which left him permanently disfigured and partially paralyzed for the last forty years of his life.This horrific sight had an effect on orchestras - they certainly paid attention.My all-time favorite conductor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Y5BRHD8KJYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4Y700E#wasThisHelpful","R10Y5BRHD8KJYU","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Criminal mastermind Phil Morgan is taken for a ride by his fellow crooks and his body is dumped by the roadside.But they failed to bump him off.Instead he hit his head and woke up with total amnesia.He is taken to the hospital where he is cared for by a brilliant psychiatrist.He resolves to go to medical school himself and become a psychiatrist.Years later, he emerges as Dr. Matthew Ordway, The World's Greatest Psychiatrist, who has devoted his life to the study of the criminal mind.Almost a super-hero, except he has no special powers outside of his intellect(though he is able to hypnotize weak-minded criminals).All  ten  B-Movies were produced by Columbia Pictures between 1943 and 1949, and starred one-time leading man Warner Baxter (42nd Street) as The Crime Doctor.Warner Baxter was a bit older than your average B-Movie private eye, and a lot less physical (his stunt double gets a workout), but I always enjoyed the clever writing of these films.The series has a preposterous premise, but it is very well-done.The seventh entry in the series, ""Crime Doctor's Man-Hunt"" (1946), has a brilliant surprise ending that took me completely by surprise.Great fun.OnesMedia has produced the only available collection of all ten Crime Doctor movies, and is selling them at a very nice price.Five DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).Picture quality ranges from OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problem playing them.Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.------------------------------------------------------------------GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVDA-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves.

"Boston Blackie is a reformed jewel thief turned private detective.Chester Morris played Boston Blackie in fourteen Hollywood films between 1941 and 1949, all produced by Columbia Pictures.Basically a rip-off of The Saint, but great fun nonetheless.And Boston Blackie was not the only rip-off of the Saint in the 1940s - He was not even the only rip-off of the Saint produced by Columbia Pictures.I am a sucker for B-Movies about reformed jewel thieves turned private detectives:- George Sanders as the Saint (RKO Radio Pictures)- Warren William as The Lone Wolf (Columbia pictures)- Chester Morris as Boston Blackie (Columbia Pictures)Class Distinction:The Saint and The Lone Wolf were pretty much indistinguishable: Swanky upper-class reformed jewel thieves turned detectives.Boston Blackie was more of a Common Man reformed jewel thief turned private detective.OnesMedia has produced the only available collection of all fourteen Boston Blackie movies, and is selling them at a very nice price.Seven DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).Picture quality ranges from OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problem playing them.Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.For the OnesMedia website, see my comment dated July 8, 2015.------------------------------------------------------------------GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVDA-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves.

"Richard Bonynge (born 1930) was one of the most underrated, yet most influential conductors of the Twentieth Century.Not everyone took him seriously - Cynics referred to him as Mr. Joan Sutherland.He was married to one of the great sopranos of the Twentieth Century.True, his early career piggy-backed on his wife's success.When Decca signed her, they had to take him.Nevertheless, by the end of the Twentieth Century, he had earned a reputation as on of our most perceptive interpreters of Bel Canto Opera, French Opera, and Ballet.He was instrumental in the 1970's revival of interest in Massenet (the operas he conducted are all first recordings).Bonynge conducts:- Three of the eight operas in this collection (his wife sings in two of them),- Three ballets,- Three-quarters of the orchestral showpieces,- He plays the piano in 25 songs and conducts additional songs and arias.The 144 page booklet includes a detailed plot summary for each opera, cued to the track listing (three ballets get the same treatment).The complete texts for each opera plus English translations are on a CD-ROM that comes with the set.There are also complete texts and translations for the songs, and the arias from additional Massenet operas used as fillers.OPERAS:- ""Manon"" - Beverly Sills, Nicolai Gedda, Gerard Souzay - cond. Julius Rudel.- ""Werther"" - Frederica von Stade, Jose Carreras - cond. Colin Davis.- ""Thais"" - Renee Fleming, Thomas Hampson - cond. Yves Abel.- ""Esclarmonde"" - Joan Sutherland, Huguette Tourangeau, Giacomo Aragall - cond. Richard Bonynge.- ""La Roi de Lahore"" - Joan Sutherland, Luis Lima, Sherrill Milnes - cond. Richard Bonynge.- ""Therese"" - Huguette Tourangeau, Ryland Davies - cond. Richard Bonynge.- ""Le Jongleur de Notre Dame"" - Roberto Alagna and an all-male cast - cond. Enrique Diemecke.- ""Don Quichotte"" - Nicolai Ghiaurov (Don Quichotte), Gabriel Bacquier (Sancho Panza), Regine Crespin (Dulcinee) - cond. Kazimierz Kord.""Manon"" and ""Werther"" have been recorded many times. For these operas, the recorded competition is intense.The standard was set by each opera's first recording:- 1928 ""Manon"" - EMI (Naxos) with Germaine Feraldy, Louis Guenot - Opera Comique cond. Elie Cohen. *- 1931 ""Werther"" - EMI (Naxos) with Ninon Vallin, Georges Thill - Paris Opera cond. Elie Cohen. *None of these singers were members of the original cast (Massenet died in 1912), but they studied with the singers who were.The Paris Opera maintained a distinctively French performing style up through World War II.A lost tradition.In 1955 EMI (Testament or Naxos) recorded ""Manon"" at the Paris Opera. The singers were of a younger generation, but Pierre Monteux, the 80 year-old conductor, had known and worked with Massenet. *Surprisingly, these popular operas were not in Decca's stereo catalog.A missed opportunity - Suzanne Danco and Regine Crespin, the reigning French divas of the early stereo era, were both under contract to Decca.This box includes the 1970 Westminster/ABC/DG ""Manon"" (with Sills and Gedda), and the 1980 Philips ""Werther"" (with von Stade and Carreras).Nothing to complain about here, aside from some discomfort with the language.The uniquely French style of the mono EMI recordings is lost forever (its easier to fake fluency in Italian or German).There was competition from EMI for ""Thais"" (with Beverly Sills), and for ""Don Quichotte"" (with Jose Van Dam),but Decca is responsible for the only available recordings of ""Esclarmonde"", ""Le Jongleur de Notre Dame"", ""La Roi de Lahore"", and ""Therese"" (at least on major labels).ARIAS FROM ADDITIONAL MASSENET OPERAS:""Cendrillon"" - Joan Sutherland""Cherubin"" - Joan Sutherland, Angela Gheorghiu""Le Cid"" - Joan Sutherland""Herodiade"" - Huguette Tourangeau, Angela GheorghiuORCHESTRAL MUSIC FROM OPERAS:""Cendrillon"" - Marche des princesses - cond. Bonynge""Cherubin"" - Entracte - cond. Bonynge""Le Cid"" - Ballet Music - cond. Bonynge""La Navarraise"" - Nocturne - cond. Bonynge""La Roi de Lahore"" - Entracte, Adagio & Waltz - cond. Bonynge""Manon"" - Prelude + La Nuit de Noel - cond. Albert Wolff (mono) **""Thais"" - Meditation - John Georgiadis/Nigel Kennedy violin, cond. Bonynge (2 performances)SONGS:Huguette Tourangeau: 20 Songs with piano accompanimentJoan Sutherland: 7 Songs, five with piano accompaniment, two with orchestral accompanimentBALLETS:- ""Le Carillon"" - cond. Bonynge- ""Cigale"" - cond. Bonynge- ""Manon Ballet"" (orch. Leighton Lucas) - cond. BonyngeLe Carillon (1892) and Cigale (1904) are essentially one-act ballets (40 minutes each).The ""Manon Ballet"" is a full-length ballet (1 hour, 48 minutes).It was created in 1974 for the Royal Ballet.The plot is the same as the opera, but arranger Leighton Lewis did not use any music from the opera ""Manon"".Instead he used music from other Massenet operas and orchestral works. Gimmicky but enjoyable.ORCHESTRAL WORKS:Suite for Orchestra No.3 ""Scenes dramatiques"" - cond. BonyngeSuite for Orchestra No.4 ""Scenes pittoresques"" - cond. Albert Wolff **Suite for Orchestra No.7 ""Scenes alsaciennes"" - cond. Bonynge and Albert Wolff **Concert Overture ""Phedre"" - cond. Albert Wolff (mono) **Lamento d' Ariane - cond. BonyngeFantasy for Cello and Orchestra - Jascha Silberstein cello, cond. BonyngeInvocation from ""Les Erinnyes"" - Douglas Cummings cello, cond. BonyngeRECOMMENDATIONS:At the low price asked, and with full texts and translations, the Decca box is an essential purchase for all lovers of French Opera.- ""Esclarmonde"", ""La Roi de Lahore"", ""Therese"" and ""Le Jongleur de Notre Dame"" - the only available recordings are in this box.- ""Manon"" and ""Werther"" - the stereo recordings in this box are as good as any in the catalog, but the three mono EMI Paris Opera recordings  are irreplaceable. *- ""Thais"" - the Decca recording with Renee Fleming and Thomas Hampson is outstanding, but the EMI recording with Beverly Sills and Sherill Milnes has great sentimental value for me.Also recommended: the DVD featuring Renee Fleming and Thomas Hampson in performance at the Metropolitan Opera: Massenet: Thais- The Metropolitan OperaRenee Fleming is fun to look at.- ""Don Quichotte"" - Close, but I prefer the Decca recording with Nicolai Ghiaurov to the EMI with Jose van Dam.This is one French opera where being a native French speaker is not necessarily an advantage.Massenet composed the role with Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin in mind.Bulgarian bass Nicolai Ghiaurov is the closest we can come in stereo.P.S. Additional Massenet operas have been recorded on other labels:""Cendrillon"" with Frederica von Stade (Sony)""Cherubin"" with Frederica von Stade (Sony)""Le Cid"" with Grace Bumbry (Sony)""Herodiade"" with Cheryl Studer (EMI) - or - Renee Fleming (Sony or Newton Classics)""La Navarraise"" with Marilyn Horne (Sony)----------------------------------------------------------------* EMI's Paris Opera recordings:Manon: 1929 EMI: Great Opera Recordings: MassenetManon: 1955 EMI: Massenet: Manon - or - ManonWerther: 1931 EMI: Werther** French conductor Albert Wolff conducts the ""historic recordings"" on CD 23.Contrary to the booklet, the two Massenet suites are stereo (1955). The Phedre Overture and orchestral excerpts from Manon are mono.The Manon is from an abridged 1951 Decca recording of the opera featuring Jeanine Micheau. Sounds interesting, but I haven't heard it.Albert Wolff (1884-1970) was an historically important conductor who is almost forgotten today.His Paris Conservatoire recordings were a mainstay of Decca's early stereo catalog - Recently documented in three two-disc sets on the Decca/Eloquence label:Fte à la FrançaiseEloq: Invitation to the DanceEloq: Overtures in Hi-Fi","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12N5A7GN3TJJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NUP7Y4#wasThisHelpful","R12N5A7GN3TJJJ","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: NORTH AMERICAN DVDs FINALLY RELEASED ON OCTOBER 7, 2015.One year before the official North American release, Season 3 of DCI Banks was released in two European DVD versions - from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.Both European versions have found their way onto Amazon.By the time I posted my review, thirteen reviews of the European versions had already appeared on this page.Some reviewers have complained that the subtitles are in Dutch, not English.Some reviewers complained that it will not play at all.There is a simple explanation:Both the English and Dutch versions are in PAL Region 2 format - If you buy them, you will need a special region-free DVD player.The North American release is identical in content to the UK release (with English subtitles), but it is in the NTSC Region 1 format (the North-American standard).The different versions are easy to tell apart- the cover art for the European releases is radically different. *Make sure the cover of yours has the two women on the left and the man on the right (and no Dutch writing).------------------------------------------------------This excellent and gritty British police series debuted in 2010.Filmed in Yorkshire, primarily in the city of Leeds (population 750,000)Since the series began, Stephen Tompkinson has played Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, and Andrea Lowe has played Detective Sergeant Annie Cabbot.There is a surprising amount of sexual tension on this show.D.S. Cabbot took maternity leave at the start of Season Two.Nobody knows who the father is, and there is a great deal of speculation among her fellow officers.[No, DCI Banks is not the father.]D.S. Cabbot is back as a single mother in Season Three.In Season Two, Caroline Catz, as Detective Inspector Helen Morton, was brought in as a temporary replacement, but has caught on and is now part of the team.(I have a major crush on this woman. This was her first series after ""Doc Martin"").All three are back for Season Three.This show keeps getting better..Season Three has the best writing so far - especially the final episode ""Bad Boy"".Very Dickensian.Charles Dickens had a knack for introducing unrelated plot lines, which are finally brought together by a remarkable chain of coincidences.In lesser hands this would be a recipe for disaster, but Catherine Tregenna pulled it off successfully.In real life, DCI Banks' evidence against the killer would not be admissible in court,but dramatically the episode was very satisfying.My only concern is that there was entirely too much fraternization between the ranks in Season Three.also Too much ""Boinking""also Too much ""Rogering""also Too much ""Shagging""also Too much ""Hiding the Sausage""also Too much ""Taking Old One-Eye to the Optometrist""----- Euphemisms from from the Online Slang DictionaryThe implied sexual tension of Seasons One and Two is out in the open.I would have thought the lower ranks were off-limits to Detective Chief Inspectors, but this is apparently not the case in Yorkshire.Season Four will be interesting.Only real complaint is the lack of a Blu-Ray version.Still five stars.[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.] ___  Pilot (2010): DCI Banks: AftermathSeason 1 (2011): DCI Banks: Season 1Season 2 (2012): DCI Banks: Season 2 - Caroline Catz joins the seriesSeason 3 (2014): reviewed on this pageSeason 4 (2015): DCI Banks: Season FourWatch the Pilot before watching Season 1, Episode 2 (""Friend of the Devil"") - a continuing story.While waiting patiently for DCI Banks Season 3, I created a list of my Favorite British Police Inspectors - see my Comment dated May 12, 2015.-------------------------------------------------------* Different versions of Season Three:GOOD: North American version = DCI Banks: Season Three (the man is on the right)BAD: UK version = DCI Banks - Series 3 [DVD] [2015] (the man is standing in the center)BAD: Dutch version = Inspector Banks (Complete Series 3) - 2-DVD Box Set ( DCI Banks ) ( Wednesday's Child / Piece of My Heart / Bad Boy ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Netherlands ] (it has ""DIE COMPLETE DERDE SERIE"" printed on the cover)Don't order the UK or Dutch version unless you have a region-free DVD player and need Dutch subtitles.Region-free DVD players are actually a good idea.Unfortunately you won't find them at Best Buy, Target or Walmart.They are not illegal, but the big retailers are under a lot of pressure not to sell them.On the Amazon search bar, under ""Electronics"" enter ""region free dvd player""Several models under $50.All DVD players are region-free when they come from the factory.The regional encoding software is programmed in later.It can be deprogrammed by someone who knows what they are doing(there is a computer port on the back of your DVD player - along with a warning label that it is for authorized technicians only).I have owned a Toshiba region-free player for two years, and it plays flawlessly.In addition to playing every DVD in the world (PAL or NTSC), it will also play region A and region-free blu-rays, but not European region B blu-rays.Region-free blu-ray players are available, but more pricey - in the $200 range (but the price will almost certainly come down if you are patient).- but read the description carefully: ""region-free DVD / Blu-Ray player"" is not the same as ""region-free DVD / region-free Blu-Ray player"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30Y42PDM9MDTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SAJLR28#wasThisHelpful","R30Y42PDM9MDTS","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Program notes on the back of each jacket except for the bonus disc (CD 10).""Tape transfers from the original analogue sources and mastering using 24-bit/96kHz technology.""The Bartok, Hindemith, Nielsen, Varese and five of the eight Ravel pieces have already been issued in 24-bit transfers, most as part of RCA's 'High Performance' series.The rest are newly remastered for this collection.Fritz Reiner retired from the Chicago Symphony in 1963, and died shortly thereafter.Reiner was a Hungarian conductor who made his early reputation in Germany before moving to America.The Chicago orchestra, audiences and critics were looking for a carbon copy of their fallen hero.(only George Szell really fit the bill, but he already had the job in Cleveland and wasn't interested).The closest match the search committee could find was Georg Solti, then in his third year as Music Director of London's Covent Garden Opera.The Chicago board offered him the Symphony, but he was unwilling to leave Covent Garden, and Chicago wasn't looking for a part-time conductor.Jean Martinon was the fallback choice.A victim of circumstanceCertain orchestra members resented him (including the principal oboe, who was the musician's union delegate).Martinon had a terrible local press, though his recordings with the orchestra were universally praised.By 1968 he was gone, back to France.In 1969, Georg Solti took over as Music Director.The orchestra, audiences and critics were happy again.I actually felt sorry for Martinon (I was a teenager).He seemed to have gotten a raw deal.As a farewell gesture, at his final recording sessions, the orchestra agreed to record Martinon's own 4th Symphony.Guilty conscience?(it wasn't RCA's idea).Last year, Sony issued a box of all the Reiner/Chicago Symphony recordings: Fritz Reiner: Complete RCA CollectionI titled my review ""Wonderful Performances by a Great Conductor with a Great Orchestra in Remarkable Sound"".I thought about calling this new Martinon box -""Wonderful Performances by a Great Conductor with a Great Orchestra, 30% in Remarkable Sound, 70% in Pretty Good Sound"".CDs 1-3, the earliest recordings in this collection (Martin, Nielsen, Roussel, Varese + Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe Suite), were the last in a series of audiophile LPs that RCA produced in Chicago's Orchestra Hall between 1954 and 1966.Orchestra Hall was a mediocre concert hall, but a superb recording studio - it actually sounded better empty.In 1966 it underwent a disastrous remodeling, which resulted in a mediocre concert hall and mediocre recording studio.[ Jean Martinon was very unlucky in Chicago.]For the next ten plus years, well into the Solti era, the orchestra recorded across town in the Medinah Temple, a merely good recording studio.Sony's CD masterings of the Medinah Temple recordings (CDs 4-10) actually sound better than the RCA ""Dynagroove"" LPs of the late Sixties.POINTS OF INTEREST:-- The Varese Arcana, Martin's Concerto for Seven Wind Instruments, and Ravel's Bolero are from the Chicago Symphony's final recording session in the old Orchestra Hall on March 19-21, 1966.Nielsen's 4th Symphony was recorded later that year (on October 10) during a pause in construction - the sound is still recognizable as Orchestra Hall.The first Medinah Temple session was six months later - on April 26, 1967.[the booklet claims that Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream was recorded in Orchestra Hall on May 18, 1967, but this is probably a typo - two days earlier RCA's engineers were in Medinah Temple for a recording session.]-- The Medinah Temple was not a place of worship.It was a 4200 seat auditorium, built in 1912 by the ""Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine"", better known as the Shriners.(I saw the circus there as a child)It had surprisingly good acoustics, considering it's enormous size.Still standing, though the interior has been gutted and is now home to Bloomingdale's Department Store.The Shriners are a North American charitable fraternity (related to the Masons) founded in 1870.They run children's hospitals and drive tiny cars while wearing red fezzes.-- Decca used the Medinah Temple for their first Solti recording in 1970 (Mahler's 5th and 6th Symphonies), but never stopped looking for a better hall.Beginning in 1971, they briefly flirted with recording at the University of Illinois (Mahler's 7th Symphony).Results were excellent, but it was 150 miles from Chicago - an extravagant solution.Decca, EMI, and DG reluctantly agreed with RCA's decision to use the Medinah Temple for recording the Chicago Symphony. *-- This is the third CD transfer of Carl Nielsen's Symphony 4 'The Inextinguishable'.This may be the fastest performance on record - extremely exciting.Magnificent playing by the Chicago brass. The critics always made a great deal of Solti's brass section, but the key players were already in place.'The Inextinguishable' is supposed to be performed without breaks between movements ('attacca').It was first issued this way on CD in 1994.Twelve years later Sony issued a new 24-bit remastering in improved sound, but a misinformed editor inserted a five-second gap between movements 3 and 4.For this new box, Sony re-used the 24-bit mastering, but closed the five-second gap.They finally got it right.There is a drum whack at 10:17 of track 3, the sound decays for one second, then the brass lurches in.More of a stagger than a pause.-- Massenet's Meditation from 'Thais' - violin soloist Steven Staryk was concertmaster of the Chicago Symphony during the Martinon years.In 1956, Sir Thomas Beecham appointed the 24 year-old Staryk concertmaster of the Royal Philharmonic (or ""leader"" in the funny language of the natives).He played the violin solo in Beecham's recording of Scheherezade.Later, Staryk was konzertmeister of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw (1960-1963), and held the Chicago position between 1963 and 1967.After Chicago, Staryk returned home to Canada and devoted himself to a solo career and teaching.Strad Magazine called him ""The King of Concertmasters"".-- Paganini's ""Moto perpetuo"", orchestrated by Frederick Stock (not Stokowski) is from a private fund-raising CD issued by the orchestra.Stock was conductor of the Chicago Symphony from 1905 to 1942.-- Ravel's Boléro, Pavane and La Valse on CD 10 were part of a ""Ravel's Greatest Hits"" LP in the `70sSuite 2 from Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe is performed in the concert version without chorus. Martinon recorded the complete ballet with chorus for EMI in 1974 with the Orchestre de Paris.-- Casadesus' Piano Concerto with the composer as soloist (CD 10) was recorded with the French National Radio Orchestra, not the Chicago Symphony.-- Prior to Chicago, 50 percent of Martinon's recordings were of French (or Swiss) music.In Chicago, 60 percent of his recordings were of French music.Post-Chicago, 90 percent of his recordings were of French music.CONTENTS OF THE SONY BOX:- Bartók: Miraculous Mandarin Suite- Bizet: Symphony in C + L'Arlésienne Suites- Casadesus: Concerto for Piano (composer, piano)- Hindemith: Nobilissima Visione- Lalo: Le roi d'Ys Overture- Martin: Concerto for Seven Wind Instruments, Timpani, Percussion and Strings- Martinon: Symphony 4- Massenet: Meditation from Thais- Mendelssohn: A Midsummer Night's Dream Suite- Mennin: Symphony 7 ""Variation-symphony""- Nielsen: Symphony 4 ""The Inextinguishable"" + Helios Overture- Paganini-Stock: Moto perpetuo- Ravel: Alborada del gracioso / Boléro / Daphnis et Chloé Suite 2 / Introduction and Allegro for Harp, Flute, Clarinet, and Strings / Ma mère l'Oye  / Pavane pour une infante défunte / Rapsodie espagnole / La Valse- Roussel: Bacchus et Ariade Suite 2- Varese: Arcana- Weber: Clarinet Concertos (Benny Goodman)------------------------------------------------------------------DISCOGRAPHY OF CHICAGO SYMPHONY GUEST CONDUCTORS - and - JEAN MARTINON DISCOGRAPHYI have prepared two discographies - See my comment dated March 16, 2015.----------------------------------------------------------------------------* Solti's first Beethoven cycle with the Chicago Symphony was recorded in three different locales:- Symphony 9 in the Krannert Center at the University of Illinois (1972)- Symphonies 1-5 and 8 in Medinah Temple (1973-74)- Symphonies 6 and 7 in the Sofiensaal in Vienna (during the orchestra's 1974 European tour)Solti Beethoven: SymphoniesThere was a second attempt at remodeling Orchestra Hall, which resulted in a slight improvement, but it was enough for Decca to resume recording there.- I think the last recording session in Medinah Temple was Solti's recording of Mahler's 2nd Symphony in 1980.In 1995-97 Orchestra Hall was completely re-designed and enlarged to include the adjacent building - now known as ""Symphony Center"".I still miss the old Orchestra Hall - even though I only heard one Youth Concert there (I used to be a Youth).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34VLKIUPLO0CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCCWXPG#wasThisHelpful","R34VLKIUPLO0CR","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a delayed start,  Amazon is finally offering Goberman's Haydn on CD.The 14 CD box  costs less than the digital downloads.BACKGROUND:In the early years of LP ('50s and '60s), there were four abortive attempts to record the Complete Symphonies of Haydn:-- Jonathan Sternberg with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra (mono recordings) on the Haydn Society label (augmented by Anton Heiller, Mogens Wöldike, Franz Litschauer, Hans Swarowsky, and Erwin Baltzer)-- Hermann Scherchen with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra (mostly mono, some stereo) for Ultraphon and Westminster (augmented by Henry Swoboda, Lazslo Somogyi and Robert Rudolf)-- Leslie Jones with the Little Orchestra of London (stereo) for Pye and Nonesuch.-- Max Goberman with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra (stereo) for ""The Library of Recorded Masterpieces"".The first three were commercial ventures, but Max Goberman's was a labor of love - He funded the Haydn Symphony project out of his own pocket.""Library of Recorded Masterpieces"" LPs were sold by subscription, which brought in some money, but Goberman made up the difference.His income came from being one of the most sought-after conductors on Broadway (see ""West Side Story"" original cast CD).After three years of work, Goberman had made it to almost the half-way mark, when he died of a massive heart attack in 1962.He was 52 years old, and had recorded 45 Symphonies and three overtures:Symphonies 1-6, 7-9 (Morning, Noon & Night), 10-17, 19, 20, 21, 22 (Philosopher), 23, 24, 26 (Lamentation), 27, 32, 34, 35, 37, 40, 41, 48 (Maria Theresa), 49 (La Passione), 51, 52, 55 (Schoolmaster), 56, 57, 60 (Il Distratto), 65, 92 (Oxford), 96 (Miracle) and 98+ Symphonies A and B (Hob 107 + 108)+ Overtures to ""L'infedelta delusa"", ""Lo Speziale"" and ""Acide et Galalea""In the late '60s, Columbia Records (USA) acquired the rights to ""The Library of Recorded Masterpieces"", and announced their intention to finish the Haydn Symphony project on the budget label Odyssey.Charles Mackerras and the London Symphony were recruited for the remaining works, but only Symphony 18 was completed before the project foundered (unfortunately Symphony 18 was left out of the new collection).To date, there have been four complete sets of the Haydn Symphonies:[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]1) Antal Dorati with the Philharmonica Hungarica: recorded 1969-1972 by Decca: Haydn: The SymphoniesIt's very well done, with scholarly notes, but I'm not sure how it would have measured up to a hypothetical Goberman/Mackerras set.Dorati has one advantage over other complete sets - an appendix with two versions of Symphonies 22 and 63, four finales to 53, and two finales to 103 (unavailable outside the Dorati box).2) Ernst Maerzendorfer with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra: recorded concurrent with the Dorati project (never released on CD).3) Adam Fischer with ""The Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra"" on Brilliant Classics: Haydn: The Complete Symphonies4) Dennis Russell Davies with The Stuttgart Chamber orchestra on Sony: Haydn: The Complete SymphoniesThe booklets included with the Fischer and Davies boxes are not as detailed as that in the Dorati box.Both conductors are spirited, but there are some questions about their scholarship (see my comments on Symphony 48 ""Maria Theresa"", third version).If you want a boxed set of all 106 Symphonies played on period instruments, you are out of luck.- The late Christopher Hogwood with The Academy of Ancient Music came closest with 81 Symphonies: Haydn: Symphonies- Roy Goodman with the Hanover Band recorded 62 Symphonies - Individual CDs on the Helios label, not yet in a box.- Derek Solomons with L'Estro armonico recorded at least 30 Symphonies for CBS (only a few made it to CD).- Trevor Pinnock with the English Concert recorded 22 Early Symphonies: Haydn - Pinnock: Complete Recordings (DG Collectors Edition)- Thomas Fey with with the Nuremberg Symphony has an ongoing series for Hanssler (55 symphonies in 15 years) using modern instruments, but played in period style. I'd sooner invest in a 100% period instrument recording.- Dorati, Fischer, Hogwood, Pinnock and Solomons are available on you-tube.- There are thirty-second samples of Goberman on Amazon's MP3 downloads page.- See my Comment dated May 30, 2015 for links to websites with brief samples of the Davies set and a perceptive review.(Amazon won't allow me to print website links in a review, but its OK in the Comments section).---------------------------------------------SOUND QUALITY AND PACKAGING14 CDs in mini-LP cardboard jackets, but not ""original jacket"" format (no notes on the back).36 page booklet with a brief article about Max Goberman, but no notes about the Symphonies.If I remember correctly the original LPs came with program notes by H.C. Robbins-Landon.[the much-maligned Wikipedia is a good source - their ""Haydn Symphonies"" page has links to an article about each Symphony.]Contrary to Sony's claim, ""these historic recordings [are not] restored to pristine condition"".Some are, but several of the original 3-track master tapes were lost before Sony acquired the Columbia archives.The transfer to CD was supervised by Sony's Andreas K. Meyer, who has done quality work in the past.""Given the musical importance of Goberman's recordings, we decided to continue with the Haydn Symphonies project and managed to cobble together sources, comprising original 3-track masters, 2-track masters used in the Odyssey re-releases, and, as a last resort, pristine copies of the original LPs issued by the Library of Recorded Masterpieces.""The booklet does not specify the source(s) used for each Symphony.This is not a deal-breaker for me - it's unfortunate, but even at it's worst, the sound is still pretty good.Sony did a valiant job in making the Goberman recordings presentable.A lot of time and effort.Early '60s stereo means wide separation and clear placing of each instrument.The sound is close-up, not ""concert hall realism"".If you are at all concerned, check out the thirty-second samples of Goberman's Haydn on Amazon's MP3 downloads page.--------------------------------------SYMPHONY 48 in C MAJOR: ""MARIA THERESA""I don't have time to compare recordings of everything in this box, so I decided to start with my favorite middle period Haydn Symphony.Haydn scholar H.C. Robbins Landon shared my enthusiasm:""From the tense excitement of the opening (with those reeling horn parts that must be heard to be believed) ... to the breathless pace of the Finale, this Symphony seems to have been composed in one great inspirational sweep.""Originally scored for two oboes, bassoon, two horns (first, third and last movement for high horns in C), and strings.There are three versions of Symphony 48:- Without Timpani (as per the original score)- With Timpani- With Trumpets (replacing high horns)H.C. Robbins Landon started the war against trumpets and drums:""It is not certain that the crude timpani part in the Esterhazy archives is really Haydn's ...The modern trumpet and timpani parts as published by Breitkopf & Hartel, and in the Eulenburg score, are patent forgeries.""--- `The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn' - New York, 1955If you want to hear what Symphony 48 sounds like without drums, try the period instrument performances by Goodman or Hogwood (Hogwood is on you-tube).I miss the timpani.Later on Robbins Landon changed his mind - at least about drums:""No authentic timpani part for this work has survived, but it is unlikely that Haydn performed the Symphony without one (all the other similar C major works of this period include a genuine kettledrum part) and none of the other existing versions can be considered satisfactory.The editor (Robbins Landon) has therefore reconstructed one especially for this recording.""--- HCRL, notes written for the Solomons CD, 1983To the best of my knowledge, everyone but Goodman and Hogwood include timpani.The third version, adding trumpets to the orchestra, was created after Haydn's death.Trumpets sound in the same range, but are less prone to accident than high horns.Substituting trumpets for high horns takes away a lot of the danger in live performance (no clams), but also much of the excitement - high horns have a uniquely thrilling sound (they whoop).Though he eventually accepted timpani in Symphony 48, Robbins-Landon remained adamant that the the trumpet part was a forgery.Dennis Russell Davies recorded the trumpet version in Stuttgart.I'm also pretty sure I hear trumpets in Fischer's recording (no mention in the booklet).OK in concert. Not for a recording.I love the sound of high horns in this symphony.First impression: Goberman whoops quite nicely, thank you.His ""Maria Theresa"" is very nearly perfect.Unapologetic high horns.[Dorati also uses high horns, but they are less boisterous than Goberman's.]Prominent timpani.The chamber orchestra sounds larger than is fashionable nowadays, and the strings play with full tone - historically incorrect, but I like it.First and Second violins are seated on opposite sides of the orchestra, as they should be.Haydn wrote with antiphonal strings in mind (try listening over headphones).By the 1960s, divided violins were going out-of-fashion after 200 years.The most influential Maestros - Bernstein, Karajan and Solti - scrunched all violins together on the left.Basically reducing the orchestra to two string groups (highs on the left, lows on the right).Nineteenth Century relics Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter clung to the old ways in their stereo recordings.Max Goberman followed their lead.Dorati and Fischer use the modern seating plan with all violins on the left.Period Instruments: If you must have drums in ""Maria Theresa"" (I must), your best historically correct bet is Derek Solomons.I am not normally a big fan of period instruments, but was greatly impressed by his CBS CD - Tiny orchestra, thrilling natural horns: Symphonies 45 "" Farewell "" & 48I'd love to hear the rest of his Haydn, most of which never made it to CD.Trevor Pinnock used a larger period instrument orchestra, but his performance is on the sedate side compared to Solomons, who is almost manic (both are on you-tube).OTHER SYMPHONIES:Goberman's performances of the early symphonies display the same qualities as ""Maria Theresa"".The orchestra is not quite as large as that used for the middle period Symphonies, but is still scandalously large by historically-correct 21st Century standards.I like the sound of Goberman's orchestra, but I'm old and set in my ways.I'm also a crank - my all-time favorite conductor of late Haydn is Otto Klemperer (his Symphony 102 is the greatest Haydn recording ever).Followed closely by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic (not his Vienna remakes).Goberman only recorded three late Symphonies (92, 96 and 98).His 98 is outstanding, the others very good.--------------------------------------There are 108 ""Symphonies"" in the catalog published in 1956 by Anthony van Hoboken.Hob I: 1-104 are Symphonies 1-104 in the traditional canon devised in 1906 by Eusebius Mandyczewski - imperfect chronological order.Hob I: 105 is the Sinfonia Concertante in B flat Major for violin, cello, oboe and bassoon (1792). A popular work, recorded many times. Not really a symphony.Hob I: 106 (Symphony C) is an incomplete single movement fragment in D Major from 1769.Hob I: 107 and 108 (Symphonies A and B) are early works (1757-1760), which were discovered after Mandyczewski's publication.Goberman, Dorati, Fischer and Hogwood include Hob 107 + 108.Hoboken thought Hob 1:106 was a fragment from a lost D Major symphony of 1769.Haydn scholar H.C. Robbins-Landon originally agreed and called it Symphony C, but later speculated that it might be the missing overture to the opera ""Le Pescatrici"" - a work which only survives in fragmentary form.Even more confusing, there is a Hungarian recording of Robbins-Landon's reconstruction of ""Le Pescatrici"" but it has no overture.A reconstruction of the Symphony Hob I: 106 (3 minutes, 11 seconds) is available in a 2 CD set of Haydn's Overtures: Haydn: Complete Overtures, where it is identified as the overture to the opera 'Le Pescatrici'.There was also a performance by Derek Solomons (3 minutes, 33 seconds).Not on CD, but someone posted it on you-tubeEnter the following on the you-tube search bar:J. Haydn - Hob I:106 - Symphony in D major (fragment)-------------------------------------In addition to the Haydn Symphony project in Vienna, Goberman also planned to record the complete Concertos of Vivaldi: 75 were recorded with the ""New York Sinfonietta"", plus a very nice set of Bach Brandenburg Concertos.All in the three year period 1960-1962.---------------------------------------My favorite ""Maria Theresa"" of all time was the old Nonesuch LP by Karl Ristenpart and the Chamber Orchestra of the Saar, but I am relying on memory.I haven't heard it in twenty years, not since I donated my turntable and LP collection to charity.Perhaps this is just nostalgia.Was it as good as I remember?I wish whoever owns the rights would issue it on CD - Perhaps in a big box of Karl Ristenpart recordings.Back then I naively assumed that every LP would eventually be available on CD or the internet.99 percent are, but there are a few treasured recordings still in limbo.Max Goberman spent a long time there.Back among the living, thanks to Sony.P.S. See my Comment dated August 2, 2015 for a discussion of repeats in Goberman's Haydn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YCFYLF1MBDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIO5O96#wasThisHelpful","R6YCFYLF1MBDW","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a CD collection of Haydn's Complete Overtures, you don't have a choice.To date, this is the only time it's been done.Fortunately the performances are spirited and well-recorded.Played by a chamber orchestra of approximately 35 players on modern instruments.22 Overtures.- Eleven overtures to Italian operas (one overture is speculative)- Three overtures to German operas (one overture is speculative)- Two concert overtures Hob Ia: 4 and 7- Symphony fragment Hob I:106 (identified as overture to the Italian opera ""Le Pescatrici"")- Five orchestral introductions to the oratorios.When Anthony van Hoboken published his Haydn Vercheiznis in 1956, he assigned Hoboken numbers by category.Hob I was ""Symphonies"".There was also a category of Hob Ia, ""Overtures"": fourteen of which were excerpted from complete operas, which also had their own Hoboken numbers.The booklet uses the Hob Ia numbers for these fourteen overtures - this is confusing as nearly every other recording uses the number assigned to the complete opera (Hob XXVIII = Italian Operas, Hob XXIX = German Operas).The Hob Ia number really only makes sense for the two independent Concert Overtures, Hob Ia: 4 and 7.In the list that follows, I have used the more commonly accepted Hoboken number, not the Hob Ia number.[I found the complete Hoboken Catalog in the appendix of 'The Oxford Companion to Haydn', ed. David Wyn Jones, 2002]OVERTURES TO ITALIAN OPERAS:Hob XXVIII:1 AcideHob XXVIII:2 La Canterina - HAS NO OVERTUREHob XXVIII:3 Lo SpezialeHob XXVIII:4 Le Pescatrici - SEE BELOW UNDER ""INDEPENDENT ORCHESTRAL WORKS""Hob XXVIII:5 L'Infedelta delusaHob XXVIII:6 L'Incontro improvvisoHob XXVIII:7 Il Mondo della LunaHob XXVIII:8 La Vera costanzaHob XXVIII:9 L'Isola disabitataHob XXVIII:10 La Fedelta primiataHob XXVIII:11 Orlando PaladinoHob XXVIII:12 ArmidaHob XXVIII:13 Orfeo ed Euridice (L'Anima del filosofo)OVERTURES TO GERMAN OPERAS:Hob XXIXa:1 Philemon und BaucisHob XXIXa:1a Der Gotterrath - THIS IS THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF SYMPHONY 50Hob XXIXa:4 FeuersbrunstHaydn constructed Symphony 50 in C Major with music recycled from his marionette opera ""Der Gotterath"" (now lost), which was performed as a Prologue to the German opera ""Philemon and Baucis"" during a 1773 visit by the Empress Maria Theresa.Manfred Huss has assumed that the overture to ""Der Gotterath"" was re-used in it's entirety as the first movement to  Symphony 50.Not unreasonable, but not absolutely certain.(the booklet notes should have explained this).ORATORIOS:Hob XX ""Seven Last Words of Christ"" - orchestral introductionHob XXI:1 ""Il Ritorno di Tobia"" - orchestral introductionHob XXI:2 ""Creation"" - orchestral introductionHob XXI:3 ""The Seasons"" - orchestral introductions to Part 3 (Autumn) and Part 4 (Winter).

Not really a symphony.Hob I:106 is an incomplete single movement fragment in D from 1769 (""Symphony C"").Hob I:107 and 108 (Symphonies A and B) are early symphonies, 1757-1760 (recorded by Goberman, Dorati, Fischer and Hogwood in their more-or-less complete sets).Manfred Huss in this recording identifies Hob I:106 as the long-lost overture to ""Le Pescatrici"" Hob XXVIII:4.Well, it might be.Hoboken thought Hob 1:106 was a fragment from a lost D Major symphony of 1769.Haydn scholar H.C. Robbins-Landon originally agreed and called it ""Symphony C"", but later speculated that it might be the missing overture to ""Le Pescatrici"" - a work which survives only in fragmentary form.Even more confusing, there is a Hungarian recording of Robbins-Landon's reconstruction of the opera ""Le Pescatrici"" but it has no overture.Hob 1:106 in this set of ""Complete Overtures"" is the only recording on CD (3 minutes, 11 seconds).There was also a performance by Derek Solomons (3 minutes, 33 seconds).Not on CD, but someone posted it on you-tubeEnter the following on the you-tube search bar:J. Haydn - Hob I:106 - Symphony in D major (fragment)--------------------------------------------------------------------My only complaint is that the booklet notes are unnecessarily confusing.As already mentioned, Manfred Huss is the only conductor on record to use the misleading Hob Ia numbers.The booklet does not acknowledge the better-known Hob numbers assigned to the complete operas.Also, the booklet should have credited H.C. Robbins Landon for coming up with the idea that the Symphony Hob I:106 was actually the overture to ""Le Pescatrici"".And the identification of the three German opera overtures is pretty sketchy.Unfortunately the Hoboken Catalog  is also a bit of a mess, and 'The Oxford Composer Companion to Haydn' doesn't help.Hob XXIX lists six works as ""Marionette and other German operas"" (Esterhazy actually had an elaborate puppet theater).""Philemon und Baucis"" and ""Feuersbrunst"" are listed,but not ""Der Gotterrath"" which, as explained above uses the first movement of Symphony 50 in C Major for an overture.The booklet notes make no mention of this.Messy. But still nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQX537O102MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UWOJAY#wasThisHelpful","RIQX537O102MI","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This box is the second time the series has been released on DVD.Contents are identical to the 2006 release on the A&E label. *Order whichever version is cheapest (usually this one).The box under review was actually manufactured in Australia, but don't worry - it is region-free NTSC, which means it is compatible with all North American DVD players and televisions.Eight DVDs in four standard-size double-DVD plastic cases; all in a cardboard slipcase.CONTENTS:- The 2000 pilot ""Golden Spiders"" (90 minutes)+ Season One (2001) complete = Eight episodes (four are double-length)+ Season Two (2002) complete = Twelve episodes (four are double-length)+ Bonus: ""The Making of Nero Wolfe"", a 22 minute introduction to the series (2001)(see end of this review for the titles of each episode)HOW TO VIEW THIS SERIES:-- Step One: Insert DVD number 8 (Volume 4, Disc 2) into your player.Watch the pilot: ""Golden Spiders"".-- Step Two: Watch the 22 minute bonus ""The Making of Nero Wolfe"" (also on DVD 8), an excellent introduction to the remaining episodes in the series (no spoilers).-- Step Three: Watch DVDs 1 through 7 in that order. When you come to DVD 7, you have a choice of aspect ratio for watching ""The Silent Speaker"" -The series is presented in the 4:3 aspect ration which was standard for televisions in 2001.Apparently it was also filmed in the wide-screen aspect ratio of 16:9, common to modern televisions.But only one episode is presented in wide-screen, ""The Silent Speaker"" on DVD 8.""The Silent Speaker"" can also viewed in the old 4:3 format on DVD 7.If you have a modern TV set, by all means view it in wide-screen on DVD 8.The pilot, ""Golden Spiders"", is rated M for Mature audiences, because of violence (Archie Goodwin actually tortures one of the bad guys to make him talk).It is the best film in the series, and darker than the rest.The remaining episodes (rated PG for Parental Guidance) are a bit flippant in tone, almost campy at times, but still rewarding for mystery buffs.[a surprising number of Wolfe's clients are murdered after hiring him - seems like this would be bad for business.]With Maury Chaykin as Nero Wolfe, and Timothy Hutton as Archie Goodwin,this TV series was originally produced by the cable network A&E.Hard to believe,A&E has gone down-market considerably since then.Back in 2000 they spent a lot of money and produced a quality product.Set in 1950's New York, it was filmed in Toronto.No problem. 2001 Toronto looked a lot like 1955 New York. Beautiful cinematography, sets, automobiles and costumes.SUBTITLES?Not actual subtitles, but the DVDs are closed-captioned in English.Closed-Captioning is activated while the disc is playing by pressing a button on your TV's remote.""Subtitling"" is activated by pressing a button on your DVD player's remote.""Closed-Captioning"" is obsolete, but it's better than nothing.Unfortunately closed captioning will not work if your DVD player is connected to the TV using the preferred modern method of HDMI cable.You have to use the three-cable (red-white-yellow) method to connect your player to the TV.[a lot of the less expensive DVD players do not even give you the option of a three-cable output - one tip: DVD/VCR combo players always include a three-cable output.](old-fashioned coaxial cable also will work with closed captioning)The remastering on these DVDs is pretty old, but looks gorgeous.I think they would look even better on blu-ray, with everything in 16:9 widescreen.Whenever it is released on blu-ray, I hope we will have subtitles instead of closed captioning.* Earlier A&E DVD release: Nero Wolfe: The Complete Classic Whodunit Series (this is usually more expensive, though the contents are identical - including the bonus feature)The A&E version is also available in separate volumes for Seasons 1 and 2, but that is really expensive.------------------------------------------------------------CONTENTS:Pilot (2000)- The Golden Spiders *Season 1 (2001):- The Doorbell Rang *- Champagne for One *- Prisoner's Base *- Eeny Meeny Murder Moe- Disguise for Murder- Door to Death- Christmas Party- Over My Dead Body *Season 2 (2002):- Death of a Doxy *- The Next Witness- Die Like a Dog- Murder Is Corny- Motherhunt *- Poison Ã  la Carte- Too Many Clients *- Before I Die- Help Wanted, Male- The Silent Speaker *- Cop Killer- Immune to Murder* 90 minute episodes, the rest are 45 minutes long (give or take a minute)-----------------------------------------------------------------------P.S. An earlier ""Nero Wolfe"" series (14 episodes) aired on NBC in 1981 starring William Conrad  as Nero Wolfe.It was preceded by a 1977 pilot starring Thayer David who passed away before filming on the series started.Neither is commercially available at the present time,nor are the two movies that Columbia Pictures made in the 1930s:- ""Meet Nero Wolfe"" (1936) starring Edward Arnold- ""The League of Frightened Men"" (1937) starring Walter Connolly(but see my comment dated March 19)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R276NH5WLBQ7SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DM8LFZ6#wasThisHelpful","R276NH5WLBQ7SW","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a teenager living near Chicago in the 1960s.I listened to Jean Martinon a lot - at least on radio station WFMT's Thursday night boadcasts.He was Music Director of the Chicago Symphony for five mostly unhappy years.For details, see my review of Jean Martinon - The Complete Cso RecordingsJean Martinon (1910-1976) was in charge of four of the world's great orchestras, and left recordings with each of them:- Lamoureux Orchestra of Paris, 1951-1957 (Philips, DG)- Israel Philharmonic, 1957-1959 (Decca)- Chicago Symphony, 1964-1968 (RCA)- O.R.T.F (French National Radio & Television Orchestra), 1969-1973 (DG, EMI, Erato, Vox)JEAN MARTINON: THE DEUTSCHE GRAMMOPHON LEGACYFour CDs in a standard plastic case with 12 page booklet.Everything but the Ginastera Harp Concerto has previously been issued on CD.The pre-Chicago period is represented by a 1960 recording of Cello Concertos played by Pierre Fournier (Lalo, Saint-Saens, Bruch).This was Martinon's last recording with the Lamoureux Orchestra of Paris.Post-Chicago, Martinon's primary orchestra was the ""Orchestre national de l'Office de radiodiffusion-télévision française""  (whew).Better known as  the O.R.T.F., the orchestra of France's National Broadcasting Corporation.The Bizet and Lalo orchestral works were recorded with the O.R.T.F, plus a collection of Twentieth Century Harp Concertos played by Nicanor Zabaleta (Ginastera, Saint-Saens, Tailleferre).Martinon made many more recordings with this orchestra, for EMI, Erato and Vox, in particular an invaluable series of Twentieth Century French music.[the 1969 DG recording of Martinon's Violin Concerto is conducted by Rafael Kubelik, and has already been issued in a box of that conductor's recordings.]These are Martinon's only recordings of:Bizet: La jolie fille de Perth Suite // Lalo: Rapsodie norvegienne // Cello Concertos by Lalo, Saint-Saens and Bruch // Harp Concertos by Ginastera, Saint-Saens and Tailleferreand his only stereo recording of:Lalo: Namouona Suites 1 & 2-----------------------------------------------------------------I haven't been able to locate a discography of Jean Martinon on the internet, so I thought I'd create one.Limited to CD reissues.[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]DECCA: Complete Decca Recordings 1951 - 1960 issued in 2006 (deleted and insanely expensive), or reissued as individual CDs on Eloquence - five different orchestras, mono and stereoPHILIPS/ELOQUENCE: The Philips Legacy , 1953-1956 Lamoureux Orchestra - monoDG/ELOQUENCE: ""The Deutsche Grammophon Legacy"" (the box under review) , 1960 and 1969-1971 Lamoureux Orchestra and O.R.T.F. - stereoSONY (RCA): Jean Martinon - The Complete Cso Recordings , 1964-1968 Chicago Symphony - stereoWARNER (EMI/HMV and ERATO): ICON - The late years (14CD)(the EMI Debussy, Ravel and Saint-Saens are not in this box, but are available separately)VOX: Prokofiev Symphonies and Overtures, 1971 O.R.T.F. - stereo----------------------------------------------------------Adam:- Giselle: highlights - 1959 Paris Conservatoire (DECCA)- Si j'Etais Roi Overture - 1951 London Philharmonic, mono (DECCA)Bartok:- Miraculous Mandarin Suite - 1967 Chicago (SONY) +1971  O.R.T.F.

"I was a teenager living near Chicago in the 1960s.I listened to Jean Martinon a lot - at least on radio station WFMT's Thursday night boadcasts.He was Music Director of the Chicago Symphony for five mostly unhappy years.For details, see my review of Jean Martinon - The Complete Cso RecordingsJean Martinon (1910-1976) was in charge of four of the world's great orchestras, and left recordings with each of them:- Lamoureux Orchestra of Paris, 1951-1957 (Philips, DG)- Israel Philharmonic, 1957-1959 (Decca)- Chicago Symphony, 1964-1968 (RCA)- O.R.T.F (French National Radio & Television Orchestra), 1969-1973 (DG, EMI, Erato, Vox)JEAN MARTINON: THE PHILIPS LEGACYThese are mono recordings, 1953-56 with the Lamoureux Orchetra of Paris.Three CDs in a standard plastic case with 16 page booklet.Martinon was Music Director of L' Orchestre des Concerts Lamoureux from 1951-1957, his first important appointment (the orchestra was founded in 1881 in by Charles Lamoureux).These are Martinon's only recordings of:Dukas: Sorcerer's Apprentice // Falla: El Amor Brujo + Noches en los jardines de Espana // Faure: Pavane // Mozart: Symphonies 31,32,33 // Prokofiev: Love for Three Oranges Suite.Martinon re-made the remaining half of the contents of this box in 1970s stereo with the O.R.T.F. (French Radio & Television Orchestra), a better orchestra than Lamoureux, though less distinctively ""French"" sounding.French orchestras used to have a distinctive sound: Woodwinds were ""nasal"" (according to critics) and horns sounded like saxophones.The Lamoureux Orchestra of the 1950s was basically a virtuoso ensemble with slightly odd-sounding winds.Russian orchestras were influenced by the French, but England and America adopted the German sound, which has come to be the international standard.French composers of the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries expected an orchestra to sound like this (Lamoureux gave the premiere of Debussy's La Mer in 1905).Martinon's successor, Igor Markevitch. maintained the Lamoureux's high standards in a series of stereo recordings for DG.In the mid-sixties, there was a reorganization of Paris orchestras, recruiting the best players from French and international orchestras to create the ""Orchestre de Paris"" (music directors Charles Munch and Herbert von Karajan).This depleted the Lamoureux Orchestra (the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra went away completely).Only the Orchestre de Paris and the O.R.T.F. (now called ""Orchestre national de France"") remain in the big leagues.Nowadays all orchestras sound the same.Progress.-----------------------------------------------------------------I haven't been able to locate a discography of Jean Martinon on the internet, so I thought I'd create one.Limited to CD reissues.[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]DECCA: Complete Decca Recordings 1951 - 1960 issued in 2006 (deleted and insanely expensive), or reissued as individual CDs on Eloquence - five different orchestras, mono and stereoPHILIPS/ELOQUENCE: ""The Philips Legacy"" (the box under review), 1953-1956 Lamoureux Orchestra - monoDG/ELOQUENCE: Jean Martinon: The Complete Deutsche Grammophon Recordings 1 , 1960 and 1969-1971 Lamoureux Orchestra and O.R.T.F. - stereoSONY (RCA): Jean Martinon - The Complete Cso Recordings , 1964-1968 Chicago Symphony - stereoWARNER (EMI/HMV and ERATO): ICON - The late years (14CD)(the EMI Debussy, Ravel and Saint-Saens are not in this box, but are available separately)VOX: Prokofiev Symphonies and Overtures, 1971 O.R.T.F. - stereo----------------------------------------------------------Adam:- Giselle: highlights - 1959 Paris Conservatoire (DECCA)- Si j'Etais Roi Overture - 1951 London Philharmonic, mono (DECCA)Bartok:- Miraculous Mandarin Suite - 1967 Chicago (SONY) +1971  O.R.T.F.

"All of Sviatoslav Richter's recordings for Deutsche Grammophon, RCA, Columbia, EMI, Philips, Decca and Teldec have been released in four inexpensive mega-boxes.I thought it would be useful to prepare a combined index to the material.After a false start due to World War II, Richter's public career lasted fifty years - until his final concert in 1995.The first fifteen were spent behind the Iron Curtain - It wasn't until 1960 that he was allowed to visit the West.Once the dam had broken, Western companies rushed in to record Richter.[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]-- Deutsche Grammophon was first: They actually jumped the gun by sending DG engineers to Prague in 1956 and Warsaw in 1958.-- In 1960, RCA and Columbia documented Richter's first North American tour:Thirteen CDs recorded over a ten week period. The most thorough documentation we have of Sviatoslav Richter in his absolute prime (seven recitals were recorded in their entirety).For the bizarre story of that tour, see my review of Complete Album Collection-- In 1961, Richter visited London - Philips recorded him in the Liszt Concertos, and EMI recorded him at their Abbey Road Studios.-- Decca waited until 1970, though later on they issued some 1960's recordings from Benjamin Britten's Aldeburgh Festival.-- Teldec made a few very late recordings with Richter in 1993-1994 (he retired in 1995).  Bach, Mozart and Schumann - all new to his recorded repertoire.Decca, Philips and Deutsche Grammophon are now owned by Universal = this review, 51 CDs (DECCA BOX)RCA and Columbia are owned by SONY = 18 CDs Complete Album CollectionEMI is owned by WARNER = 14 CDs Icon: Sviatoslav Richter (first edition was on the EMI label)TELDEC is owned by Warner, but their box is still on the TELDEC label = The Teldec RecordingsBACH:Well-Tempered Klavier Book 1 No.1,4,5,6,8 = 1962 Florence (DECCA BOX cd 26)English Suites 3,4,6 = 1991 Rolandseck (DECCA BOX cd 1)French Suites 2,4,6 = 1991 Rolandseck (DECCA BOX cd 2)Duetti BWV802-805 = 1991 Neumarkt (DECCA BOX cd 3)Fantasia BWV906 = 1991 Neumarkt (DECCA BOX cd 2)French Overture BWV831 = 1991 Rolandseck (DECCA BOX cd 3)Italian Concerto BWV 971 = 1991 Neumarkt (DECCA BOX cd 3)Toccata BWV913 = 1991 Neumarkt (DECCA BOX cd 2)Toccata BWV916 = 1991 Neumarkt (DECCA BOX cd 2)Concerto BWV1054 = 1993 Bashmet, Orchestra di Padova e del Venuto (TELDEC cd 1)Concerto BWV1058 = 1993 Bashmet, Orchestra di Padova e del Venuto (TELDEC cd 1)BARTOK:Burlesques Op.8c (BB55) = 1989 Vienna and London, two performances (DECCA BOX cd 32,33)Sonata for 2 Pianos and Percussion with Lobanov, Barkov, Snegirev = 1985 Tours (DECCA BOX cd 41)Concerto 2 = 1969 Maazel, Orchestre de Paris (WARNER cd 12)BEETHOVEN:Sonata 1 --- 1976 Tours (WARNER cd 1)Sonata 3 --- 1960 Carnegie Hall (SONY cd 2)Sonata 7 --- 1960 Carnegie Hall (SONY cd 8) + 1976 Tours (WARNER cd 1)Sonata 9 --- 1960 Carnegie Hall (SONY cd 2) + 1963 Paris (DECCA BOX cd 12)Sonata 10 = 1963 Paris (DECCA BOX cd 44)Sonata 11 = 1963 Paris (DECCA BOX cd 12)Sonata 12 = 1960 Carnegie Hall and studio recording (SONY cd 2,12) + 1966 Ferrara (DECCA BOX cd 12)Sonata 17 = 1961 London studio recording (WARNER cd 1)Sonata 18 = 1992 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 13)Sonata 19 = 1963 Paris (DECCA BOX cd 44) + 1992 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 10)Sonata 20 = 1963 Paris (DECCA BOX cd 44) + 1992 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 10)Sonata 22 = 1960 Carnegie Hall and studio recording (SONY cd 3,11) + 1992 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 10)Sonata 23 = 1960 Carnegie Hall and studio recording (SONY cd 3,11) + 1992 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 10)Sonata 27 = 1965 Salzburg (DECCA BOX cd 12)Sonata 28 = 1986 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 13)Sonata 30 = 1991 Stuttgart (DECCA BOX cd 11)Sonata 31 = 1991 Stuttgart (DECCA BOX cd 11)Sonata 32 = 1991 Stuttgart (DECCA BOX cd 11)Andante favori WoO 57 = 1977 London (WARNER cd 1)Diabelli Variations = 1986 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 14)Rondos Op.51 = 1986 Amsterdam (DECCA BOX cd 13)Cello Sonatas complete with Mstislav Rostropovich, cello = 1961-63 studio recording (DECCA BOX cd 35,36)Violin Sonatas 4,5 with Oleg Kagan, violin = 1976 Munich (WARNER cd 4,10)Piano Trio Op.97 ""Archduke"" with Kopelman, Berlinsky = 1992 Moscow (DECCA BOX cd 37)Piano and Wind Quintet Op.16 with Moragues Wind Quintet members = 1992 Moscow (DECCA BOX cd 37)Concerto 1 = 1960 Munch, Boston Symphony (SONY cd 11),----------------- 1988 Eschenbach, Schleswig-Holstein Festival Orchestra (SONY cd 18)Concerto 3 = 1962 Sanderling, Vienna Symphony (DECCA BOX cd 42),----------------- 1977 Muti, Philharmonia (WARNER cd 9)Rondo for Piano and Orchestra WoO 6 = 1962 Sanderling, Vienna Symphony (DECCA BOX cd 42)Triple Concerto = 1969 with Oistrakh, Rostropovich/ Karajan, Berlin Philharmonic (WARNER cd 10)BERG:Chamber Concerto = 1977 with Oleg Kagan/ Nikolayevsky, Moscow Ensemble -

Unreadable.-- CDs 1-25 and 29-32 are arranged in roughly chronological order (Bach through Shostakovich).CD 33 is a jumble of composers, in recordings made between 1966 and 1989.CD 34 is the famous 1958 Sofia, Bulgaria recital.CDs 26,27 and 28 are miscellanies that reproduce the contents of three DG LPs from the 1960s.Why not a straight chronological arrangement on CDs 1-33, and the Sofia concert on CD 34?-- For some reason, six solo piano works (Beethoven Sonatas 10, 19, 20, Liszt's Funerailles, Ave Maria, and Harmonies poetiques et religieuses) are distributed among ""Chamber Music"" (CD 40) and ""Concertos"" (CDs 43 and 44).-- Typographical Errors in the ""Decca, Philips and DG"" booklet:- page 9: Prokofiev Visions fugitives (CD 30) should be recorded 1979 not 1993- pages 9 and 69: The Rachmaninov Prelude (CDs 26 and 34) should be Op.32 No.12, not Op.32 No.13- page 10: Schubert Sonatas D575, D840 and D894 (CDs 15 and 16) are numbered as 11, 17 and 20.

"In the 1950s, Russian pianist Sviatoslav Richter was an almost mythical figure to music lovers in the West.He was was forbidden to travel beyond the Iron Curtain.Beginning in 1956, Deutsche Grammophon sent engineers to Prague and Warsaw to record Richter in improved sound,but the pianist's big breakthrough didn't really come until 1960, when Soviet authorities finally allowed him to visit the West.Between October 15 and December 28, Sviatoslav Richter embarked on an extended concert tour of the United States and Canada.Thirty concerts in 75 days. Fifteen cities.The two dominant American record companies, RCA and Columbia, each expressed an interest in recording Richter during his American tour.First stop was Chicago where he performed Brahms 2nd Piano Concerto with Erich Leinsdorf and the Chicago Symphony on October 15, 1960.Two days later it was recorded by RCA, which signed the pianist to a three LP contract.Next stop was New York City and Carnegie Hall, where he embarked on a marathon of five recitals in twelve days,October 19-30 (interrupted for a concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra on the 21st).Six concerts in twelve days is actually something of a stunt, but it certainly caught the attention of the New York press.[would any living pianist dare something like this?]The recitals were not broadcast, but back then Carnegie Hall routinely recorded performances for the personal use of the artist, using their in-house microphone system, which unfortunately dated back to the 1940s (medium-fi mono, obsolete by 1960).Columbia Records saw their opportunity, and negotiated a deal with Carnegie Hall and someone in the Soviet Ministry of Culture, allowing them to issue these taped recitals on LP.Consequently all five recitals were released on ten mono LPs by Columbia Records.RCA threatened legal action, claiming that Richter had signed an exclusive contract with them - at least for the American tour.RCA convinced the pianist to sign a letter demanding that the Columbia LPs be taken off the market.Columbia agreed to the recall and destroyed their inventory.[the account in the booklet paints Columbia Records as the innocent victim of Russian perfidy.]For 55 years, the few surviving LPs have commanded astronomical prices on the used record market.The continued non-availability of the Carnegie Hall recitals has created a mystique around them that may or may not be justified.Judge for yourself.This is the most thorough documentation we have of Sviatoslav Richter in his absolute prime.Twelve days of concentrated piano playing.Unedited.In response to popular demand, Richter returned to Carnegie Hall at the end of the tour for three additional concerts:-- On December 18, he appeared with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic (Concertos by Liszt and Tchaikovsky).Unfortunately no recording session (Bernstein was a Columbia artist).-- The December 23 recital, all-Beethoven, was not recorded.-- The December 26 recital was recorded, this time by RCA using their own stereo microphones, plus a repeat program on December 28 across the river in Newark, New Jersey.Highlights from both were issued on a single RCA LP in 1965.The entire December 26 Carnegie Hall recital, plus the encores from December 28, were issued in a 2 CD set in 2005, ""Richter Rediscovered"".The rest of the December 28 recital appears for the first time in this new box.Luckily for us, RCA and Columbia are both now owned by Sony.The Cold War is over.After 55 years, we finally have a complete edition of Richter's 1960 American recordings:Seven public recitals on 13 CDs + 3 CDs worth of studio recordings (2 concertos, 3 sonatas).-- October 17: RCA STUDIO RECORDING (Chicago) = CD 1Brahms Piano Concerto 2 w/ Erich Leinsdorf, Chicago Symphony-- October 19: Carnegie Hall recital = CD 2+3Beethoven: Piano Sonatas No. 3, 9, 12, 22, 23 // Schubert: Impromptu Op.90, No.4 // Schumann: Fantasiestücke Op.12, No.2: Aufschwung // Chopin: Etudes Op.10, No.1 and 12-- October 21: [Concert with Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra (Concertos by Dvorak and Brahms).

Perhaps Richter was in a bad mood on the 30th.You'd never guess from the evidence on this CD.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOUND QUALITY and PACKAGING:11 of the 13 CDs devoted to the 1960 recitals have been newly mastered at 24bit/96kHz by Sony's chief engineer Andreas K. Meyer.- The five October Carnegie Hall recitals, though mono, still sound pretty good. Better than I had expected.There is not a lot of high frequency information on these tapes, but low and mid-range reproduce well.I don't know how much high frequency information there was on the original tapes.They have always had a bad reputation.It was still a pleasant listening experience, once you get used to it.- Meyer also mastered the December 28 Newark recital.- The December 26 Carnegie Hall recital is the same Marion Conaty remastering used for ""Richter Re-Discovered"" (24bit/96kHz)No complaints.-- If you're concerned about the sound of the October Carnegie Hall recordings, try Disc 9, Track 12 in the free audio samples on Amazon's digital music page (or Disc 7, track 3 for some quiet playing):Sviatoslav Richter - The Complete Album Collection.Studio recordings: Brahms 2nd Piano Concerto is a new 24bit/96kHz remastering by Andreas K. Meyer (at least the third time it has been remastered for CD).Beethoven's 1st Piano Concerto and Piano Sonatas 12, 22 and 23 are XRCD remasterings by Kazuie Sugimoto of Sony Japan (they previously sold for $30/disc in North America).Everything sounds wonderful to me. The piano in the Sonatas is a bit clangy, but that's an accurate reproduction of Richter's Steinway.I may not be the best judge of sound - my ears are 65 years old (as is the rest of me).""Original jacket"" mini-LP format. Original cover art with program notes on the back.Everything comes packaged in an attractive rigid cardboard box.56 page booklet with essay by Jed Distler.My only complaint is the lack of an index to the music on these CDs.Sony used to get a lot of complaints about the difficulty of removing CDs from their two-CD cardboard jackets.They must have listened, because this time two-LP sets are packaged as two single CDs with identical covers.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------After the 1960 North American tour, Richter's next Western appearance was another five-concert marathon, this time in London, July 8-18, 1961.Some, but not all of this has been released on BBC Classics.Unfortunately not in a systematic fashion.Nearly all of Sviatoslav Richter's public recitals were recorded- Authorized or not.He is the most pirated pianist in recorded history.There is an enormous data base of recordings:From 1960 alone, there are five recordings of Chopin's Etude Op.10, No.1 in C to choose from:Prague, Bucharest, Kiev, Moscow and New York.I will not attempt a comparative analysis of Richter's recordings.Way beyond my capabilities, and life is too short.I do think this box is one of the best ideas that Sony has ever come up with.And it doesn't even cost a lot.-------------------------------------------------------------------POINTS OF INTEREST:-- As someone will no doubt point out, the 75 day U.S tour was not actually Richter's first appearance outside the Communist Bloc:Between May 10 and 15, 1960, he gave three recitals in Finland.I don't think they were recorded.-- If the five October Carnegie Hall recitals seem to have had noisier audiences than the December 26 recital, blame the microphones.On December 26, RCA used directional microphones, more sophisticated than Carnegie's in-house microphone system that picked up everything indiscriminately.-- The account of the LP release of the Carnegie Hall recitals in the the Sony booklet goes into some detail.It looks bad for Schuyler Chapin of Columbia Records:Chapin asked the representative of MK (the Soviet Cultural Bureau) if this agreement had Richter's approval.Soon after he received a telegram from Richter confirming his OK.But the telegram was sent from Washington D.C at a time when Richter was in New York.Apparently Chapin never made an attempt to contact Richter personally, relying on intermediaries.-- re the October 30 Carnegie Hall recital: the fine print on page 44 of the booklet reads: ""Original LPs: ML6065/6 in set M2L312 (release cancelled)""If the release had not been cancelled, I hope they would have corrected the glaring typographical error on the album cover: Schumann's Fantasia in C, Op.17 is credited to Schubert.The actual first LP release was in Japan in 1979.-- The December 28 recital was given in the ""Mosque Theater"" in Newark, New Jersey.No - It's not a real mosque. No connection to Islam.The Mosque Theater (original name ""Salaam Temple"") was a 3500 seat auditorium built in 1925 by the ""Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine"", better known as the Shriners.Still in use as an auditorium - renamed as ""Newark Symphony Hall"" so as not to offend.The Shriners are a North American charitable fraternity (related to the Masons) founded in 1870.They run children's hospitals and drive tiny cars while wearing red fezzes.In the early years of the Twentieth Century, they built a lot of auditoriums.In addition to the Mosque Theater in Newark, they built the 3700 seat ""Syria Mosque"" in Pittsburgh (1911-1991 R.I.P.) and the 4200 seat Medinah Temple in Chicago (famous as a recording venue for the Chicago Symphony), built in 1912 and still standing, though the interior has been gutted and is now home to Bloomingdale's Department Store.-- The October Carnegie Hall recitals were previously released on CD by the small Canadian label Doremi, but they were copied from commercial Columbia LP pressings, not the master tapes to which Sony has access.-- Sony's booklet claims that five selections are previously unreleased.In fact, four were omitted from the Columbia LPs (and Doremi CDs), and are appearing here for the first time:- Chopin: Etude Op.10, No. 12 in C Minor ""Revolutionary"" -- October 19- Debussy: Images Book II, No.1 - Cloches a travers les feuilles -- October 28- Prokofiev: Sonata 8, Op.84, finale encored -- October 23- Schumann: Novelettes Op.21, No.1, 2, 8 -- October 28See my comment dated January 24 for details.------------------------------------------------------------------------------LATE RECORDINGS:The 1960 Sviatoslav Richter was a far more fiery and risk-taking pianist than the mature Richter many of us have grown accustomed to.Tremendously exciting.As a bonus, the Sony box has two CDs of the mature Richter in concert at the 1988 Schleswig-Holstein Festival (previously released), plus some Schubert pieces recorded in concert at the Aldeburgh Festival.CD 17 = Aldeburgh, 1977 (first CD release)Schubert: Scherzo in D-flat D.593 / Andante in A D.604 / Four Landler D.366CD 17+18 = Schleswig-Holstein, 1988Beethoven: Piano Concerto 1 w/ Christoph Eschenbach, Schleswig-Holstein Festival Orchestra // Brahms: Sonata 1 // Chopin: Etudes Op.10, No. 1-4,6,11,12 // Liszt: Etudes d'exécution - Harmonies du Soir / Hungarian Rghapsody 17 / Scherzo & MarchThe 1977 Aldeburgh Festival recordings on CD 17 were last seen on a CBS Masterworks 3 LP set sponsored by cigarette manufacturer Benson & Hedges (no engineer is credited).The 1988 Schleswig-Holstein Festival recordings on CDs 17 and 18 appear to be straight reissues of the 1993 CD remasterings (no engineer is credited).-- Missing from the Sony box is the early '70s studio recording of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier that RCA issued on 4 CDs in 1992: Well-Tempered Clavier, The (Richter)It was not an original RCA production, but was licensed from Melodiya.----------------------------------------------------------------------ALPHABETICAL INDEX TO THE SONY BOX:BEETHOVEN:Sonata 3 -- 1960 Carnegie Hall (SONY cd 2)Sonata 7 -- 1960 Carnegie Hall (SONY cd 8)Sonata 9 -- 1960 Carnegie Hall (SONY cd 2)Sonata 12 -

"I recently watched the documentary ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" on my local PBS station - It's in this box.I had almost forgotten how good Bing Crosby was.This is a nice collection of 24 Bing Crosby musicals, produced by Paramount Pictures between 1933 and 1949.Paramount musicals were not ""All-Singing, All-Dancing Spectaculars"".Unlike the competition:-- Warner: Busby Berkley-- RKO: Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers-- MGM: Broadway Melody seriesBing Crosby's musicals were more laid-back productions, a reflection of Crosby's personality.They are basically comedies or melodramas interrupted by a few songs.Very little in the way of dancing.There are no big production numbers for movie fans to wallow in.The closest any of these 24 Bing Crosby films came to a big production number was ""Puttin on the Ritz"" in 'Blue Skies', and it's a Fred Astaire solo.More typical is the performance of ""Pocketful of Dreams"" in 'Sing You Sinners' -  with Bing, Fred MacMurray and twelve year-old Donald O'Connor.Wonderful song.Plus a little dance and a lot of fooling around (Bing chews gum while lip-synching to the pre-recorded music track). - see chapter 3 on the 'Sing You Sinners' DVD.Warner, MGM and RKO musicals had a standard ensemble of players, but Crosby's Paramount films went through a changing line-up of musical comedy co-stars:- George Burns and Gracie Allen in ""College Humor"" and ""We're Not Dressing""- Ethel Merman in ""We're Not Dressing""- W.C. Fields in ""Mississippi""- Martha Raye in ""Rhythm on the Range"", ""Waikiki Wedding"" and ""Double or Nothing""- Shirley Ross in ""Waikiki Wedding""- Donald O'Connor (age 12) in ""Sing You Sinners""- Gloria Jean (age 13) in ""If I had My Way""- Fred Astaire in ""Holiday Inn"" and ""Blue Skies""- Betty Hutton (playing twins) in ""Here Come the Waves""- Mary Martin in ""Birth of the Blues"" and ""Rhythm on the River""- Basil Rathbone (yes!) in ""Rhythm on the River""[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]It wasn't until 1940 that Bing Crosby finally found his ideal co-star in Bob Hope: ""The Road to Singapore"", followed by many more.I don't usually think of the Hope-Crosby 'Road' pictures as musicals, but there are a lot of great songs in them.Together Hope and Crosby made six 'Road' pictures for Paramount (four are in this box), plus a seventh for MGM.For the confusing history of these movies on DVD, see my review of:The Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Road to Comedy Collection-- The only movie in this box given the deluxe treatment is ""Holiday Inn"" (1941), which comes with a commentary track and a 45 minute documentary about Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby.Hit songs: ""White Christmas"", ""Happy Holidays"" (for New Year's Eve) and ""Easter Parade"" - sung by Crosby, seven years before Astaire sang it in ""Easter Parade"").Directed by Mark Sandrich, who was responsible for many of the Fred Astaire / Ginger Rogers films at RKO.In ""Be Careful, It's My Heart"", Fred Astaire's first dance number with Marjorie Reynolds, her resemblance to Ginger Rogers is amazing.It's available on a separate blu-ray that includes a colorized version of the film + the black and white original.This new 13 DVD collection contains only the black and white original (which looks fine).Colorized Blu-Ray: Holiday Inn (Blu-ray with DIGITAL HD)-- All these movies have have already been released on DVD, some in earlier budget boxes.No films were newly transferred from the original negatives for this new box, but I have no real complaint about the picture quality.-- All 24 movies have English subtitles.The 90 minute documentary ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" does not have subtitles even though the fine print on the box claims it does.The 45 minute documentary included with ""Holiday Inn"" does not have subtitles (the box does not claim that it does).The single disc version of ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" DOES have English subtitles: American Masters: Bing Crosby - Rediscovered-- ""Mississippi"" ((1935) has a score by Rodgers and Hart""Holiday Inn"" (1942) and ""Blue Skies"" (1946) have scores by Irving Berlin (two of his best)-- Shirley Ross was one of my favorite singers .  Her brief film career featured wonderful duets opposite both Crosby and Hope:""Blue Hawaii"" with Bing Crosby in ""Waikiki Wedding"" (1937)""Thanks for the Memory"" with Bob Hope in ""Big Broadcast of 1938""""Two Sleepy People"" with Bob Hope in ""Thanks for the Memory"" (1938)-- Twelve year-old Donald O'Connor (still a boy soprano) plays Bing's kid brother in ""Sing You Sinners"" (1938)[fourteen years before ""Singing in the Rain""]Fred MacMurray (five years younger than Bing) plays his older brother.--  Thirteen year-old Gloria Jean plays Bing's adopted daughter in ""If I had My Way"" (1940). The following year she played W.C. Field's niece in ""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"".-- The four ""Road"" pictures include  a 15 minute mini-documentary on the Road pictures, plus brief extras that concentrate on Bob Hope's work entertaining the troops in World War II.-- Bing Crosby has only a small part in ""Variety Girl"" (1947) - a duet with Bob Hope.The plot is about two starlets trying to get a screen test with Paramount Pictures - Star Trek's DeForest Kelley (age 27) is the romantic lead.Thirty Paramount stars (and directors) play themselves in cameos.Hope and Crosby's regular co-star Dorothy Lamour is in it, but in this film she sings a duet with with Alan Ladd.-- ""Emperor Waltz"" (1948) has a score by Johann Strauss ed. Victor Young.Written and directed by Billy Wilder (just after ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Lost Weekend"").In later years he was embarrassed by it - Schmaltzy, but it's not bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXAJJU20M865/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1S7O48#wasThisHelpful","RBXAJJU20M865","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"----------- PROBLEM DISCOVERED ----------------------------65 Days after posting this review, I discovered a serious problem with the Monteux box.Not fatal, but not good.Three of the four D'Indy compositions are transferred at the wrong speed and are pitched flat (only the Istar Variations on CD 4 in the new box is pitched correctly).The problem dates back to the 1994 Monteux Edition on RCA.Volume 9 had three works of D'Indy.The original 1994 pressing (1994a) was mastered at the wrong speed  (matrix number on the inner ring of the disc = 3/94).RCA detected the problem and issued a corrected version (1994b) (matrix number on the inner ring = 10/94).Sony has both matrixes in their vault, and unfortunately chose the wrong one for the 2014 box.These works are spread among three discs in the new collection.CD 1 has Symphony on a French Mountain Air:1994a (in 2014 box) = 25:01 (11:07, 6:17, 7:37) pitched flat - My stopwatch timings1994b (corrected) === 23:39 (10:30, 5:56, 7:13) correct pitchCD2 has Symphony 2:1994a (in 2014 box) = 42:12 (11:45, 11:36, 5:16, 13:35) pitched flat1994b (corrected) === 40:44 (11:07, 10:57, 4:59, 12:51) correct pitch (B flat)CD 5 has the Fervaal Prelude:1994a (in 2014 box) = 5:00 pitched flat1994b (corrected) === 4:43 correct pitchSony has no plans to remaster CDs 1, 2 and 5.Still a five star box, but this is extremely frustrating:"" When creating this set, we were obviously not aware that our predecessors at BMG/RCA released CD No. 09026618882 in two differently pitched versions.The current Pierre Monteux edition apparently uses the lower pitched European version of Vol. 9, no. 09026618882 of the 1994 Monteux Edition,as source for CDs nos. 1, 2 and 5 in the current set.A higher pitched version of CD 09026618882 was made available in the US and is still available throughhttp://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=143102In that context there are no plans to reissue CDs nos. 1, 2, and 5 of the current Monteux set.With all best wishes,Sony Classical International ""Both versions of the original 1994 CD are on the market with the same Amazon Stock index number: Vincent d'Indy: Symphony on a French Mountain Air; Symphony No. 2; Fervaal PreludeThe back inlay card of the faulty version (3/94) lists a total timing of 42:31 for Symphony 2.The back inlay card of the corrected version (10/94) lists a total timing of 40:12 for Symphony 2.Or you can purchase a guaranteed correctly-pitched reissue of the 1994 CD from Archive Music:http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=143102-----------------------------------------------------------------------My original review:""Let me state here that Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened The Rite or looked for his own glory in it, and that he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity.""- composer, quoted in Robert Craft, 'Conversations with Igor Stravinsky' (1959)Pierre Monteux was present at the birth of more Twentieth Century Classics than any other musician.He played in the orchestra at the premieres of:- Debussy: `Pelleas et Melisande' (1902)- Stravinsky: `Firebird' ballet (1910).He conducted the premieres of:- Stravinsky:`Petrushka' (1911)- Ravel: `Daphnis et Chloe' (1912)- Ravel: Valses nobles et sentimentales (1912)- Debussy: `Jeux' (1913)- Stravinsky: `Sacre du printemps' (1913) - scene of a famous riot- Stravinsky: `Les rossignol' (1914)- Ravel:  `Tzigane' (1924).- Poulenc: Concerto champetre (1929)- Prokofiev: Symphony 3 (1929)But his favorite ""modern"" composer was Johannes Brahms.In 1895, the 20 year-old Pierre Monteux met the 63 year-old composer and took part in a private recital of his chamber music.-- Also recommended by the World's Foremost Authority on the Music of Johannes Brahms.I am a sucker for Nineteenth Century Conductors who hung around long enough to make modern stereo recordings.Pierre Monteux was born in 1875 and died in 1964, so he qualifies, along with Bruno Walter, Thomas Beecham, Leopold Stokowski and Otto Klemperer.Monteux participated in one of RCA's earliest stereo experiments: The 1953 Delibes Coppelia Suite - in this box.He was based in America from 1916 to 1924 (Metropolitan Opera and Boston Symphony), and returned in 1935 to direct the San Francisco Symphony.All his San Francisco recordings are in this box.22 CDs, recorded 1941 to 1952.Mono, except for two works recorded during a 1960 return visit to the city.After leaving San Francisco, Monteux retired to his wife's family's home in Maine, but continued to give concerts and make recordings as a guest conductor, mostly with the Boston Symphony.--------------- PART ONE: SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONYBach: Christmas Oratorio - Sinfonia (1949)Bach: Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor, orch.

1964LONDON SYMPHONY:Brahms: Violin Concerto in D, Op. 77 with Henryk Szeryng (1959) -- stereoBetween 1956 and 1964, Monteux made a large number of stereo recordings with the London Symphony, Vienna Philharmonic, Amsterdam Concertgebouw and Paris Conservatoire Orchestras.Recorded by Decca, Philips and Westminster.Some Decca titles were released in North America by RCA, but the rights to all but the Brahms Violin Concerto are now owned by Universal, which owes the public a big box of Monteux's European recordings (it would be approximately 20 CDs).The 1961 'Daphnis et Chloe' with the London Symphony is especially recommended.Some Decca titles have recently been issued on Australian Eloquence.--------------- PART FOUR: OPERA, 1955 - 1957Gluck: `Orfeo et Eurydice' with Stevens, Della Casa and Rome Opera (1957 stereo)Verdi: `La Traviata' with Carteri, Valletti, Warren and Rome Opera (1956 mono)But Monteux's best-known opera recording was a joint EMI/RCA project:Massenet's `Manon' with Victoria de los Angeles, recorded in Paris (1955 mono).All rights have reverted to EMI.Currently available on: ManonAfter World War II, Monteux regularly appeared at New York's Metropolitan Opera, where he was typecast as a French specialist (Rudolf Bing wouldn't let him conduct Verdi or Wagner).A 1955 Met broadcast of Offenbach's `Tales of Hoffmann' is in Sony's  Metropolitan Opera Live series: Offenbach: Les Contes d'Hoffmann (Metropolitan Opera) (mono)SOUND QUALITY and PACKAGING:Back in 1994, RCA/BMG issued a 15 CD Pierre Monteux Edition boxed set.That accounts for about two-thirds of the material in this new box (the old box was not an original jacket production so individual CD timings were longer), and about half the remasterings.Sonically, the earliest of the wartime San Francisco recordings are nothing special, but the situation had improved by 1945 (the 1945 Rite of Spring on CD 5 is astonishing).RCA concentrated most of their engineering talent in Boston and New York.This is reflected in the superior sound of Monteux's 1951-1954 mono recordings, made in those two cities.Monteux's 1955-1961 Boston and Chicago stereo recordings (Debussy, Franck, Khachaturian, Saint-Saens, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky) were among the highlights of RCA's ""Living Stereo"" LP catalog, and are still of demonstration quality.The London Symphony recording of the Brahms Concerto with Szeryng was actually produced by Decca Records in 1959.Excellent ""ffrr"" stereo sound.Attention Audiophiles: the 1950 Berlioz Symphonie fantastique, 1950 Franck D Minor Symphony, 1951 Brahms Symphony 2, 1952 Schumann Symphony 4, 1953 Mozart Piano Concerti, 1958 Brahms Violin Concerto and 1959 Tchaikovsky Symphony 4 are XRCD remasterings by Hiromichi Takiguchi of Sony Japan (they previously sold for $30/disc in North America).Hard to believe that the finale of the Symphonie fantastique was recorded 65 years ago.Spectacular.""Original Jacket"" mini-LP format beginning with CD 11 (the 1950 LP reissue of the 1942 Scheherezade).Original cover art with program notes on the back.CDSs 1-10 are 78rpm recordings that were never issued on LP: Plainish jackets with contents printed on the back.Everything comes packaged in an attractive rigid cardboard box.110 page booklet with full discographic information, an index to the recordings, and essay by Monteux biographer John Canarina.Unfortunately no texts or translations for the operas.Inevitable with these bargain boxes, but still sad.Also, for some reason, the 2-CD opera sets get no program notes, just 3 blank pages.Plot summaries for the Brahms, Chausson and Mahler vocal works are reproduced with the original program notes.POINTS OF INTEREST- Delibes: Prelude et Mazurka from Coppelia (CD 26) is RCA's earliest surviving stereo recording - December 2, 1953.- Debussy: La Mer was recorded in stereo on July 19, 1954 but CD 27 presents the entire work in mono as it was issued on LP, aside from a 4:23 fragment in stereo.Explanation in the booklet: ""The entire recording was made in stereo and was edited for release, but the edited tape got lost, with the result that, even though the stereo master of Nocturnes did survive, the coupling was originally issued in mono. The surviving stereo take from La Mer shows the extreme clarity that the two-microphone pickup techniques provided at that time.""The edited tape ""got lost"".Good grief.- Brahms: Alto Rhapsody with Marian Anderson (CD 18), recorded 1950, is conducted by Fritz Reiner.Monteux conducted the singer's first recording of the work (CD 5), recorded in 1945.- Chausson: 'Poème de l'amour et de la mer' with Gladys Swarthout (CD 24), recorded 1952, is conducted by Monteux, but the coupled French song recital is accompanied by pianist George Troville.- Stravinsky: 'Sacre du printemps' Two RCA recordings of 'The Rite of Spring' are included:The 1951 Boston Symphony version (CD 15) is usually regarded as the best of Monteux's four commercial recordings.The 1945 San Francisco version (CD 5) clearly is played by a lesser orchestra, but the sense of strain has its own rewards -In the opening solo the Boston bassoonist, playing in his highest register, makes a beautiful sound;the San Francisco player sounds like he is about to have a stroke (not inappropriate).This is the first CD release of the March 10, 1945 recording of The Rite of Spring(it was only in RCA's catalog for six years before being replaced by the Boston version).It's the most brutal of Monteux's four recordings.I wonder if the date of the recording had anything to do with it?Impressive achievement.Now my preferred 'Sacre du printemps'.- Richard Strauss: Death and Transfiguration (CD 38), recorded 1960.During World War I, shortly after his arrival in neutral America,Pierre Monteux created a mini-scandal in the New York press when he refused to conduct the music of Richard Strauss on the grounds that he was an enemy composer (Monteux had no objection to conducting the work of dead Germans).In December, 1944 Monteux received word that his favorite brother Henri had perished in a Nazi concentration camp.In Henri's memory, he programmed the still-living Richard Strauss' Death and Transfiguration at the next concert.""It shall be my message and my prayer for my brother"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MKXYL4X18P7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAPMAFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3MKXYL4X18P7U","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are not tasteful performances.Big orchestra Mozart with a vengeance.NEW TO CD:- Piano Concerto 20 in D Minor k466 with Maria Isabella De Carli and the International Youth Festival Orchestra of St. Moritz, Switzerland.This is one of Stokowski's rarest studio recordings (1969 stereo).It was not intended for public sale.Only issued on a souvenir LP given to the young musicians who took part in the 1969 Festival.Apparently the idea was to give as many students as possible the opportunity to play under the 87 year-old legend.It sounds like a hundred piece orchestra with doubled winds (tripled? quadrupled?).Tremendously exciting performanceNot much subtlety.Thanks to skilled engineering, the excellent pianist is not drowned out by all this noise.There is no other recording of a Mozart Concerto remotely like it.- Piano Concerto 24 in C Minor k491 with Ezra Rachlin and the Houston Symphony is from a radio broadcast (1960 mono?).Another exciting performance.Another big orchestra, But not quite so insanely large as in the D Minor concerto.The label says ""mono"", but I hear some limited channel separation over headphones.- Overture to ""The Marriage of Figaro"" with the Philadelphia Orchestra is from a radio broadcast (1960 stereo) made during Stokowski's historic return to the orchestra he had led from 1912 to 1940.Decent broadcast stereo.I wonder what music lovers under the age of forty who grew up listening to Mozart conducted by Hogwood, Norrington and Gardiner will make of all this.I loved it.ALREADY RELEASED ON CD:- German Dance k605,No.3 ""Sleigh Ride"" - N.Y. pickup orchestra (1949 mono)- Rondo alla Turca in Stokowski's orchestration  - NBC Symphony (1955 mono)These are the same RCA recordings that have already been issued on CD by Cala - Less conveniently coupled there as fillers for other composer's work.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are the only surviving recordings of these works conducted by Stokowski.In addition, Stokowski recorded five additional Mozart compositions:- Sinfonia Concertante k297b with the Philadelphia Orchestra (1940 mono) Stokowski -- Beethoven: Symphony No. 6; Mozart: Sinfonia Concertante for Winds- Symphony 35 with the New York Philharmonic (1949 mono broadcast) Vaughan Williams: Symphony No. 6 / Tchiakovsky: Romeo and Juliet / Mozart: Symphony No. 35 / Scott: From the Sacred Harp / Weinberger: Polka and Fugue from Schwanda the Bagpiper- Piano Concerto 21 in C k 467 with Dame Myra Hess and the New York Philharmonic (1949 mono broadcast) Myra Hess: Public Performances, 1949 - 1960- Serenade k361 with the American Symphony (1966 stereo) Vivaldi / J.

"Don't forget the video at the top of Amazon's web page.Wow.""Phase 4 Stereo"" was the brainchild of Decca Records (London Records in America).Starting in 1961, the label produced over 300 LPs of ""Easy Listening"" music.Lots of percussion and gimmicky stereo imaging, designed to show off your new home entertainment center.There was also a ""Concert Series"" of 190 LPs devoted to light classical music - Once again, Lots of percussion and gimmicky stereo imaging.At first, Camarata and Stanley Black were borrowed from the ""Easy Listening"" Division.But in 1964, classical music heavyweight Leopold Stokowski was recruited to record Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Scheherezade"" in Phase 4 Stereo with the London Symphony.Not as gimmicky as the early Phase 4 recordings, but more gimmicky than what the classical record buyer was accustomed to.Stokowski went on to record a total of 22 LPs (+ 6 greatest hits anthologies) for Phase 4.Precisely half of them are in this new box, which is cause for complaint.Stokowski deserves an entire box to himself, gathering together all his Decca and Philips recordings from the '60s and '70s.For this Phase 4 box, a token Stokowski CD would have been sufficient- thereby freeing up space for some Phase 4 recordings not yet on CD (see the next five paragraphs).Other heavyweight conductors who recorded for Phase 4:- Antal Dorati: 6 LPs, 5 are in this box  (missing Johann Strauss Waltzes),- Charles Munch: 3 LPs, all are here- Arthur Fiedler : 4 LPs, all are here- Anatole Fistoulari: 2 LPs + a 3 LP set (Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake is here - missing Tchaikovsky Symphony 4 + Brahms Piano Concerto 2 with Ilana Vered)- Erich Leinsdorf: 4 LPs (Mahler and Wagner are here - missing R.Strauss Rosenkavalier Suite + Stravinsky Petrushka & Rite of Spring)- Lorin Maazel: 3 LPs (R.Strauss, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev are here - missing Mussorgsky-Ravel Pictures + Chopin Piano Concerto 1 with Israela Margalit)Lesser-known house conductors Stanley Black, Henry Lewis, Eric Rogers and Robert Sharples are represented, but Phase 4 stalwarts Camarata (14 LPs) and Carlos Paita (6 LPs) were snubbed completely.Stanley Black is represented by 5 CDs, one third of his classical total.House pianists were Ivan Davis and Ilana Vered.Inexplicably absent is the great pianist Rudolph Firkusny who recorded two Beethoven LPs for Phase 4.MOVIE MUSIC:There was a series devoted to film scores.Conducted by Stanley Black (""Film Spectaculars"" Vol. 1-5 - not in this box)and composer Miklos Rozsa (""Ben Hur"" - in this box, but ""Quo Vadis"" is missing).But the most important film recordings were conducted by composer Bernard Herrmann.His own scores and those of others, plus a concert series (Holst's ""Planets"" was a best-seller).Fourteen LPs, but only two are in this box.This is the biggest disappointment.Included: ""Music for Alfred Hitchcock Thrillers"", plus Science Fiction Film Scores.BLOATED SPECTACLEThere were a number of Phase 4 audio documentaries on LP.Not high-brow BBC documentaries.""Battle Stereo"", conducted by Robert Sharples was typical: Actors accompanied by military music and EXPLOSIONS!Modified original jacket format: 4 Fiedler LPs = 3 CDs, 3 Munch LPs = 2 CDs, etc.See the detailed list of performers at the end of this review.CONFESSION:I haven't bought this box. Yet.I have all the Dorati, Fiedler, Munch and Stokowski recordings in their previous CD incarnations.More than half the contents of this rather expensive new box.The Fistoulari complete `Swan Lake"" is tempting - this is its first CD release,But everything else is of marginal appeal.The Leinsdorf and Maazel look interesting, but I'm not sure if I want all those Stanley Black recordings.Who knows? Maybe I do.If the price comes down I will certainly buy it.The five star rating is for people new to ""Phase 4"" and for rich people who don't mind the duplications.I am extremely annoyed by all the missing stuff - Especially the twelve LPs of Bernard Herrmann and the two Rudolph Firkusny LPs.Eleven LPs of Leopold Stokowski are missing, but I already have them on earlier CDs.It seems like this could have been better planned.SOUNDI can't comment on the sound.Normal standards for ""Concert Hall Realism"" do not apply anyway.The Phase 4 Concert Series was not marketed to serious classical music lovers with audiophile equipment.Their intended target was the popular music listener with a healthy curiosity, and a modest home stereo.I was the intended target.I was a fifteen year old Beatles fan in 1964, with no background in classical music.Stokowski's ""Scheherazade"" was one of my first classical LP purchases.""Phase 4"" should not be confused with the four channel recording fad of the 1970s.These are two channel recordings.The original recording sessions involved 20 microphones, which were recorded directly to a four channel master tape (one channel reserved for percussion), which was then mixed down to a two channel master tape.I wonder if the four channel master tapes still even exist?Universal seems to have given up on surround sound SACD in favor of Blu-Ray Audio - with new boxed sets of Beethoven and Strauss conducted by Karajan, Wagner's Ring by Solti, and a tribute to Carlos Kleiber.The first three are two-channel audio, but the Carlos Kleiber box features 2 hours, 38 minutes of hi-def surround sound: Carlos Kleiber: Complete Orchestral Recordings on Deutsche GramophoneWHAT IF?IF THE FOUR CHANNEL MASTER TAPE STILL EXISTS,We might some day be treated to a very interesting Blu-Ray Audio collection of ""Phase 4 in Surround Sound"".Gimmicky, but true to the spirit of Phase 4.But the box at hand is composed of standard two channel CDs.Oh, Well.P.S.

"There is no such thing as Janos Starker's ""Warner Legacy"".This box contains seven CDs of his ""EMI Legacy"" (1956-1959)plus three CDs of his ""Erato Legacy"" (Beethoven & Brahms Sonatas from 1959).EMI first released CDs 1-6 as ""L'Introuvables du Janos Starker"" in 1994, a boxed set that had some problems.The Dohnanyi, Milhaud and Prokofiev Concerti in that box were mono, but are now quite decent stereo.- CD 10 consists of previously unreleased EMI stereo recordings (53 minutes of encores).CHAMBER MUSIC:- Bach: Suites (6) for Unaccompanied Cello, BVV 1007-1012 (1957-1959, 1,2,3,5 mono, 4,6 stereo)- Beethoven: Sonatas (5) for Cello and Piano - Gyorgy Sebok, piano (1959 stereo)- Brahms: Sonatas (2) for Cello and Piano - Gyorgy Sebok, piano (1959 stereo)- Kodaly: Sonata for Unaccompanied Cello, Op. 8 (1957 stereo)-  ""Encores & Showpieces - Part 1"" by Bach, Chopin, Debussy, Kreisler, Mussorgsky, Paganini, Saint-Saens, Schubert, Schumann, Tcherepnin - with Gerald Moore, piano (1958 mono)-  ""Encores & Showpieces - Part 2"" by Bach, Chopin, Davidoff, Delej, Dinicu, Handel, Hindemith, Liadov, Pergolesi, Popper, Ravel, Rubinstein, Saint-Saens, Valensin - with Gerald Moore, piano (1959 stereo, first publication)CELLO & ORCHESTRA with the Philharmonia:- Boccherini: Cello Concerto in B flat, G.482  - Carlo Maria Giulini (1958 stereo)- Dohnanyi: Konzertstuck, Op. 12  - Walter Susskind (1956 stereo)- Dvorak: Cello Concerto, Op. 104 - Susskind (1956 stereo)- Faure: Elegie in C Minor, Op. 24 - Susskind (1956 stereo)- Haydn: Cello Concerto 2 in D Major - Giulini (1958 stereo)- Milhaud: Cello Concerto No. 1, Op. 101 - Susskind (1956 stereo)- Prokofiev: Cello Concerto in E Minor, Op. 58 - Susskind (1956 stereo)- Saint-Saens: Cello Concerto No. 1, Op. 33 - Giulini (1957 stereo)- Schumann: Cello Concerto in A Minor, Op. 129 - Giulini (1957 stereo)Mstislav Rostropovich, with his larger-than-life personality, tended to overshadow every other cellist in the second half of the Twentieth Century (at least in the public mind).The great Hungarian-American cellist Janos Starker (1924-2013) was perhaps too modest for his own good.Between 1945 and 1958, Starker was one of the world's most-sought after orchestral cellists;In 1953, at age 29, Fritz Reiner appointed him principal cello of the Chicago Symphony (that's him in the third movement of Emil Gilel's 1958 RCA recording of Brahms Second Piano Concerto).In 1958, at age 34, Starker unexpectedly left Chicago and retired to Bloomington, Indiana, where he spent the remaining 55 years of his life teaching young cellists at the University of Indiana.Surprisingly, his other career as a concert cellist, which lasted into the 21st Century, was a part-time occupation.According to the booklet, all EMI recordings were newly remastered in 2014, correcting the problems from ""L'Introuvables du Janos Starker"".The three CDs of Erato remasterings date from 1994 (everything sounds fine to me).[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]In the 1960's Starker launched a new series of recordings for the American label Mercury.Most of these have been reissued in a 10 CD box: János Starker - The Mercury Recordings (Decca box set), which is the main rival to the Warner box.Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplication between the two: The Bach Suites, the Brahms Sonatas, and three Cello Concertos.Starker's interpretations hadn't really changed that much.In the the Concertos of Dvorak, Saint-Saens and Schumann, it is the Philharmonia Orchestra under Giulini and Susskind (Warner) versus the London Symphony under Dorati and Skrowaczewski (Mercury).As interpretations, I prefer Dorati/Mercury in Dvorak and Giulini/Warner in Saint-Saens and Schumann, so its a toss-up.Mercury adds the Lalo Concerto, Bruch's Kol Nidrei, and Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations.Warner is much more generous, adding Concertos by Boccherini, Haydn, Milhaud and Prokofiev, plus Dohnanyi's Konzertstuck and Faure's Elegie.The Warner box is also a lot more adventurous: The Dohnanyi and Milhaud are rarities, andthe Prokofiev Concerto, Op.56, is the seldom-heard original version of the Sinfonia Concertante, Op.125.Both boxes have the Brahms Sonatas with Gyorgy Sebok, piano: 1959 versus 1964 - I can't tell the difference.Warner adds the Beethoven Sonatas.Mercury adds Sonatas by Bach, Chopin, Mendelssohn and Debussy, plus some baroque cello sonatas (available as single CDs).Warner has two CDs worth of ""Encores and Showpieces"": lighter music, most of which he never recorded again.At present, the Warner box costs significantly less than the Mercury box.Kodaly's Sonata for Unaccompanied Cello, Op.8, is a Twentieth Century classic.It has been recorded over forty times.Starker, who studied with Kodaly in Budapest in the 1930s, is the work's definitive interpreter- He made the first recording in 1948, he would return to it again in 1950, 1957 (in the Warner box) and 1970 (Janos Starker plays Kodály)[misprint: the Warner booklet claims that the 1957 recording of the Kodaly is stereo, but it is mono.]----- Later in life, Starker re-recorded much of this repertoire for other labels.The Bach Suites in 1994 for RCA: Bach: 6 Cello Suites Bwv 1007-1012 - Sony Classical MastersThis pretty much supersedes the Mercury version as an example of the mature Starker's Bach playing.In 1978, he re-recorded the Beethoven Sonatas for Teldec with Rudolf Buchbinder: Beethoven: Complete Works for Cello & PianoTeldec is now owned by Warner.This should have been in the ""Warner Legacy"" box.Too bad they forgot it.Every serious cello student should invest in the new Warner box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R320VCR2Z5C75E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3LJRHA#wasThisHelpful","R320VCR2Z5C75E","A5A6WMTH4SF9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A6WMTH4SF9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bra provides some stretch, but it was not enough stretch to accommodate my body during the later stages of pregnancy.  I had to order some bra extenders, and now that I have them, the product is pretty comfortable.  The bra lacks underwire but does have a thin layer of padding for modesty.  Unclipping a side is easy enough, but I'm not always able to unclip with one hand.  I like that the segments connecting portions of the bra are made with metal.  I've had bras that have plastic connectors and they just don't hold up.

"This assortment of bamboo towels is a great way to test an alternative to cotton towels.  While thin, the towels are very soft and silky.  They absorb liquids well and I've found that they wash and dry nicely  (they've gone through two washes thus far).  With each stint in the dryer, they have become a bit more fluffy.  The most obvious purpose for these is for body cleansing, however,  due to the softness, I may try these as liners for cloth diapers for an additional layer of soft absorbency.  I have several cloth diapers that are the same composition of 70% bamboo and 30% cotton and this combination is absorbent, soft, and gentle on baby's skin.

"Most of the dog beds I have purchased in recent years have come from stores like K Mart, Big Lots, or Target.  They were all nice beds, but after a year of use, the sides were floppy or the stuffing had disintegrated.  That could very well happen with this bed; I've only had it for a month.  However, compared to the other beds that I purchased, this one is substantially more heavy from the get go.For my two dogs, I selected the large bed.  One is a 30 pound puggle and the other is a 35 pound husky shepherd mix.  Only one dog can fit in the bed at a time, but I expected that.  While both of my dogs are medium sized, the puggle is a much better fit for this bed than the husky shepherd and that is solely based on the overall length of the puggle's body compared to the husky shepherd's.  The puggle is shorter and stockier and the husky shepherd is leaner and longer.  I am very glad that I did not go with the smaller bed for my dogs because it would have become a cat bed.The color on the bed I received - particularly the blue component - is much more low-key than what is shown in the stock image.  I find that to be great.  I don't want my pet's furniture to be the center of attention.The fabric on this is different than other beds I have had. Many of the other beds I have owned utilized a surface that was easier to wipe clean.  This cover can be removed and washed in the event your furry one excessively sheds or deposits something in the bed that is not easily cleaned.  The product has zippers to remove the exterior component from the interior ones for washing purposes.  Placing the cover back onto the interior pillows requires some manipulation and tucking.Overall, I like this bed and my puggle likes this bed. It is easy for her to get in and out of and she likes to drag her toys into it.  For a dog bed, the cost is more substantial than others.  I think it will take multiple washes and at least a few months to determine if this product will match the initial appearance of durability and quality that it initially presents.  Update to come.Disclaimer:  I received a discounted or complimentary product for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AKW25RW42DUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012MZ7SVO#wasThisHelpful","R2AKW25RW42DUO","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear a ladies size 10 shoe and I found these socks to fit well even during pregnancy when my feet were exceptionally swollen.  The socks have a good bit of stretch to them, which makes them comfortable for daylong wear.The thickness was better than anticipated.  I would not classify these as winter socks (at least for an Ohio winter), but they would definitely work for the other three seasons of the year.The color assortment is nice - white, black, and grey - which makes it easy to match socks to outfits.  A small but nice detail is that each sock has a different color used on the toe and heel.  In my house, there is a major problem when it comes to matching socks.  While we are finally using sock clips, we still have quite a few  wandering, unmatched socks in black and white.  It can be a difficult task to search through a pile of similarly colored white and black socks to find sock partners.  So, I love the different toe colors on these socks.  It makes it easier to pinpoint where the match is in a pile of socks.The height of the sock is good for me.  When I work out, I prefer socks to peek outside of the top of the shoe to prevent rubbing and these do accomplish that.The set of six socks came in a box that can be quickly wrapped for gift giving.  While the box is easy to wrap, it does have some strange phrasing.  Inside the lid is the sentence, ""Thank you for your patience.""  On the side of the box are little snippets like ""healthy and comfortable"" and ""buy with confidence"" next to a recycling symbol.  No where on the box is the product of origin specified, however, the customer service line uses a country code of 86, which is China.Ultimately, I wouldn't hesitate to give these as gifts to someone I was close to, so long as I knew that the person had a shoe size that would work well with these.I received a discounted or free product for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QN07DRBRXK97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CKH2TM#wasThisHelpful","R3QN07DRBRXK97","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice assortment of socks with distinct patterns to assist in the matching process post-washing.  I love the little grippers on the socks to help young ones with their traction.

I'm not above giving socks as holiday gifts and kids always tend to lose them, so these would make a good stocking stuffer.Currently, the product description indicates that the socks ""Fit for 0-3 years baby"" but this is not correct and if you are wondering what part of the age spectrum these are truly for, it is for toddlers (2-3 years) and definitely not those under a year unless you have a monster size baby.  I washed the socks and they did not shrink, so they will be going into storage until my little one grows a bit.All in all, I like this product, but I do wish the socks were smaller.I received a complimentary or discounted item for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR3VE5M6U4QAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166OJMJI#wasThisHelpful","RR3VE5M6U4QAP","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two dogs - one that eats like a 99 year old and another that could consume all her food in 15 seconds if I didn't add water to it and crunchy stuff like apples and carrots.  The slow-eating pup often needs encouragement in the way of wet dog food or pieces of treats to start eating.  Unfortunately, I don't have hours to wait for her to eat, so I oblige her affection for treats.  This product is an easy way to make a dry kibble more appealing.  The bags are full of soft dog food that apparently have a delightful smell and taste.  I just open up the bag and poor half on her kibble and swirl it around.  I know there are foods out that there that already have a mix of soft and hard kibble, but I'm able to adjust the amount of soft treats in my slow-eating dog's food with these single-serve bags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6JCWBGRG8M0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126F8Y7M#wasThisHelpful","R2S6JCWBGRG8M0","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It appears that this product is not intended to have a very long lifespan. The fabric is very thin and snags much too easily on the velcro.  Because the closure is velcro, lint and strings attach to the velcro which weakens the effectiveness of the closure.  A couple of buttons along the top in place of velcro would have made the closure better.  There is some stretch to the fabric, but I don't see how this one size fits most towel will work for a lot of people - kids sure but any fit adult male at 200 lbs  will likely find this towel to be inadequate in terms of width. The length of the towel works decently for someone who is 5'6'', but if you are much over that, you'll be showing quite a bit of leg.  I use the towel at the pool and it is looking pretty shabby already with strings hanging.  The towel has fallen off a couple of times even when the velcro fastener has been pretty clear of lint and string.

"The premise behind this product is a good one - the ability to open a gate in a hands-free way.  If you are carrying kids or boxes or other items, this is a great idea.  The gate does have some pros, including:1) Easy install with adjustable tension knobs,2) A gate that is of moderate height (32"" high, which is too high for my dogs to jump over), and3) Two options for opening the gate - through the foot release or push down/pull up level (requires a free hand).However, the first and second pro tend to accompany most pet gates and the third pro isn't really that wonderful if both of the opening options are executed poorly.In terms of cons:1) The gate's foot release requires a great deal of pressure, which can make the user's body unstable and prone to falling.2) The gate does not automatically snap shut.3) Finding the appropriate tension so that the foot release works (albeit poorly) takes time and patience.4) The push down/pull up level combo is sometimes sticky (even after playing with the tension knobs).I have lots of gates around my house. Most of the gates require multiple maneuvers in order to be opened.  Unfortunately, I will not be replacing the gates I have with extras of the Four Paws Metal Foot Release Gate. The biggest con from the list about is that the option of using one's foot to open the gate takes a great deal of work.  I played around with the tension, and it has never opened smoothly.  Because I have to use more force than ideal to open the gate via the foot release, it makes me fearful that I will lose my balance when my hands are full of something.  I cannot be losing my balance when carrying a baby or a load of laundry - that is dangerous.If you won't be opening the gate frequently because it will be placed in hallway/doorway that has limited use, then it functions as a barrier to keep pets from passing.  If you will be going into a room multiple times a day, this isn't the product that I would recommend selecting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91J4U9YDVXK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PIDXO6#wasThisHelpful","R91J4U9YDVXK3","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I have an assortment of appetizers or cookies, I've used the labels to differentiate different food items/flavors.  For that purpose though, I almost prefer to use slate slabs since I don't have to peel stickers - I can just write on the slate directly.  For the most part, I have  been using these labels for one of the other alternatives suggested in the picture gallery which is as gift tags.  The black background looks great when paired with the ink of metallic markers.  The labels are a nice size for labeling gifts. I could see this being a fun tool for teaching kids how to practice letters and creation of words.  Kids like to write on different mediums and with different writing utensils.

"I received this product in green, and the shade is a very happy green that is pretty true to the product image.  If you are wearing a mostly dark outfit, this purse can add a bit of a punch to it.Despite the great color, there are a couple of disappointments with this pursue.1) First, the clasp on this purse is not the same as some of the other colors that are offered by the seller.  The closure is a magnetic closure and it never closes tight enough to make me feel comfortable to carry expensive items in it.  Some of the other pursues offer a turnlock clasp where the clasp must actually be turned to open the bag.  This provides some measure of security so that the flap doesn't open randomly.2) A second security element that would have likely made up for the bad clasp would have been zippered pockets on the inside.  There are no zippers, so if you are carrying a smart phone, credit cards, or cash, there is no zippered compartment to keep them securely stowed away in the event the flap opens or your purse falls upside down.3) The strap is pitiful.  The hardware is cheap, and it can take a bit of time to adjust the strap to the appropriate length.All in all, I love the color a great deal.  The security related elements have much to be desired, however.  Other than chapstick and a couple of dollars, I rarely carry anything of value in this purse.I received a complimentary purse for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMVCBWR63H0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ABBSXW#wasThisHelpful","R2EMVCBWR63H0B","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had many different vacuums, including the much-applauded Dyson Ball vacuum.  I would have to say that the Dyson was actually one of the worst vacuums I have ever owned.  The sweeping head on the Dyson literally broke to pieces over three years and it never picked up pet hair.  In 2011, my husband and I made the switch to Hoover vacuums and we took it one step more and decided on a vacuum with bags even though bagless vacs were all the rage. We went with the Hoover Platinum Collection Lightweight Bagged Upright with Canister, UH30010COM.  It was an amazing unit when we bought it and after years of abuse, it is still pretty good but considerably more tired and a touch louder.  The Hoover Commercial Hush Tone is very similar to the Hoover Platinum in many, many ways.  The bags last, the product picks up substantial amounts of pet hair and dirt (from humans and animals alike), and is of a very sturdy, yet lightweight, construction.The first thing you notice when you take the Hush Tone Lite is that it is well constructed.  It does have a good bit of plastic components, but these appear to be made of a very high quality plastic. The vacuum bag compartment is a dense fabric with a metal zipper. The power cord and prong are also thick and sturdy.  I always see these fancy ads for Dyson, but after having owned one and heard similar Dyson horror stories from others, I can say that the Hush Tone, seems like it has over $200 worth of build quality and engineering in the design and not into hype and advertisement like Dyson products.When it comes time to use it, it's exceedingly simple. There are limited settings and buttons.  You pick whether you want a high or low brush setting and then turn the unit on and you are on your way.  There are no attachments stuck in random places all over the vacuum to worry about. Some people will probably hate that this product lacks attachments, but I love it.  When I need attachments, I pull out a detail vacuum that is portable and light.  The lack of extra pieces make this unit lighter; it weighs in at just over 11 pounds.  A huge plus for me is the cord length. With a cord length of 35 feet, you can cover multiple rooms.  Probably one of the coolest features of this product is the ability to easily switch out the cord.  There are effectively two cords to operate the product.  One is very short (a pigtail) and affixed to the top of the unit.  The user than affixes the 35 foot cord to this shorter cord.  I have had many vacuums that have needed to have tape wrapped around the cords because someone in my family mutilated the cord, which is not safe.  It is so easy to replace the cord on the Hush Tone should it be run over or otherwise damaged.  If a 35 foot cord is not long enough for you, you could easily plug in a 50 foot cord into the pigtail cord instead of using the 35 foot cord that comes with the product.When we first bought the Hoover Platinum, we immediately noticed the difference in air quality and carpet quality.  As noted, the Platinum that we have had for years probably should have died after two years; we are not kind on our vacs.  So, when I used the Hush Tone Lite, it was amazing the difference in air quality that was experienced again.  As a commercial vacuum, this thing has some suction.  It works well on low-pile carpets, but I would not use it on berber and some carpet runners would also be bad to pair with this vacuum because the Hush Tone pulls every little particle up.The bags last a long time.  We vacuum twice a week on average but with leaves dropping off the trees of late, we've had to increase that to three times for some areas of the house.  The first bag we used lasted three weeks, and I think that was largely because our old Hoover was leaving stuff on the carpets.  The second bag we used with the Hush Tone Lite lasted over a month.  Our house has multiple floors, over 2,000 square feet, and a mix of carpet, vinyl, and hardwood flooring.  Really, I love bagless vacuums.  I find them so much cleaner to handle.  When trying to open canister vacuums, I find that dust and hair inevitably escapes or gets stuck in the canister.  It is disgusting.  With a bagged vac, I don't have to have debris flying about.  When the bag needs changed, I just toss the old one in the trash.  The bags on the Hush Tone keep the gunk and junk inside them very well.Overall, I think this is a great vacuum for a home with mixed floor types and especially a home with pets and/or children.  If you have particularly high carpet, I would urge caution before purchasing.  Likewise, if you have lots of runners that are not low pile, I would ask yourself whether you have alternative ways to clean those rugs since they could get pulled up into the unit.  This unit is great for enhancing air quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IZG7KT3UH8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R36IZG7KT3UH8S","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Graco Snugride Click Connect 35 Infant Car Seat, Pierce  for my little one.  This seat cover fastens easily to that seat to provide some light blockage of sunlight. The Click Connect Seat comes with a short canopy that can be extended, but this seat cover encompasses the entire opening of the car seat.It is a very light product that makes it ideal for spring or summer months because it isn't heavy enough to severely restrict air flow.  Because it is light, the edges can blow around easily in the wind, but the two snaps that affix the cover to the seat will keep the cover from blowing away,  I likely wouldn't use this in winter for fear that snow and rain would penetrate the cover and cause it to droop on baby's face.  This is not a waterproof cover.In a pinch, the cover can be removed and used as a small blanket for a little one to be placed on.  I would avoid placing the cover on grass because it isn't an industrial fabric and the background of the fabric is white, which does not make it a great match for grass stains.  If you do use it on grass, place the underside of the cover on the grass and use that side consistently.This certainly isn't a critical piece for those initial weeks of parenting, but it is something that is nice to have.  If all of the mom-to-be's items are gone from her registry, you are looking for some type of gift to finish off a basket for a baby shower, or you want to avoid getting mom-to-be her umpteenth newborn onesie, this is a nice extra to consider.I received a complimentary product for evaluation and review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HIIWXLBE6TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN46XLK#wasThisHelpful","R8HIIWXLBE6TQ","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty good product for creating some nice sea salt inspired waves.  I had to fool around with the product quite a bit to get it to work well for me though.  While I have naturally curly hair, I couldn't just spray the product on to wet hair and scrunch it.  The result when I did that was a bit limp.  So, I pinned my hair up when it was wet with some bobby pins and then applied the product liberally.  The next day, I removed the pins and the result was exactly what I wanted - loose, non-greasy waves that held the whole day.  The smell of this product is pleasant.  I do find that the sprayer component can get clogged, but I can usually get the product moving again by cleaning the nozzle with warm water.  In terms of a product that I can spray directly on wet hair and have loose waves without pinning, I would recommend Tresemme Salt Spray Sea, 6.76 Ounce.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BWOXPKTS92P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0UJV4O#wasThisHelpful","R1BWOXPKTS92P5","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am expecting a baby in late October and despite the books and the hospital classes, I still feel like there will be that moment when I will leave the hospital and feel completely unprepared for ensuring that a little human thrives.  The Baby Manual is a nice break from the books and the classes and a great way to synthesize a lot of material in a documentary style film.  Does it have all the information you need?  No.  However, if it were any longer, it would be just as overwhelming and information-dense as the classes and books I've used.The DVD set is composed of two CDs that each have chapters.  Some chapters are short, especially the initial chapters.  Other chapters are much longer, including the breastfeeding section.  I found the breastfeeding section to be great; it covered all the material that I encountered in a two-hour in-person, hospital-sponsored breastfeeding class.  I actually liked the lactation consultant (Taryn) in The Baby Manual a heck of a lot more than the hospital instructor.  She was funny and had some great demonstrations for appropriate latching.The demonstration videos by folks like Taryn, the lactation consultant, and Selena, the safety technician, who helped show how to install a car seat are what makes this set especially nice.  You could search YouTube for similar videos (and you probably still will at some point), but it is great to have the information in one complete set with professionals that are straightforward but likable. Similarly, the parents who are showcased are real about their struggles with parenthood; they were all people I wouldn't mind having a tea or coffee with to learn more about parenting.  Most of the videos with the the parents and professionals are of good quality sound wise.  One that did seem to have a bit of an echo was with Maria the pediatrician.  For the most part, however, these videos seemed modern and did not feel hokey or home-produced.There are helpful lists at the end of each chapter, but it can take a while to get through some of the lists as the video imitates a person writing each thing to buy or remember.  This can make the checklist portion a bit tedious. Some things on the lists were not discussed in the chapter but seemed like potentially obvious and necessary items depending on personal preference (e.g., pacifiers).While The Baby Manual is geared toward new parents, I did share the set with my future little one's aunts and uncles and grandparents since there were some requests.  The most pertinent chapters for them dealt with diapering, reducing crying, health routines, and sleep routines.  If the grandparents, aunts, uncles, haven't been around babies for a while, this set could be a welcome refresher.  My child's grandparent for instance reared children when putting babies on their tummies was the recommended practice.  Times change and recommendations change so the video offered helpful protocols and reminders.  With that in mind, if any of these folks you may share the The Baby Manual with have a sensitivity to seeing unclothed chests, realize that this video does talk about breastfeeding and show it in progress.Some random likes:  I liked that the creators gave some references to cloth diapering and acknowledged working moms.  The idea of having a friend cull through a registry and the addition of an exercise ball to the nursery were great suggestions as well that I will be incorporating.All in all, I liked this DVD set quite a bit.  It doesn't provide all the information you are going to need, but I think that it is worth a watch near the start of pregnancy and a couple of times later on.  Between the start of pregnancy and the end of pregnancy,  you can read, read, read and take classes and consult with others and then take a mini refresher course via The Baby Manual to resurrect some of the lessons that were pushed to the corner of your brain because of anxiety or the forgetfulness that often accompanies pregnancy.This DVD set is 240 minutes long and in English.  It has no subtitles.I received a complimentary product for evaluation purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDFSKUA4O69K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T22D6ZI#wasThisHelpful","R1VDFSKUA4O69K","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would size up on this product.  The wings on the support allow for adjustments, but if you are borderline on the measurements, do yourself a favor and size up to more easily allow for those circumference modifications.  The velcro is strong and will keep you supported for long periods of time.  Sizing up also allows for greater flexibility of product adjustments during the day.  The color of the fabric works well under lighter colored fabrics although it is obvious that a support is being worn if you opt for thinner fabrics.  A camisole or tank top over the support can help hide the support under clothing although this can lead to additional perspiration.  The back of the product has holes to encourage breathability and air flow, but the front is a fairly solid panel so it can get pretty sweaty where the solid panel is positioned.  The support cleans fairly easily  in the wash although there have been some problems with the support's velcro picking up lint and fuzz, which over time, could impair the product's usability.  To remove the lint, I often use another piece of velcro, a toothbrush, or tweezers.I received a complimentary product for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGNAVEV46KQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFE9VQU#wasThisHelpful","R1BGNAVEV46KQ4","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have quite a few tops with awkward neck lines that just don't accommodate traditional bras.  To boot, I'm pregnant so comfortable bras can be like finding a unicorn.  I went with the XL since I am a 36C right now and that is what the description recommended.  If is completely feasible to size down if you are around that measurement.  While this product did not slip down on me, there was certainly a lot of added stretch that could make it feel large on some women.I picked the nude color and it worked really well with light colored fabrics.  The inserts are somewhat annoying.  I have to use inserts/pads, but these ones don't seem to sit in a centered position and for lighter fabrics, it is often clear that the user is wearing a bra with pads.  Further, the inserts/padding always agitate out of the bra when washed or the inserts bunch together, so I would encourage use of  a lingerie bag to keep the pieces at least somewhat together.  It isn't hard to put the inserts back in the bra, but I would prefer they just be affixed in a semi-permanent way.The height of the bra has caused some annoyances.  Even with tops that I wouldn't deem low-cut, the top of the bra can creep over some necklines, which isn't attractive.I found the bra comfortable and I have worn it for long periods of time (14 hours+), but I do think picking a good size is important and somewhat tricky given the parameters provided in the description.  Post- baby I don't believe the XL will work in the way I need it too.  A large would have provided longer term use since the product is, again, quite stretchy.

The Luseta tea tree and argan oil shampoo and conditioner duo is a good option for individuals who have never tried a tea-tree infused hair product.  Some tea tree products have strong tea tree scents and can lead to a very concentrated feeling feeling when applied to the scalp. In addition to this set, I currently have  Generic Value Products Tea Tree Oil Shampoo compare to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo 33.8 oz and Tea Tree Oil Shampoo 16 fl oz (473 ml) Liquid in my shower. The Luseta products, especially the conditioner, are much less intense than the other tea tree hair products I have noted.  I like strong tea tree products, but for newbies just trying tea tree oil shampoos, the Luseta set is great.I began using tea tree oil to treat an itchy scalp.  I had used dandruff shampoos that sometimes worked and often had a horrible odor.  Tea tree oil smells fresh and clean and happens to work wonderfully on scalps prone to dryness.  Even though tea tree oil is further down the ingredient list, the shampoo appears to have a higher tea tree oil concentration than the conditioner; the shampoo feels stronger on the scalp.  The scent associated with both products is mild and dissipates quickly.This duo both led to clean-feeling scalp but also soft hair.  Argan oil is an ingredient that I like a great deal, but when I have used it in the past for conditioning, it has caused a greasy look.  I haven't had that problem with the Luseta duo.  Both the conditioner and shampoo have cetearyl alcohol, which is a good alcohol for hair conditioning.I really like the pump bottles and the bottles themselves are a thick plastic, so I may save the bottles for refilling purposes in the future for body wash or some other bath product.  The 16.9 ounce options will last me a while because a little goes a long way.  Not that it matters much to me, but the coloring of the bottles and overall appearance are pretty attractive for shampoo and conditioner.The product bears the leaping bunny symbol, which means it is not tested on animals.  It comes in a #1 bottle; plastic #1s (next to #2) are the most readily recycled in communities across the US.Ingredients:Shampoo -Shampoo: Water (Aqua, Eau), Sodium Cocoyllsethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide MEA, Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Glycol Distearate, Parfum, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Polyquaternium-10, Tetrasodium EDTA, Argania Spinosa Kernel (Argan)  Oil, Melaeuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, CI 19140, CI 42090Conditioner: Conditioner: Water (Aqua, Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Steartrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Amodimethicone, Tetrasodium EDTA, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil,  Argania Spinosa Kernel (Argan) Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Citric Acid, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, CI 19140, CI 42090I received a complimentary shampoo and conditioner to review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NBBQ4EYC4NYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HMM6J0#wasThisHelpful","R2NBBQ4EYC4NYX","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The diffuser, other than button operation, is easy to use and set up.  There are three main pieces - cover, water tank, and plug-in adapter.  The cover does not screw on; it just sits on top of the water tank/base.  The adapter, plugs in on the bottom of the unit.To use this device, the user needs to lift off the cover, fill the water tank with up to 1/4 cup of water/120 ml of water (there is a maximum fill line) .  Then, place several drops (or maybe only one drop depending on the intensity of the oil), into the water.  Place the cap back on the water tank.  Then, the user has one button to push to turn the unit on.I found the last step of pushing the button to be the most annoying because pressing the button can have different effects.  The first push turns the unit on (sometimes), once the unit is on, the second push will allow you to select a single color rather than the flashing colors, the third push allows all light changing features to be completely turned off so that the dome is unlit. This is nice for sleeping but it may make you think the unit is off when it is very much on.  The final button push (sometimes) turns the unit off.  My fear would be that I (or someone else) would push the button in to turn the unit off and then walk away and it would not have shut down, so make it a practice to always unplug the device even if you think it is off.My unit did turn off when flipped on its side.In terms of how it moves scents about a room, the product is impressive.  My room smelled like eucalyptus and lavender within five minutes of operation.  The unit is  fairly quiet and the changing colors can be pleasant, but I like being able to select a single color as well.I received a complimentary product for evaluation and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVV1PYI97BI7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QFPUXO#wasThisHelpful","RVV1PYI97BI7U","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this oil blend, but it only took one use for me to realize that a little goes a very long way.  I used it in Essential Oil Diffuser, Vtin 120ml Aroma Essential Oil Cool Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier with Adjustable Mist Mode,Waterless Auto Shut-off and 7 Color LED Lights Changing,against Dry Air for Bedroom,Office,Home with 3 drops of oil in 120 ml of water and the scent, while lovely, was quite intense.  I didn't smell a lot of peppermint, but the lavender and eucalyptus were very noticeable.The blend is noted as one that helps with breathing function; I have sniffles even in the summer and after using this blend in the diffuser, my sinuses felt less obstructed.While this seems to be a quality product, the concentration and scent intensity must be approached with caution if the user is prone to headaches, which I am.  I actually only left the diffuser on for 10 minutes with this product before turning it off.  The scent lingered in the room for a couple of hours; it is strong stuff.I received a complimentary oil blend for evaluation purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUMRCVFVE3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWHX2JI#wasThisHelpful","R1JUMRCVFVE3M","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In terms of sharpness, I didn't find these to be very sharp.  The tips don't have a great point, so it is harder to grasp short hairs and stubborn hairs.  I have never been able to use just one set of tweezers.  For ingrown hairs, I need a set that has very thin ends.  The Petunia Skincare tweezers do not work well on ingrown hairs for me.  For longer hairs and sculpting, I usually reach for tweezers that are slanted.  The Petunia Skincare tweezers do have a slanted end and I was able to sculpt my brows a bit.  I did find that some of the hairs I tried to pluck broke off close to the skin because I just couldn't get the hold that I typically strive for.  The length of these tweezers are probably average;I tend to prefer shorter handles to provide more exact control; the Petunia Skincare tweezers don't provide this.Just as people have preferences for hairbrushes, shampoos, and shoes, I have very strong preferences for my tweezers.  I have two favorites that are both made by Tweezerman and include:  http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-Mini-Slant-Tweezer-Colors/dp/B00AAJOZN4/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1441367030&sr=1-1&keywords=tweezers and http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-1300-r-Ingrown-Hair-Splintertweeze/dp/B000FFYMYU/ref=sr_1_31?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1441367030&sr=1-31&keywords=tweezers.  (I haven't always experienced consistent tweezer quality with the Tweezerman tweezers, but when I get a good set, the results are great.)The Petunia Skincare tweezers have found a place in my gym bag so that I can pluck on the go.  They won't be my go-to tweezers, but they will serve as an alternative if I have no other option on hand.I received a complimentary set of tweezers for evaluation and review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QP1YK2F4BMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVRH9II#wasThisHelpful","R1QP1YK2F4BMT","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:Eye contact: This cover has a semi-rigid neckline that can be manipulated to allow mom to maintain contact with baby.  The adjustable neckline also allows downward air movement to the baby.Adjustable: Metal d-rings allow mom to adjust the neckline of the cover similar to some aprons.Color is gender neutral:  The color of the cover is light grey and white with images that resemble flowers.  The images are printed in white but are very lightly printed so from far away, the cover would appear to be mostly grey.  The interior of the cover is not lined; it is just the backside of the fabric, so it too looks grey.Storage pockets:  There are two storage pockets that are about 7 inches long and 6.5 inches wide.  These are on the inside of the cover and could temporarily hold small items (set of keys, pacifier, burp cloth).  See commentary below.Light fabric:  The fabric is very light which would make it good for summer late spring and summer use if you have warmer/hot temperatures in your area.Folds up small:  The cover folds up small and doesn’t take up much room in a bag that is already probably full of miscellaneous diapers, outfits, and equipment.Provides moderate coverage:  Not including the neck strap, the rectangular portion of the fabric that covers the chest area and baby is 37 inches wide by 26.5.  The loose strap for the neck is about  27 inches long and can be affixed to another shorter strip of fabric (2.75 inches) via a d-ring.Product can be used for other purposes:  The cover can be draped over a car seat to provide additional shade to a little one.Cons:Storage pockets:  The storage pockets are at the bottom of the cover and sewn on the inside.  They are open at the top.  I would have preferred pockets on the outside of the cover that had zippers on the top so that items could actually be stored within them without the small items potentially falling out.Cover constructed with lightweight fabric:  The fabric is good for use in warmer temperatures because it is not double-lined.  However, due to the thinness, it can shift a bit in wind.  I wish there were little weights in the lower corners.  Putting items into the storage pockets can help a bit on the bottom.  The top upper left and upper right corner also flap downward, regardless of the presence of wind , and an extra flexible strap at the back would be helpful to maintain modesty although it would make the unit harder to put on.  A better alternative I think would be the presence of semi-flexible and rigid plastic (similar to the neckline construction) running down along the left and right of the cover  to keep the cover from flapping about.Moderate coverage could be more ample: I’m 5’6”  with an average torso and the fabric dimensions noted above would be the bare minimum amount of fabric I would want to work with if I were out and about. Ideally, there would be more fabric on the sides to wrap around the back a bit this is especially case since the upper left and right flap do not stay upright but flip out.Wrinkly:  If you are highly sensitive to wrinkles, this product tends to wrinkle regardless of whether the user decides to fold the cover or roll the cover up for storage.All in all, it is a nice product that gets the job done.I received a complimentary product for evaluation purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0J4BJTWPWRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XYDHC92#wasThisHelpful","R2R0J4BJTWPWRT","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like it as a really long tank top for the gym and casual outfits. The length covers my bottom when I am wearing spandex gym/yoga pants, which depending on the manufacturer, can be a bit thin.  The fabric is lightweight so for my local climate, it would work from late spring to mid-fall.  The color was as expected and it arrived in good shape without loose threads.  The product has some stretch to it so it does nicely accentuate curves.  I'm pregnant and therefore ordered a larger size than I normally would wear, and I felt quite comfortable in it.  I let me sister who is a pretty petite gal try it on and while it was more dress like on her, she indicated she wouldn't use it as a dress because she felt too much of the leg area was exposed.  For purposes of being used as a really long tank top, this product meets expectations and I would consider ordering a second color.I received a complimentary sample in grey  for evaluation purposes.Update October 2015:  I liked the length of this so much that I ordered a second in black.  The black was as equally comfortable as the grey, but if you have pets, it is a hair magnet.  I cannot keep the black tank hair and lint free.  It is not one I would wear out often in public.  I do wish the company offered this tank in additional colors.  I would probably start to replace all my shorter tanks with this option if there were more color options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B53CFFSHK7LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZTP2W9S#wasThisHelpful","R3B53CFFSHK7LK","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a knee brace that you can wear out and about, this isn't one that I would recommend.  I found that the brace moved considerably.  The product is tightened and through the use of velcro.  Unfortunately, the velcro does not stay affixed which leads to a fit that loosens over the course of mere minutes.  The pressure provided is weak and does not stabilize the knee.  The advantages of this type of product, if you can keep it on, is that it is easier to apply than a neoprene knee sleeve and is adjustable.  If the user is going to remain in confined to a bed or chair, then this product may be worth considering, but any minimal movement will cause shifting.I received a complimentary sample for purposes of evaluation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8TZWS1QFM55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0A0NLQ#wasThisHelpful","RC8TZWS1QFM55","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the idea of these yoga pants because they had a dip in the front to accommodate a large (and still growing) pregnant belly and a stretchy fabric that is not at all constricting.  The fabric is thicker than other exercise pants that I have but still stretchy and breathable.  I've worn these in many exercise classes and they don't shift around.  The pants also hit at a nice point on my leg - right around the mid-calf.  I need to wash these a few more times to assess longevity, but thus far the fabric seems to be holding up to consistent (3-4x a week) use.

"This product comes in various pieces that do not  connect easily.  While pushing this along hardwood floors covered with cat hair, the handle separated, and the broom didn't collect much hair on hard surfaces.  On carpeted floors, the broom did not move easily and the handle, again, disassembled itself. On couches, I had better success but only after I decided to just use the broom head.  The broom head when moved across fabric-laden furniture allowed a ton of hair to be clumped together.  The hair did not stick to the broom, but it did form a bit of a ball that could be swept or picked up. If you really want a broom, this is not the tool unless you are committed to replacing the handle.

"I'm expecting and have tried a variety of products throughout pregnancy to keep skin moisturized.  I've tried and liked many Burt's products, but this one just came across as average.  It absorbs quickly, but it does have a smell.  To keep the skin from drying out, it seemed like I had to apply this moisturizer more frequently than other products I've tried. The container size is not huge so if you are using this each day, you will burn through quite a bit of this. This latter point seems like that is the problem with most of the pregnancy-oriented moisturizers like Palmer's and Bio-Oil.

You will be able to find a matching piece and those pieces will endure through the years.2) White is adaptable: The second advantage is the actual white color. You can make any piece look as dressy or casual as you want by pairing fancier or more casual tablecloths and placements with the dishes. Many people seem apprehensive to purchase white dinnerware for fear of staining. You don't need to worry about that with Corelle.

"For a new parent, this assortment provides some essentials all in one kit.  Taken as a whole, the set is nice but not overly praiseworthy.  All of the contents are made in China.  While soft, the blankets and sheets are pretty thin.Blankets - A 30"" by 40"" blanket is not that big. It can be hard to picture, so I'd get out the tape measure. These are good for swaddling and soft enough. The color of the blankets that I received does not really match the product picture. When you google Ecru, the color can range from an off-white to tan to a light buttercup yellow. These blankets are a pale yellow. I like them, but they were not the color I anticipated. The packaging says the thermal blankets are 100% cotton, but that is not what the sewn in tag says.  The tag identifies them as 100% polyester.  Made in China.Crib sheet - The fitted sheets are very soft but also very thin.  If you hold them up, they are fairly see through.  Again, similar to the blankets, the color is more of a pale yellow.  The crib sheet fit my crib mattress quite well.  100% cotton.  Made in China.Waterproof quilted pad - It measures 18X27  and is white in color.  It would be good as a changing pad or in a bassinet.  Also, if you are breastfeeding in bed, this is a nice size to lay down beside you to protect bed linens.  When paired with a second quilted pad, it could work well in a pack 'n play to protect the bottom from spit up and leaks.  It has no tie downs and it is a touch small for use in a crib.  This product washed very nicely. Top layer 100% cotton, middle layer polyester fiberfill, bottom layer 100% vinyl.  Made in China.Protective Crib Mattress Covering:  This measures in at 28X52 and is white in color.  I inserted it underneath my sheets.  It has no tie downs.

"For the first 25 weeks of my pregnancy, I had no fewer than eight pillows cushioning my front and my back and legs.  My husband had to reach over a mountain of pillows to remind himself that, yes, we shared a bed.  Despite all the pillows, I found myself constantly on my back, which doctors and nurses and every book tells you is a big no-no.  So, I ordered this pillow and when it came, I immediately thought it was going to be fantastic despite my husband saying, ""Gee, I've always wanted to sleep next to a massive refrigerator.""The pillow is massive.  I have a queen bed and it takes up half the bed easily, but it replaces the individual pillows that I had supporting me.  When I first tried it after its arrival, I napped on top of it, face up and the pillow was so comfortable on my back.  Using it as a reading prop was also wonderful.  When I started to use it as a support for side sleeping, I had problems.The pillow is the same width and height all around the ""U"" shape.  The material is not overly soft but not particularly firm.  For supporting the back and belly, this is great.  There is enough give on the pillow to accommodate a growing belly.  However, the height of the pillow really hurt my neck.  I don't normally sleep with my neck at the angle that is pictured in the stock photo.  I try to keep it more neutral.  The user's head doesn't sink down particularly well on the pillow, which can cause intense neck cramps, next-day discomfort, and overall grouchiness.The last couple of nights, I've tried to invert the U pillow so that my head is at the opening and I use a different, lower pillow to support my neck.  I haven't found this positioning to be as effective at cradling my belly and back.  The legs of the U end up flaring out and I end up sleeping on my back.For individuals who like tall pillows, plan to use this as a reading support, or plan to sleep on their backs on top of the pillow, this product will probably work great, but I have to find something that offers better neck support for nighttime support.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5S5FXE6200WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E7DIQ#wasThisHelpful","R5S5FXE6200WR","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I made my husband put this thing together and the first thing he said when I dumped the gazillion pieces out of the box was that it would be easier to put together an airplane.  There are so many pieces and for new parents like us this unit was a pain to put together and required careful attention to the directions and hunting for random pieces.  When finally assembled, the unit is on the whole heavy but does not offer the impression of being sturdy.  It has a low weight threshold of 20 pounds and only moves in one direction.  It is a battery hog requiring 4 D batteries along with one C battery.  Turning on the device requires that switches be in an unlocked position and the user has to push the seat to get it moving.  Folding the device is a pain and moving it without folding it is also a pain.  The seat is nearly horizontal so baby is looking upwards rather than at the things happening around him.  As battery life dwindles, music quality naturally suffers.  Really, the only two things I like are the elephants on the swing which match the nursery and the soft fabric.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HWA3L5AJDD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYWZAK4#wasThisHelpful","R23HWA3L5AJDD4","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I travel, finding things that have multiple utilities can help save space and lighten the overall luggage load.  This microfiber blanket is quite ample in size and for the space conscious traveler it can function as a beach blanket, sleeping throw, or even a massive towel.  I've spent a lot of money on travel towels that are made out of microfiber because microfiber travel towels are light and dry quickly.  With the Yoler blanket, you essentially have a substantial quick-drying blanket that can function as a massive towel for a price that is equal to or better than units marketed as travel towels and half the size.As noted above, the size is great.  You can put two adults on this blanket comfortably or several children.  I really like the corner pockets on the blanket that can be weighted down with sand or stones.  That is a smart addition that I have not seem incorporated in many blankets I've owned.  The microfiber material allows sand and rocks to be shaken off relatively easily.  The travel bag is a nice addition that allows for easy toting of the blanket.I have a yellow Yoler beach blanket, and it is a very cheerful color.  The biggest flaw with the yellow is that I found that when placed on grass, it can collect grass stains.  It is not a huge knock; I generally anticipate that blankets placed on grassy surfaces will pick up dirt and stains, but I did have some difficulty removing the stains from the fabric.  I wish the Yoler blanket were offered in some darker colors to hide stains a bit better.  For use with kids, the blanket is bound to pick up stains from drinks if not from surfaces it is placed upon.All in all, I would recommend this blanket, and I personally will consider it as a gift option for others.I was provided with a free sample to test.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DDL4N7LV7KTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4PFV5S#wasThisHelpful","R2DDL4N7LV7KTP","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had to fool around with this product a few times; the initial attempts did not yield great results, but after playing around with the amount and incorporating a hair dryer, I have found that this sea salt spray is actually pretty nice.  I already have curls, but they are often wild and I've often yearned for the great curls that I've attained at the beach on visits past.  I actually like the second day results of this product better than the first day.  The product dispenses easily and it doesn't have an overly strong scent.  Even when I have used too much product, the result wasn't overly heavy - it looked wet but didn't feel weighed down.  Even though the product has salt in it, I did not find the product to be overly drying even when using the product three or four times in one week.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNZIZ5V3W9EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJU8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2RNZIZ5V3W9EL","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When just looking at the tiny product stock image, this looks like a really cute clothing piece for a little one.  And it is cute, but it is not very well made.  The bath rode is said to be made out of terry that is ""incredibly fine, soft, and strong.""  I don't think I would use any of those words to describe this piece.The fabric is thin and not very soft; it reminds me of cheap discount towels that I've purchased at Dollar General when I forgot to pack towels for a vacation.  The fabric also sheds little pieces of white over the pockets and any people who are in contact with the robe.  The shedding went down slightly after a few washes.The trim details and pockets seem to have been rather messily down; there are lots of loose strings.In terms of things I like, it is great that the  sash is affixed to the robe; it is one less thing to lose.  I think the grey and white is a nice color combination.  The lightness of the robe makes it a good piece for spring and fall.Ultimately, the quality is lacking on this piece.  The loose strings are prevalent and who really wants to gift a lint roller along with an infant robe?  Kind of tacky.  Knowing all of this, the color scheme is nice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAR5JH1VV5O99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQL6HQG#wasThisHelpful","RAR5JH1VV5O99","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When this stroller is paired with the Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Gotham, the user effectively creates a travel system that permits easy movement of the car seat from the vehicle to the stroller.  Please note that Graco has two types of connection systems - the click connect and classic connect.  You have to use the click connect with this stroller.  You may elect to purchase the stroller,  SnugRide Click Connect Seat, and car seat base as a set rather than on a piecemeal basis.  See here for an option:  Graco Aire3 Click Connect Travel System, Gotham.  All this being noted, and if not clear, this stroller does not come with a car seat.  If you want to use the stroller with an infant, you'd want to purchase the car seat.ASSEMBLY:  The stroller has some assembly that is necessary when the box arrives.  With a couple snaps of the wheel and front security bar, the stroller is ready to roll.  Compared to some other infant items that I've had to assemble, this unit was a breeze.CONNECTING THE INFANT SEAT TO THE STROLLER:  This is a pretty easy process.  The user must fully recline the seat (see below), open the car seat attachment flap that is found on the front of the stroller, and then insert the carseat into the stroller and pushing down with enough force so that the car seat will latch into the side mounts found on the stroller.COLOR AND ASSETS: The color is great - a gender neutral black and tan.  Overall, the unit looks sleek and somewhat sophisticated.  The canopy extends easily, and I haven't had many problems with it retracting on its own.  The seat can also be mostly vertical or reclined.  There are straps on the back of the unit that are pulled down to make the seat vertical.  There is a button that can be pressed to recline the seat fully.  The seat must be reclined fully to safely accommodate the SnugRide Seat, which is used for infants up to 35 lbs/32 inches.STORAGE:  The storage area under the stroller is a bit on the small side.  If you have a massive changing bag or even a book bag, I would opt for something a big thinner or it isn't going to fit.STORAGE:  The stroller does fold up easily.  There is a pull located in a pocket underneath where a child would be positioned.  The pull merely needs to be moved upward for the unit to collapse.WEIGHT:  The picture on the stroller box shows a happy mother carrying a collapsed stroller in one hand with an infant in the other hand.  I don't know about that.  The stroller still has a decent sized footprint and 21 pounds is not feather light when also potentially carrying a diaper bag or personal purse.EASE OF MOVEMENT:  Over concrete, grass, and rocks, the stroller moves pretty easily.  I'm impressed by the smooth ride that the four wheels facilitate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20YXTUD1BT2Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PX8PDII#wasThisHelpful","R20YXTUD1BT2Q3","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been providing grain free cat food to my cats for a little over a year.  I do encourage cat owners to give it a try, especially for owners who have cats with digestive issues.  Additionally, I've always been able to integrate a new grain free flavor into my cat's daily diets with few consequences (e.g. loose stool or vomit).  I've used nearly all of the Natural Balance grain free flavors as well as the 4health brand that is sold by Tractor Supply Company (indoor formula & whitefish potato and pea).  All together, I've tried about seven options. Next to the Tractor Supply Company's whitefish, potato, and pea option, I've never struggled so much to get my cats to eat a grain free option.  I have to mix this in with another cat food and even then I find that my more intentional cats will spit out the pieces they do not enjoy.  I do like the size of the pieces; for older cats, the pieces are small.  Also, there is very little odor.  The 4health grain free indoor formula offers a cat food that similarly lacks an odor and smaller sized pieces.  I would recommend that over this option.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZCXJCRP4YCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M0JL92#wasThisHelpful","R6ZCXJCRP4YCU","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Balance Bites are an interesting concept.  Each pouch contains little chocolate protein puffs that offer 13 grams of protein and 190 calories.  For a snack, I like the amount of protein and the overall calories.  Also, when I eat snacks, I most prefer those that allow snacking for an extended period of time.  Snacks such as Balance Bites offer the impression that you are getting to consume a lot more since each bag  is packed with protein puffs.The problem with these protein puffs is that if you like tasty snacks, this one is a little lackluster.  For the amount of protein, I expected some type of chemical protein flavor that often accompanies protein powders.  There wasn't really a chemical flavor; there wasn't much of any flavor despite being coated in a milk chocolate layer.The milk chocolate layer does melt easily and because this is a snack that involves the hands, it is rather messy.Another eating option is to pair the puffs with milk or a milk alternative and eat them like a cereal. I paired a bag with So Delicious coconut milk, and the result wasn't too terrible.  Pairing the protein puffs with ice cream also sounds somewhat appealing to me, but then the concept of the 190 calorie snack goes out the window.At the end of the day, I would encourage the company to continue to work on its formulation with a specific focus on flavor and a secondary focus on making the puffs a little more resilient to heat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA86OR6H19I04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT1ZYHW#wasThisHelpful","RA86OR6H19I04","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In theory these seemed like a good idea, but this product did not work for me; the pieces never worked for how I was carrying in my pregnancy.  I'm carrying most of my weight in my stomach, so I have been able to get my pants on and zipping is still possible but not entirely comfortable at 24 weeks.  The problem is that none of the black elastic options fit; they are all too long and easily come undone.  The inserts do not match very well.  I've found it better to just wear belly bands with my regular jeans or to wear maternity jeans. Maternity jeans are very comfortable and I found them at many thrift stores.

If your younger kids are on cleanup duty, then this will likely work okay.  I can't say that I find this unit particularly durable.  It is virtually 100% brittle plastic.  With two dogs and daily cleanups, I don't see this lasting a long time.  The tongs/teeth on the device get tangled in grass that is not cut short, which can make it difficult to retrieve doggy debris.

"My overall impression is that these are mediocre.  A serving size is three pieces with a total of about five servings in a resealable bag.  Each piece is one to two bites, but unless a toddler is consuming them, two bites is likely the maximum.I like that you get 7 grams of protein per serving, but at 180 calories, I'd rather go for a Quest bar that has just a few more calories, 20 grams of protein, a lot more fiber, and a lot more flavor.  These bites only have 1 gram of fiber per serving.  I don't know why the product description currently says that they are a good source of fiber.In terms of taste, I didn't find the blueberry flavor to be very strong.Texturally, the pieces are satisfying.

"First thing first: This is not a truly wireless device. There is a base unit that plugs into your audio output from your TV, but then there is a second device about the size of a deck of cards that you have to carry with you and connect your headphones to. On one hand, this is a plus because you can use any wired headphones or ear buds of your choice. On the other, it can be a bit of a pain to have to carry around the receiver (it comes with a neck lanyard). Just something to be aware of.The back of the base unit has an input for optical audio cable, stereo RCA jacks, and a mono RCA jack. For my testing I used the stereo RCA jacks because my television only has one optical audio output that is always connected to my sound bar. Sound was clear and loud, and the default ear buds are of mediocre quality. They do come with three sizes of buds so it was easy to fit them for a good audio seal. The claimed range of 33 feet seems about accurate. Walking to the kitchen with a wall between the base unit and myself, the range dropped to about 15-20 feet. Standard stuff.Overall, the device does what it says: Beams sound from your TV to a set of headphones without have to have the TV volume itself on. But this is hardly anything revolutionary, there are countless wireless listening devices all over the market place right now. That brings us to the big problem with the device: It is $200, priced at the high end of wireless listening devices, and offers nothing special to justify the cost. I would look at other options for better prices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15K2HVIN1I3Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT50VM#wasThisHelpful","R15K2HVIN1I3Q6","A2DPYMNI2HCIOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DPYMNI2HCIOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:30 Mins After spending 10 minutes trying to catch crickets with my bare hands every week, I decided to get out of the Dark Ages. There must be a better way. So I started researching Bug Vacuums and most were toys - which is okay as long as they work. I settled on this one because of the ability to lock the insects in the chamber, since crickets were my insect of choice.The vacuum has good suction but since the opening is large for bigger insects you must have it directly over the insect to suck it in. But once it is in the chamber it is not going anywhere - the suction is really good at the back end.So as you can see from the video I caught at least 40 crickets in about 20 seconds.It comes with 4 ""AA"" batteries but as a rule I always switch them out of any toy and insert fresh Duracell batteries.The Good:Easy to use - just pull the trigger.Easy to empty out the insects as the chamber comes apart in two areas.Trap door to lock the insects in.Trap door doubles as a magnifying glass so you can study the insects you trap.Comes with a cool green light.A great choice if your in the market for a bug vacuum","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HO10FGINM5TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGU9GK#wasThisHelpful","R2HO10FGINM5TD","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:20 Mins I got this tester to review for my YouTube Channel but I also like to share my reviews here on amazon.com.The tester is well organized and easy to use. It comes with simple clear color instructions. Basically you will use five drops of each specific reagent to do the six test factors (five if your not doing Bromine) and a tablet for the CYA (Conditioner) test.The ColorQ Pro 7 test for Free Chlorine, Total Chlorine, Bromine, pH, Alkalinity, Calcium Hardness and Cyanuric Acid. There is enough reagents for 144 test and 100 tablets for CYA testing. Plenty if you are a homeowner for the season.What is to like about the ColorQ Pro 7:Easy to preform each test.Results are reliable - I matched them against digital testers and my Taylor FAS-DPD K-2006 kit. Results are right on.Easy to read digital display.No more color matching - the colorQ gives you an exact readout.The unit runs on AA batteries which is good.Reagents are clearly marked and have an expiration date marked on them.Cons:Reagents do expire so figure to buy a new set every season.It does take a little more time than your traditional reagent test and test strips - (but the results are spot on and worth it).It may not be a suitable price point for some - but you are paying for ease of use (you can't beat the digital readings).Bottom line, if you are looking for a test kit that gives you accurate easy to read results and is simple to use, this is it.Watch the video to learn more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11UW43L6BLWNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WKK71S#wasThisHelpful","R11UW43L6BLWNI","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lately, I guess I am getting older, the glare has been bothering me and I needed darker lenses. So these Sunglasses fit the bill and they are perfect for outdoor use in a Sunny area.The lifetime frame and lens warranty is pretty good too. It comes with a storage pouch and a lens cleaner. Not much to the packaging but a great value.Watch the video to learn more and to see them in more detail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197PIPG26JSX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFOYFR0#wasThisHelpful","R197PIPG26JSX9","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:19 Mins My son is in his 2nd year of tennis lessons. We play in the street all the time and decided we needed a net to enhance the informal practice sessions. So we went out and measured various lengths as there are 10 ft., 12 ft., 14 ft. and larger nets available. we settled on this 18 ft. net as it is a large area and cars can still pass it in the cul-de-sac.It took us about 10 minutes to assemble it the first time. It is very simple to set up. The parts look durable and the net is a quality product. As you can see from the video it is a perfect size for rallying and a great practice aid. It is also very light weight and easy to carry and set-up.The price is affordable and the quality of the product is good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXJKOV8ZM4Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049IE82U#wasThisHelpful","RTXJKOV8ZM4Q3","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:49 Mins Another pool guy swore by this product so I picked one up at my local SCP Wholesaler to try out on some stains on my pool route. I was skeptical at best. But right from the start it took off a Frisbee size rust stain. Then a small little rust stain and last a large stain that has been on that particular pool for a few years - not exactly sure what it was. The video will show this thing really working.The other pool guy suggested I try it on scale on the pool tile and sure enough it took the scale right off too. I also show it in the video rubbing off a black algae spot on the pool bottom.Some of the negative reviews are due to a misunderstanding and it seems the earlier listing was for a 6-pack of the product. Also some stains might not be what they appear. The plaster has defects called Mottling, which is not a stain, so rubbing it will do nothing. If you have dark copper staining the only way to remove those stains is with an acid wash. Nothing will rub those off. But for rust stains and other similar stains this thing works great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SM961IH7KTCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Q0ZKTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3SM961IH7KTCJ","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:45 Mins I received this to review on my YouTube Channel but think those on Amazon.com can benefit also from the review.NaturAqua is a 100% mineral salt product. It does many things when added to your pool. It controls algae growth, clarifies the water, allows you to use less chlorine and stabilizes the pH.Using mineral salts in a pool is a fairly new and unknown concept here in the US. I spoke with the manufacturer and it has been widely used in Mexico for over 18 years. This is the first time it has been sold here in the US.A little bit of this product goes a long way. The container is only 10.6 oz. but for most pools that will get you through the entire swimming season.I have been testing the product now for over seven weeks in my test pool and it is looking great. This is a good alternative product if you are sensitive to chlorine and want to keep the levels low in your pool all season long.The test pool has been fluctuating between 1.5 ppm to 0.5 ppm and looks crystal clear.The product is effective and works very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFHVBFFK7LVJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHA666C#wasThisHelpful","RFHVBFFK7LVJV","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:24 Mins These gloves are great for outdoor work. For my type of work they start to show wear after 2-3 weeks but they are getting wet constantly so that is a factor. They are very comfortable and the backing is very breathable so you can comfortably wear them all day without issue. The grip is very good and the protection they offer your hands is excellent. I have been using them for almost three years now and they are the best.Watch the video for more details.Note that I wear both the medium and large size.

The Extreme Multi-Layered bag is very good but mine started to wear out. I thought I would give the Sand Silt bag a try since I am mainly vacuuming up dirt and fine particle debris.This bag has turned out to be exceptional. The fit and quality are great.

" 2:40 Mins I use the IMAK Hand / Elbow Arthritis Gloves and have been wearing them religiously for over four months now to sleep. They work great in relieving my hand pain and discomfort.I've been using these Vibrating gloves now for over 2 months and I must say they do add to my treatment. At first there is no noticeable difference but consistent use - for me that is once or twice a day, you do notice added pain relief. I think if you are expecting to put these on and be cured after one use, you don't understand the nature of arthritis. For me it is a constant regiment of being extra careful with my hands, wearing the compression gloves, watching my diet and using these vibrating gloves. All of this is continuous and if I stop the pain will return at a higher intensity.So basically it is like fighting a war in which you cannot let up - the treatment needs to be done everyday, probably for the rest of my life to prevent worse pain and discomfort. Like I mentioned in my IMAK glove review, my Grandma on my Dad's side had severe arthritis, my Mom and her Mom also have severe arthritis so it is no surprise to me at 43 years old that I have developed arthritis. Plus the work I do doesn't help -swimming pool service - constantly using my hands.These gloves work well and are an effective treatment over time. They are comfortable, charge quickly and relieve the pain in my hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AKC8TNDYLZO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJTI1LU#wasThisHelpful","R3AKC8TNDYLZO6","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After a long trip with the Rebel T5i I decided that the skin was needed to protect it and keep the body scratch free.You can see from the video that it fits the T5i really snug - like a glove. Some reviewers noted it was loose but not so in my case. Offers good protection, buttons are still accessible and it is very durable.

" 2:58 MinsThe reviews of System Mechanic scared me away. No way was I going to load a program that could crash my computer. the AVG seemed like a safe option - does just enough without potentially messing up the computer.Was thinking about replacing my slow, slow, slow Windows 7 desktop (2 years old) but for less than $20.00 why not try this - I thought. I ran a free program the night before to see if I had issues - I did (you will see that in the video). Loads of issues in fact.The AVG program downloaded just fine - product key is easy to find (it is also in your Amazon.com order e-mail receipt). Program is easy to work with - it does everything for you and you just need to click ""okay.""The dashboard is nice and user friendly and it comes with some very nice optimizing tools for the screen and programs to speed up the computer.

" 3:45 MinsBeen using a Pro Vac for almost 20 years now  - not the same one of course ;). They last about two-three years on my route. I also use the 22"" one for vacuuming my larger pools - also a great product.But the 14"" is my default vac head. It is easy to use, swivels nicely and is built to last. The seal on the bottom is great as it increases suction and allows for an overall better vacuuming job.The Good:smooth vacuuming with great ball bearing wheelsSeal on bottom allows for great suctionSwivel handle allows for sharp turnsPerfect size for the step area & spasGreat for spot vacuuming using automatic cleaner hosesExtra heavy weights so vac head won't floatComes with a swivel head attachmentBasically an all around great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B69BJ8YNQ88O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003840IV6#wasThisHelpful","R1B69BJ8YNQ88O","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:39 MinsLets start with the drawbacks of this cleaner. It is all plastic so if you drop it from any height you will probably crack it. It would be nice if this thing had some aluminium plating on the bottom and on the handle. So rule number one - don't drop the Pro 1500.It is too large to vacuum some step areas in a pool - not a major issue as you can brush the top step down.The back seal needs a lot of silicone lube to keep it water tight - but this thing is underwater for at least an hour each day so it makes sense the the battery compartment seal needs to be very strong.So that is the reason it got four stars - there is room for improvement.The Good now. The suction on this thing is great. When I tested it with my hand in the mouth the suction was similar to a vacuum hooked up to the skimmer on a 50 ft hose. It vacuums up the bottom really well. The Layered Debris bag traps both dirt and leaves no problem. It is a good size bag so you won't be stopping every few minutes.Note that a pile of leaves will clog up a standard manual vacuum and it will clog this one also. The opening is the same size as a manual vac and hose.The battery will last for about one hour or more - it comes with two so you can get 2-3 hours of vacuuming out of this thing no problem. That is good enough for my route.Has a nice shoulder strap for easy carrying. The Vac head it comes with is pretty good too and it comes with a standard plastic brush and wheel head too like the Pro 900.Very easy to maneuver in the pool and makes vacuuming a breeze.It comes with a one year warranty so that is a plus for sure - especially if you drop this thing ;).All in all a solid product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5R8AQ0RG37K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZCG482#wasThisHelpful","R1K5R8AQ0RG37K","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:21 MinsThis cleaner works well and if you experience a lack of suction simply tie part of the bag off with a rubber band - basically cut the debris bag in half and suction will increase tremendously. The bag actually sits too close to the motor impeller opening - so when it starts to get a little full suction will drop off. This trick will keep your cleaner suction strong even when the bag is filling.The overall design seems good, I've been using it everyday on my pool route and haven't had any charging issues or other problems - I did shorten the debris bag down to create more suction. I just keep the charging port well lubed with Magic Lube Silicone Lube to prevent water damage and make sure I drain the unit completely to prevent any motor damage. Simple steps to take so you aren't sending this thing into Warranty. I will update this review over time and let you know how my unit is holding up longer term.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33B8LOLIXJ7D0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B3SKN4#wasThisHelpful","R33B8LOLIXJ7D0","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:20 MinsFirst, the only difference between the MAX and the MAX CG is that the CG has a higher power rating. Is there a huge difference in suction? Not really. But it is noticeable and the CG runs louder when you turn it on.I did extensive research by reading the reviews here and on other sites. The main cause of failure seems to be not lubing the charging port before putting it in water. In the video you see me Lubing it up with Magic Lube Silicone Lube. Essential for a good water seal. Second, the motor on the Pool Blasters are vented to prevent overheating so you must completely drain it out off all water to prevent rust forming in the engine. Two simple things to remember.If you notice that you have a problem with the cleaner losing suction after a minute even with a clean debris bag I discovered a helpful trick. Simply tie the bottom portion of the bag off with a rubber band to shorten the bag. This creates more area for the impeller and will increase the suction dramatically.The improved debris bag that comes with this unit is quite good. It is multi-layered and although it looks and feels fragile it rinses out without ripping no problem. It also traps dirt very well.Suction drops off if the bag starts to get overfilled as the motor pulls water from behind the bag. Also, when the charge starts to weaken you will notice a drop off in suction. Fully charged and with a clean bag you can submerge it and stick your finger in the mouth and feel really good suction.It has the standard one year Warranty and like almost all manufacturer you will pay to ship it back. I hate that but it is common practice with almost every manufacturer. Shipped a basketball back to Spalding - paid $5.00, shipped a camera in to Cannon - $8.00, etc. Hopefully if you follow the tips listed you won't need to use the Warranty at all.Good solid cleaner and it does what it is designed to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23WJQOOJ2P7LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L61OGA#wasThisHelpful","R23WJQOOJ2P7LQ","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:59 MinsIf your looking for a good looking violin at rock bottom pricing this is it. If this is going on a shelf on display it will look like a $100+ instrument. The strings actually tighten well and the sound is decent. The bow as you can see from the video started falling apart from the first use. As a starter violin or if you are just going to dabble with it not a bad investment.Bottom line: good looking violin, great case, okay sound, poor quality bow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XCRJA0CI9YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVTAJMY#wasThisHelpful","R10XCRJA0CI9YN","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:42 MinsI was worried after reading the reviews stating the battery compartment didn't seal properly. That would be bad. But I was relieved when the unit I received had what I believe to be the updated battery compartment cap. The older units seem to come with one that had clips on the side so maybe that was the issue all along? Regardless, as you see in the video I load the battery compartment seal up with silicone lube like how my son likes his toast - ""lots of jelly Papa."" Safe to say I have opened it twice now in three weeks since getting it and no water inside, ""yeah!"" - If you haven't seen the video I use Magic Silicone Lube for the water seal.With that out of the way, this thing works great. It comes with 8 knock off Duracell looking batteries so I am sure it will run longer and better with fresh batteries. But so far no complaints. The power is good enough to do exactly what it designed to do - pick up the leaves on the bottom. Like all leaf vacs it won't pick up large branches or rocks, some small seed pods are okay - picks up good size acorns no problem. It is mainly for a pool with a lot of leaves.I like the fact that you are not dragging a garden hose around and you save water. So it is faster and easier to move this thing around.It comes with a one year warranty so if there is a problem you can get a replacement as some here have noted in their reviews. I like it and will use it on my pool route.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DVIB3ZK78Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYPRLH8#wasThisHelpful","R24DVIB3ZK78Q","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:35 MinsThere are a lot of different patches on the market and I chose this one based on the good reviews. I was surprised by how much material this kit actually comes with. Yes, the patch material is a little thin, but that shouldn't effect the long term hold of the patch as the actual vinyl liner is also quite thin itself. The glue is very good and pliable and they give you enough to do several patches. More glue than I expected. There is also instructions in Spanish and other languages.As you can see from the video it is pretty easy to do as long as you can reach the area to be patch (you might have to dive down in other cases).A good buy for the price and this seller shipped it to me in one day with AmazonPrime.

" 5:05 MinsI currently have this cleaner in my pool and it is spotless.This is the New redesigned and updated Kreepy Krauly by Pentair (Model 360040). If you have a Vinyl or Fiberglass pool you will need (Model 3060042) as it has a Pleated or Flat Seal.This is actually the first real overhaul of the cleaner since its inception. There have been over 3 million Kreepy Krauly cleaners sold Worldwide making it one of the most recognizable cleaners on the Market. My customers refer to their cleaner as Kreepy Krauly even if it is not one.I though I would be retired before Pentair remodeled their flagship cleaner. The version previous works great in the pools they are in so I figured they wouldn't mess with it. I'll be honest the old version was sometimes a hard sell since it did look dated. The new version just looks spectacular.From the color scheme down to the sleek new style it is a great looking cleaner. It will sell just on how cool it looks. But of course the other selling point and one that is more valid is that this cleaner is a Beast. It will pick up large debris that other cleaners won't even attempt to pick up. It also is designed to cover the entire pool when set up correctly. All in it is a design that really works.I will point out a few of the things I really like about the new unit. First, the cleaner itself is made out of a harder plastic that by the looks of it is very durable. The Kreepy already had parts that lasted forever so I expect this new one to have even more durable parts. The Seal plate is extra thick so it will also last longer.I like the new bumper. The Kreepy Krauly Classic works great but the bumper would sometimes not pull the cleaner out of the step area. This one has no issues and is designed to help the cleaner out of tight spots. Plus it looks very durable.I really like the adjustable Dive Float. One of the problems with the Kreepy Krauly is that it works too well. It would sometimes come out of the pool or get stuck on the hose coming out of the Side Port or Skimmer. Now you can simply adjust the Dive Float down to prevent that.The cleaner also comes with a generous amount of hoses, Twelve one Meter hoses or almost 40 ft of hoses.Suffice to say this is a great improvement over a cleaner that really didn't need to be improved. I highly recommend the New Kreepy Krauly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2ZWG4Y81D3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT62M8C#wasThisHelpful","R1K2ZWG4Y81D3Z","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It will not only work great but blend in to the pool surface and won't detract from the overall look of your pool.Here I give a review and show you how to properly install the Poolvergnuegen Limited Edition ""Dark Color"" 2 wheel suction side automatic pool cleaner. I feel that this is the best suction side cleaner on the market today.This cleaner works well in all pools and will not get stuck in any corners or on the steps (as long as you have the correct wheel RPMS). It is super reliable and the only part you need to change regularly is the tires (every 2 years or so). I have eight of these installed in various size and shaped pools on my route and have no issues thus far, 2 are over 4 years old.

Basically the problem here is that the dogs will swim in this pool every week and the gardener will blow dust and junk into the pool each week with his leaf blower. It really doesn't help that these tiles are light tan in color.So I scrubbed the tiles once again and then I added the ""Pool Perfect."" To be honest I didn't have high expectations at this account. The next week I was surprised to see the tile looking like I just cleaned them. I added two more capfuls of ""Pool Perfect"" and gave it another week. As you can see from the video after three weeks the tile is still looking like I just cleaned them (As of now it has been 5 weeks and the tile still looks great).  So I have been adding the maintenance dose each week now and  haven't had to scrub the tile line. This stuff works amazingly well.If you are interested in the tile brush (it actually attaches to a pole nicely but in this pool the decking overhangs at an angle so it is easier to use it by hand) Here is the make:Purity Pool TSQC Tile Scrubber with Quick ConnectIt comes with a regular pad but I upgrade to a more coarse one:Purity Pool RPC Replacement Pad for Tile Scrubber, Coarse","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPTBBTGE0U40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8Y4QCE#wasThisHelpful","R2PPTBBTGE0U40","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:22 MinsHere is Zodiac's newest cleaner the T3. I was skeptical about it since the T5 was less then spectacular. But the T3 is a surprisingly good cleaner. It is based partly on the T5 and I think it has some of the good qualities of the G2 also. It is weighted very well so it climbs the walls and moves at an excellent speed (once the suction is adjusted properly with the flow gauge that came with the cleaner).It reminds me of a mini G2 cleaner which I think is the best of the Zodiac bouncing suction side cleaners. I like the molded plastic as it feels very durable and I also like the fact that Zodiac kept things simple and this cleaner only has twelve parts. It operates with the one moving part concept, that being the new redesigned diaphragm.As you can see in the video it picks up debris very well  -not sure why the small rock stopped it but the big one didn't -- probably the angle of entry. You get the idea that it won't have any trouble in a pool that gets lots of debris. If it is pliable the diaphragm will pick it up.It did get stuck in one area of my pool by the steps when I manually dragged it to that spot and let it try to get out. But it hasn't gone to that spot by itself. I say what was happening to case it to get stuck and the solution was simple. At the recommended suction of ""3"" it just would wedge itself in the corner and couldn't get free. I lowered it down to ""2"" and it worked it's way out of the corner no problem. So the key if your T3 gets stuck in a corner is to lower the suction and it will work it's way free. I left it set at ""2"" so it won't get stuck in the future. Adjusting the hoses and weights won't solve this, just lower the suction.I think the cleaner is priced very well for what you get. I still wish Zodiac would include a threaded side port fitting with their cleaners. Most other cleaners come with it and to purchase one will cost you $20-$30. You can't hook it up to the threaded side port without it so if you don't have one you will need to purchase one. Here is the best one: Hayward W400BWHP White Free Rotation Vacuum Lock Safety Wall Fitting.The only problem I have is that the new style hoses are limiting. If you want to spot vacuum your pool or spa you can't just attach a vacuum head to the hose. Also, the twist lock elbow doesn't fit into the side port without a locking device and even then it isn't secured as well as universal type hose.  In the installation video I show this in more detail. I also will show you how to connect a leaf canister in the installation video --coming soon!Here are the good and bad points that you see at the end of the video expanded:The Good:Picks up lots of different size debris:It does a great job on the debris I gave it and gets a  thumbs up in that departmentVery well build and weighted down good:I can't say enough about the hard plastic body. It just feels indestructible. It feels heavy too which is good for balance in the pool as it climbs the walls and moves around.Moves around the pool really well:This cleaner moves at a very good pace -- just like the great G2 cleaner.  It will clean the entire pool in no time at all. It also goes up the walls with no problems.Comes with durable new style locking hoses:Okay, the hoses do have a good point. They look and feel very durable. But there was nothing really wrong with the old universal hoses.The Bad:Only has 30 feet of hoses :Two more hoses would have been nice. But it should work in most standard size pools.No side port connector device included:Again, a big gripe with Zodiac. Make a wall locking fitting for the side port and put it in the box.New style hoses limit spot vacuuming:Again, you can't really utilize these new hoses for manually vacuuming your pool or spa.Footpad & Finned Disk one part together:It looks like a good idea. But I don't think the parts on the old cleaner wear out at the same pace. It does save you one part by combing them together.All in all I give this cleaner four stars. I just am not a fan of the new locking hoses. Zodiac got it right again with the T3. They are back on track here and this one is a winner.If you need to connect a leaf canister to this cleaner here are the parts you will need to make the new style hose connection to the canister:Baracuda MX8 Cleaner Leaf Catcher Hose Adaptor R0533300Baracuda MX8 Cleaner Leaf Catcher Hose Adaptor X77094","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287OHKW66P1JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002IXKP2#wasThisHelpful","R287OHKW66P1JS","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:22 MinsWe were on the fence about ordering this Cutout. I couldn't find a review or a photo or video showing it next to a person so there was no way to know how it really looked. But we needed a centerpiece for my son's train theme party so we decided at the last minute to order this. I picked a seller in California hoping to get it in less than one week. The seller was great about tracking it down from the manufacturer and making sure we got it for our party. I would recommend the seller for sure:  Lamps Beautiful. They went out of their way on this one and we are very thankful.As you can see from the video it is a high quality photo on a piece of cardboard. It looks real so that was a relief. I thought it would be larger but it turned out to be a good size. I think there are some slightly larger ones available but my son likes cargo trains. I would recommend it for a party. It was packaged very well and is a good quality product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LMOCVHQR1KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6NBB9U#wasThisHelpful","R22LMOCVHQR1KA","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:47 MinsHere is a product review video of the Nordic Flash Floating Camera Strap for your digital Waterproof camera. I am using a Samsung HMX here but it works also on Your Underwater GoPro/Panasonic Lumix/Nikon COOLPIX AW110/Canon PowerShot D20/Fujifilm FinePix/Olympus Tough/Sony.This is a handy thing to have if your going to use your camera while fishing on the lake, swimming in the Ocean and even in your backyard pool. Here is the cool thing about it - it is a 2 pack. That means you get two floats for the price of one.At the end of the video I show me using both floats on the camera. Being in the pool industry I know one thing about water - it will destroy everything eventually - especially salt water. So if you are using this a year from now and the plastic or strap has been weakened by constantly being in water and it snaps while you are swimming in Lake Baikal in Siberia Russia your camera will sink 1,637 Meters or  5,369 feet (deepest lake on Earth). But wait, you had two floats holding your camera so all is well Comrade ;)That is one of the major complaints I was reading about these floating straps - but the Nordic Flash solves this problem by giving you two floating straps. Very nice.The Nordic Strap is very comfortable while on your wrist and the strap has good slack so you can shot videos or photos while the camera is strapped on.  The color is bright enough to see from very far away and it floats very well with the camera attached if it were to come off your wrist. But it fits on your wrist very snug.Did I mention it is a 2 pack? Excellent product.Oh, I received this product for free for a review on my YouTube Channel - but I thought I should post a review here also.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BWW8KWSQGJRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JA0BN6#wasThisHelpful","R2BWW8KWSQGJRX","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:06 Mins***Update*** 6/14/2015 - after a year and a half the drive is still working great. No issues at all with the drive so I think I am in the clear.Got this drive delivered on a Sunday by AmazonPrime. Wasn't home to see who dropped it off, maybe a local Warehouse employee...So far this drive is impressive. It connected to my computer within seconds. If you watch the video you will see it backing up my photos pretty quickly through the 3.0 USB port.It is super quite. It is backing up as I type and my Desktop is louder then this thing.It is compact. About the size of a VHS tape. If you don't know what that is  that means I am getting old. If I had one of my Dad's 8 tracks around I would have used that ;)It comes in a hard metal case which is pretty cool. It adds some heft to this little drive. It also makes me think it is durable. I think that also raises the price point above other drives in it's category.I will update this review in a couple of months to let you know if the drive is still doing well. So far I like it.

" 3:35 MinsThere are a lot of different patches on the market and I chose this one based on the good reviews. I was surprised by how much material this kit actually comes with. Yes, the patch material is a little thin, but that shouldn't effect the long term hold of the patch as the actual vinyl liner is also quite thin itself. The glue is very good and pliable and they give you enough to do several patches. More glue than I expected. There is also instructions in Spanish and other languages.As you can see from the video it is pretty easy to do as long as you can reach the area to be patch (you might have to dive down in other cases).A good buy for the price and this seller shipped it to me in one day with AmazonPrime.

"I have this card in my Samsung Galaxy III.It has been in there now for about 8 months with no issues. Okay, it had one issue but that was the phone design itself. It would un-mount if the phone was moved around roughly. It seems to pop out very easy in the Samsung Galaxy phones. So I solved the problem by putting some electrical tape on it to hold it in. So far after 8 months it hasn't un-mounted. It will give you an ungodly amount of storage on this phone. If your wondering if your Samsung Phone will take this card - it will with no issues. It shows a total of 59.6 GB of available space once installed.

"I wanted to make sure this thing held up before I reviewed it. So far it still snaps shut and is used almost everyday while driving. It attaches to the dashboard of my Lexus (it is that soft but rigid leather material) and so far has stayed on like it is super glued on there. Apparently it can be removed and moved but why mess with perfection.It holds my Samsung Galaxy III which already is a huge phone, but wait! Add an Otterbox Case to make it look like it is on Steroids! But it still fits in this holder nicely. I have it a little high in the holder so I can reach the volume button if needed. If you clip this phone type directly in on center the volume button is covered by the clips. Not a huge issue.This is a really good Car mount if you have this cell phone.

"So you got one of those Visa Gift Card Credit Cards for Christmas, huh. I got a $100.00 one and I hate splitting the balance in a store. It is confusing to the cashier and annoying when the line is held up because the exact balance is off.So use it on amazon.com instead  by purchasing a gift card for yourself.Enter your name and e-mail as the gift card recipient.Just enter the card like this:Name on Card: Gift Card Recipient (that is what it says on mine for the name)Card Number: the 16 -digit card numberExpiration date: mine was 02/22 - Wow - that is a long time from now.After that finish the order and an e-mail will be sent to you. In my case I had $100 in my amazon.com gift account instantly.This is a nice way to use up the card if you don't want to spend the complete $100 at once.

"Okay, Windows 8 is complicated. 8.1 makes things a bit easier  -at least the start Icon is on the bottom in Desktop mode. But for a 92 year old codger it can be mind boggling. He finally needed a newer computer and so he entered the strange world of Windows 8 (Rod Sterling is standing over your shoulder). I sent him some YouTube videos to watch but he is ""Old School"" and needs to hold a book in his hands. This book is perfect as it has great pictures which makes it very easy to follow. He should now be able to handle Windows 8.1 without pulling the remaining hair out of his head ;)I gave him two tips before getting the book and they might help you also:If you get stuck just hit the ""windows"" key on the keyboard and it will take you back to the ""Start"" menu - the screen with all the tiles. Then if you need to escape and take a breather click on the ""Desktop"" Icon and relax as you view Windows again. All is right with the world. This key is located on the bottom left between the ""FN"" and the ""ALT"" key. it has four squares on it and look like a window.There are some full screen apps now which means there is no ""x"" at the top to close it. Help! You are now trapped forever on that screen... you can hit that ""window"" key on the keyboard again to escape. To close a full screen app simply scroll the mouse to the very top, it will transform into a hand. From there drag the mouse down and to the bottom of the screen. The full screen app should shrink and as it reaches the bottom (it will drop halfway through the bottom of the screen) it will close.There is an alternate way to close these full screen apps but this way is pretty easy. I don't see the point of full screen apps. They confuse the heck out of everyone.So these two tips saved him as he waited for this book to arrive.For more tips of course get this book and read it. It is handy to have around if you are new or even have used Windows 8 or 8.1 for awhile now. Very useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM62UL4VPWGYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111882623X#wasThisHelpful","RM62UL4VPWGYT","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There were so many choices for screen protectors on Amazon so I went with the one with the best reviews. Turns out to be a good choice.These things cover the entire front of the ASUS MeMo Pad FHD right up to the edge area which is great. The slit for the front facing camera is just perfect.Okay, I will admit it, this is something I can't do so I let my wife do it. I just am not a detailed Perfectionist type like her ;)The first try was a botched attempt because some bubbles formed due to dust on the screen. My fault as the table she was working on was a little cluttered ( got yelled at for that). So she pealed it off and tried with number two on the kitchen counter. This one went on perfect with no bubbles.It fits so good that you won't even know it is on there. Doesn't effect the screen quality or touch sensitivity in the least. But you must put it on in an area that is 100% dust free and clean -if anything gets under the screen during the application it will not look good. That is how good it sticks to the screen. We could see the dust trapped under it in the first try.Not the manufacturers fault but the envelop was a little bent even though it says on there in big type ""Do Not Bend.""

It seems very well constructed for the price. This model CHH received the best reviews so I decided to try it out. I didn't want a full size table since they take up a lot of space. This one is portable and small enough to put away after playing with it.It is a great size table for my 5 year old son. The players spin well and though some have commented on the thin hollow rods, they seem fine. The bottom fit in snugly and all the parts fit well.

It is made of hard plastic and though it looks like a toy it works very well.It comes with a good plastic bat and three rubber balls. It can probably pop-up or pitch at least five balls before it runs through it's cycle and turns off. It runs for a short cycle and then turns off so that is a nice feature. It takes four ""D"" batteries not included of course ;)My son loves it. As you can see from the video this thing really works.

" 2:33 MinsThis case is really good. The tablet fits in there very snugly and doesn't move around at all. The quality of the case is great also. I mainly purchased this for the stand option. I like the dual stand mode and the fact that it is not held up by a tab cut into the back of the case like the cheaper versions (which tend to weaken over time/use). It is a sturdy product with all the buttons and cable hook-ups easily accessible. The video will cover all of this also if you watch it.Good point:All the cable holes are uncoveredThe volume button is also uncoveredThe speakers in the back of the ASUS are uncovered by the case as it has two slits down the backThe top switch is uncoveredWell made caseNice colorBad points:Makes the tablet a bit heavierThe camera hole will create a shadow unless you unvelcro the holder part before taking a photo.A great case for your tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CMH1ONS42T3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00316GARM#wasThisHelpful","R3CMH1ONS42T3U","A10TF6TUAV0XZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10TF6TUAV0XZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My eyes can be sensitive to light and I never drive without sunglasses. Even with sunglasses, though, sometimes the light glare can be difficult. For instance, when you find yourself driving behind a silver car and the sun glares off that car in a way that blinds you. Not to mention that driving with sunglasses on at night doesn’t really work, but some cars headlights blind you.The HD Vision Visor is a great way to reduce the glare from the sun or oncoming headlights.

"It is so annoying when you drop things in that gap between the seats in your car. Sometimes you can find the item again, and sometimes you can’t. Even when you do find the dropped item, reaching it can be tricky. Months ago, I dropped a micro SD card in that area and was extremely lucky to have found it, but it was very difficult. The solution? Prevent things from falling down there in the first place.The Catch Caddy Car Seat Catcher, Car Organizer is a great way to handle that. You still drop things, but instead of getting lost under the car seat, they fall into this caddy, and you simply pull the caddy out and retrieve your item.I had a bit of trouble with it popping out at first, but I finally got it pushed down far enough between the seats to stay put.This is a set of two, which is great for those of you with two gaps to accommodate. My Chevy Impala only has one, so I have a spare on hand in case something happens to the one I’m currently using.This is a very simple device that is infinitely useful.I received a complementary sample unit for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKAQBQJMKK7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV46AWQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FKAQBQJMKK7M","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is handy to have a scale around the house. I have a postage scale and I have a kitchen scale, both of which have been very useful to me. I was intrigued by the portability of the Smart Weigh Digital Pro Pocket Scale with Back-Lit LCD Display, Tare, Hold and PCS Features 500 x 0.01g (2 Lids Included).It is important to note, that while the size and weight of this scale are very convenient, its maximum weight capacity is 500 g, so if you need something that can handle bigger items, this is not the scale for you.If you just need to weigh small packages or letters, jewelry, or ingredient portions in the kitchen, then this scale may be just the thing for you.It is battery operated, and the manufacturer includes two AA batteries in the device. The LCD panel is easy to read and the unit has an auto shut off feature to help prevent draining your batteries. I weighed several items on this scale and then my other scales to compare, and this scale reported the same weight as the others each time. So, either this one is accurate or they are all wrong by the same amount.If you need a small, portable scale, you’ll definitely want to give this a look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32REDEBLLSEO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME8VI34#wasThisHelpful","R32REDEBLLSEO1","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to cook and often host dinner parties for friends and family. In order to accommodate food issues for various guests, I often end up making two entrees in addition to sides, salad, and dessert. Needless to say, I go through a few dishes in the process, especially measuring spoons and measuring cups. One thing I don’t want to have to do while in the middle of cooking such a big meal is to stop and wash the measuring cups I need to use again soon. I prefer to have several sets.The OXO Good Grips Plastic Measuring Cups, 6-Piece, Black is a good set to have on hand. This set offers five measuring cups and a leveler tool in this set, all of which nest and lock together very well to keep all of the pieces together. The cups are well marked on the outside of the cup near the top so you can easily see the size you need before you take them apart.I was surprised to find that Oxo included a 2/3 cup in this set – I’ve never seen that size before. Along with the 2/3 cup, you’ll find the standard  cup, 1/3 cup, ½ cup, and 1 cup measuring cups. The leveler is a nice touch, but unnecessary in my opinion. It works, but a butter knife works just as well. In fact, I can’t attach the leveler tool to the top of the stack if I want to store them in the drawer where I keep my other measuring cups because the leveler makes it just a bit too tall for that drawer.These measuring cups can be easily washed by hand or in the dishwasher. I am very pleased with them and would recommend them to anyone who needs a set of measuring cups..","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37Y1QZI8FP8H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X2CWQ#wasThisHelpful","R37Y1QZI8FP8H3","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"New computers or CD/DVD burners come with software to create and copy discs, but that software is usually a starter edition that provides basic functionality. This is enough for the general user, but there are times when you need your media creation software to be a bit more robust.I’ve had TiVo since the first model came out and one of my favorite features is its ability to transfer recorded programs to your computer, where the show can be burned to a DVD. Since this TiVo feature was introduced, there has always been only brand of media burning software at a time that could transcode the TiVo video format to DVD. That started with a different company, but Roxio bought them several years back.I have to say that I have always been disappointed that Roxio has offered less functionality for creating DVDs from TiVo files than the previous company offered, but the software still works well for the core function, transcoding the video. What is missing is a lot of extra templates and features that made the menu screens for the DVDs a bit spiffier. And of course if you need software that can create a DVD from a TiVo file, Roxio is your only option today.Roxio does a great job of burning copies of CDs and DVDs as well as creating new ones. You can use it to create back-up discs of your data as well.Roxio Creator NXT 3 does a lot more than burn discs, however. You can use it to edit video, make movies and slideshows, and even record directly from your computer’s screen using the new ‘Live Screen Capture’ feature. As with previous versions, you can also convert videos to formats that can be transferred to and played on portable devices like iPods.This version of Roxio supports a variety of Windows operating systems, including Window 8, Windows XP, and all of the workstation class versions of Windows in between those two.The install of Roxio went smoothly on both of my Windows 7 x64 computers and the software runs very well on both.If all you need to do is to make copies of discs or burn data to discs, I recommend you stick with the software that came with your computer or optical drive. If you want a full-featured media creation program that can edit and create video and turn TiVo files into DVDs that can be played on most DVD players, then you will want Roxio Creator NXT 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PWCAOSCI095/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMQLT6C#wasThisHelpful","R2PWCAOSCI095","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using a few different power banks, I’ll never buy a spare battery for a smartphone again. It is so much easier and more economical to use a power bank. A spare battery can only be used with one device, but power banks work wonderfully for charging most devices that charge via a USB port.The Eachine Mini Y5 6000mah Super Compact LCD External Battery Power Bank is a great option for anyone who wants a small, lightweight power bank that still packs a lot of battery juice. With 6000 mah, this unit can charge my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone fully more than twice.This power bank comes with the unit itself and a micro USB cable that you can use to charge the power bank and also to connect a device to the power bank. Like all of the other power banks I’ve had, this one doesn’t come with a power adapter, but the device can be charged using any USB power adapter or the USB port on a computer.Most power banks have a built in flashlight and this one has a good bulb in it.Because it is smaller in size, it only has one USB port, so you can only charge one device at a time with this unit. You can find power banks with two USB ports, but they will be larger and heavier. This one fits easily in my pocket.One thing I really like about this one is the digital display, which shows you how much charge is left on the device. It never shows 100% - the maximum charge I’ve seen is 99%, which is not a problem for me. Although this did cause me some confusion Christmas Day. I’d used the device the day before and plugged it in before bedtime Christmas Eve so it would be ready to use the next morning. When I woke, it had only charged up to 66%. I plugged it into another device to charge it and hours later it still showed only 66% charged. I decided to deplete the battery completely by leaving the flashlight on all night. When I picked it up to turn on the light, it finally struck me that I had set it on the nightstand upside down, so it was actually charged to 99% the whole time! I had to laugh at myself, but in my defense Christmas Day was pretty hectic.I would recommend this power bank to anyone looking for a powerful yet lightweight device to charge their USB powered electronics on the go.I received a complementary sample unit for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMUQMWAPM2ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUS0BQW#wasThisHelpful","R3TMUQMWAPM2ET","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have five cats and I spoil them a little. I don’t let them run wild, but I do like to reward them when possible. I don’t give them treats every day, but they do get them several times a week. I normally buy treats with seafood or catnip flavors, but I recently tried TEMPTATIONS TUMBLERS Chicken & Turkey Flavor Treats for Cats, and they have thoroughly enjoyed them. How do I know? Well, they ate them. And as anyone who has a cat knows, cats don’t eat something they don’t care for. In fact, one of my male cats doesn’t like soft food or soft treats – he only eats crunchy food and treats. He love these.The manufacturer tries to play up the round shape, saying that they are fun for cats to roll around and play with. Mine don’t play with these treats – they just eat them.

"Even when I was slim, I sometimes wanted to wear something that helped flatten my tummy a little. When I worked in a bank, it was usually control top pantyhose – which I hated wearing. When I don’t have to wear pantyhose, I normally choose some shaper wear. I recently tried the Maidenform Flexees Women's Shapewear Brief Firm Control, Blush, X Large.The first time I wore it, a couple of people at work asked me if I had lost weight. These people see me every day, so that was a good sign. I wore it all day under my work clothes and I do think it helped flatten my stomach a little.I’ve worn an X-Large size for a couple of years now and while I am still that size, I have lost some weight in the last few months – the looser waistbands on my pants and skirts prove that. Even so, the X-Large size of the Maidenform shapewear fit a bit tighter than I thought they should. It felt fine in the stomach area, but it cut into my skin a little around the leg holes and the waist of the shapewear.I think the product works, but I am not sure if the uncomfortable fit is due to the way it is cut or if they are just sized smaller than they actually are. If you try these, I would recommend ordering a size larger than you normally wear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4QX7F44D0S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007QMKLY#wasThisHelpful","R2F4QX7F44D0S9","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love music and carry my iPod Classic everywhere I go. I have my whole music collection on that iPod so I can enjoy any song in my collection. I also have a lot of my favorites on my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone. My iPod Classic requires headphones or an external speaker to listen to them and although the Samsung phone has a speaker built in, a phone’s speaker is never really ideal for listening to music.The BeoPlay A2 – Grey is a great option for me. With its 3.5mm audio port, I can plug my iPod or other devices directly into it, but with its Bluetooth connectivity, I can connect many more devices to it wirelessly.The BeoPlay also has a USB port built in that you can use to keep a device like a smartphone charged using the battery in the BeoPlay. That battery can last up to 24 hours, but if you use it to charge another device, it would shorten that time. One thing that disappointed me about the charging function is that it only charged a device while it was playing sound from it. If I stopped playing something on my smartphone, the BeoPlay powered off after a short while and then stopped charging my phone.The BeoPlay comes with a power adapter to charge it, but no other cables. You must provide your own 3.5mm stereo cables or USB cables if you need them.The sound on this speaker is really phenomenal. It gives 360 degree sound coverage and the audio quality has a depth to it you just don’t get on a smartphone speaker.I am very happy with this speaker.

"I like my make-up to look natural, but that doesn’t mean I won’t jazz it up a bit with some glittery eye shadow when the occasion warrants it. JAPONESQUE Velvet Touch Shadow Palette, Shade 02 gives me a nice, subtle eye color that allows for a little sparkle when you want it.Combining some matte colors with the glittery colors makes it easy to dress your eye make-up up or down with this one palette.I haven’t used this brand before, but I have to say I like the colors and I like how smoothly the shadow applies and blends. Although I do like it, I can’t say I would buy it myself when the drugstore brand work just as well at a fourth of the price that Japonesque charges for this one.The eye shadow kit comes with a mirror built in, but doesn’t contain any applicators, which surprised me.

"My old shower curtain had a long life, but was finally ready to go. Raising kittens a year ago didn’t help it – apparently they liked nibbling on the edges of the curtain, which facilitated the sides tearing.One of my major requirements in a shower curtain is that it be machine washable. Being able to run it through the washing machine periodically extends the life of the shower curtain liner immensely, while maintaining a sanitary condition in the shower. The LiBa Shower Curtain Liner, PEVA Antimicrobial PVC Free Shower Curtain meets this requirement.The grommets for the shower curtain rings feel strong, which means they are less likely to rip with daily use. The liner itself is not quite as heavy as my old one, which means it billows in while I am showering, unlike the old one I had which had more weight to it. With this lighter one from LiBa, I have to set a couple of things on the liner to weight it down. This works since it is hanging in a regular tub with a ledge I can use for this and not a shower stall.That’s really my only disappointment with this liner.

"The Sterling Silver Pink Crystal Bow Pendant Necklace with Swarovski Elements is not a necklace I would have chosen for myself simply because the bow design isn’t really my style. Looking at the photos of this necklace on the Amazon product page, I thought it looked OK, but didn’t expect to like it as much as I did when I saw it in ‘person’, so to speak.The close up photos made me think the bow pendant was larger than it is and the crystal stones look like they have a lot of gaps between them.

The stones are set very close together so that I can’t see any obvious space between them.The silver chain is very nice and I will get a lot of use out of it for more than just this pendant.

"I love jewelry and go back and forth between gold and silver. I really don’t have a preference outside of which suits that particular piece of jewelry best as well as which metal works better for my outfit. Having seen the Sterling Silver Blue Crystal Dangle Earrings with Swarovski Elements in photos online, I thought these earrings looked pretty, but now that I have seen them up close, I think the photos don’t really do them justice.The product page for these earrings gives the dimensions, but I am really not good at envisioning a thing’s sized based on measurements. From the photos, I worried these earrings would be a bit larger than they are. Instead, they are large enough to catch attention, yet small enough to avoid being tacky.Also, the close up photos of this jewelry makes it appear as if there is a lot of space between each stone, but that is misleading. The stones are nestled next to each other both on the outer edge and in the middle of the design with no gaps obvious to the naked eye.The gradient shades of blue will allow these earrings to blend with several hues of that color and I have a semi-formal dress that these will be perfect with.I am thrilled with these earrings and would highly recommend them.I received a complementary sample unit for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MZ05E8W4YCWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFX4RV8#wasThisHelpful","R1MZ05E8W4YCWC","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to graphics creation and editing, I am still very much a novice. I have advanced computer skills, but that isn’t enough when you are working with graphics – you also have to understand the artistry of the task. I don’t know if I will ever be more than an amateur when it comes to this kind of technical work, but luckily Corel helps me be better than I am at it.I’ve used several Corel products in the past, and one thing has stood out for me above all other features with this brand – they really make an effort to hand-hold their users through the software. The software has all the power to satisfy advanced users (I am taking the word of a friend who is proficient with graphics editing) but they don’t turn their nose up at people like me. I’ve honestly found Adobe Photoshop a bit intimidating – I haven’t used the current versions, so I am speaking of older editions of Adobe Photoshop. I have never felt this way about Corel, at least not for long.Corel includes built-in help to guide users through the plethora of tools built into Corel Painter 2015, and they also have a great series of video tutorials published at YouTube. I am still working my way through these tutorials, but have learned a bit already.I also appreciate that this software doesn’t utilize a lot of system resources. I can run Corel Painter 2015 alongside other applications with no degradation in system performance. Of course, Corel provides options where you can set how much memory and other system resources are being devoted to Corel, which is a huge plus.Like I said before, I am an amateur when it comes to graphic editing, but with Corel Painter 2015, I don’t have to look like it.

"I do not recommend Standing Stone Farm. I enjoyed the beginner's cheese making class I took there, but have not had a good experience with them since. In April 2013, I signed up for an Intermediate class to be held in August 2013. They charged me the $150 as soon as I registered in April 2013. When the date of the class drew near, the owner, Paula Butler, cancelled the class, for seemingly good reasons. She said she would reschedule it in Oct or Nov 2013, but she did not. She also did not provide refunds, promising the class would be rescheduled in Spring 2014 'when the goats would be active.' I waited patiently, still interested in the class. It is now Summer of 2014, 14 months after she charged me for the class, and I still don't have my money, nor has she rescheduled the class.

I'm of the firm belief companies like this should not charge the customer until the class/service date is near or until the goods are ready to be shipped. I probably shouldn't have trusted her when she said she was going to reschedule it, but the beginner's class I took went so well and I really didn't want to lose my spot in the Intermediate class, which only allowed 8 students and she said she hasn't offered this class in several years.After the last year of stressing over this, the idea of this class is no longer fun at all. She could come to my house to teach me and I don't think I would want to do it now. I'm too upset. The lack of response is really the icing on the cake.After I began posting online reviews and warnings, I got a reply from a relative of the owner. She said the payment is nonrefundable - even though the owner cancelled the class and has refused to schedule another in 14 months. At this point, I will start filing complaints with the BBB and any other regulatory agency that might cover this situation.If you are interested in cheese-making supplies or cheese-making classes, find a more reputable company unless you have money to throw away should they randomly decide to take your money and not provide the service or goods you paid for. Standing Stone Farms is not reputable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAV2UKJSWHMAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVKC44O#wasThisHelpful","RAV2UKJSWHMAF","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to cook, and I prefer to make things from scratch whenever possible. Fresh ingredients always produce better flavors and are usually healthier. I had never thought about having a puree maker, but when I saw the Paderno World Cuisine Puree Maker, I was curious – especially after I saw other people use it to make homemade marinara sauce.I haven’t yet used it for marinara sauce as I am looking for a good recipe that calls for it to be pureed, but I did recently make a strawberry puree using this gadget. Honestly, I think I will use this more for fruit purees than for marinara sauce anyway. I found a simple recipe for strawberry puree that called for frozen strawberries and sugar. After thawing the strawberries, I drained them and ran tham through the Paderno device. Cranking the handle was not at all difficult with this ingredient and I pureed a 48-ounce bag of strawberries very quickly. The puree is deposited to a puree cup and the juice ran off into a different cup.I can’t say this is a device I will use often, but I will use it more. I can see this being a very useful gadget for anyone who wants to make homemade baby food.The device was not well packed inside the Paderno World Cusine packaging and the puree cup was broken when it arrived on my doorstep. I contacted their customer service, and they shipped a replacement part to me in about a week. I was very pleased with their customer service – problems occur with any product, and all I ask for is good customer service policies and personnel ready to make the problems right.One other thing of note: I was disappointed in the manual. They include a one page sheet of instructions that could be improved. It really doesn’t make it clear how to remove some of the parts that come pre-assembled. Also, for an item like a puree maker that many people would have few immediate uses for, it would be a good idea for the manufacturer to include some recipes in the manual that utilize their device.If you have ingredients you need to puree, I would recommend this device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U6BBDDGP1AVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSI1TDK#wasThisHelpful","R3U6BBDDGP1AVB","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don’t drink coffee every day, but I do keep an automatic coffeemaker set up in the kitchen for those days when I am in the mood for it or when I have company that would like a cup. I’ve had several automatic coffeemakers over the years and you would think that they would all be pretty much the same. For the most part that is correct, but I have owned one Mr. Coffee unit that was terrible – it frequently leaked water all over the counter when you tried to make coffee.The Black and Decker CM3005S 12-Cup Tea and Coffeemaker definitely has no issues with leaks. This appliance has all of the most popular features that most people have come to expect in an automatic coffeemaker: Sneak-a-cup feature, auto brew and auto shutoff, permanent filters, and an automatic cleaning system.On top of those common features, this maker also has something I’ve never seen in a coffeemaker before: you can brew tea in it using a special tea filter included in the package. Being allergic to tea, I cannot test that feature myself. What I can say about the tea brewing feature is that it has its own filter that works in the same carafe that you use for coffee, and special brew settings on the control panel that you select for tea. I will keep this feature in mind when I have guests that drink tea, though.When I first get a new coffeemaker, I like to run it through a cleaning cycle before I use it – just like I wash new dishes or pots and pans before use. The manual instructs to use a vinegar and water solution with the cleaning cycle option, and then run a rinse cycle afterwards to remove any vinegar residue that might be left behind. This worked very well, and I will perform this task regularly to keep the maker clean and the coffee fresh tasting. The removable parts (carafe, permanent filters and filter basket) all can be run through a dishwasher cycle to clean them or can be washed by hand if you prefer.As with most automatic coffeemakers, this one has a clock and a timer to automatically start brewing at a specified time. I did test this once and it worked well, but I was raised to unplug coffeemakers when they aren’t being used, so I don’t use this feature on a regular basis. For me, it is just as easy to set up the coffee the night before, and then just plug it in and press the power button when I wake up. With the Sneak-a-Cup feature that lets you pour a cup of coffee before the brewing cycle is complete, the timer function is even less important to me, although it is nice to have it in case I need it.One feature I do really like is the ‘Strong’ button. Choosing this setting allows the unit to brew a stronger pot of coffee, which I prefer. I can’t stand a weak, watery tasting cup of coffee.There is also a switch that tells the maker whether you are brewing a full pot of coffee or only 1-4 cups.When the coffee completes the brewing cycle, a short series of beeps sounds to alert you that it is done. The coffeemaker emits a similar series of beeps when the automatic shutoff feature activates a couple of hours later.I mentioned before that the unit comes with a permanent filter for brewing tea, and it also includes a gold-tone filter for the coffee grounds. Brewing with a reusable filter like this saves money on coffee filters over time, and I much prefer this.I am very pleased with this coffeemaker, and would recommend it to anyone who needs a good automatic coffeemaker – especially if someone in your household drinks tea also.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O7OFQH3GTAK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I43C#wasThisHelpful","R3O7OFQH3GTAK5","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first books I ever read by Lori Foster were the stories in her ‘Love Undercover’ series. Something about those stories grabbed me and wouldn’t let go – I devoured each title in that saga. I first ‘met’ the main characters of ‘No Limits’ in that series when Cannon and Yvette appeared as supporting characters. They were very young in those books, and so I really didn’t think about them possibly having their own book.When I saw this pair starring in ‘No Limits’, I had high expectations based on the ‘Love Undercover’ books. After I began reading this book, I realized their world felt very different from the one I had been so intrigued by in the ‘Love Undercover’ series and it just didn’t click for me. I was about halfway through this book when I realized that while ‘No Limits’ is connected to the ‘Love Undercover’ books, it is actually in a different series with a different theme.In the other series, one of the main characters was always in law enforcement and the case they were engaged in was the back plot for the story, often throwing the main characters together very often. In this new series, titled ‘Hard Knocks’, the theme changes from law enforcement to the fighting arena, where the heroes are all MMA fighters. Not only that, but the lead characters are considerably younger than those in the other series. Neither the fight world nor the age group of the lead characters really intrigued me much.Worse, something about Yvette just left me feeling flat. While I could understand why a woman would fall for Cannon, I could never really see why he fell for her. Granted, love doesn’t often make sense, but I felt like their connection was somewhat forced, despite the shared trauma they experienced together in the past. I also felt like her reactions to certain situations just didn’t ring true.If this had been the first time I had read a book by Lori Foster, I doubt I would read another. Thankfully, I have enjoyed some of her other books, so I know this is unusual. I can’t say it is a bad book, it is just not a great book. Perhaps someone who is into MMA fighting or enjoys romances with young adults would appreciate this story more than I did. While I will certainly read other books by this author, I won’t continue reading the ‘Hard Knocks’ series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYXWZ1JFOSMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373779046#wasThisHelpful","R1YYXWZ1JFOSMM","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I finished reading the first book in Alessandra Torre’s “Innocence” series, I had to buy the sequel, “Masked Innocence.” Our hero and heroine went through quite an evolution in the first part of their story, but in the second book, we learn they both have a long way to go before they even think of the possibility of a happy ending. This pair is so different in nearly every way that one wonders how they will make it, but one thing never in doubt is their love and commitment to one another.This story puts both characters through the wringer in so many ways, testing the depths of their love for one another again and again. There are times when lesser people would throw in the towel and call it quits, but circumstances make that an impossible choice – especially for Brad. He truly has grown in leaps and bounds from the confirmed bachelor we met in “Blindfolded Innocence” to the man who would do anything for those he loves.The author certainly throws these two for a loop in her story, but still manages to ramp up the kink to a delicious level that is bound to inspire fantasies in all but the most conservative readers. I should say, if your tastes in romance lean toward the conservative, this is probably not the book for you. If you like to fantasize about things you would likely never do but find it fun to read about, then you should enjoy “Masked Innocence” as much as I did.Just as when I finished the first book in this series, I bought and read the last book in the series as soon as I finished this one. “Masked Innocence” is the kind of book that makes me appreciate the instant gratification ebooks afford me even more than ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KV5X5YZKN1DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778376#wasThisHelpful","R2KV5X5YZKN1DC","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘Blindfolded Innocence’ is the first book I’ve ever ready by author Alessandra Torre, and it definitely will not be the last. When I finished reading this book, I immediately ordered the second in the ‘Innocence’ series from the review list. Within an hour I decided there was no possible way I could wait for that print copy to be shipped to me and bought the Kindle version so I could continue this addictive story without further delay.With Brad and Julia, this author has created two characters that felt so real to me that I often forgot it was a fictional book and not actually Julia’s diary I was reading. This book is written in first person, using Julia’s perspective, so the reader really gets the chance to emulate all of the mixed emotions Julia deals with during and after each interaction with the utterly confounding and irresistible Brad.So help me, as much as he did frustrate her, I found myself wishing for a man like him to barrel into my life and sweep me off of my feet. Of course, this isn’t a sweet romance with flowers and candy. No, this is one scorching hot affair that sweeps Julia up like a tidal wave with no idea of where she will end up.Both of the lead characters are complicated people and while they have plenty of differences, once they do get together it is easy to see what each of them like about the other.‘Blindfolded Innocence’ is the first part of a three (and a half) book story. There is definitely a cliffhanger at the end, so be prepared to buy the other books in the series if you want the complete story. I knew this when I got the first one, so it didn’t bother me, but I can imagine how disappointed another reader might be if they didn’t realize this book wasn’t the complete story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J34S00D28QS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778287#wasThisHelpful","R1J34S00D28QS0","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Currently, I have five cats in my home. Two of them are about eighteen months old, one is about three years old, and the other two are about sixteen years old. The older cats pretty much stick to a routine of nap and eat, but the younger cats need stimulation – especially if I want them to sleep through the night and not wake me. I have several toys I use with them, but I like to have a couple of hands-off toys so that I can tire them out a bit even when I don’t have time to sit and play myself.The SmartyKat FeatherWhirl Electronic Motion Ball is definitely interesting to my youngest two cats. Since I turned it on, they’ve been stalking it in the bathroom. Of course, it has been mostly that slow-motion stalking that cats are known for, but as they got more used to it, that did progress into full on batting it with the paws, picking it up and carrying it off, and the like.The toy needs two AA batteries, which are not included. You will need a small Philips head screwdriver to open the battery compartment and to close it again. Once that is done, slide the stick with the feather on the peg atop the ball, and press the power button on the side to activate it. I’ve had some cat toys that had no power button, requiring removing the batteries every time I need to turn it off, so I have come to appreciate a power button more than you know.Set the toy on the floor, and it begins a series of random twists and turns, flicking the feather on the end of the stick around in a way that will surely entice most cats as much as it did mine. As with most of these motion toys, this will work best on a hard floor, so if you don’t have much space without carpet, this may not be a good toy for you. That said, even though it doesn’t move around much on carpet, it still wiggles in a way that they like.Most of my home is carpeted, with the exception of the bathrooms, kitchen, and the dining room. I usually put this kind of toy in the larger bathroom, which works well until it ends up trapped against the cabinet. I also put it in the bathtub, which works well and allows it to move a lot, but of course the tub isn’t very big.As I’ve written this, the kittens’ stalking of the SmartyKat toy has definitely picked up its pace and progressed to full on capture and growling. These kittens are from the same litter, and are having a great time playing with this gadget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODKGOSK6R01H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQGRIKI#wasThisHelpful","RODKGOSK6R01H","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago, I realized the difference in cheap cookware and good cookware when I invested in some KitchenAid pots and pans. Those pans have definitely made a difference both in my cooking and in cleanup and still work as well as they did when I first got them.Consequently, I was very excited about getting the Cooks Standard NC-00347 10-Piece Hard Anodize Premium Grade Nonstick Cookware Set, Black. The Amazon product page gave me high hopes for this set. As I unboxed and washed them, I was even more excited. The pots and pans have a good, solid feel to them – heavy duty without being too heavy. Not only that, but they have a very attractive look.Made from aluminum, they have a hard anodized surface that works better than any Teflon coating does. The metal distributes heat very well and the coating keeps food from sticking to them. The manufacturer says you can hand wash them with a towel and forgo the detergent, but I can’t do that. I do wash them in hot water with some Dawn detergent and cleanup is easy.While the pots and pans are metal, the lids are clear glass, so you can see how your dish is doing without removing the lid. Having used metal lids for most of my life, this made a big difference to me when I first got pans with see-through lids, and I won’t go back willingly. Unlike my KitchenAid set, the Cooks Standard set includes a small hole in the top of each lid, which would let steam escape and also allows the insertion of a cooking thermometer without removing the lid.Cooks Standard strongly recommends against putting these pans in the dishwasher, and this seems to be pretty standard amongst the more expensive brands of cookware. Since they clean so easily, this hasn’t been a problem for me.There are a few things that prevent me from giving this cookware set five stars. First, the lids cannot be set half open on the pans. There are times when I want to tilt the lid up to let more steam escape, but not remove the lid completely. These lids won’t stay like that – as soon as you let them go, they slide back into place. I’ve never had a lid that did that before. This may be a plus for some people, but it isn’t for me.Second, the handles are just too big. They feel good when you are holding them, but they are bulkier than they need to be. Again, this may not be a problem for others, but my kitchen has very narrow cabinets, and it makes it harder to fit these pots and pans in them.Last, the handles get hot while you are cooking. The manufacturer acknowledges this in the manual, warning that you should use potholders when handling these pans. However, I don’t always find it convenient to have to use a potholder while cooking. None of my other cookware needs a potholder except for the items that go in the oven. Just cooking pasta made the handle warm enough that I felt safer with a potholder to protect my hand. Also, because the handles are smooth and rounded, it is easy for them to slide against the fabric of a pot holder, which isn’t really safe when you are pouring off hot fluids, etc.This set cooks very well, but given the issues with the handles and the lids, I think they are overpriced when you compare them to competitors’ models.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMPPQRF1A12Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEH7Q8G#wasThisHelpful","RJMPPQRF1A12Q","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many of us these days use Post-it notes. They are convenient way to leave short notes for others and even ourselves. Over the years, I have also found Post-it flags to be very useful. I use them when I want to mark a section of a document that I need to find easily again or to mark spaces where someone needs sign. Most frequently, however I use Post-it flags to mark interesting recipes in cookbooks.The Post-it 12 Inch Notebook Kit, Includes 25 Full Adhesive Notes, Yellow, 2 x 2 Inches and 100 Arrow Flags, Bright Colors (ED-FLIPOUTM) intrigued me. Being able to attach the pad of notes and flags to the book or notepad that I am using them with seemed like a great idea.Unfortunately, the implementation of this product left something to be desired. While the notes and flags work perfectly fine. The sticky back on the kit doesn't hold very well when you place it on a notebook or book. Not only that, but the sticky notes fell off the kit while still in the package and have not stayed affixed to it.

"I almost never have problems with ants inside my home, but I do see them on a couple of windows where I have hung suction cup hummingbird feeders, since the ants are drawn to the nectar. I’ve sprayed the perimeter of the windows with Safer Brand 14-Ounce Aerosol Ant and Roach Killer 5720 to prevent them coming inside and also to minimize the ants at these feeders, and this formula has proven effective outside so far. Because it is a contact killer and not a repellent, I do spray the ants on the windows again every few days.The last time I brought the feeders into the house to wash them, I didn’t get all the ants rinsed off before making it to my kitchen, but luckily caught the few that came in quickly and sprayed the area with this ant killer, which took care of them immediately.Unlike most insect sprays, this one has a fresh citrus spray that is actually pleasant.If you need a good ant killer, I’d recommend this spray.

"I never thought I'd say this about a power bank, but the Cell Phone Battery Charger by Haidue - 10000mah Dual-port Ultra Compact Battery Charger is the prettiest power bank I've ever used. Of course, being pretty really isn't a criteria for choosing such a device, but since this one is just as functional as it is attractive, the look is just a bonus. The gold finish is subtle, not gaudy, and the lines of the device are smooth.This power bank has two USB ports which can be used to charge most devices that charge via USB - not just cell phones. I've used it with my Plantronics 975 Bluetooth headset, my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone, and my Kindle Fire HD tablet. All of these devices kept their charge while plugged into this device.With 10000 mAH, this battery backup can fully charge my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone three times, with some juice leftover.To charge the power bank itself, simply plug the micro USB cable into the matching port, and plug the USB end of that cable into either the port on your computer or into a USB power adapter.There is a flashlight built into this device, so if you have a power outage, you can use it to charge your phone and to see in the dark. The flashlight isn't very strong, but it is definitely enough for an emergency like a power outage, at least to help you find your standard flashlight.If you have a device that charges via USB and you don't want to be caught with a dead battery, I would recommend this power bank.I received a complementary sample unit for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLHT3NGXOBWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK281F8#wasThisHelpful","RCLHT3NGXOBWE","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to grill, and use my gas grill on the patio when I can, but sometimes the weather just doesn’t allow for outdoor grilling. Luckily, indoor grills can work very well for most meals.I’ve used several indoor grills before, but have wanted a George Foreman grill for a while, having heard good things about it from friends who own one. I got the George Foreman GRP360R 360 Grill this week and used it the night it arrived to grill a nice rib eye steak.Until I used one, I really didn’t understand what the difference was between a George Foreman grill and the other indoor grills. The George Foreman model is the only one I’ve used that slopes forward, with the drip tray in the front to catch all the juices and fat. This provides two great advantages: there is less chance of the juices and liquids overflowing over the rim of the grill plates and it makes it easier to clean after you’ve finished cooking.Cleaning this grill really is easy. The grill plates are removable – I won’t own a device that doesn’t have removable plates anymore. After removing the plates, you can completely submerge them in water to wash them either by hand or in the dishwasher. I washed them by hand when it arrived so I could use it immediately, and then ran them through the dishwasher after dinner. The drip pan is also simple to wash. I put it in the top rack of the dishwasher last night and it worked fine there.The specifications state that this is a four-serving grill, and that really just depends on what you are cooking. The rib eye I grilled last night is pretty big, and I think I could only fit three of those on this grill.I should also mention that since this device has grill plates both on the top and bottom you can cut your grill time a lot and shouldn’t need to flip most items you grill on it. I didn’t flip the steak that I grilled last night.The hinge on the back of the grill is pretty wide, and this (combined with the top and bottom grill plates) makes it ideal for grilling Panini sandwiches as well.The manufacturer’s website has additional plates you can buy for this grill if you want to make waffles with it as well.I am very pleased with this grill and expect to use it on rainy summer days and throughout the winter when I can’t grill outside.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDSW041R18O2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXP2#wasThisHelpful","RDSW041R18O2S","A23ZNGL704AW7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZNGL704AW7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I LOVE the fact that it has a handle so you can carry it from either the long end or the short one.  Even though I rarely pick it up because it's so great to be able to roll it everywhere,  that's a brilliant idea, at least when you're loading and unloading it. This case is such a great size!  It's right in between my small carry-on, under-the-seat one and the one I take for 3 weeks overseas. This is a very handy size for small trips, but trips where I need a little more than a simple carry-on.  It's so easy to move around on those 4 wheels.  I know I sound like a Tumi commercial, but I don't think you can get better suitcases anywhere. They are simply and beautifully put together to last, and I have tested them in every conceivable way. Tumi always passes my tests.It comes with a little white cover to keep the suitcase from picking up dirt or lint while stored, which it would in this case because of its shiny black surface, which collects lint.At first I couldn't figure out how to open it. You align the 3 numbers on '0' and then you take your thumb and move the tab over and it works beautifully. Now I really do feel silly for struggling to figure it out, but I am so happy because the inside is just as gorgeous as the outside.I have another large Tumi suitcase that I've taken all over the world. It has been on planes, buses, ships, cars, and who knows what else.  It is still just as beautiful as ever.  Now my son has it and I'm afraid he may have forgotten that he has it on loan, not as a gift, but he has taken it from sea-to-shining-sea more than a few times and he's not careful with things. It was one of the best purchases I've ever made.  Now I have two beautiful Tumi cases and I'm very pleased with both of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SQTHFZ7LUSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCJUT1O#wasThisHelpful","R21SQTHFZ7LUSL","A3OXRFCJI67IMN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OXRFCJI67IMN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this hand cream. It has a really refreshing but very light scent and goes on in a thick, luxurious cream that my skin just drinks in. The thing I like about it most is that I never take time to do anything about my awful nails and cuticles. This cream is designed to help condition them, and I appreciate that.  This is large tube that will last quite a long time.

"Intelligent, well-written book about the potential demise of just about everything as we know it. Obviously my short review can't cover all that was included, but one part was particularly interesting to me as an investor who is interested in our American economy. If you think back to the 2008 financial crisis, ""Student loan debt is now greater than total US credit card debt, with the average student loan balance being $29,000."" ""One oout of five Americans over the age of twenty owes money on student loans, and half of them are worried about it."" Currently the average payment on student loans is $279 per month, which is not easy to pay on an entry-level salary after rent and car payments. There was a quote from investor Mark Cuban with ""dire predictions that ballooning student loans are poised to trigger the next major deb crisis in the US, rivaling the home mortgage debt crisis for its potential to upend the economy.""  Most people don't realize that students owing that student loan deb can't get rid of it by declaring bankruptcy.  That causes students to 'settle' for less risky jobs with a lot less future potential that may be 'converting higher education into a bloated luxury product.""  Okay, that is just one part of the book that SCREAMED out to me, but there are parts that will probably call out to you as well.  Robotics have the potential to take over many jobs but, according to the book, have not done well with healthcare technology. Interesting, thought-provoking, and more than a little unsettling, so if you are a person who has trouble sleeping, probably better pass this one up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPA0F2Q632S09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1928055044#wasThisHelpful","RPA0F2Q632S09","A3OXRFCJI67IMN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OXRFCJI67IMN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Call: The Life and Message of the Apostle Paul is an easy-to-read story of Paul's travels. It almost felt a bit like a travel guide, with maps and charts, and wonderful pictures. I've had the opportunity to visit some of the places mentioned: Athens, Corinth, Ephesus and others, and the pictures were those I would have chosen to include as 'companions' to the stories. This is not the book Biblical scholars are waiting for about Paul. It's not intended to be. It is informative though, and I enjoyed reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA8I36VVVEMCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630882623#wasThisHelpful","RA8I36VVVEMCA","A3OXRFCJI67IMN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OXRFCJI67IMN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Steve Martini has pulled out all stops to make this legal thriller #13 in the Paul Madriani series into a comprehensive legal thriller with a background of  political and financial conspiracies, woven around an up-to-the-moment environment of electronic manipulation.Alex Ives goes to a party and wakes up in his car 50 miles away after a fatal high speed crash. He has no recollection of leaving the party and his blood alcohol level is minor. The driver of the other car who was incinerated after the crash is Olinda Serna a Washington lawyer with powerful friends and financial connections.When Alex is accused of homicide he asks Madriani for help in defending him in court. It is soon clear to Madriani that the crash may been staged and that Alex is in danger because he should have also been killed in the crash. He sets out to uncover everything he can about Serna and her clients - a search that leads to a path of political and financial corruption, both in Washington and overseas, and shadowy people with worldwide connections who will murder to maintain their power.This is not your run-of-the-mill legal thriller - it has a bit of everything to keep you on the edge of your seat. A lot of what you read is beyond the bounds of believability but is very entertaining and if you like this kind of escapism you will enjoy this book. This is another case where a best-selling author has gone to great lengths with a new plot to keep a long running series alive. I see seeds of international espionage and powerplay in the plot that suggest that this is only the beginning of a longer story and despite his successes Paul Madriani and his small legal firm will continue to be accidentally involved in things beyond their control.My thanks to The Reading Room and the publisher for an advance copy of this book for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UF0W8MA8ZIK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTSC7LG#wasThisHelpful","R2UF0W8MA8ZIK0","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again Stuart MacBride has produced a top ""Scottish Noir"" crime thriller featuring DS Logan McRae and his whacky police colleagues in Aberdeen. While Aberdeen is the star location for most of the action it shines as a place that I would like to avoid, both in climate and lifestyle.McRae is caught up in the investigation of a myriad of difficult and violent cases, mostly with a violent sexual background. A bloody body is found with terrible wounds and investigations suggest that a local BDSM bondage group may know something about it. A serial rapist is menacing and torturing girls in both Aberdeen and Dundee. An attack on Logan's girl-friend PC Jackie `Ball Breaker' Watson who was out along late acting as bait suggests that it may be Aberdeen Football Club's star player - but he has an alibi for each time the rapist strikes. Jackie is not convinced and she is hell-bent on proving that he is the rapist. On top of all of this an 8 year old boy runs away after he stabs and kills an old man and puts a policewoman into intensive care with knife wounds.This all means lots of overtime for McRae, but lots of problems in dealing with his superiors, overweight and angry DI Inch and foul mouthed crazy lesbian DI Steel. All of this is light and very amusing relief from trying to find murderers and a rapist. A warning - there are some parts of the book with very vivid descriptions of violence and sex that are not for the faint hearted.There is one amusing dig at MacBride's biggest competitor in the field of ""Scottish Noir"", Ian Rankin. When the local BDSM group plan their activities they meet in an upstairs room of a local pub under the pretext of  discussing books by Ian Rankin.You probably need to read earlier books in the series to really appreciate the characters and the setting. McRae is a bit of an enigmatic character to me, a good diligent policeman who deserves better from his job and from his bosses. All in all another very realistic but amusing police procedural which is well recommended. I plan to keep on reading more books in this addictive series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JB9E1T91LY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RI9AX6#wasThisHelpful","R21JB9E1T91LY5","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read and enjoyed several books in the Jake Grafton series by Stephen Coonts but unfortunately IMHO this one is a ""Lemon"". It falls between the early adventures when Jake Grafton is a Naval pilot and the latter stories when Grafton is associated with covert operations. This time Grafton is working in the Pentagon directly for the Joint Chief of Staff on drug related issues and seems to be a bit out of his depth in a pretty unrealistic story.What would happen if a Colombian drug lord is apprehended and brought to trial in DC? What would happen if that drug lord (with a wealth of billions of dollars) wants to spend part of his wealth hiring terrorists and assassins to bring Washington to its knees? Coonts paints a violent picture of a missile attack on the President's helicopter, the assassination of several key politicians, Judges and power brokers plus an invasion of suicide gangs intent on killing as many people as possible.What is the outcome - martial law and Grafton and his cronies trying to find the main assassin and destroy the suicide gangs. This is done against a background of war between drug dealers. IMHO things like this are a bit over the top.All in all this book really didn't work for me especially because Coonts involved real people in the drama, with George Bush Snr and Dan Quayle taking leading parts in the fiction. He also manufactured a fictitious overthrow of Fidel Castro.The only part of this story that really interested me was that Coonts told me how Washington Post journalist Jack Yocke became an unusual associate of Grafton - something that had puzzled me in some future books where Hockey plays an important supporting role.All in all I still love the Jake Grafton series, despite this ""Lemon"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FS1QCOCHN7PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048EKJMS#wasThisHelpful","R1FS1QCOCHN7PR","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The late Walter Tevis was a fantastic storyteller, especially when the story involves someone who has an inbuilt need to win. This time the tale is about 'Fast Eddie' Felsen, a young pool hustler, who had an ambition to beat the best pool players in the country.After making his seed money in small Pool Halls around the US, Eddie arrives in Chicago to find Minnesota Fats - the best there is. Travis describes Eddie's first pool battle with Fats almost on a stroke by stroke basis, building up the tension, the exhaustion and the emotional strengths of the two players.This is also a coming of age story for Eddie as he meets shy Sarah, slowly falls in love but doesn't have the emotional strength to understand what is happening. Travis also shows that Eddie can't make it to the top without support from others and how Eddie doesn't realise that he needs that support to  achieve his dreams.You don't need to be a pool player to understand what is happening as Travis is a master in describing complex things in simple and understandable language. While his prose is straightforward he is able to put you into the middle of an action-filled and evocative arena. His games become battle scenes as bloody and compelling as scenes on a real battlefield.I first encountered Tevis's work in The Queen's Gambit where the battle scenes were on the chess board (and you didn't need to know how to play chess to appreciate the action). Tevis followed up THE HUSTLER  with The Color of Money where we meet Eddie later in life still wanting to follow the ambitions of his youth. I look forward to reading that book soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O9CPYU6UX18U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O13NIWY#wasThisHelpful","R2O9CPYU6UX18U","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years David Baldacci has created a range of interesting characters and this one is probably one of the most unusual. Amos Decker was involved in a serious violent football tackle where he died twice and woke up with hyperthymesia (an exceptional memory of everything that happens).Amos - the ""Memory Man""- went on to become an excellent detective (helped by his great recall of details). One evening he returns home and finds his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law have been brutally murdered. Amos's world collapses as he is not able to forget anything about that night - his mind replays things like a DVD. He just avoids suicide, quits his job, and becomes homeless. Eventually he pulls himself together sufficiently to set up as a PI and earn enough to live in a low-cost Motel.Amos is a pretty forbidding character, six-five, and has let himself go - fifty pounds overweight, shaggy and initially bearded. Because of his ""gifts"" his social skills are lacking (he's a bit of  a UK TV's Doc Martin).Horrific murders happen at the local high school and Amos is asked by the local police chief to help because they a don't have a clue how the killer got into or out of the school. At the same time a strange man confesses to the police that he murdered Amos's family, but was in police custody at the time of the murders. Amos has to take better control of himself as the two tragedies slowly converge and he is the only person who can unravel what has happened.Baldacci has written a complex, frequently confused story about a huge man with a huge memory who is struggling to understand and survive huge emotional traumas. The plot meanders and loses direction and sometimes passes the believability level. 3.5 stars.The book it is listed as a standalone but the ending suggests that Baldacci plans to bring Amos back and it seems to me that he has edited parts at the last moment to allow this to happen. This is very confusing - I am not sure if this is a good idea as Baldacci has several other good characters around (for example, Will Robie, the hitman with a conscience, is coming back in November - The Guilty).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W370GMPWO08M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N7TDP8K#wasThisHelpful","R3W370GMPWO08M","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One day a ""Stranger"" approaches Adam Price at a school sports meeting and tells him that his wife faked a recent pregnancy and miscarriage to keep him from leaving. He also speculates that Adam might want to check the DNA of his sons to prove that he is really the father.Adam's world is turned upside down when he finds that his wife has purchased something from a website called Fake-A-Pregnancy.com. He confronts his wife who asks for time to think about a response - then she disappears.  The Stranger then tells someone else unpleasant things about how a family member is financing her college fees that has a serious impact on that person's life.The story develops as the impacts of the Stranger's activity unravel and have more serious and complex consequences than anyone could envisage.While the plot is fascinating the writing and the setting didn't grip me. I put the book down several times and moved over to other books that took my attention before eventually getting to the half-way point when the implications of the various revelations started to unravel and become more interesting. I think part of the reason for my lack of connection is that the US setting in a society absorbed in living the dream, especially in the competitive field of college sports is foreign to me as an Aussie.I have read and enjoyed most of the the last few of Coben's annual mysteries, but this one didn't rank as highly as the others. 3.5 stars rounded down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU71DC7QTDQV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMPN46W#wasThisHelpful","RU71DC7QTDQV5","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bernard Cornwell has written another page-turning historical adventure featuring Lieutenant Richard Sharpe, a foot soldier in the Napoleonic Wars between France and Britain, this time during the campaign in northern Portugal in the spring of 1809.Sharpe is leading a very small company of riflemen cut off in Portugal from the main English army when French Marshall Soult takes the key city of Oporto, a key stepping stone to taking the capital Lisbon. While it is an almost impossible task to fight his way back to British lines, Sharpe is ordered to follow Lieutenant Colonel James Christopher (a Foreign Office agent) and find Kate Savage, a 19 year old English girl who has run away from her mother to a town under attack by the French. On the way Sharpe joins up with a group of 37 Portuguese soldiers who have also been cut off during the attack on Oporto.At last Sharpe is beginning to make his mark as an officer, despite the distrust of his peers of someone who was born into poverty and his troops towards someone who started out as a humble private.  Sharpe achieved his promotion to an officer through bravery in the field and gets the respect of his troops through tough and skilful leadership under almost impossible conditions.Sharpe, his men and the Portuguese group fight their way out of danger against far superior French forces and track down the renegade Colonel Christopher who has suddenly become an ally of the French. Their only hope is that General Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington) will arrive with relief forces in time to drive the French out of Portugal.This is another great adrenaline-filled page-turning authentic historical re-enactment with Richard Sharpe taking a front-seat role in the battles for the control of Portugal. 4.5 stars.I have resolved to read all of this brilliant series - so far I have read 9 with only 13 to go.

"E-novellas are normally written as promos for a forthcoming full length book - this one is no exception. The main difference is that Steve Martini wrote this novella to highlight the issue of the impact of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder on returning US military personnel.

Adjusting to the peaceful environment of civilian life after being a SEAL is even more difficult and stressful than for most other military personnel.Paul Madriani is asked for legal help by an ex Navy SEAL who says he is being sought by the authorities for disclosures he may have made about the most famous SEAL raid ever.

"This is #1 in the long-running John Rebus series by Ian Rankin. While it has some of the signs of a debut novel it also shows Rankin's great ability in plotting a thriller and developing a character as complex as John Rebus.After an eventful and stressful experience with the SAS Rebus is adjusting to life as a Detective Sergeant in the Edinburgh homicide squad. He is still suffering from post traumatic stress but he can't remember what was the real trigger. He drinks too much, smokes too much and still suffers nightmares. His marriage has collapsed, he only sees his teenage daughter occasionally and his love life is occasional.Rebus is thrown into a major investigation of a serial killer of young girls where there are no real clues except that the killer will strike again. The only thing that can be done is to try and find a clue through diligent police work. Rebus is part of the team but doesn't realise that the case has a personal element - until almost too late.There is a bit of a strange sub-plot featuring Rebus's brother John who has taken over his father's profession as a stage hypnotist, and a local crime journalist who thinks he knows more than he really does.Ian Rankin has written 19 bestselling crime novels in the John Rebus series with another one (Even Dogs in the Wild) due to be published in November 2015. This series has come a long way since this book was first published nearly 30 years ago. At the time Rankin contemplated making it a standalone book - thank goodness he allowed the series to develop. It now has a such a cult following that the real settings used in later books in the series are now part of tourist ""John Rebus"" tours.There is still some time before #20 in the series is published and I will try to find the time to read more of this great series before then. Unfortunately there are other talented writers of ""Tartan Crime Noir"", especially Stuart MacBride, who will compete for my attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24CLIF7GJ2ONZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UPVVVU#wasThisHelpful","R24CLIF7GJ2ONZ","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful book about a remarkable character. ""With some people chess is a pastime, with others it is a compulsion, even an addiction... every now and then a person comes along for whom it is a birthright."" This person is Beth Harmon - ""she is quiet and well-mannered. And (when she plays chess) she is out for blood..."" She hates to lose.Beth Harmon was orphaned at the age of eight when her parents were killed in an automobile accident. She is placed in an orphanage in Kentucky that is almost a modern equivalent of a Dickensian orphanage, with children given tranquilisers twice a day to keep them calm and controllable - opening the gates to long-term addictions..One day when cleaning the board erasers in the basement for a teacher, Beth comes across an old janitor playing chess alone. After several attempts the janitor agrees to show her how to play chess, and she goes over the moves in her head during the lonely hours when she can't sleep. It takes three games for Beth to win her first game and in three months the janitor can no longer beat her. Then he gives her a book - ""Modern Chess Openings"" - and Beth is addicted to chess for life, playing chess movements and strategy in her mind in class and in bed at night.At thirteen she wins a local chess Tournament. With the help of her foster-mother by the age of sixteen she is competing in the US Open Championship. Her ultimate challenge is to go to Russia to face and beat the Russian world champions.While it helps to know something about chess is not important because the late Walter Tevis wrote in a way that even if you don't understand what is really happening you are part of the action and this keeps you on the edge of your seat, barracking for Beth. If you are a chess ""expert"" you might find errors in the game and strategic descriptions, but you need to remember that chess is the vehicle Tevis uses to tell us a wonderful tale that could also apply to almost any competitive game.The Queen's Gambit is a more than a story about chess - it is fundamentally a thriller with the same kind of adrenaline filled action that takes you into the heat of battle in a similar way that Bernard Cornwell takes you with Richard Sharpe into the heart of battles between the British and the French in the Napoleonic wars. All along I had to remind myself that chess is fundamentally a battlefield game between sides with a King and Queen, who live in castles protected by knights, supported by their Bishops, with an army of Pawns (soldiers). Let battle commence!This is an exciting and beautifully crafted book which had a profound effect on me emotionally. It has gone straight to my best list of best reads of 2015 and will stay in my memory for a long time. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VMEDK79LBH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O15BN4C#wasThisHelpful","R36VMEDK79LBH0","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Nora Roberts' books are not my normal genre I try to read her annual romantic suspense releases (recently The Witness, The Collector, Whiskey Beach, Chasing Fire) to see how a bestselling author who has written so many books manages to turn out something different. While I have been impressed with her recent romantic suspense releases I was disappointed with this one.Shelby Foxworth lost her husband, Richard, in a boating accident. Then when she is settling his estate she lost her illusions of the man who provided  a life of luxury for herself and their daughter when she finds herself left with a crippling debt. Her luxury life was a complete fabrication, and Shelby soon finds that he was an adulterer, a liar and a con man.Staggering from the impact Shelby moves back home to her loving family who she deserted for the high life with Richard. Despite initial problems they welcome her back and she meets Griff Lott, a local building contractor who is totally the opposite of Richard. Of course following the typical Roberts formula, Shelby and Griff are immediately attracted to one another.In recent books Nora Roberts was able to mix her romantic formula's with interesting suspense and a courageous but flawed young woman. This time IMHO this formula was somewhat  disappointing. The romantic stuff would hardly make a successful Harlequin/Mills and Boon book, the suspense was weak and unbelievable and Shelby was not a very memorable or powerful heroine. I had worked out most of what was going to happen, both romantically and with the suspense plot when I had read about one fifth of the book.It seems to me that Nora Roberts has written so many books that she may be getting to her use-by date. Her romantic formulas are tired and repetitive and her suspense plots are becoming unbelievable. I did give it 3 stars but this is because it is not my normal genre and I am sure that there will be many readers who will love anything that Roberts writes.My thanks to Net Galley and the Australian publisher for a copy of this book for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NGAHNWOH651N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2BKKZS#wasThisHelpful","R1NGAHNWOH651N","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fascinating Cold War espionage thriller by the late Helen MacInnes set in Paris, Athens and Mykonos. MacInnes was well known for the many best-selling espionage thrillers that she wrote from 1941 to 1984 covering WWII and the Cold War.John Craig, a historian, is on a working holiday in Paris when he encounters Professor Sussman, one of his old teachers. Sussman tells Craig that he has just been a witness at war trials and tells him about his experiences in Auschwitz, especially with one of the worst of the Nazis, Heinrich Berg. While Berg is known to be buried in Berlin, when a stranger approaches Grossman he is sure that it is Berg. The next day Grossman is found dead in an apparent suicide from his hotel balcony.Through his sister, who has been working at the US Embassy in Moscow, Craig meets a strange mixture of people from various nations, many of whom eventually turn out to be in the espionage business and are seeking Berg who may be Russian Colonel Insarov. As Craig is the only person who has seen Berg he is persuaded to go to Mykanos where a major Russian espionage group is planning an exchange or a coup. Craig gets drawn into the web of intrigue and proves to be as good if not better than many of the professionals.This is a complex and compelling espionage tale with all the hallmarks of knowledge of fieldcraft of the day. Microfilm is the preferred data form for transfer of information as data storage and cell phones were still in the future. While I was absorbed and involved by the plot I had some difficulty in keeping up with who's who, from what country and who were working together. In the end a fair proportion of the tourists on the small island of Mykonos seemed to be spooks trying to outdo one another in their secret trades.This was a thoroughly enjoyable and well crafted espionage thriller that took me back to the days of the Cold War - 4.5 stars. I certainly plan to read some more of MacInnes's books which are now being re-released in e-book format. Next time I plan to visit one of her WWII thrillers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18QS8M3J024W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLDW5NO#wasThisHelpful","R18QS8M3J024W","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like financial thrillers and this one by Andrew Gross is one of the best I have read based on the events of the recent Global Financial Crisis. Gross uses his knowledge of the background to the GFC to craft a conspiracy thriller suggesting that it may have been partly manipulated by outside forces.Ty Hauck is a former NYPD detective who is now a private security consultant to a big financial institution, but despite the greater income benefits he is not comfortable with his new role. In the midst of the GFC a key market operator, Marc Glasman, his wife April and most of his family are killed during in a midnight home invasion. Hauck gets drawn into the case because during a traumatic time in his past he had become very close to April and he makes a promise to himself that he will discover the truth behind the tragedy.The killings become financially important when it is discovered that Glasman has billions of dollars in outstanding trades that could bring down one of the biggest Wall Street businesses. Then another Wall Street trader who appears to have committed suicide is also found to have billions of bad outstanding trades.Hauck's soon realises that he is looking at murders arranged by powerful forces. He joins forces with Naomi Blum, a beautiful and ambitious US Treasury investigator as they track down the people behind this major financial conspiracy.Andrew Grosss is a top-notch thriller writer who has written a page-turning and mostly plausible financial thriller that goes behind the scenes of the worst financial disaster in recent times. I will certainly look out for other books in his Ty Hauck series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXS0QC1C326T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ATPQ2K#wasThisHelpful","R2EXS0QC1C326T","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been several years since I read a Sean Dillon thriller by Jack Higgins, and it was great to read one again. This time Dillon, ex-IRA enforcer, who is surprisingly now part of a covert group supporting the UK Government, takes a bit of a back seat with the introduction of Major Harry Miller MP who has as similar background of violence to Dillon, but from the other side.Miller is on a mission for the UK Prime Minister (as his personal Rottweiler) to find out more about Russian influence in Kosovo when he meets Blake Johnston, the US President's head of dark forces. The meeting becomes explosive when Miller shoots the leader of a squad of Russian soldiers who are about to commit an atrocity to the inhabitants of a small village in Kosovo near the Russian border. The incident has international repercussions in London, Washington and Moscow and brings Miller, Dillon and Major Ferguson together to defeat the plans of the secretive ""Broker"" with connections to Bin Laden, and Putin's Rottweiler General Volkov.The plot is made more entertaining and different with the introduction of Miller's sister Monica, Lady Starling, a lovely widowed University Don who is immediately attracted to and excited by the dangerous Dillon.While some of the plot was a bit over the top it did show that Jack Higgins continues to be a master craftsman of page-turning political thrillers full of exciting international suspense, intrigue and action. I hope to catch up with a few more in the series from time to time as I have always enjoyed Jack Higgins writing and am sure that they will keep me well entertained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U049B35D1RB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RI93P6#wasThisHelpful","R1U049B35D1RB5","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some time I have been meaning to sample one of Laura Lippman's books about Tess Monaghan, first an investigative reporter and now a ""fearless"" private investigator. I was disappointed.Tess is a strange PI who really doesn't know what she is doing and stumbles around (trailing her pet Greyhound with her) doing silly things that accidentally lead her to solving a case.

"John J Davis has chosen a complex plot for his debut (spy?) novel about the Granger family. Ron and Valerie Granger are living a quiet rural life with their brilliant 16 year old daughter Leecy when their peace is abruptly disturbed one night by a home invasion that attempts to kidnap Leecy.Ron and Valerie are no normal rural couple working in a small family business - both of them have a history, Ron with the CIA and Valerie with Mossad. They have been waiting for the right opportunity to tell Leecy something about their history when everything unravels. Ron overcomes one of the invaders single-handed and Valerie shoots the other invader in the head with professional accuracy.The family leaves home on the run, after stopping off to get pre-packed ""Go"" bags for both parents containing weapons, money and false identities.  Their aim it to to find the mastermind before he finds them.Leecy is soon asking for answers about what her parents did before she was born which she surprisingly finds exciting. When Ron asks for assistance from his former CIA minder things get very complex and dangerous.I don't know why Davis called this a spy novel as neither parent was a spy - they were assassins. It is a brave plot for an action-packed debut novel but it didn't absorb my attention as much as it should. There will be more books in the series released soon but my jury is still out on whether I will want to find out more about how this family business develops and prospers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FDOADKPOUQUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIGC274#wasThisHelpful","R2FDOADKPOUQUQ","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic historical fictional novel about the early troubled years of the State of Israel. Herman Wouk takes us from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War after the UN vote that recommended the partitioning of Israel, through Israeli cooperation with France and Britain and invasion of Egypt during the Suez crisis, to the bloody but overwhelming victory of the Six Day War.Wouk has a magic touch in being able to seamlessly integrate fictional and real historical characters with both insight and compassion in action-packed environments. David Ben Gurion, Moshe Dyan, Golda Meir and West Point trained US Army colonel ""Mickey"" Marcus (who was Israel's first military chief of staff during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War), are larger than life.Fictional characters include Austrian born Zev Barak, an Army officer, later military attaché in Washington; Sam Pasternak, born in Czechoslovakia - a combat officer, later in military intelligence and a renowned womaniser; Benny Luria, born in Moshe Dayan's moshav who becomes an Air force pilot and leads a squadron that destroyed the Egyptian air force within minutes of the start of the Six Day War; and Benny's beautiful sister Yael (who has also been an Army officer), caught between a love of Israel, her family and the magnetic attractions of living the high-life in the US.The most fascinating fictional character is Polish born Yossi Nitzan, fresh out of the refugee camps of Europe who turns up at the front in the 1948 War as ""a lanky bespectacled dust-covered boy of sixteen or so, wearing a rusty British tin hat and mounted bareback on a muddy white mule."". He is immediately nicknamed ""Don Kishote"" (Quixote in Hebrew) and volunteers for the war - ""I'm eighteen. Give me a gun."" Kishote eventually becomes a paratroop leader in the Suez war and a Tank Commander in the Six Day War.This is edge-of-seat adrenaline-packed authentic historical action written by one of the World's best storytellers. Of course Wouk writes from a Jewish perspective backed up by vital knowledge about the various ways the Jewish religion is practiced. It is this comprehensive perspective of Jewish life that helps to explain the painful birth of modern Israel. I was captivated when I read this book when it was first published in 1993 and was even more captivated when I read it again recently.I plan to revisit the sequel The Glory very soon. Both books would have been given six stars if that was permitted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I15FZ8BDLAM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ09O8Y#wasThisHelpful","R3I15FZ8BDLAM8","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an enjoyable and intriguing story by talented author Australian author Fiona McIntosh set in 1930's England. Stella, an impoverished but well educated young woman takes a job as a French/Piano governess/tutor to support her much younger brother and sister.It all starts with a chance meeting with an unusual man at a Piccadilly ballroom who orchestrates a job with the wealthy but strange Ainsworth family at their huge home in Sussex.

Slowly Stella learns something about the family secrets and more about the world of the mysterious Douglas.Things come to a head when Douglas decides to take his whole family and Stella on a cruise calling at North Africa, Egypt and the Holy Land leading to two unexpected endings.Both Suncoast and Mrs Suncoast read and enjoyed this book.

"Bernard Cornwell's long running series about Richard Sharpe, a foot-soldier in India and in the Napoleonic Wars is one of the best historical series around. Sharpe's Rifles is set at the time of the brutal French Invasion of Galicia in Spain in January 1809.While Richard Sharpe joined the Army to avoid prison he quickly found that he loved a life of a soldier, especially the adrenaline pumping excitement of battle. He has proved himself in battle and gained a stunning battlefield promotion to become an officer. This is not a comfortable situation as other officers look down on him because he is not their class and his troops who won't look up to him because he is not seen to be a proper officer.Sharpe has moved on to join the  95th Rifles who are posted to Spain. His Company Commander is killed in a skirmish with the French and Sharpe is left in command to get his Company to safety through French lines. This would be hard enough with the respect of his riflemen which is not forthcoming, especially from the dominating and difficult Irishman Harper who the troops look up to instead of Sharpe. The battle of wills between two strong personalities is enthralling and compelling.Sharpe's Company meet up with Spanish cavalry commanded by aristocrat Major Vivar who means to raise the flag of Spain's patron saint over Santiago de Compostela, now in French hands. Sharpe is faced with a dilemma, to help Viva or to go it alone in dangerous country.Once again this is a history lesson about the art of war in the early 19th Century which is bloody and brutal. It is also the story of a brave and clever man of common background who has to face up to his gremlins to get the respect of his men.I found some of the background, especially Sharpe's relationship with women from a genteel background, is a little confusing because the book was written before SHARPE'S TRAFALGAR (which comes before Rifles in the timeline) where Sharpe has a torrid and very emotional relationship with Lady Grace Hale.Once again this is a great page-turning story which puts you in a front row seat on the battleground and builds up Sharpe's character as he faces up to his gremlins and shows that he is one of the smartest soldiers of his generation. I still have lots of Sharpe's adventures to share and I look forward to reading them from time to time as exciting relief from more contemporary novels. 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33495GRLYIRU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RI9TF0#wasThisHelpful","R33495GRLYIRU7","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the final volume of Herman Wouk's two masterly historical novels about the early days of Israel. Wouk is a compelling storyteller of Israel's dangerous and exciting days from the end of the Six Day War through the battles of the Yom Kippur War, the Entebbe Rescue and the first Camp David agreements.Wouk tells the story through a few compelling fictional characters who interact seamlessly with real characters such as Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan and Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat.This is edge-of-seat adrenaline-packed authentic and exhaustively researched historical action written by one of the World's best storytellers. Of course Wouk writes from a Jewish perspective backed up by vital knowledge about Jewish life and values and the various ways the Jewish religion is practiced. Despite this he pulls no punches with detailed descriptions of the chaotic practice of politics in Israel, the arguments, the disasters and the triumphs.The surprise attack at the start of the Yom Kippur War by several Arab countries caught Israel by surprise during one of it most revered religious holidays and shows how close Israel came to absolute defeat. In the end audacity and sheer military skill left Israeli tanks within striking distance of Damascus and 100,000 Egyptian troops surrounded and starving in the Sinai. These amazing achievements have so easily been forgotten.This a front-row seat of history as Israel becomes the centre of the Cold War and the World gets nearly as close to a nuclear war as the Cuban missile crisis. It also forms the foundation of the US support for Israel.The story ends in the early 1980's - so much has happened since then as Israel continues to live a fortress existence, now facing different kinds of terrorist enemies and looming nuclear capabilities in Iran. The saga continues.....","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKIVO220DY51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ0A64A#wasThisHelpful","RJKIVO220DY51","A345U10UP0S8LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A345U10UP0S8LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a playful story, written for an older child, about how to keep your body healthy. Nolan is out exploring the woods--searching for a good spot to build a fort--when he accidentally falls and cuts his knee. He knows his body is doing all it can to repair the cut and fight off any germs that have entered into his body. So he works doubly hard to eat right and rest, so his body has all the nutrients and energy it needs to heal.There are some more advanced concepts in here (like T-cells, B-cells, lymph nodes, etc.), but the cute, fun illustrations go a long way in helping the reader understand the content. As a parent, I also like that Nolan is active and engaged in imaginative play, and that, in the story, his parents encourage his independence.Moreover, I applaud author Wu for not overly-vilifying junk food. We all know that sweets and treats aren't good for us if we eat them all the time. But being too negative about unhealthy foods has a tendency to backfire and give kids food hang ups. Thankfully, Wu doesn't put too much judgment on food choices. Nolan has a dessert of yogurt and fruit, and even though he wants to have that Ultimate Chocolate Sandwich cookie, he tells himself, well, I'm working on healing my body tonight, so I'm going to eat healthier foods; I can still have that special treat tomorrow. What a perfect way to handle that situation.Overall, this is a really cute story that will definitely help kids understand their immune systems better. The story is easily accessible, and the battle theme will appeal to young imaginations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NL1N8TQE4CQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631771523#wasThisHelpful","R2NL1N8TQE4CQC","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a helpful resource for kids who want to learn more about what it is (or will be) like to have a newborn baby in the house. Emily is very excited to meet her baby sister, Sarah. But she isn't sure what to expect either. This book follows Emily as she meets her new sister and then learns how to help her parents take care of their very young baby.The book covers a lot of important and relevant info that will genuinely help a child understand what babies are like. Wu talks about nursing, bathing, umbilical cords, why Mommy is so tired, baby milestones, changing diapers, etc., etc. And I like that Emily interacts with and asks questions of, not just her mother, but her aunt and father, too. Having multiple family members involved seems much more realistic to me.I am not completely sure who the intended audience for this book is, though. In my opinion, the book is probably going to be best for a slightly older child, since there are definitely not enough pictures to keep the interest of any kid under the age of five or six. But I'm also confused by the ""helpful tips"" section located in the front of the book. I think it is intended to be read by parents (?), since this section talks about topics like how to position a baby during breastfeeding. But if it IS meant to be read by parents only, I would suggest to the author that it be put in the back of the book, after the story. Otherwise, it's confusing to the (young) reader.Overall, I like the idea of this book. I believe it is very important to keep kids connected and in the loop when it comes to major family transitions. Any resource that can help a child be more comfortable with something so life-changing as a new baby is wonderful. My only wish is that there would be more clarity about the age of the intended reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWIFJ6I2I91S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163177154X#wasThisHelpful","R3DWIFJ6I2I91S","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to reading this book. I love The Husband's Secret, so I had high hopes for All of Us and Everything. Plus, I really like stories that focus on relationships between sisters, and relationships between mothers and daughters, so I really thought this one was going to be a good fit for me.Yikes, what a disappointment. While I think there was some potential here for an interesting story with weird, eccentric, engaging characters, author Bridget Asher just couldn't pull it off. The story is sprawling and unfocused. It has engaging moments, but it also has a lot of superfluous, boring sections that could have been eliminated all together. In fact, I'd say the whole book could have been edited down, probably by at least 40 percent. It would have moved along much more quickly.I took issue with the dialogue, in particular; it just wasn't believable to me. And some of the conversations between characters went on and on and on. I found myself zoning out at these points, and I'd have to catch myself and reread what I just read (never a good sign).Ultimately, this book did basically nothing for me. While I still think the plot had potential, I never fell in love with the characters.If you are looking for a better book about relationships between sisters or between moms and daughters, I'd suggest The Roots of the Olive Tree: A Novel. I really liked that one. Oh, and if you've never read anything by Liane Moriarty, don't judge her based on a (totally misleading) comparison to All of Us and Everything. Her books are nothing like this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R69BJZHOE9M7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385343930#wasThisHelpful","R69BJZHOE9M7G","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mare is a beautifully written coming of age novel. Velvet is a tweenager living in Brooklyn and struggling to find her place. Her home life is rocky; her mother dotes on her little brother while constantly criticizing Velvet. Velvet endures a lot of verbal and physical abuse and is generally unhappy. So when she is offered the opportunity to visit an older couple living in the country as part of an inner-city youth reach out program, Velvet eagerly accepts. During her first two-week visit, Velvet's hosts, Ginger and Paul, let her ride a horse, and Velvet's world is basically changed forever. Despite her mother's protests, Velvet repeatedly visits the farm to ride the horse. And while she begins to develop her riding skills and ends up feeling proud of herself (for the first time in her life), she also has to deal with the problems that arise when she attempts to exist in two very different worlds.I agree with other reviewers that Gaitskill's writing is phenomenal. The story she has created is very engaging. I loved watching events unfold from the point of views of each main character. This multi-POV approach isn't really unique anymore, but in Gaitskill's hands, it still adds a lot of depth and feeling to the book. I ended up empathizing with just about every character here--though I was never able to dredge up much sympathy for Velvet's mom. (I know she's been through some things, but, yikes, what a piece of work...)My only complaint is that the book is predictable at points. In fact, I would say that even within the first few pages, I had this feeling like I knew exactly where the story was going, almost like I had read it before. Gaitskill managed to surprise me a couple of times, but, for the most part, I knew what was coming next. I'm still not exactly sure why the story feels so familiar to me (maybe it's as simple as I've read too many ""a girl and her horse"" stories?), but other readers may not feel the same.Regardless, the book is written so well that I was willing to overlook a little bit of predictability. There is enough depth--to the story and to the characters--that I found The Mare to be a satisfying and engrossing read. I think this one is going to be a popular pick for book clubs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AOG8CT4ZSZWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307379744#wasThisHelpful","R2AOG8CT4ZSZWN","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:31 Mins This is one of the best toys we've ever played with.I was worried that the bear was going to be bulky and hard (especially his head), but he is super soft and cuddly. The voice is adorable:  very kid-like without being annoying, and always clear and understandable.Operating the bear is easy. Ours was charged out of the box, but recharging him is as simple as plugging him into the wall with a basic USB cable. To turn him on, you just press his left foot. (It's marked with a power symbol.) You can interact with the bear by pressing the button on his belly (easy to push but still nicely disguised) in response to his questions. You can also talk to the bear, answering his questions that way, and he will respond back. He doesn't always understand what my kids are saying the first time around, but he usually gets it after a second or sometimes third repetition.The activities, stories, breathing exercises, music selections, etc. are perfect. I've been listening to this bear for the past few weeks, and even I haven't grown bored of him. Except for bedtime stuff, I rarely hear repeating activities. I am genuinely shocked by how much information this little guy holds. It's crazy. And though I haven't seen a place to buy separate activity cards yet, apparently Fisher Price has come out with separate card packs that will let the bear do even more stuff. I will definitely be getting those.Hands down, one of the best features of this toy is that it can also be operated through an app on a parent's smart phone. This sounds creepy, but it really isn't. Parents have the ability to prompt the bear to move on to a different activity (brushing teeth, bed time story/song/breathing, clean up time, adventures, music, drawing, games, stories, dance/party time or even break time). This is an AMAZING feature, in my opinion. I don't interfere with my kids' play often, but I love being able to have the bear wind down an activity (break time) and, especially, to have the bear prompt my kids to start their bedtime routines--all without me being in the room or having to touch the bear in any way. It's genius.Parents also have the ability to control the bear's volume through the app, which is wonderful. And you can tell the bear your kid's name (again, through the app), and the bear will greet your child personally. I have a four-year old and an almost six-year old, and both of them have been playing with the bear. The app actually lets me program both of their names in, and then I can choose the name of the kid who is playing with the bear in that moment, so the bear can say the right name. It takes very little time to set up, but it sure adds a personal touch.Ultimately, I am blown away by how cute, fun, and full of info this toy is. It keeps both of my kids busy for a long time. They don't whine while they play it. They don't get bored. They stay engaged with the activities and stories, and cheerfully interact with the bear for at least a couple of hours each day.

"Accidental Brownie is a memoir written by Paul Froiland about his experiences as a child. Many of the stories focus on relationships--especially relationships with and between neighborhood kids, as well as his own relationships with family members. Froiland is playfully self-depracating and minimally critical of his naive child self. Thankfully, he never ventures into ""self-loathing"" territory (which can easily become tedious and tiresome, in my opinion). His recollections stay light, and he remains full of forgiveness. Based on this memoir alone, I would venture to say that Froiland, in reality, is probably a very likable fellow.I have one observation and one minor criticism. First, I would argue that the title Accidental Brownie brings to mind an image that the author didn't intend. It could be that I have been cleaning up after three young children for too long, but all that title makes me think of is a kid pooping in his pants. When I read the essay ""Accidental Brownie,"" which is really about Froiland unintentionally acting like a member of his sister's Girl Scout troop, I was legitimately surprised that the story did not, in fact, involve fecal matter. Clearly, I need to get out of the house more...As for my minor criticism, I think Froiland's writing style can be sprawling at points. Though I was entertained by the memoir and felt engaged with the stories, there were definitely moments when Froiland could have come to the point sooner by editing out superfluous details.Regardless, Accidental Brownie is an enjoyable read. The light subject matter makes the book go quickly, and, ultimately, I felt this was a sweet and fun walk down memory lane.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T7HGIDF466T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9187751798#wasThisHelpful","R2T7HGIDF466T2","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no denying that my daughter went ape-sh*t for this My Little Pony Castle. She about peed herself when she saw the box. Luckily I was able to put it together in about five minutes, so she didn't have to experience anticipatory anxiety for long.She can interact with this toy in several ways. There is a flap on the second level which can be pulled down. (It plays music when in the down position). Also, the pony figures (which are surprisingly well-made, btw) can take the elevator, slide, swing, stand on the upper level, or twirl in a circle on the maniacal merry-go-round. In order to make the ponies twirl, you will need to press the big pink button on the upper level. Pressing the button also initiates the music, so buckle up, y'all.Woo-ee! This toy is loud. You better really love the My Little Pony theme song, because you are going to be hearing it. A lot. Like, through your ENTIRE living space. And there is no volume button either, so it's going to get intense. You will probably sweat.I agree with other reviewers that this toy does require a higher degree of imaginative play. Your kid has to do most of the heavy lifting, so to speak, not the other way around. My daughter really likes the castle--and especially the ponies--but she can talk to herself for hours without getting bored, so she's probably the ideal customer. Based on her satisfaction with the toy, I would have given the castle five stars. But I just can't forgive the soul-crushing, mercilessly loud music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73Z0FZK62802/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENR9W#wasThisHelpful","R73Z0FZK62802","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not impressed with this puzzle at all.The pieces are thin, and the art isn't engaging. The puzzle doesn't come with batteries, so you will need to supply those. And even when you do, the puzzle still may not work. For us, four of the puzzle cut out slots were missing the metal part that communicates with the puzzle piece in order to know when to play music. In other words, straight out of the box, four of our pieces were broken and no music played with them. The other pieces that did actually work, weren't that great. The sound quality and musical composition is garbage--even my kids agreed (and, let's face it, their standards aren't that high).Ultimately, I was shocked by the bad quality of this puzzle.

"I was surprised how easy it was to put this spinner together. It comes in three pieces, all hardware included. You fit the rod pieces together, tighten one screw, and you are done. And putting it in the ground is also easy. You just step on the horizontal bar, push it down, and that's it.It took me way too long to figure out how to bend the pieces so that they would spin correctly. The directions are actually confusing on this. But all you really have to do is turn EACH red flower 30 degrees in one direction on one wheel and then 30 degrees in the other direction on the other wheel. I've attached pictures, and I hope they make the process more clear.Once assembled and properly bent, the windmill is beautiful. The red color next to the green plants is very complimentary.My one complaint--and I considered taking off an extra star for this--is that the paint is already peeling off in certain areas. Not a ton, but enough that I notice it close up. And I can tell that more is going to peel, so I'm not sure how long this windmill is going to last outside. For $100, I expect more than that.Still, from far away it looks so beautiful, so I'm happy with it, overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VGXK4NOPYXYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CUOTOI#wasThisHelpful","R2VGXK4NOPYXYY","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caroline is a hot mess. Recently acquitted of murdering her husband and released from prison, she is trying to figure out how to make a life for herself with help from her two grown twin daughters.While I like the unique premise of this book, that is about all I liked. Unfortunately, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped and uncomplicated. Caroline, especially, never felt real or complete to me. She comes across as someone who thinks she is sassy and smart, but really is petty and insecure. I disliked her through the whole story.Unfortunately, the other characters aren't any better. They all felt one-dimensional to me, too--all so narrowly defined (the scummy husband, the underestimated but brilliant public defender, the wise inmate) and not allowed to move beyond their assigned roles. I found nothing interesting or engaging about any of them. And watching them interact with each other was awkward and, worse, boring.Overall, I like the idea of this book, but I wish Sherman had done more with less. In other words, I wish this book could have been just about Caroline's trial or just about her experience after being released from jail, for example, but with more build up, explanation, and depth. I wanted more of an intro into the story. I wanted more insight into Caroline's experiences and perspectives. And I wanted a deeper understanding of her personal relationships. Ultimately, there wasn't enough substance here for me to really engage with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVP02KEJO5040/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1460265637#wasThisHelpful","RVP02KEJO5040","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband bought Poo-Pourri Before-You-Go Toilet Spray 2-Ounce Bottle, Lavender Vanilla for me last Christmas as a silly stocking-stuffer. I thought it was hilarious at first, but after actually using it, I have to say that Poo-Pourri is really a great product. We haven't used up the first scent, but I decided to try this original citrus scent, too. I actually like it better than Lavender Vanilla.I am very sensitive to scent. I smell EVERYTHING, and what other people can barely smell, I can smell no problem. In fact, usually I'm overwhelmed by the smell of perfume, smoke, lotion, soap, cleaners, etc. So the fact that this stuff doesn't irritate my nose is amazing.I think it helps that this isn't like chemical-ridden Febreeze or something else synthetic that tries to mask odors. The only ingredients in here are natural oils. And all you have to do is spray a few spritzes of oil in the toilet before you poop (the directions say three to five sprays, but I only use one), and, amazingly, once the poop gets coated in the oils, it won't smell. It's an honest-to-God miracle. Seriously.Now that I've used this product for a while, I'm in love with it. It's quirky and weird, for sure, but genuinely effective. Such a great concept.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CFG36AQ7QMDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108XRHJU#wasThisHelpful","R1CFG36AQ7QMDG","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Uninvested, Bobby Monks argues that the financial system is seriously dysfunctional. Especially when it comes to investing for retirement, most people are operating in the dark. They don't understand where their money is going, they don't know how much they are paying in fees, and they aren't sure if they are invested in respectable companies. And, to top it off, their money managers--who are supposed to be giving them wise and unbiased advice--may not necessarily have their best interests in mind.Monks paints a fairly bleak picture, giving plenty of evidence showing how uninformed investors are getting taken advantaged of by greedy bankers. I thought his perspective on mutual funds--specifically, how investors see mutual funds as a solution to the complex mess of saving for retirement, despite the fact that many don't really understand what they are investing in--was interesting and unique. Most people praise mutual funds (and index funds, too) like they are the gold standard, so it was nice to see another perspective.Honestly, I was completely on board with Monks until the very end. Unfortunately, when it came time to DO something about the problem, Monks couldn't deliver. His solutions are way too basic and nebulous to be useful, and, worse, they don't make sense. In addition to knowing and understanding the contents of your portfolio and what you pay in fees, etc., Monks encourages investors to buy stocks directly from individual companies that they believe in and are familiar with--and no more than ten at a time. While I, of course, agree that investors should be familiar with their investments, I don't see how investing in a handful of companies that ""share my values"" is going to get me through retirement. I may like baseball cards and organic skin products, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Topps and Honest Company are going to be the aggressive growth companies that will sufficiently grow my nest egg. And God forbid one of them goes under...Moreover, one of the great benefits of mutual funds is that people like me--people who have a little bit of money, but not a lot--actually have the option to access and invest in solidly growing, well-founded blue chip companies that otherwise would be out of my price range and unavailable to me. No, I don't want to be fleeced by money managers and their fees, but I still see investing in index funds as an okay way to build my retirement accounts.Ultimately, I enjoyed this book up until the end. Monks laid out such a great case for how messed up the system is, but then went nowhere with it--not a tangible solution in sight. As a result, I finished the book feeling dissatisfied and slightly depressed. I will continue to work to understand my portfolio and prospectuses, yes, but, for right now, I'm sticking with my index funds.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHG7UL8791R3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591848199#wasThisHelpful","RHG7UL8791R3S","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a surprisingly well-written memoir written by a man who pushed himself hard to become a scholarship athlete at the University of Mississippi. Richie Contartesi doesn't look like a typical football player, and throughout his sports career, he was told repeatedly that he was too small and too slow to play. Much like Rudy Ruettiger, though, Contartesi never quit on his dream. In the face of obstacles, he simply pushed himself more and worked twice as hard. As a result, he was eventually able to accomplish his goal of playing on a D1 team.I liked Contartesi's story, overall. He shows a lot of heart, and I respect anyone who is willing to persevere even when things get tough. I certainly admire his spirit. I was also very impressed with his writing skills, and I thought the book had a nice rhythm and flow to it.My only complaint is that the book could be a bit too ""play-by-play"" for me at parts (no pun intended). I didn't need to know so many specific details about each game. To me, that extra detail became tedious. However, I also felt that way when I read Rudy: My Story, so I can acknowledge that younger and more enthusiastic football fans may not agree with me.Ultimately, this was a satisfying and heartfelt read. I enjoyed learning Contartesi's story, and I'd recommend In Spite of the Odds to anyone who liked the book written by or the movie based on Rudy Ruettiger.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34WZILN7BCCPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JDGR38#wasThisHelpful","R34WZILN7BCCPC","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used these labels on treat bags for my daughter's 4th birthday. They are really cute, and add an extra something to an otherwise simple, and somewhat boring, bag. The adhesive on the label is permanent, so it doesn't peel off nicely, just FYI. But the label is really adorable. I love how it has a somewhat shiny and textured appearance, too.I ended up not using the Avery template for my daughter's birthday, but I did print out a couple of labels just to test things out. I've used Avery's online templates a bunch, so I am very familiar with their website. But even for someone who is unfamiliar, it's easy to enter the product code and see the templates available for your specific label. There is a nice selection for the scalloped label. And the designs print out nicely. In fact, I've never had a problem with Avery's website. The design and print process always goes smoothly.The only weird thing about these labels is that they come on a 4 x 6"" sheet of paper. Usually Avery puts their labels on an 8.5 x 11"" sheet, so this is different. It's not a deal breaker, but I can't help but notice that a lot of paper seems to get wasted with this specific scalloped label. (You only get three labels per sheet.)Overall, though, I'm happy with the finished product. The labels looks very nice, very polished.

"Anne-Marie Slaughter was Director of Policy Planning under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton--but she's most familiar to me as the author of her controversial Atlantic article, ""Why Women Still Can't Have It All."" The woman has some seriously impressive credentials, and I was excited to hear what she had to say about the oft talked-about subject of work/family balance, and I was curious to see how her thoughts stacked up against other books on the subject, such as Overwhelmed: How to Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time, Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder, All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood, and Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.Amazingly, Unfinished Business adds something new to the discussion. Slaughter's ideas are refreshing and insightful, and I also happen to think she is spot on. Slaughter's strongest point is that there is powerful and ubiquitous discrimination against caregiving in the United States. Fifty years ago, women wanted out of the home. They wanted to have freedom to pursue their own goals, while also having the opportunity to support themselves. And over the past half-century, they've more or less accomplished this goal. Obviously there is still progress to be made, but there is no denying that women are better off than they were several years ago. They are better educated, more independent, and largely more self-supporting. But, as Slaughter says, ""In the long quest for gender equality, women first had to gain power and independence by emulating men."" They may have proven that they can do ""men's work,"" but, unfortunately, what was once considered ""women's work,"" (i.e., caring for children and the home) is still not valued in our society.Traditionally, we talk about kids and work/life balance as if these are ""woman problems."" But Slaughter argues that having the time and flexibility to provide care--whether to our kids, parents, or friends--is a freedom that everyone, man or woman, should have. Moreover, people should be respected and rewarded for engaging with and taking care of their families--for, say, taking paternity leave or adjusting their schedules in order to attend a child's play.In fact, I love how Slaughter sees the next phase of the women's movement being a men's movement, where men fight for and ultimately achieve the same range of choices that women have when it comes to care-giving vs. breadwinning. Imagine if men could be accepted, truly accepted, as the lead parents at home, without judgment or condescension. How freeing that would be for both women and men alike!Slaughter ends the book with several in-depth and creative ideas for creating workplace environments that are legitimately family-friendly. There is little here that is concrete or immediately implementable, but I thought she gave some good jumping off points.Overall, I loved Unfinished Business. I'm so happy to see more high-powered women writing books like this, books that honestly examine the barriers people face when they try to do their jobs well AND still be present with their families. Talking about these issues is the first step to genuinely addressing the problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKWFZ0NSPY4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994566#wasThisHelpful","R3FKWFZ0NSPY4R","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sol Nazerman runs a pawn shop in a low-income neighborhood. His business is mostly legitimate--sure, he pays money for the random trinkets brought in by his destitute neighbors--but the business isn't profitable. And he's only able to stay afloat through the patronage of a local criminal who is using Sol's business as a vessel to launder his money.Sol lives an isolated and sad existence. As the story advances, we see why. Sol is a Holocaust survivor--the only one of his nuclear family to make it. His wife and two children were all not only killed, but also suffered horribly beforehand. (His flashbacks about his wife were awful, nearly unbearable to read.) While many see the numbers etched into Sol's forearm, few seem to make the connection that he is a survivor. Or maybe they just don't care.This book reads about as drearily as the plot sounds. At first, I didn't know if I was going to make it through. I've heard a bunch of people say this book reminds them of Dostoevsky's works, but I have to disagree. At least Dostoevsky injected some mania in with his depression; The Pawnbroker, on the other hand, is straight melancholy, through and through.However, when I made it past the first 50+ pages, when I started knowing more about Sol's backstory and started seeing his more significant relationships unfold, I found myself hooked. I was absolutely enthralled and invested. And though I really don't want to sound cliche here, the flashbacks to his experiences as a prisoner broke my heart. I'm not going to lie:  I cried...a lot. I have to give Wallant credit for creating a deep, thoughtful, multidimensional story and cast of characters. I don't think that I ever really liked anyone in this book, but I definitely felt for all of them.Ultimately, The Pawnbroker is not a book to read if you want to feel warm fuzzies. It's deeply--just OPPRESSIVELY--sad. But it is also thought-provoking and honest. (And I would add that it ended on a surprisingly optimistic note; I actually wasn't expecting that.) Before reading this book, I had no idea that Edward Lewis Wallant was a Jewish-American author lumped in with the likes of Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, or Bernard Malamud. But after reading this book, I can definitely see that his talent more than qualifies him for the company of those talented authors. This was a heavy read, but also a very, very good one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA39F9PFS0M7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941493149#wasThisHelpful","RA39F9PFS0M7O","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the look of this animal zoo. It's bright and colorful. My 15-month old was immediately drawn to it. The monkey and animal figures are the perfect size for his hands; even when my son isn't playing with the whole tree house, he seems to have at least one of the figures from this set with him.The elephant is probably the most fun part of the set. He is weighty, substantial. His feet move, and his trunk bends. When you touch the button on his back, he plays music. And the music sounds surprisingly good, too! My son always smiles and dances to it--and inevitably presses the button again to keep the fun going.My only complaint is that the actual tree house is somewhat boring. My son (and his older siblings) like teetering the figures back and forth on the tree tops. But it's hard for little hands to position the figures so that they actually stay on the tree. Same with the swing. It's fun in theory, buy my baby can't get the figure to stay on the swing (even I sometimes have trouble with it). As for the part to the right of the tree, well, it's not much better. The yellow piece slides up and down the vertical bar, the red flat piece opens up to reveal a very shallow compartment (too shallow to put anything in), and there is a blue piece that can be flipped up and down. There just isn't much to engage on that side (and my baby agrees with me on that point; he only plays with the tree part).So, overall, I really like the brightness and durability of the set. And the elephant, monkey, and people figures are a lot of fun for my son. I just wish there was more to interact with on the actual tree house part.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P61KUPXUXJUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT1SW#wasThisHelpful","R3P61KUPXUXJUA","AGBFIQMV9L61Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGBFIQMV9L61Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""A Dark Inheritance (UFiles, Volume One)""Written by Chris D'Lacey. . . . .Chris D'Lacey's dragon-oriented ""Fire"" series was one of the first series that my kid delved into on her own, leaving dear old dad in the dust - she was really into it, but by the time she put down the last one, she was done and sold them all back to a local book shop. I figured I'd give this book, the first in a new series, a try and see what the fuss was about. We read it aloud together, and I gotta say I was pretty shocked by how badly written this was. D'Lacey's authorial voice is stiff and self-consciously mechanistic -- you can hear the gears grinding as he tries to make his writing sound clever, with several real clunkers in the metaphor department and character descriptions that frequently bring the narrative to a screeching halt. The dialogue is often terrible, and many of the characters are thinly conceived and have unclear motivations and unrealistic interactions. All in all, I was somewhat appalled that this guy is such a popular writer, given the high level of kids' lit these days.The main character Michael is tweenage boy who apparently has reality-altering superpowers that he was unaware of... A cool concept that quickly gets swallowed up into a fairly stiff narrative. Michael is the book's first person narrator and often lapses into inexplicable descriptions of what the female characters were wearing -- D'Lacey seems more concerned with describing fashion than character traits -- and his interactions with these female characters often ring false, particularly a long sequence where the mother of a girl the hero has never met practically adopts Michael on the spot, welcoming him into her house and trading bon mots with him in an almost sub-Mrs. Robinson-ish way. Although almost all the supporting characters are female, D'Lacey doesn't always fill these characters in that well -- the most convincing is Michael's sarcastic little sister, the least is the French super-spy Chantelle, who wobbles between roles as an object of undefined desire and vague maternal authority -- and male characters mainly exist as potential bad guys.The narrative flow is pretty uneven, with patches of natural-sounding dialogue punctuated by forced scenes that are meant to drive the plot forward, but which stand out like boulders in the road. D'Lacey adds a lot of elements that draw attention to themselves and pull readers out of the story -- overly elaborate and clunky metaphors, monologues, iffy plot devices and abrupt shifts in narrative that seem too contrived. The most compelling element of the book, Michael's ability to warp reality, is neglected in the second half of the book, in favor of resolving the book's not-too-compelling mystery. I suppose if you're not looking for top-notch writing and just want a quick book to gobble down, this is okay ""junk food"" reading, but it also seems that there are a lot of writers working in similar veins who do a better job. I guess I'd give this a 2.5, if I could.

"...even when she was struggling.This five-CD ""brick"" includes five albums from her 1970s heyday on Warner Brothers:""Streetlights"" (1974)""Home Plate"" (1975)""Sweet Forgiveness"" (1977)""The Glow"" (1979)""Green Light"" (1982)This collection omits her first three albums, which are the stuff of legend and probably sell quite well on their own, in favor of the next five records which have their ups and downs, but are still vital parts of the Bonnie Raitt canon. The first album, ""Streetlights,"" is of a piece with the first three, with a soulful mix of blues, country/folk and soul, but it also shows Bonnie starting to get swallowed up by the LA studio system, and maybe losing her way a bit aesthetically speaking. Still, it includes her version of John Prine's ""Angel From Montgomery,"" which is a stone cold classic. The next album, ""Home Plate,"" was just awful and probably reflects various other bad choices she was making at the time. Two years later she bounded back with ""Sweet Forgiveness,"" which was a little gooey but great, and included some classics such as the title track and her versions of Paul Siebel's ""Louise"" and Karla Bonoff's ""Home.""Personally, I love 1979's ""The Glow,"" which is a slick set of torchy soul songs worthy of Percy Mayfield or Etta James, and 1982's ""Green Light"" is also a guilty pleasure.  This one was sort of her new wave album, a glib, bouncy rock set recorded with Terry Adams of NRBQ. There are some dumb songs on here, as well as some soulful gems, all of it framed by bright, melodic, round-toned production and tons of shameless pop hooks... It doesn't really stick to my ribs the way her best stuff does, but I like it. Used to sing along to it as a kid.All in all, this is a great collection of music by one of America's great roots musicians. Skip ""Home Plate"" and cherish the rest. Ya gotta love Bonnie Raitt!

"""Fury: My War Gone By""Written by Garth EnnisIllustrated by Goran Parlov(Marvel Comics, 2014). . . . .NOTE: spoilers below. . . . .How did Nick Fury get to be such a bad-ass? What was he doing in the days before SHIELD? Dystopian writer Garth Ennis tackles this question in this grim, grisly, uber-cynical story-cycle about Fury's career as a black ops super-commando during the Cold War, with chapters set in 1950's French Indochina, Cuba, Vietnam again, and Contra-era Nicaragua. Fury and his compatriots run clandestine hit jobs for the CIA, while history noisily unfolds in the background -- he's there at the Bay Of Pigs and the invasion of Laos -- just nobody knows it.Actually, this series doesn't really tie into the whole SHIELD mythos -- it never comes out and this books seems to be non-canonical, as Fury's groovy 'Sixties swingin' spy days are replaced by a much grittier career as a war-addict, ex-war hero, a half-thug soul-dead hitman working for the CIA. SHIELD, the Howlers, Hydra and AIM are nowhere to be seen, just a lot of blood guts, boobs and really coarse language. Some scenes are particularly harrowing -- this is a ""war is hell"" comic writ large. It isn't your grandpa's Nick Fury comic, for sure, but it is a good read -- grim, gripping and substantive.Particularly nice are the nods to action tales and artists of yesteryear, hints of Canniff, Kubert, Oliver Stone, and others. This book ain't pretty, but it sure is well-made. Recommended, though not for squeamish readers.

"OXO Good Grips Zester. . . . .This is billed as a zester, but they also suggested it could be used as a cheese grater... My current cheese plane is getting a little bit dull, so, yeah, it was time to get a backup. The OXO Good Grips Zester does not shave parm as finely as does our old microshaver, but it's fine nonetheless. I gotta say, though, that the angled grip is a nice feature -- they sell it as a plus for storage and countertop stability... I dunno about that, but the angled tilt between hand and grater feels nice in a subtly ergonomic way... With my old straight cheese plane, I have to point the tool away from my hand, and invariably tension builds up as I'm grating on a straight line, and I'll lose the line and cheese flecks go flying across the kitchen... So far this hasn't happened with the OXO model... Maybe it's also because the cheese is being grated more coarsely and there's less tension required to get a good ""bite"" out of the parm... Anyway, this is a pretty effective kitchen tool... Nothing super-fancy - it just does the job and does it well.  I would recommend this item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGTBMGS2HLZVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VLYQGS#wasThisHelpful","RGTBMGS2HLZVY","A3CN9CCJUNIPKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Various Artists""FEEDBACK MADAGASCAR""(ARC Music, 2014). . . . .A lively set of modernized, contemporary pop from the isaland nation of Madagascar... For those of us familiar with the more acoustic-oriented Madagascarian music that leaked out in the '80s and '90s, a lot of these more high-tech recordings may come as a revelation -- slick pop sounds have come into this corner of Africa as well, although with that unique Malagasy spin. A few artists, such as Rossy and Jaojoby, may ring a bell, but most are unfamiliar -- to me at least, and to my way of thinking, that's a very good thing. Some of the production is a little too slick for me, but the music is all new, and thus I am hooked.  Definitely worth a spin... Plus, the album sales are a benefit for TREEMAD, an environmental fund that aims at reversing the deforestation that's endangering the Malagasy ecology, so it's good works as well as good music.

"""The Walking Dead Volume 22: A New Beginning""Written by Robert KirkmanIllustrated by Charlie Adlard(Image Books, 2014). . . . .Mild spoilers festering below. . . . .I refrained from posting a review of the last Walking Dead TPB... Like a lot of people, I felt let down by the arty but perhaps predictable expectation-defying anticlimax, though I didn't feel as strongly about it as some of the more strident readers who posted denunciations of Robert Kirkman for betraying all that is zombilicious and good... I figured, he's got a plan, it's ambitious, let's see where he goes.So, finally, Volume 22 came out and like all the others, and whizz-bang!! I burned through it in an hour and was still hooked. Kirkman does a little deus ex machina number and skips ahead a year or two (oops! did I mention the spoilers?) and we get to see his vision of a recovering human civilization coming to fruition. Everybody's older, wiser -- happier even! -- and things are looking pretty hopeful, even though there are still too many zombies out there to eliminate altogether, so there's that. A cranky batch of new characters are introduced, to balance out the casualties of the last few years, and the surviving characters from issues past are generally going through some interesting changes, with the keenest focus being placed on Rick's son, Carl.Despite the rotting corpses on the cover, the real dangers still come from other humans: this book is a prelude to another conflict with a criminal human faction (oh, right - oops! spoiler alert!) and in some ways I wish Kirkman & Co. had spent a little more time fleshing out the mechanics and daily rhythms of their post-apocalypse utopia. (Doubtless, a Volume 21-1/2 will come out someday...) I kind of hope the battle between the new batch of sociopaths isn't too drawn out - the Negan storyline got really old, and I'd like us to see more of the world than just one patch of forest in Georgia...) But as I said above, I'm still hooked.  This was a good volume that packed in a lot of information, and I'm hanging onto it for a while, as I'm sure that it will be fun (and informative) to re-read as the plot thickens later on.

"""Last Shop Standing: The Rise, Fall AndRebirth Of The Independent Record Shop"". . . . .This brief documentary is an ardent love letter to locally owned record stores, once a dying breed and now back off the endangered list as the novelty of the digital era gives way to a more mature view of the music world. The setting is Great Britain, as musically-obsessed a nation as ever there was, and the cast of characters includes dozens of delightfully idiosyncratic record store owners and employees, and many of their numerous fans, including music journalists and fabled British artists such as Billy Bragg, Johnny Marr and Paul Weller of The Jam, who sing the praises of their favorite local shops, while also offering clear-eyed analyses of what went wrong.The opening chapters paint a dire picture, of a heartless music industry that threw the indie shops to the wolves when their corporate profit models changed, and a fickle fan base who plundered the Internet's bounty when Napster & Co. arose, and quit spending money in the analog world... Many shops went under, but the sellers that survived became lean and adaptable, as well as philosophical about the various twists of fate. The film examines a global phenomenon through a ""small"" local filter, and while the specifics may have been different in other countries, the overall story sound much the same. (And I'm sure I'm not the only viewer who spent a lot of the movie quickly absorbing the flavors and rhythms of various shops across the UK, looking yearningly at the overstuffed record bins in the background shots, and making mental lists of all the stores I'd love to check out on my next vacation...)Numerous interviewees offer clear and cogent explanations of how indie stores fit into the wider music business, and how the changes of the '80s, '90s and '00s made them vulnerable to decline. The funereal tone of the film gives way, surprisingly, to a strong note of hope, as a new generation of music lovers got the ""shop local"" vibe, and events like the annual Record Store Day brought new life into the surviving shops. The end of the film feels a little rushed (probably trying to keep it short enough for TV slots, perhaps?) but the optimistic tone is a pleasant note to end on.This documentary is simultaneously clear-eyed and misty-eyed -- a neat trick -- and is an informative and delightful excursion into the world of independent music and independent retail. Plus, what a great cast of characters - one charming local music nerd after another... what's not to love? Highly recommended!

"Various Artists""MALE VOICES OF FADO""(ARC Music, 2014). . . . .An excellent collection of contemporary fado ballads, featuring some of Portugual's finest male singers, including some old-timers and some younger artists.  This particular selection is easy on the ears, in the sense that it doesn't showcase much of the severity that sometimes characterizes the genre... Which isn't to say that it's a goopy world-fusion crossover set, not by any means.  These performances are uniformly soulful and compelling, wonderful examples of the aching, reflective nostalgia and romanticism that characterizes the genre.  Female fado singers often get the most attention with global audiences, but this album is a great way to introduce yourself to the masculine side of the style... Features singers such as Joao Braga, Fernando Farinha, Carlos Ramos, Ricardo Ribeiro and others.  Recommended!

"Korrontzi""Tradition 2.1""(ARC Music, 2014). . . . .Freewheeling world-beat instrumentals and vocal songs from a lively Basque band.  The melodic, accordion-led music reveals strong Celtic, African and Arabic influences (as well as Iberian/Latin ones) with vocals in a variety of languages, including Italian, Euskara (Basque) and African dialects such as Shona... The wide array of influences reflects both the unique cultural geography of Catalonia and the band's wide travel and embrace of many styles of music.Guest performers include Celtic virtuosi such as Scottish accordionist Phil Cunningham (on ""Arkupeko Dantza"") and Michael McGoldrickm playing uileann pipes on ""Diatonic Bilbon,"" as well as Portuguese fado guitarist Custodio Castelo. Most songs center around the giddy, high-energy performances by bandleader Agus Barandiaran on the trikitixa, which is a Basque version of the accordion. This album is very cheerful and easy on the ears... After a while it may seem a little too ""poppy,"" but mostly it's quite pleasant.  The new version also includes a two-sided video disc, presented in both PAL and NTSC formats, with two long-ish clips of live performances that give a sense of this band's high-energy approach.

"Dan Brock & Louise Brock""Kentucky Songbag""(Donerail Records, 1968). . . . .Bluegrass fans will want to give this a listen - it's JD Crowe and his first band, The Kentucky Mountain Boys, backing folksingers Dan and Louise Brock on a perky set of songs about Kentucky and its traditions. The musical approaches are quite different -- the Brocks were very much in a Chad Mitchell-esque coffeehouse folk mode, but the low-key bluegrass backing works well. The musicians include J. D. Crowe on banjo and guitar, fiddler/bassist Bobby Sloane and Doyle Lawson on several instruments as well.The Kentucky Mountain Boys -- soon to change their name to The New South -- also recorded their first album, Bluegrass Holiday, at the same time as this one, though the Brocks got the first release date, and the band's picking is kind of in the background on most of this album.

"I have a lot of merino wool clothing... probably 90% of my clothing.  Most has been minus33 brand, but I have now been trying a couple other brands for some more options and styles.  This long sleeve shirt is great quality, fits me perfect (I am 5'11"" 160lbs and ordered a medium), and feels great; no itch at all (I have no itch with my minus33 either).  I use this shirt, due to it's light weight, from spring to fall.  It makes a great base layer under a tshirt on cool days or nights.  And of course, because it's merino wool, it has tons of great properties which I'm sure if you are looking at merino wool clothing you probably already know!  I wash my merino wool just in a sink!  Just cold water, a little wool shampoo, swish around a bit, rinse, then lay out on towels to dry.  So easy, and saves tons of electricity and water by not using my washing/drying machine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZKBOY8JNA7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGO9UL2#wasThisHelpful","R2IZKBOY8JNA7G","A1V7LAYECKEL8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V7LAYECKEL8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear a 31 to 32 waist for my jeans.  I ordered a small and these fit perfect.  A medium would probably be fine as well, but I prefer my underwear to fit well, so it doesn't have extra material to bunch up.  They are soft, breathable, easy to wash, and really just some of the best boxers I have ever owned.  Pricey, but when you start using merino wool you will understand that you don't need 50 shirts, 50 underwear, 50 socks, etc.  You just need a few of each.  So you have less, they are easier to care for due to having less, and they are much better material and quality!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P7DWOSZPTKXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFOP8CQ#wasThisHelpful","R2P7DWOSZPTKXO","A1V7LAYECKEL8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V7LAYECKEL8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Probably the best shoes I have ever warn.  They fit perfect, they are waterproof yet still breathe.  I probably wouldn't wear them in the hot summer unless I was going on a hike where I knew things would be getting wet or muddy, just because I think they may get a little warm if it was say 80F or higher out.  But I really can't say yet, I have only warn them during winter so far, and they have been amazing.  They keep my feet warm due to the waterproof and windproof.  Being windproof really makes a difference!  It lets my socks do their job of insultaing my feet without new cold air always coming in.

Now these can be washed in a normal washer/dryer; however, you should get some good wool shampoo, not normal detergent, and wash with only cold water, and I usually just dry with no heat, it takes a bit longer, but uses less energy because it isn't making heat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R346Q9J40AKZ36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R7A326#wasThisHelpful","R346Q9J40AKZ36","A1V7LAYECKEL8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1V7LAYECKEL8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This perfume is not as strong as many I have tried recently, and it has a nice staying power, lasting all day.I find this scent to be both calming and refreshing.

"Where It Hurts is a very well told mystery and a piercing examination of grief.  Coleman's latest offering is beautifully written, masterfully plotted and keenly heart felt.  Gus Murphy is a complex character struggling to come to terms with the death of his son, who finds himself drawn into a tale of murder and corruption that will shake his town to the core, and just might bring him back to life.I started reading this story and was quickly overcome by the dark, depressive atmosphere and Gus' air of hopelessness.  Just as I was starting to wonder if I could continue with this dark tale, I found myself thoroughly engaged by a mystery that just kept delivering new twists and turns, and by a lead character that managed to win my heart from the depths of his depression.Where It Hurts is the work of a master storyteller.  I found this book hard to put down and was sad to say goodbye to Gus Murphy.  I hope this is the first installment of a new series, as I can't wait to see what the future holds for Gus,and I can't wait to read more of this author's fine writing.  His authentic dialogue, his dark imagery, and his perceptive observations on grief and family all make this a stellar work and an enthusiastic recommend for any fan of dark, gritty mysteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31GCEPWZHCC8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039917303X#wasThisHelpful","R31GCEPWZHCC8T","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Game of Flames is an adequate installment of the exciting Voyagers sci-fi series that will be eagerly read by the series' many young fans.  This is a fast paced, action packed read and an excellent choice for reluctant readers.  Although the author does a fine job of bringing new readers up to speed on the events of the previous book, readers will find it much easier to start with book 1.  This book continues to follow the formula of a new planet and a new element as we continue to follow the efforts of the Alpha Team as they struggle to find each of the elements required to make the energy that will save the Earth.This installment of the series answers some of the questions that were left at the end of book 1, and poses quite a few new ones.  Kids will be thoroughly engaged by the characters, but might find that this installment lacks some of the suspense and drama that was present in the first book.  There's plenty of action, but it's all predictable, and I doubt that even the youngest reader will feel much tension or have any doubt about the eventual outcome.The science involved in this work of science fiction is a bit sketchy at times, but the strong characters carry the story along at a good clip.  Some of the character motivations remain unclear, and there are enough unanswered questions to ensure that young readers will be clamoring for the next installment.  This one was just okay for me, and I hope that the next installment brings back some of the drama.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7C5ZI1KNESWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385386613#wasThisHelpful","R7C5ZI1KNESWM","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure how I've missed this series, but I'm glad I finally found it!  I'm kind of sad though, as I think I've started at the end!  Bryant & May works just fine as a stand alone, but it is filled with characters that are so intriguing I found myself wishing to know more about the histories that are only hinted at in this volume.The Burning Man is a smart, well written mystery that is full of twists and turns that  will certainly test your detective skills as you try to figure things out along with the Peculiar Crimes Unit.  I will admit that I became lost in trying to track a rather large cast of characters, and struggled to make sense of London police organizational structure and financial district geography.  This became easier as the novel progressed as I became more accustomed to the author's writing.I was able to hang with a somewhat confusing, complicated beginning thanks to the author's fine writing. It is a true pleasure to read, turning this mystery into an exercise in witticism and solid plotting.  Dialogue snaps along so fast, and developments occur at such unexpected intervals that it's important to pay close attention.  This is not a novel to be read with only half of your attention.  Instead, this is a mystery to be thoroughly enjoyed and devoured.  I look forward to searching out more Bryant & May cases!  The Burning Man is a must read for any fan of British mysteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AV68W9FYNIXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345547683#wasThisHelpful","R1AV68W9FYNIXL","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Peddler's Road marks the first installment of an exciting new series steeped in folklore and filled with adventure.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and admired the author's imaginative take on the classic story of the Pied Piper.  I wasn't expecting Baba Yaga to show up, and enjoyed the homage to classic fairy tales.This is a well told story, with two main characters who are well developed and easy to cheer for as they find themselves on a good old fashioned quest, facing evil in an effort to find their way home and ultimately save the world.  They are joined by creatures both magical and tragic.  Dialogues are well written and filled with energy, helping to move this story along at a fast clip.Parents of very young readers should be cautioned that this story is rather dark.  The thought of children being stolen from their parents might be a bit too scary for some, while others will relish both mood and atmosphere.  Yaga's forest of bone is a triumph, and the Pied Piper himself is sure to send shivers to young readers.  The Peddler's Cove is a well written action adventure that is sure to please young Percy Jackson fans looking for some new magic, and is an enthusiastic recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XAKJKBTSY0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385755228#wasThisHelpful","R10XAKJKBTSY0S","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bear and Squirrel Are Friends is a delightfully funny read aloud and a must have for any story time collection.  The author uses a rather muted color palette, smart design choices and cartoon-like characters to tell a story that is filled with moments of sly humor.  I've been reading this story to various groups of preschoolers all week with great success.  The author builds suspense as she leads us through a description of this rather unorthodox friendship, bear's hibernation, and bear's great hunger when he wakes.  Will he eat his friend?  That's the question that will engage any story time audience, as they can see where this is going from early on.  I heard whispered questions as they eagerly waited for me to turn the page.  That's great story time stuff!This picture book is wonderfully paced, very well written and filled with enough small details to guarantee lots of requests for repeat reads.  No worries, all ends well and the power of friendship is once again reinforced.  A surprisingly light and whimsical take on the typical hibernation theme and an enthusiastic recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KMJP932A8YK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481429132#wasThisHelpful","R3KMJP932A8YK9","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Build and Imagine playset I have examined, and although I feel that it does have some design flaws, I do think this one provides plenty of play opportunities for young children ages 5 -8 with an interest in story telling.  The increased number of panels offers more building opportunities than some of the other available sets, and the addition of sturdy animal characters add to the value of this offering.The stand alone characters are sturdy, and the building panels fit together securely and are stable when used to construct the building shown.  Note that the panels are only magnetic on one side, and that these magnet pieces are very small.  They will be hard to manipulate for younger children, and easily lost.  This playset is a recommend for kids at the upper end of the recommended age range and will provide even more play opportunities when combines with some of the more basic Build & Imagine sets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UTY70UFXN9HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SP8KMI#wasThisHelpful","R1UTY70UFXN9HB","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a celebration of family, even the members that drive you crazy, and that wonderful thing that allows us to love them anyway.This was a hard read.  I wanted to stop a few times, just because it became so intense that I was having trouble dealing with some emotions that this story brought forth.  As a parent of a 19 year old special needs son, there were so many things in this story, so many feelings, so much dialogue, and even moments of humor that struck so close to home, it was uncomfortable.  This story rings with authenticity and it's cast of flawed characters are a treat to read.  This is not the soft and fuzzy story that you sometimes find that depicts parents of special needs kids as martyrs or saints.  This is a searing examination of love and bitterness, and guilt and doubt.  It's incredibly human, and achieves that balance between the dramatic and the realistic with an uncommon grace.The author has created a powerful story that sheds light on the plight of America's disabled adults.  As importantly, it sheds light on the issues families face when the special needs of one member effect everyone in the family.  This is a distinctly American family story.  A road trip like no other and  a well observed and heart felt roller coaster ride along life's journey.  It's. Nice. Outside, is a truly memorable story and an enthusiastic recommend for any fan of literary fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRHCNUMCSVXIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250036054#wasThisHelpful","RRHCNUMCSVXIQ","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed Under the Udala Trees and found it to be a well written, deeply personal coming of age story that moved me with it's keen observations on love, war, faith and tradition.  The writing is stellar, conveying both the beautiful and the terrible  with a level of care that brought me fully into the story.  This book is filled with characters that are vibrant and fully developed, all prepared to infuriate you and break your heart.There are many references to Nigerian culture, tradition and folklore that sometimes left me feeling a bit adrift, but I never lost the essence of this powerful story, and as we reached the end and Ijeoma states that she and her daughter were ""...both choking under the weight of something larger than us, something heavy and weighty, the weight of tradition and superstition and of all our legends"", I felt that I knew exactly what she meant.This book was very eye opening for me, as it brought to bitter focus the plight of the LGBTcommunity in Nigeria.  In reading this story that is so far removed from my own personal experience, I was able to gain perspective and knowledge.  I was also entertained by a finely written tale that proves once again that love is universal, struggles with faith are ongoing no matter what corner of the globe you call home, and that we all sometimes suffer from the weight of the very things we hold dear.  Under the Udala Trees is an important story and an enthusiastic recommend for any fan of literary fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22V5N13OCFE2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544003446#wasThisHelpful","R22V5N13OCFE2Q","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Mother Goose and use her rhymes every week in story time.  I was overjoyed to see this new title as it represents yet another opportunity for young readers to learn the classics.  The author pays homage to 15 classics, all wrapped up in a brand new story that will appeal to every toddler or preschooler.  The rhyming is fast paced and well written, creating a smooth read aloud flow that makes this an excellent choice for a sleepy themed story time or a bedtime read.Mother Goose has called all of her favorite characters to her house for story time, and we get to follow the cow, dish and the spoon, along with Jack be Nimble and Jack-a-Dandy as they gather together their things to head to her house.  Wee Willie Winkie is coming, along with Bo Peep, and that Contrary Mary,  Miss Muffet's spider is also there, and they all get to listen to MG's tales of faraway lands.  When it's time to say goodnight, Mother Goose puts them all to bed as the stars spell out Good Night.  The text is clever and the rhyming is perfect as befits a Mother Goose story.But Wait!  This book isn't done yet!  After the story is done, you get a full text of each of the fifteen rhymes featured in the story.  The illustrations have a classic, timeless feel and with the addition of the original rhymes, this turns this book into the complete package.  I love everything about this one, and if you are looking for one toddler book to give this Christmas, you can't go wrong with Mother Goose's Pajama Party.  This is a whimsical treat that will keep on giving and is an enthusiastic recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXHG4223JTKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553497561#wasThisHelpful","RGXHG4223JTKE","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loren Long has created a truly beautiful look at the seasons with this gem.  An excellent choice for story time or the classroom, the author uses a spare, sometimes lyrical text to tell a story of one little tree that is afraid to let go.  All young story listeners will be able to identify with the fear of change, and will easily understand this little tree's reluctance to let go of his leaves when the seasons change and all of his fellow trees seem to be moving on without him.  The book exudes an atmosphere of caring and concern as the animals wonder if the tree is feeling sick, and try to encourage him to let go. It's only when the little tree realizes that he can no longer see the sky because his fellow trees have grown so large, that he decides to let go.  The final spread provides a nice pay off as we see the little tree finally as big as his fellows and embracing the seasonal changes.Long's illustrations are quite stunning.  His charming depictions of both trees and animals really pop against an abundance of white space.  He perfectly conveys the changing seasons with forest scenes that make you feel the chilling cold of winter and the lushness of summer.  Little Tree has a ton of personality, which is surprising as he has no features.  This story will serve as an intro to seasonal change or just a fun fable about nature and letting go.  Little Tree is a new classic and an enthusiastic recommend for story time, classroom use, or any young child's personal collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196ECRZ4NOBLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399163972#wasThisHelpful","R196ECRZ4NOBLC","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Race Car Count is a wonderful counting book that will hold great appeal for young racing fans.  Michael Slack takes that whimsical  touch that gave Monkey Truck such charm and uses it to  create a group of 10 race cars that are loaded with personality.  His illustrations are filled with so much energy that this book just races by. In a book filled with wrecks, oil slicks, engine trouble, and loops, it's hard to take your eyes off the pictures long enough to worry about counting the cars.The text is spare, making this a perfect choice for toddlers as well as preschoolers.  The rhyme rolls along without a hitch as its energy perfectly complements the illustrations.  Each number is highlighted and over sized to aid in number recognition, and with the exception of the spread featuring car number 10,  all cars are available for counting on each two page spread.  The final two pages highlight all 10 cars lined up in a row and ready to race again, creating an excellent number line for some of the best counting practice to be found this side of the race track.It's not often you find such an effective counting book that is also a fun read aloud.  Since this one does not feature the number word, and only counts up to 10 and not back down, this is best recommended for early counters and race fans of all ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N89NW5KYR2FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627790098#wasThisHelpful","R1N89NW5KYR2FW","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read and enjoyed Katherine Howe's previous novels, so I was excited to dive into this one.  I soon discovered that although Ms. Howe's writing continues to be top notch, in this case she has decided to tell a story that is so ponderously slow that it was a struggle to finish.  As a ghost story, The Appearance of Annie van Sinderen  is a success, but as a thriller, the total absence of suspense and the slow pacing leave this novel floundering about in its own creepiness.Howe succeeds once again in creating a story that is supremely creepy.  This story is deeply atmospheric, and Howe sets the scene beautifully. Her transitions are seamless, and the story itself is intriguing.  With all this great stuff going on, it's a shame that the pacing was so off.  This might have been overcome if the character of Annie had been stronger, but I never felt any sort of connection with her.  The Appearance of Annie van Sinderen is an intriguing story, but only a cautious recommend for older teen and adult fans of literary ghost stories.*This book provided courtesy of the publisher","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HL6CP9U2CS1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167781#wasThisHelpful","R3HL6CP9U2CS1A","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Searcher is a very enjoyable fast paced read that features fine writing, suspense, and memorable characters.  I had a hard time putting this one down, as the author had me hooked pretty much from page one.  This work is extremely well plotted, offering up intrigue, mystery, and action in just the right amounts to keep the pages turning at a fast clip.  Solomon Creed is indeed a man of mystery, and the hints of the supernatural only add to his allure.I think it's the author's extensive descriptive talent and his ability to balance that with finely choreographed action that makes this book seem so cinematic.  The Searcher is a fine thriller.  It's grisly and violent, and also well observed and very unique.  A twisty, gritty thrill ride that is an enthusiastic recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYDT6JCM5N5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062329723#wasThisHelpful","R1FYDT6JCM5N5Y","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Killing Trail marks the debut of what will surely be an interesting series featuring an engaging heroine and a truly memorable dog.  I think I was a bit surprised by this book, as I was expecting something a bit more gritty.  This is in fact a cozy mystery, with no language or graphic violence.  I love a good dog story, so I did enjoy this one and actually found myself wishing for more stuff about the dog and less about the rather flat, one dimensional characters.  The relationship between Mattie and Robo was the high point of the book and the only reason this sneaks into a three star rating.The mystery here is very predictable, and the ending offered up few surprises.  I found the dialogue to be very clunky, hampering the character development and leaving me adrift in plot developments that didn't seem very realistic.  The author has some very interesting subject matter to work with here, and an engaging lead character, unfortunately she just fails to tell a very exciting story.  Even though this book is a very fast, easy read, the story lacks substance and is only a cautious recommend for those readers who like their mysteries on the simple, cozy side.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJARCMXEJK5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629533815#wasThisHelpful","R3DJARCMXEJK5W","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mudpuppy makes wonderful puzzles, and this construction themed cutie is no exception.  At 25 pieces, this is a perfect choice for three year olds, who will likely find it just challenging enough to make it fun.  The artwork is whimsical and filled with energy, featuring cute dog characters guiding favorite construction machines along a windy road.  The color palette is kind of muted, but fits well with the theme.The pieces of this puzzle are thick and well cut, fitting together easily.

"I went into this novel not knowing what to expect.  I chose it based on the author, so I was a bit taken aback at first, not sure what to make of this format, and the author's rather light hearted tone.  It wasn't long though until I had fallen in love with the characters and caught on to the author's satirical send up of all things YA.  It's a strange combination of events that bring fantasy and reality together in this story, but the final message is a good one, and the ride was fun.  Patrick Ness always produces literature that stretches convention. and The Rest of Us Just Live Here does a great job of pushing that envelope and reminding us that the most important things in life are happening every day.  It turns out that we don't have to save the world after all.  We are still pretty special.

"Jack Gantos is a brilliant writer, and I firmly believe that any teenager struggling to find his way and learn how to be true to himself will find it easy to relate to this story. I also firmly believe that it's a miracle that Mr.Gantos survived his adolescence.  I know that this is a fictionalized account, but even if only a portion of this is true, then it had to be a miracle.This is a short, fast read filled with perceptive observations on growing up, hilarious accounts of bad behavior, and heart breaking moments of such poignancy that they took my breath away.  All of these can occur on a single page, as this is the gift of Jack Gantos.  This book takes place over a very short period of time.  It ended up feeling a bit truncated.  The ending seemed abrupt, just as the beginning felt like being thrown in the deep end of the pool after all the party guests had already been there for a couple of hours.

"The Scribe was a treat to read, combining elements of historical fiction, horror, and mystery (my favorite genres) into a a riveting story that was hard to put down.  The author seamlessly spins out an excellent mystery, all the while firmly setting this gory story in time and place through excellent use of period detail.  The characters are well drawn and fascinating.  I was immediately invested in Thomas Canby, intrigued by his past, and engaged by his intelligent, straight forward manner.  His pairing with Cyrus Underwood added an even further dimension to what was already a multi-faceted story.This story won't be for everyone.  It's quite gruesome, although none of the authors details seem gratuitous.  His distinctive writing style depicts a serial killer's gruesome activities with a keen analytical eye and a gothic sensibility.  Cyrus Underwood adds a local Atlanta feel that brings in the supernatural in a voice that is haunting and true.

"The Girl Who Could Not Dream is the perfect fantasy adventure for the 9-12 year old set.  Heck, I'm way past that age group and I totally loved it.  This book has it all!  Well drawn characters, humor, action, a unique and interesting premise, monsters, glitter ponies and pink rabbits.  What more could you want?Durst has fashioned a true children's adventure novel that is so refreshing and well written that I can't wait to tell all of our young  library patrons all about it.  In a time when so many fantasies are being written that lean toward the dark side, Durst has went the opposite direction, infusing her story with a heavy dose of whimsy and humor without sacrificing the action and suspense.  Kids will find it easy to relate to young Sophie and her middle school struggles, even as they envy her own personal monster.  She is a character of unexpected depth, and the author manages to address a number of important issues without ever becoming didactic.I had a hard time putting this book down once I started it, a testament to the spot on pacing, fine writing and originality.  Sophie finds herself in genuine peril throughout most of the book, dealing with some nightmarish monsters on her way to save her parents.

I lit the candle in my dining area, and within the hour I let it burn, the scent had permeated most of my relatively small house.  Unfortunately, I found this scent to be far too strong and cloying.

"Although I'm not a total fan of the CEB translation, I do feel that this is at heart an excellent bible for kids ages 9-12.  It's beautifully bound, with a very engaging cover that is sure to appeal to young readers.  I liked this Bible's use of colorful, engaging characters, and enjoyed the many devotionals that are sprinkled throughout.  The beginning of each book features a very readable summary of events that will take place, and highlights the people, places and ""words you'll remember"".I especially appreciated the ""Bet you can!"" challenges that challenge young readers to read certain passages.  I also liked that memorization suggestions were included throughout the text.  Also included is an impressive selection of maps, a dictionary, and a topic index for the articles.  I liked the index entitled ""I wonder when I'm....""  The index cites verses that apply to topics such as anger, fear sick and thankful.  I actually feel that this area could have been expanded.While I do feel that this is a solid Bible for pre-teens, there is a significant drawback that keeps it from a five star rating.  I feel that the print is far too small for a kids Bible.  In the same vein, I wish the publisher could have used more graphics to further break up the text and make it less intimidating for younger readers.  A few more interesting fonts, text boxes and a bit more color in the heart of the text would have made all the difference in the world for what is otherwise a very fine and worthwhile offering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OPC7BYTTSKZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261917#wasThisHelpful","R3OPC7BYTTSKZF","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first exposure to a CEB translation, and I will admit that I kind of miss the language from my usual New King James version.  Still, I was interested in what insights this Bible might be able to offer so I selected a chapter to do a direct comparison.  It stays pretty true to meaning and offers up some new and valuable perspectives that I feel will be invaluable to young readers.  There are articles that appear right in the text, The book of Romans features short articles entitled ""On Being A Nonconformist"", and ""Nothing Can Separate You From God's Love"", just to name a couple.  They are quick and insightful reads that pulls the Bible text into present day in an engaging manner.One of my favorite elements are the ""Pray"" boxes which feature prayers and insights from teens.  Each book ends up with a section of discussion topics, which are perfect for any teen interested in leading a Bible study.  One of the most innovative features is the Reading Differently section which ends each book and encourages teens to experience the Bible in a new way.  The suggestions range from simple to advanced and offer new opportunities for anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the word.Personally, I don't think I'll ever give up my New King James translation, but I will be passing this along to my 16 year old son who will no doubt find it valuable.  This Bible also includes a surprisingly complete selection of maps, an index to well known Bible passages and stories, and an article index.  This is a nice tool for any student of the Bible, but is targeted for teens and young adults.  An excellent resource and an enthusiastic recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FB4GFXOW0G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261798#wasThisHelpful","R10FB4GFXOW0G2","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

See, I enjoy sci-fi as well as mysteries and although I'm not a huge fan of hard sci-fi, I felt sure that this book would be one I would enjoy.

I feel that in this instance, Mr. Sandford's writing can best be described as flat, and I find the characters to be totally uninteresting.  I'm tired of slogging through repetitive information dumps that rob the story of any momentum, while dissecting the science to a level of minutiae that was mind numbing for this lay reader.I felt that the cast of characters represented a lot of missed opportunities to give real dimension to this story.  With the exception of one or two, they never seemed like real people - and I really wanted to get to know them. Unfortunately, I got to know the ship a lot better than the people, which for me is never a good thing.  Where's the suspense?  I kept looking for some sort of tension, but since there was so little emotion and so little feeling to be had in this dispassionate narrative, I couldn't find anything to keep me going.Saturn Run is not a recommend from this reader, who evidently prefers her space stories a little more on the space opera side of things.  I've read reviews comparing Saturn Run to the works of Heinlein.  I have to admit that I just don't get it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7U3M138Z5OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399176950#wasThisHelpful","R1D7U3M138Z5OM","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am beginning to love this entire Dead Sea Essentials product line!  This three pack of bubble bath/shower gel is a real treat and is sure to please any fan of a relaxing bathing experience.  Of the three scents that are included in this pack, my favorite is the lavender.  It's a true delight and produces a lovely scent when used in a nice steamy bath.  The Hibiscus is way too floral for me and really struck me the wrong way, although I'm sure there are others who will love it.  The Milk & Honey is kind of a middle of the road scent, although I will say that this was my husband's favorite of the three.I was a little disappointed that this trio didn't produce more bubbles!  I did think that this additive made the water feel silky, and I loved how the scent stayed around.  I felt that the product lathered up fine as a shower gel, and once again appreciated how the scent lingered.  I would purchase this item in the future, but probably in individual bottles.  These bottles are kind of small, but I didn't have to use much in the shower, and as long as your prepared to not have quite as many bubbles, you don't need to use that much in the bath to get that delightful scent.This is a quality collection of gels, and an enthusiastic recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OGT0DN1NWG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVD9JOE#wasThisHelpful","R15OGT0DN1NWG2","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this little animal matching book!  I've been looking at a lot of these cloth books for babies lately, and I must say that this one is my favorite by far.  It offers a combination of cloth and plastic textures, and while I wish the entire book was plastic for easy cleaning, this one offers up plenty of other exciting features to make this a five star product.  This book features three animals that you can mix and match with ease, since each page is split in the middle.  A hedgehog, a bee, and an owl can interchange their upper and lower halves for a extremely colorful effect.Each page is crinkly and features a variety of fabrics.  The spine is plastic, and the handle is a rattle.  Attached to the bottom on a stretchy string is a bumpy plastic cloud that is perfect for teething.  This is a well designed book/toy that will be easy to transport and is sure to entertain your baby for many months.

"This Baby Genius Toy is soft and squishy, makes some cool sounds, and offers a mirror.  Those are about the only great things I can say about this one, other than it's very portable and will be easy to pack.  This is my second Baby Genius Activity Book and I'm just not impressed with the overall design of this toy.I wish this toy was plastic, for easy cleaning.  If you are going to have a sound gadget attached, you should probably be able to change the batteries.  Not so in this case.  With the sound box attached to the book by a string, there is no connection between the sounds and the book.  It's not like baby pushes the button on the flute picture and then gets the flute sound.  The sound quality isn't all that great and the illustrations aren't that impressive, especially not when you consider the high price.Don't be dazzled by a little sound gadget and a crinkly page.

"I'm not a big fan of this Manhattan Toy product.  It's soft and squishy, offering a crinkly texture and a mirror.  Babies always love mirrors, so it's for this reason that I almost let this toy barely squeak into the three star rating. The pictures are bright and colorful, but overly busy, with characters that are pretty unremarkable.  There's a loop to attach this to a carrier, and it's easy to pack, as this little book/toy will squish down to almost nothing.I just didn't care for the design of this toy.  I wish it had been made of plastic for easy cleaning, and I don't like the little dangling sound box.  The sound quality isn't all that great, and I think it's strange that little ones would push the box for the sound and then somehow relate it to the correct picture.  Better to just have the parent point to each picture and read it instead of relying on this random little gadgetBooks for babies are always an excellent idea, I just don't think this one is the best choice, Baby Genius or not.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJY2DEKSJM3RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPW03OO#wasThisHelpful","RJY2DEKSJM3RO","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I Will Chomp You!  is a must have for any preschool story time thanks to it's interactive nature, colorful illustrations, and hilarious read aloud flow.Spot on comedic timing guarantees lots of laughs, and with Bob Shea's adorable, frenetic illustrations, it's a guarantee that you will have all your story time listeners merrily chomping away.I had the pleasure of featuring this book in a recent story time, with wonderful results.  I invited each participant to come to the front and collect one of the construction paper ""chomp monsters"" that I had pre-made.  We then read the book, with all the audience chomping away every time our little blue monster went chomp.  For a craft, each child then created their very own cake out of construction paper and sequins for their chomp monster.  When story time resumed two weeks later, the kids were still talking about the chomp monster!This entire book flows very fast as the monster tries to talk the reader out of reading the book in order to protect his stash of beautiful cakes and pastries.  The illustrations provide tons of energy, with some of the monster's chomps taking up an entire two page spread. Shea's color palette is almost blinding in it's neon brightness, only adding to the fun of an exceptionally well written and delightfully illustrated book.  I Will Chomp You! is a must have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J796RTWY19YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385389868#wasThisHelpful","R3J796RTWY19YQ","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had doubts about this book, as I didn't think it would have much to offer for a parent who's kind of waited until the last minute to start worrying about paying for college.  I'm happy to say that although there was a lot of information here that didn't apply to me, there is also quite a bit that I found immediately useful.  Don't grab this expecting a detailed explanation of things.  This is more of a road map of ""where do I go from here"".  This book helped me start asking the right questions.  It's pointed me in the right directions, so I can then pursue more detailed information.The layout is very user friendly, so no matter what stage you are at in your college preparations, you can easily turn to the relevant chapters.

"An Inheritance of Ashes is a dark,gloomy, beautifully written fantasy that combines a surprisingly wide variety of different plot elements to create a story that is incredibly compelling and totally unique.  It's the writing itself that almost steals the show here,as the author exhibits amazing gifts with imagery, creating a world that is as ambiguous as the mist and as startling as some of the bleakest dystopian creations.  I think that the author's decision to leave so many questions unanswered and to leave her world with so many unfinished ""edges"" will prove frustrating to some, however I found it to be all the more intriguing and the perfect backdrop for the powerful story of family and coming of age that unfolds.Hallie is a vibrant, compelling narrator who is easy to like and cheer for.  Young readers will be able to relate to her desire to please her older sister, to be the hero, and to her feelings of inadequacy.  I have met so many teens who are trying so hard to be perfect at everything, that it was easy to hear their voices in Hallie's dialogues, which gave her character that much needed authenticity and enabled her to carry a story filled with so many fantastical and vague aspects.An Inheritance of Ashes is part epic dystopian, part coming of age, and part fantasy, but at it's heart it's about family.  It's about home, and about love, and about the danger of secrets.  It's about dealing with the past and moving on to the future, all without losing who you are.  It's a wonderful story that defies description.  It's slow moving and thoughtful, but those willing to stay with it and lose themselves in this dark world will be well rewarded.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OFI2X1CDHF1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054428111X#wasThisHelpful","R3OFI2X1CDHF1M","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rig is an adventurous, action packed novel that will hold great appeal for young readers, especially boys.  I found it less than engaging and couldn't help but compare this work to Lockdown by Alexander Gordon Smith, a work I thoroughly enjoyed.  This novel lacked the suspense I was expecting and I actually found myself bored for the first 150 pages or so.  There's really no character development and I initially found it difficult to care much for Will Drake.This story redeemed itself for me in an ending that was actually pretty incredible.  The author delivered on some unexpected story elements that elevated this from a derivative teen novel to a distinctive work of science fiction.  Will even managed to finally become a character with a bit of depth.  After a rough start, The Rig finally found it's way and will definitely find it's share of fans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JCGOFC3JGJRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544503112#wasThisHelpful","R3JCGOFC3JGJRG","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Burning Bush 2.0 is a well written examination of popular media and how it relates to Christian faith.  This is a fast read, as the author zips through many of the most popular titles in movies, television shows, books, music and video games, giving proof that God is to be found in all of them, no matter the story.  Whether it be the hope to be found in a zombie movie, the moral choices to be made in video games, or the sheer joy to be heard in music, the author effectively brings God into everything.  It turns into a refreshing look at a society that sometimes seems awash in darkness, reminding us that God's light is always there.My only problem with this work is the sheer volume of examples the author utilizes.  I found myself craving more of his conclusions and insights and less of his specific analysis.  I worry that the number of contemporary cultural references will date this work and perhaps dilute the author's valuable message.  Perhaps the most important moment in this book comes when the author encourages the reader to enter any type of interaction with media as an intellectually aware, discerning participant.  I agree wholeheartedly with the author's assertion that it is important for Christians to not shut themselves away from popular culture, but to instead be an active member.  I also think that it is important to not let media wash over you, but to interact and actively search for God's word.  This will be an important read for any parent feeling the pressure of helping their teen make solid media choices.  I plan on passing this book on to my 16 year old son, who is currently walking his own path toward discernment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8P5L9JF8U4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787413#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8P5L9JF8U4N","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Afterlife Academy is a well written, adventurous tale that arrives just in time for Halloween  to deliver a solid helping of monsters and the paranormal. It's not easy to write a story about death, demons, possession and the Underworld for the 9-12 year old set, but this author has certainly done an excellent job.  He combines just the right levels of wit, humor and action to offset the darker aspects of this story, and keeps things moving at a fast rate.When Walter Prairie meets his end, he wakes up in the ""categorizing office"" trying to figure out what's next for him.  After a mysterious mix-up sends him back to earth as a guardian agent tasked with protecting young Charlie Dewdlle, Walter quickly finds himself in over his angelic head and facing a whole new world of wraiths, shades, and demons.  Charlie and Walter make a wonderful pair in this witty take on the classic buddy saga.The plot is interesting, the characters well developed and easy to care for, and the dialogue is fast and funny.  I loved the author's concepts of the Underworld and his demon mythology, and admired how he is able to give the reader a couple of genuine scares right alongside more than a few genuinely funny moments.A special nod as well goes to a fine portrayal of a supportive family.  Charlie's parents play only a small role in this story, but I loved how they had his back even when he presented them with an unbelievable story.  They were pretty ineffectual, but they were there giving it their best, and it's always nice to see that in a kids book.  The Afterlife Academy is an enthusiastic recommend for young readers grades 4-7 who like their adventure stories a bit on the dark side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QI847R0EO2HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385744811#wasThisHelpful","R1QI847R0EO2HY","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Hershey product is a surprisingly large, well made tin filled with yummy caramels. There are three different kinds; vanilla, butterscotch, and plain caramel.  There seems to be an equal distribution of the three, although I did not count them all out and measure them.  The candies are soft and rich, much smoother than most caramels I have tried.  Each caramel is individually wrapped.  I do wish it was easier to differentiate between the flavors.  The wrappers could have been different colors instead of the subtle differences in striping.  Each flavor is written on the side, but the print is very small!This tin will be a perfect Christmas gift!

"I had a difficult time getting into this story, but by the end I really fell in love with Charlie Han and his family.  This is a great story about coping with family dynamics, and being true to who you are.  I didn't like Charlie very much at first.  He comes across as bitter and a bit mean spirited.  The story has an edge that was a bit unexpected for a book aimed at the ten year old set, with lots of talk of girlfriends, and  getting ""felt up"".  This one seems perfect for 12-14 year olds, but a tad mature for those younger readers.It took a bit for the story to take off, and after we get past some repetitive, bitter ramblings from Charlie, the narrative flew at a rapid pace.  Charlie grows quite a bit during this story, and I loved the author's portrayal of his family.  Their interactions were very well done, and the book reinforces the idea that even when parents aren't quite perfect, a family held together by love is a strong family indeed.  Despite some early flaws, this is a great story that will appeal to young readers, especially those searching to overcome their own barriers and find their own unique ways to succeed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TT2SA96C1JLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055351315X#wasThisHelpful","R2TT2SA96C1JLE","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dead Boy offers up a gruesome read for young horror fans, but it unfortunately failed to capture this adult reader.  I'm a fan of things dark and creepy, but feel that it's seldom done well for this age group. This book promises humor, but I was unable to find anything humorous or even witty in this writing.  It was hard to feel much for Crow other than pity, and felt that his character was really quite pathetic.There's an over-indulgence in all things maggoty in this story, and the author relies far too heavily on the quick gross out gags that will likely appeal to young readers, but don't do much for the story or characters.  I loved Melody, his friend who is willing to overlook his dead status.  She's a wonderful, well-developed character and she provides a nice story line about the importance and power of friendship.Despite a truly pathetic main character, this story still squeaks into a three star rating thanks to a plot that is interesting and action packed.  It's the final half of the book that kids will find fascinating and it's here that the story rises above it's cheap, gross out maggot moments and finally achieves a bit of depth.  I had a hard time getting through this one, as I felt that it was missing a bit of the heart that is necessary to make this premise work.  Not a first choice, Dead Boy is only a cautious recommend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VDTY39QPFRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553510088#wasThisHelpful","R10VDTY39QPFRD","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Naked is a very compelling read that takes an unflinching, gritty look at some truly disturbing issues.  Young Anna runs away from home at the age of 13 and becomes a teen prostitute.  This story begins when she returns home to her parents after three years and attempts to become a ""normal"" teen.  Despite it's occasional heavy handed treatment of characters, this novel effectively deals with subjects like domestic violence, freedom of choice, bullying, and of course self worth and redemption.A fast read, this book is best saved for older teens merely because of it's brutal look at prostitution.  There are no graphic sequences, and  limited language, however emotions are intense and the portrait of Anna and how she has been damaged is particularly disturbing.  I found myself becoming very invested in Anna's character at a very early stage in the story, and stayed with her even when her motivations occasionally became muddled and her inner dialogues repetitive.  I don't think the author did a perfect job of writing an authentic teen voice, but I still found myself rooting for her.The story was intense, emotional and hard to put down.  Unfortunately, it also became a bit predictable.  The best part of the story for me was in the author's exploration of the mother/daughter relationship.  Seeing that change and grow lent a new level of depth and power to the story and saved it from becoming a typical, issue driven teen novel.  Naked is a powerful debut from this author, and while it didn't blow me away, it was a good read, and a recommend for older teens and adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHOG5UQ83OZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633750078#wasThisHelpful","R1LHOG5UQ83OZ7","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was amazed by how quickly he latched on to the images, becoming excited by the high contrast designs. I could envision those little neurons firing, even in his dire condition.

"This Whoozit cube is a delightful, well made toy that will be great for babies to explore as they develop their fine motor skills.  All the elements are attached, and combine to form a cube that is pretty compact.  There's a mirror, an interesting crinkly texture, an abacus, a clock that makes a clicking noise when you turn the hand and a musical block that plays a tune and lights up.  There's also a dial to spin, and beads to rattle.  I was very impressed by how many things were included in this block!  Everything then fits together neatly into a cube that doesn't latch, but does fit together neatly.One of my only problems with this toy, is that it doesn't latch together.  It would have been a nice opportunity to add another skill, and added to its portability.  Also, I think the musical element is kind of a fail.  It's a little too loud and sounds very tinny and mechanical.  I was expecting something a bit better from such an expensive item.  Still, these are small things in what is otherwise a very good choice for baby-one that will be interesting to your child for many months as they continue to learn new skills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PG9FAQ7IF88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HH52TA#wasThisHelpful","R4PG9FAQ7IF88","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rules for Stealing Stars is a well written novel that combines magic and realism to look at four sisters as they try to cope with an alcoholic parent.  This novel is well written, very readable, and painfully authentic.  I didn't like it a bit.  I think that whenever an adult reader attempts to review a kid's novel, they must in some way come to terms with the baggage they are bringing to a book, their own agenda, and try to eliminate an adult perspective when they judge the novel's merits.  I admit that I am finding that very hard to do in this case.I found this novel to be dark, depressing and disconcerting in it's unique examination of alcoholism and magic.  I felt that the characters were never fully developed, and had a hard time engaging with them.  The author did a fantastic job portraying the damage that can occur to an entire family when a parent is battling alcoholism.  That's one of the things I do admire about this novel.  I didn't like the combination of the magical closets with a very real life problem.  I found myself wondering just what story the author was trying to tell, and getting quite angry as the story progressed.  The magic in this story is really not very magical, but dark and creepy, even when the girls think it's something positive.This book professes to provide a hopeful look at this family's struggles, but I for one couldn't find a sign of anything positive or hopeful for these girls  until the last 20 pages or so.  Up until then it's a dark, emotionally intense, and sad story. The publisher recommends this book for ages 8-12, however I don't think this book is in any way appropriate for those readers on the young end of that scale.  This is not the magic of Narnia and it's unlikely that these sisters will inspire any young readers coping with their own family struggles.  The story elements are not all that unique, however the attempt to aim this particular combination at this age group is misguided.  Rules for Stealing Stars is not a recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVD2T7RSS5SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062352717#wasThisHelpful","R3QVD2T7RSS5SJ","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My plain jane bathroom is now feeling a bit overdressed after I added this rather ornate shower curtain.  This a very nice shower curtain that was easy to install.  It hangs well for our standard size tub and rod, with a pleasing fullness.  This is obviously a high quality product, with an ornate almost middle eastern design.  If you are trying to coordinate bathroom decor, please note that the color seems to be a bit closer to yellow than ,most shades of cream.  The fabric is a bit shiny for me, and it's this along with the slight color discrepancy that makes this a four star product instead of a five.

"I have been using an older version of this Folkmanis snowy owl in library story time for many years.  I was eager to receive this new one as he seemed to be a bit different and my older one was starting to fade a bit.  I love this puppet.  This one is a bit smaller than I anticipated, but that just makes him easier to operate.  The wings can flap and the head can rotate fully around thanks to a rod centered in his head that you can then turn with your hand.  I have a pretty small hand for an adult so I can't move his head and operate his wings at the same time.  An adult with slightly larger span should have no problem, but a small child might have problems reaching to flap both wings.This owl is very soft and cuddly, and features small velcro spots on his wings so that they attach to each other in a front, perching position.  He has claws, a tail, and spots that are surprisingly vibrant.  You can't manipulate his beak, however his expression is filled with wide-eyed, owlish curiosity.  This owl looks to exhibit the same high quality construction that I've come to expect from Folkmanis, along with their usual charming attention to detail.  This snowy owl is a brilliant addition to any puppet collection and I can speak from personal experience when I say that these puppets last for years and years.  A must have for owl lovers, preschool teachers and story time leaders.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2033NX0EKJ0L5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K5F9#wasThisHelpful","R2033NX0EKJ0L5","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a hard time getting started with this story, as I think I was expecting the usual ugly duckling turning into a swan tale, and when this novel began going in a different direction, I felt a bit lost.  I wasn't expecting a story of such emotional depth, and I certainly wasn't expecting a character like Georgia.  She is beautifully flawed and astoundingly authentic.  There were times when I didn't like her very much and other times when she broke my heart as she learned so many painful lessons on her journey through grief and during her attempts to then embrace a new quality of life.This is a smartly written tale that offers up plenty of insights into grief and coming of age that will thoroughly engage young readers exploring their own limits and learning how to embrace their own possibilities.  Please note that this novel does include sexual references, language, drug and alcohol use. It is also an incredibly poignant and intelligent story that is not to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADIB2M6ISBWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072808#wasThisHelpful","R1ADIB2M6ISBWG","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little bunny is a true charmer that promises tons of fun for little ones by offering interesting motion, sound and textural elements.  The weighted bottom guarantees that this little guy will wobble, the soft springy middle offers up a nice textural contrast, and the rattly beads will make a great sound whenever baby makes a grab for bunny's ears.  Those ears fold over, adding one further point of interest.This toy is made to travel, and is built to collapse in the middle for portability.  I found it difficult to collapse and lock, although I was eventually successful.  It stayed locked in the collapsed position after lots of jostling and was easy to open back up.  I do wish the toy would have been a bit skinnier, or maybe would have included a handle for baby to grasp.  Still, as a tabletop toy, this one is pretty top notch and sure to distract an infant just beginning to bat at things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P7LVN8F38MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPB0RZ8#wasThisHelpful","R2P7LVN8F38MF","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vivian Apple Needs a Miracle is an excellent second installment of a series that continues along a path of smart writing, innovative ideas and comprehensive character development.  Vivian continues to be a strong lead character that carries a story that requires a significant suspension of disbelief as it zips along at a fast pace.  The author does a magnificent job of creating suspense, and if the events seem unlikely, it's still easy to get caught up in things thanks to the excellent writing and Vivian's strong voice.While this might appear to be an irreverent look at religion and American culture, it's actually the American media machine that gets skewered more than anything. The world building sometimes goes way over the top, almost becoming a parody in places. The author is not subtle.  Still, I continue to be a fan of the series,and will follow Vivian and Harp as they face a future on a dying planet.  I hope there's a next installment as I am eager to see how things progress.  Don't worry, the author does tell a complete story here, but leaves plenty of things open to further exploration.  Vivian Apple is my kind of heroine and readers will love to see how she grows and changes throughout this story - never letting go of her sledge hammer or her big heart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVLAYKB122AUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544390423#wasThisHelpful","RVLAYKB122AUI","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Shusterman never shies away from important issues, and Challenger Deep plunges right into the schizophrenic mind without hesitation.

"The Admissions is a smartly written novel filled with characters that are compelling, real, and truly memorable.  I was riveted by this cautionary tale of modern life and felt that I was getting a ring-side seat to witness the implosion of the modern family.  I found this book very hard to put down as I became entwined into the lives of this family.  I was mesmerized by their secrets, and charmed by their devotion to each other.  This book explores the family dynamic in a truly modern unique way, and offers up more than a few insightful moments and keen observations on family, guilt, love, and obsession.Living inside Nora's head was exhausting, but I came to really love her.  She is the backbone of this story and of this family, and the author has absolutely nailed every aspect of her character.  Moments of humor and heartache abound in this novel, and the author writes all these events with intelligence, authenticity and heart.  The Admissions is a must read for any fan of literary or women's fiction looking for a book high on drama, low on melodrama and filled with the sort of revelations that make you consider your own life and priorities. I was sorry to see it end, as I will miss the Hawthorne family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QMZJVBRDEDM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385540043#wasThisHelpful","R3QMZJVBRDEDM2","A2TSTJP0B3A3H5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSTJP0B3A3H5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 8 November 2015This is a quite good follow-up of Vulkan Lives (the author’s previous volume in the Horus Heresy) and of the Unremembered Empire (from Dan Abnett). A couple of little warnings before starting this review: it is not absolutely necessary to have read both mentioned volumes before this one, but it certainly helps. In fact, it also helps to have read the whole series, to some extent, and in particular the five first volumes. Also, and although I try to both avoid them and limit them, the following review may contain a few “spoilers”.This rather long volume (slightly less than 500 pages) focused upon the Odyssey of a handful of Salamanders, survivors of the Isstvan V’ “Odyssey as they bring back the corpse of Vulkan, their Primarch, back to Nocturne (hence the book’s title), their home planet, across the war-torn space of the Imperium and across the storm-ridden warp in particular (hence the book’s subtitle). They are driven by their belief, or rather by their need to believe that “Vulkan lives”, despite all evidence pointing to the contrary. Taking point in this belief is Artellus Numeon, once captain of the Pyre Guard and Vulkan’s Equerry, who is freed from captivity and torture by the Ultramarines, rallies the survivors of his Legion and leads the Odyssey with the grudging acceptance of Guilliman and the two other Primarchs who have joined forces with him to found – a bit prematurely - the “Second Empire”.The plot and events that take place during the Odyssey are somewhat unoriginal. They are however some nice touches, such as a murderous warp version of Ulysses’ sirens (I will say no more about them). Another nice touch is that, at one point in the voyage, the huge but largely empty battle-barge of the Salamanders is forced to drop out of the warp near the Segmentum Solar, gets to hear the call by Rogal Dorn for all Legions to rally to the defence of Terra and therefore learns that Terra has not yet fallen. The Salamanders are therefore forced to make a rather hard choice between obeying the summons and continuing on their journey. This, at least, is how the author portrays it.There is also the usual number of “desperate” void battles, boarding actions and even a battle on the ground, all of which are quite griping and well told, but not terribly original. You also get “treated” to the usual reminiscences about the treason, trauma, defeat and massacre of Isstvan V (here we go again!).Perhaps the main theme of the whole book is the Salamanders’ own agonies, and how they are torn and divided between hope/belief against all odds that “Vulkan lives”, quite literally, of course, and that bringing him back to Nocturne will revive him, and mourning and despair, which leads the Legionaries to bring him back to be buried at home. Here again, the theme and idea is rather good, but the execution is borderline stereotype, at times. It did not elicit much empathy – allegedly one of the main characteristics of the Salamanders - as far as I was concerned and, at times, I could not help getting a bit impatient with all the moaning and whining (that is how it felt like, to me) coming from the fearsome Space Marines.A related point is the author’s tendency to exaggerate and “overdo it”, at times, to make his history more dramatic, although this might also be editorial glitches. So, at one point during a particularly tense boarding action, Artellus’ ammunition is low, with the author telling us he has only half a clip left in his bolter. A few lines further, and without a single additional shot having been fired, you learn that in fact he only has three rounds left and, of course, hardly any other weapon.More importantly, when describing and exploring the moral crisis of the Salamanders, the author comes up with the dubious claim that their Legion was the one which suffered the highest casualties on Isstvan V. I would rather have put my money on the Iron Hands, although the Black Guard was also decimated! Even more controversially, the Salamanders are presented as worse off than the two others because they do not know what happened to their Primarch, whereas Corax of the Black Guard escaped, although badly wounded, and Manus Ferrus of the Iron Hands was decapitated. What the author may have wanted to convey is the uncertainty as to whether their Primarch is still alive or not was, for the Salamanders, perhaps even worse to bear than the certainty that he had been killed. Unfortunately, this is not exactly how his point comes across.Another interesting feature which could have been better used is that of a somewhat schizophrenic sharpshooter “Knight Errant” who, by and large, gets to help the Salamanders quite a lot. The problem here is that the author never entirely tells how this character made it onto the battle barge, yet alone how he acquired his somewhat mixed personality. IT would also have let readers know what the Sigillite was up to...Finally, while quite entertaining despite all my gripes and rants, this book is yet another “side-show”, even if one that is interesting at times. The point here is that, once again, the reader is no closer to the invasion of Terra and the assault of the Imperial Palace. Also, it would be nice if, in some not too distant future and before the invasion of Terra begins, a Black Library author would be kind enough to write a book on Book 17 of the series (the Outcast Dead) and focus on the preparations for the defence of System Solar. This is book 32 and, for the last fifteen instalments, authors have been spinning out the outcomes of Isstvan V but almost exclusively from the perspective of the Loyalist or the Rebel Legions.Three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WCMJ4LGZARKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784960195#wasThisHelpful","R2WCMJ4LGZARKE","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hero is the illegitimate son of “the Half-Hanged Man”, one of the nicknames of an English mercenary who had his hour of fame during the first part of the Hundred Years War before being killed by a rival mercenary captain. His son follows in his footsteps, flees to France and joins the army of Henry V of Lancaster after Agincourt, as the English King conquers Normandy.The story begins with Sir John Page, an old mercenary knight, being captured by the Turks, and by Sultan Mehmet II in particular, at the fall of Constantinople, together with the Byzantine historian Phrantzes. The latter is a historical character that really existed. The former, the hero of this book (and the next ones) is fictional, but could perhaps have been among the mercenaries that defended Constantinople. In a male version of the Thousand and One Nights, the old mercenary is made to dictate the story of his life to the historian for the Sultan’s entertainment. As long as this lasts, they will survive.The author has clearly well researched his topic, as shown by his little historical notice, but also by his attention to detail, such as the armour of Sir John Page. Also interesting, and in the same vein as “The Half-Hanged Man”, is the depiction of the main character as a human being, with all his flaws and limitations, who happens to be somewhere at the right time and moment and becomes portrayed as a hero, without really being one, and becomes a knight and a – very minor – baron. Also of interest are John Page’s motivations, and those of his fellow soldiers, to join the war in France. Patriotism may have been one of them, but it may not have been the main factor. Escaping justice, poverty and, more generally, the absence of any future and the off-chance to get rich quick in France, seem to have been at least as important.Also well reconstituted are the hard campaigns and sieges that Henry V had to sustain to conquer Normandy. As shown, many towns just gave in because they were insufficiently garrisoned and had little hope of being relieved by a French army. Some (Honfleur, Caen and Rouen) did, and in all cases, the sieges were terribly costly for the besiegers, with diseases killing probably more men than the enemy. Readers might be interested to learn about the battle of Baugé, the only clear-cut French victory during this period, and disaster for the English which was entirely the making of Henry V’s envious brother – the Duke of Clarence – who paid for it with his life, but also with those of hundreds of his men and a number of other senior and highly experienced lords and commanders.A last feature I would like to emphasise is the care taken by David Pilling’s in drawing what seems to be a realistic portrait of Henry V. The King’s superb soldiering and leadership is well displayed through the few glimpses that Page has of him, but his ruthless efficiency and his somewhat self-righteous piety are also well shown. Henry’s need to conquer and be victorious in order to cement the legitimacy of his reign, he was after all the son of a usurper who murdered his legitimate King, are also hinted at.There are however some minor glitches here and there or features and interpretations introduced by the author for dramatic effect and which may not always work or which are not entirely historical. Regarding the fall of Constantinople, the injury suffered by Guistiniani, the Genoese mercenary captain who was defending one of the most vulnerable sections of Constantinople’s Walls, did lead to his evacuation by his men, and therefore a weakening of the defence that the Ottomans took advantage off. It is however doubtful that the walls were totally abandoned as a result. Also, the Ottoman artillery simply did not pound to rubble the palaces of the Byzantine Emperors during the siege. Finally, John Page’s age, he is supposed to be sixty, is just about plausible but it is rather unlikely that he would have been able to hold his own against five Janissaries and kill three of them. Another little glitch is to have John Page addressing the Sultan as “Khans of Khans” – a title used the unfriendly Mongols – or as “Shahs of Shahs” – a title used by the Persians who not exactly on friendly terms with the Ottomans either.Four strong stars for a good and exciting read. I am also very much looking forward to the sequel of this book in which John Page, after leaving the English army following the disaster of Baugé, goes off to fight in Central Europe during the cruel and little known Hussite Wars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX44E00YXR1G7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010O5BFN6#wasThisHelpful","RX44E00YXR1G7","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is rather fascinating of Gaston III, Count of Foix and self-proclaimed sovereign Lord of Béarn (he is termed “Prince of Bearn in French) and feudal lord of many other places scattered across Languedoc, Aragon and English Guyenne. Although much shorter, it does resemble Barbara Tuchman’s “A Distant Mirror” in some respects since it is also the portrait of a great feudal lord, but one in Southern France, as opposed to Enguerrand, the powerful baron of Coucy, North of Paris. Both men were also the last of their line and both were roughly contemporaries which lived through the first half century of the so-called “Hundred Years War”. Both men also died within the last decade of the fourteenth century and both books are therefore very much about the period from the 1330S to the 1390s, and all the disasters that occurred throughout France, then the most powerful and richest Christian kingdom in Europe.This, however, is about where the parallels end and the differences begin. “Lord of the Pyrenees” is more of a biographer and it focuses on Gaston, the man himself, his achievements, his struggle to both assert his independence and remain independent. It is about a fascinating character who managed, during a long reign of some forty five years to maintain his independence against all of the much more powerful neighbouring kingdoms and play them off one against the other while never really siding with any of them for very long. It is also about a prince who, through his pragmatic, self-interested and highly efficient diplomacy, managed to preserve most of his domains from the atrocities of the Hundred Years War and make them prosper, in stark contrast with most of the rest of the Kingdom of France.The author presents in a clear style how Gaston, self-consciously self-styled Fébus, managed this, describing his considerable diplomatic talents. He also presents rather well the basis of his power, the complex relationships with his subjects in his scattered possessions and his strategic vision to link them together. Just as well presented are the tools he used to build up his power, the centralisation of his administration, the small group of faithful kin - his bastard half-brothers and sons and some of his faithful followers, and the taxing of his domains whose economic development he promoted. Above all, however, one of his main sources of power was money, and in particular the large treasure which originated with his crushing victory against his hated rivals – the Counts of Armagnac, their clan and their followers and vassals.It is the huge ransoms he extracted from the captive enemy leadership which were the root cause of his fortune and overflowing treasure, a treasure that he managed to at least maintain if not increase for a period of more than thirty years through the careful administration of his lands. It is also this treasury that allowed him to bride, impress through lavish spending and, perhaps more importantly, to raise professional mercenaries, launch them against his enemies and more generally use them as part of his diplomatic arsenal. It is also this treasury which, more generally, gave him the military means to defend the County of Foix and the Lordship of Bearn while also expanding his influence through the County of Bigorre and towards Toulouse.Another fascinating dimension of this book is to show the complexity of Gaston’s character and personality. Through certain aspects, for instance his old family feud and rivalry against the Armagnacs which he ruthlessly prosecuted, he was very much the medieval and feudal lord. Through his multiple family connections, he was related to the most powerful families of the region, including the King of Navarre, who was his brother-in-law, and the Gascon Lord Jean de Grailly, one of the Black Prince’s foremost captains, who was his first cousin. Through other aspects, as a patron of arts (music and poetry in particular) and as a highly skilled huntsman who composed a highly praised and much used treaty on the subject, he was both a great medieval lord and the forebear of the Princes of the Renaissance.A related dimension was the complexity and ambivalence of a rather passionate character, the dramas of his personal life and some rather autocratic streaks. He could be ruthless and violent. He had his sole legitimate son and heir killed, and may even have killed him with his own hands. He repudiated his wife, the sister of the King of Navarre, who survived him, and send her back to her brother with just about only the clothes she was wearing, although the exact reasons for this were never disclosed. Despite having numerous mistress and illegitimate sons from them, he never had his marriage dissolved and therefore never remarried, for reasons that are, here again, not explicit. He also ruled his domains and subjects with what seems to have been autocratic methods and a ruthlessly efficient exercise of censorship to the extent to the extent that much of the rationales underpinning the personal dramas above remain essentially unknown.The final point here is that I cannot quite agree with the statement made in the summary of this book about his reign standing “out as one of the rare success stories of the `calamitous' fourteenth century.” His reign – he would have liked the use of such a word – saw many achievements, mostly mentioned throughout his review. However, to view it as a “success story” is somewhat simplistic, because he ultimately failed to organise his succession and preserve the integrity of his lands (Foix and Bearn were split up). In other words, assessing his achievements turns out to be just as complex as the man himself.

"This is a very interesting and fascinating little with slightly more than 160 pages of text that is easy to read and therefore accessible, although scholarly. Essentially - and perhaps for a change – the book’s presentation summarises rather well its contents.The book does indeed challenge a number of views and myths that are at least partly derived from Ancient Greek sources and from Athenian ones in particular. One of these is that the rule of Kings disappeared from Greece, was superseded by oligarchies and democracies, and that the rule of one (or monarchy) made a comeback during the fourth century BC in the form of tyranny.As the author shows rather well, the reality seems to happen more complex. Kingship (Basilea) was defined, or rather caricatured by reference to the Persian King of Kings. However, it had existed before in areas that were part of Greece and continued to exist throughout the classical period (Macedonia, but also Sparta). Also, and although presented as “arch-villains” in such ways that the term “tyrant” can only have very negative connotations nowadays, there was a link between tyrants, heroes and saviours of the city in a number of cases during both the 7th and 6th century BC and the 4th century. In the latter case, the typical examples are those of Denys I and Agathocles who both became tyrants of Syracuse and remained in power for decades at least partly because of their “heroic” status as protectors and victors against Carthage.Another strongpoint is the author’s ability to clearly show how monarchy was underpinned by a common heroic ideology among rulers based on arte (loosely translated as excellence), and to what extent, even in monarchies and tyrannies, “rule of one” was never exclusive and always somehow shared, or at least supported by the family or even the clan.A further component of the rule of one was its instability, or, perhaps to be more precise, the absence of any clear succession rules within the ruling clan or family, or even within the kingdom or city. Two examples that the author uses extensively are those of the Kings of Macedonian and the Kings of Sparta. In both of these cases, and in all other cases of “one-man rule”, there was no hereditary primogeniture and there was no guarantee that a son would succeed a father since, by definition, the successor had to be “the best”. In practice, this could mean the strongest, as Alexander’s last words on his deathbed are supposed to have been when asked for the name of his successor, or, perhaps more cynically and in a more sinister way, the one who survived all of the other potential claimants.An additional key point is the author’s effort in identifying the various components that sole rulers used to legitimise their rules rule. For instance, they were themselves heroes or belonged to a kin group descendant of a hero. They could also be law-givers, the ones who gave their respective cities their constitution and therefore, at least symbolically, were its founders. Interestingly, the author also shows how the relationship between ruling/power of one and law interacted and evolved, with the later ultimately becoming the main limitation and constraint of the power of one in an interesting reversal of causality.Clear, well-presented and well-written, even if not always fully convincing and sometimes “cutting a few corners” because of its limited size, this little book is certainly a valuable contribution and an excellent starting point for anyone interesting in monarchy or tyranny during the classical, but also during the Hellenistic period. It is also, more generally, a valuable piece for anyone wanting to learn what monarchy, whether exercised by a King or by a Tyrant, meant for the Ancient Greeks, how the two differed and evolved, and how they compare to the modern notions that lurk behind the very same terms nowadays.

"I understand another reviewer on the US site has questioned and heavily criticised the author’s narrative of the battle of Agincourt, and especially the numbers of each side. There is, indeed, a bit of a controversy regarding respective numbers and depending upon which historian you happen to read: about 6000 or rather 9000 for the English and 12000 or double that number on the French side. To a large extent, the discrepancies arise because the numbers may mean different things and may also have been calculated differently. For instance, whether only men-at-arms, archers and crossbowmen and other armed infantry are included or whether servants and pages are also added can lead to significantly different totals, perhaps especially on the French side. Also, whether the numbers correspond to the forces on each side that sent out on the campaign or whether they actually correspond to the numbers on the battlefield can also explain the significant discrepancies that authors have come up with. To a large extent, and while interesting, this kind of debate is somewhat sterile because none of the numbers can be definitely proved. In addition, it is a rather minor point and there are much more important ones, which the author does make, and makes in a rather brilliantly way.One of these is that the victory of Agincourt, the whole campaign that led to it, and the follow-up campaigns a few years latter through which Henry V conquered Normandy and managed to stave of French counter-attacks following the defeat and death of his brother, were certainly not “walks in the park”, to use the title of another review. Henry V’s armies suffered huge casualties during sieges, particularly those of Harfleur (in 1415 before Agincourt) and Meaux (in 1421-22), with the author estimating (and it is no more than an estimate) that these could have represented up to a third of the forces engaged. These casualties seem to have been caused at least as much by insufficient food supplies, poor quality food and disease resulting from poor hygiene – as they were due to the enemy, even including wound infections. Various authors estimates that between a quarter and third among the injured would die of their wounds although, here again, these are estimates and a further qualification would be that the chances of a lowly archer might often be worse than those of a high ranking noble. Regarding diseases, the author rightly insists on dysentery as one of the main killers during medieval sieges and it was in fact dysentery, probably contracted during the siege of Meaux, lack of proper healthcare, and Henry’s own determination and drive to carry on that killed him at the “ripe old age” of thirty-six.In addition to showing – once again - the horrors and squalid conditions of medieval warfare in general and of the conditions during the early decades of the 15th century in particular, Jonathan Sumption’s book shows how difficult and costly it was for both England and France to wage war. This is perhaps the second main merit of this volume. It shows the extreme difficulties that both sides had in recruiting, paying and feeding the armies they raised.The author’s emphasises at length, with an almost overwhelming luxury of details, how inadequate the finances of both Kingdoms were. In both cases, the King’s own revenues were woefully insufficient and tax revenues were neither regular nor could they entirely be relied upon. The King of England, which was smaller, less populated and poorer than France, has to obtain subsidies (taxes) from Parliament whereas the revenues that the King of France could raise were largely subject to graft from the civil service and, perhaps even more so, by his numerous Valois relatives. The consequences are very well shown. Both Kingdoms had to borrow heavily to make up the shortcomings and were endemically courting bankruptcy as a result. Their armies’ pay was frequently or even typically in arrears with troops sometimes payed by those who had raised them on behalf of their respective Kings. More generally, this inadequacy in financial resources essentially meant that they could only stray in the field for a few months before disintegrating or needing to be disbandedOne of the main consequences of this state of affairs, which is also very well illustrated and described by the author, is that actual fighting was often desultory and a huge amount of time was spent in parleys and diplomatic negotiations, with just about everyone talking to everyone else. Here again, the author “treats” the reader with extremely details accounts of the various political and diplomatic negotiations between the French factions, before and during their civil war, and between them and the English.Another strongpoint of this book is to show how remarkable Henry V’s successes were, but also how expensive and fragile they turned out to be.Put simply, and without demeaning the achievement in any way, the author does convey the clear impression that the English King overreached and that the English Kingdom of France that he established and that his brother (John Duke of Bedford) would strive to defend was somewhat doomed from the beginning. To some extent, this might seem to be hindsight, although Jonathan Sumption makes a strong case, showing that even before Henry’s death, it was increasingly difficult to find sufficient money and volunteers in England to go fight in France. He also shows that despite the attempts to organise the defence of the conquered lands, and of Normandy in particular, these did not yield sufficient money or soldiers and were therefore neither self-sufficient.A final strongpoint is to show to what extent the English triumph and conquest of most of northern France was against the odds and was only made possible by taking advantage of the political chaos and divisions in France, with the root cause of these being the madness of Charles VI, the French King. Here again, there is no attempt to demean or question the achievement. Rather, if anything, it shows that Henry V was much more than a gifted soldier. He seems to have been also a first class diplomat and leader, and a very determined leader who sought legitimacy (he was, after all, the son of a usurper who had murdered the legitimate King of England) through victory against France and conquests and achievement that were equal to or even surpassed those of Edward III and of the Black Prince.Five stars for a superb piece of scholarship, even if this thick and very detailed book is not always exactly easy to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0MS4851H0IK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081224799X#wasThisHelpful","R1T0MS4851H0IK","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Posted a couple of minutes before on Amazon.co.ukThis book from Professor Mary Beard is in many respects a masterpiece, but it is also a somewhat original one because it covers the history of Rome, but only its first millennium. The period starts with its foundation, traditionally set at 753 BC, and it stops around to 212 AD, when the Emperor most well-known as Caracalla made all free inhabitants of the Roman Empire into Roman citizens, therefore changing what it meant to be “Roman” and making “more than 30 million provincials into Romans overnight”, to quote the author. The event was indeed momentous, as rightly emphasised by the author, but this was largely because of its far-reaching consequences, and these may only have appeared overtime.It can seem odd to publish a book on the history of Rome or on the Roman Empire and stop in AD 212, knowing, as we do, that the Roman Empire continued for over two and a half centuries for its Western part, and at least a further century and a half in the East. This is where the book’s title, its meaning, and the author’s intentions are important to understand.SPQR is the acronym of the Senate and the People of Rome. The meaning refers to a period where the Senate and the People exercised supreme power in the city of Rome, which was a city-state to begin with, then the capital city of Italy, and the capital of an Empire. It also refers to a period where they appeared to exercise such power, as was the case after the so-called “Roman Revolution” from Augustus onwards, during what used to be called the period of the Principate. This is the period where the Emperor styled himself as the “First among equal” or the Princeps - the First in the Senate, and was careful, at least initially, to preserve the appearances of the Republic and of its institutions.However, this book is really about Roman identity and, more precisely, what it meant to be a Roman citizen, from the foundation of the little city on the Tiber to the million large city that ruled over an Empire centred on the Mediterranean that the Romans arrogantly – but aptly - called “Mare Nostrum” (“Our Sea). It is not about what it meant to be a subject of the Roman Empire, or of the Christian Roman Empire, with multiple imperial capitals and Rome being, at best, only one of them.Here we get to the (relatively recent) divide between “Classics” and the Greco-Roman city-state model, as opposed to “Late Antiquity” which covers the Late Roman Empire up to the Arab conquests and no longer up to AD 476 only, and which is underpinned by the Greco-Asian concept of imperial power and Emperors. The reader is also “treated”, somewhat amusingly, to the “politically correct” and faintly ridiculous and hypocritical BCE and CE (Before Common Era and Common Era) that have become fashionable and which refer to exactly the same dates as BC (before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini – Year of the Lord), except that they attempt to hide the Christian origin of the supposedly “global” and “universal” dating system.Since this book is about the formation and the expansion of Roman identity and Roman citizenship, Mary Bard stars by examining, explaining and debunking Rome’s founding myths, most of which seem to have been elaborated between the first century BC and the first century AD. She also analyses more recent Roman founding myths, such as the so-called decisive battle of Actium, and the propaganda of Augustus. Also included is an analysis of what the Roman regimes and societies really were like – the so-called Republic started as an oligarchy and if Roman Senators cum politicians chose, at times, to become “populares”, as Caesar did for instance, it was more about power and self-interest than about genuine interest for the poor. To help with this, the author makes use of recent archaeological findings and excavations in Rome itself, and all of what used to be called (somewhat disparagingly) the other “auxiliary disciplines” such as numismatics (studying old coins) and epigraphy (studying inscriptions).To conclude, this is a remarkable book written in a very accessible style but nevertheless with few anachronisms and not attempt to “dumb down”, as books targeted towards the so-called “general reader” and written by academic specialists sometimes tend to do. It is also a book that contains numerous and carefully chosen illustrations which are intended to elicit the reader’s curiosity and interest, such as the fake representation of Cicero’s famous appearance in front of the Senate during which he confounded Catiline. Also included are five excellent maps of Rome and its surroundings, including its Empire. Finally, there are no notes but a rather copious section for “further reading” with just about all of the key references included and commented upon for each of the book’s chapters.There would in fact be much more to mention about this very rich book. By this point, however, I believe that anyone reading this review will have understood how valuable I found it to be and how much I recommend it. Easily worth five stars, and I would have given it more had this been possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CPS2EC4YFCZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014T9HKN2#wasThisHelpful","R2CPS2EC4YFCZM","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published a couple of minutes ago on Amazon.co.ukThis book is the last of the Cicero trilogy. It covers the last fifteen years or so of his life, from 58 BC to 43 BC and it is largely dominated by the rise and fall of Caius Julius Caesar (hence the book’s title). It ends with the beginning of a new struggle from which the new Caesar - and future Augustus - would emerge victorious and – almost literally - the “last man standing.” I can also confirm that this book can reads perfectly well on its own. It is not necessary to have read the two previous episodes (Lustrum and Imperium), respectively on the rise of Cicero as Rome’s prominent lawyer, with the case against Verres in particular, and his consulship and the Catiline conspiracy. This is exactly what I have done. It may help, however, to know a bit of the last years of the Roman Republic, although even this is not absolutely indispensable.This is because – to put things bluntly –Robert Harris had done a wonderful job and come up with a rather superb novel which is extremely well-researched and contains excellent characterisation. The result is a superbly entertaining novel told in the first person by Cicero’s secretary (Tiro) who really existed, who really was Cicero’s slave (and then his freedman), confident and friend and who really wrote a biography (now lost but mentioned in various primary sources) of his master and published Cicero’s letters after his death. Also, he did invent a kind of shorthand and we do owe him a number of abbreviations such as e.g. or etc…Interestingly, Tiro is perhaps the most sympathetic character of the whole book. All other characters, including Cicero himself, are presented “warts and all”, with their qualities but also their shortcomings. Cicero himself is a complex mixture of selfishness, lucidity and puffed up self-importance, with a level pf arrogance that is at times borderline stupidity, but also capable of streaks of remarkable generosity, although the latest feature may have been somewhat “enhanced” by the novelist in order to make Cicero more sympathetic. He cannot resist a “bon mot” that may make others laugh at someone else’s expense and therefore mortally offend some powerful Roman who will never forgive him and treat him as a potential threat for ever after. He is also both aware of his extraordinary oratory talent, and rather vain about it. He is also aware of his major shortcomings compared to the other Senators, his competitors. Essentially, he is a “parvenu”, and upstart in the eyes of the “old money”. He was not an aristocrat from one of the old families, such as Caesar, Crassus, Cato or Brutus. He did not have the fortune to make up for this, such as Pompey, neither did he acquire such a fortune during his career, as Caesar (and Pompey) managed to do thanks to their conquests. Finally, he had no military skills whatsoever, contrary to both Caesar and Pompey (and even Crassus, to a lesser extent) and seems to have been somewhat of a physical coward, even if perhaps not always a moral coward.The portraits of the other characters are also quite remarkable. This is particularly the case of the skilful and utterly ruthless Caesar, with his winning charm hiding his cold mind. Also good are the portraits of the young Octavius/Caesar whom Cicero did both mortally offend and grossly underestimate, and that of the ageing Pompey whose military talent was largely in his qualities as a first class organiser and expert in logistics. Even Mark Antony is rather good, with the author having shown him as no mean orator himself and quite capable of hitting back and hurting Cicero through a public speech of his own.The presentation and description of the historical events through the eyes of Cicero’s secretary are also excellent although, at times, the author may have provided Cicero – his hero – with a bit too much clairvoyance that only hindsight could have provided. It is for instance a bit doubtful that Cicero would have been in a position to identify Caesar as the most dangerous threat to the Republic of the three (the other two being Pompey and Crassus) in 59 BC. However, apart from this and perhaps one or two similar exceptions, the rest is excellent, including the details, such as Caesar’s Commentaries on the Gallic Wars which were publicly read in the Senate but also in the street. They were very skilfully and very much used as a media for self-promotion. Another interesting feature is the change in Caesar’s attitude after his final victory at Munda in Spain, against Pompey’s sons. His “mercifulness” towards his ex-foes allowed him to assert his primacy and superiority, as Cato very well understood. The impression here is that his autocratic tendencies came to the fore. He was less and less careful in hiding them and he increasingly appeared as a tyrant, as opposed to the somewhat anachronistic use by the author of the term Dictator, with its modern sense.Another handful of superb features are the description of life in Rome and the life of a Senator, with their peregrinations from their houses on the Palatin hill (a few had also suburban palaces) and of the increasingly deleterious atmosphere in Rome during the 50s BC. Also excellent are the depictions of everyday life at the time, more generally, including the huge mortality rates that affected women during childbirth across all social classes and the marriage/divorce behaviours within the members of the Senate in particular.To achieve this, the author has not only done his research thoroughly, he has also used extensively Cicero’s correspondence with quotations and extracts of letters abundantly used throughout the book. The end result is one of the best novels I have read this year, and also one that is so well done that just about everything “feels and look” authentic. Five stars, easily.PS: those who may want to check the historical record, and see to what extent Robert Harris has stayed extremely close to what we happen to know, may also want to read Mary Beard’s also superb and very accessible SPQR, for instance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DGQPZ5T9QLAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T19UNMQ#wasThisHelpful","R2DGQPZ5T9QLAB","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is indeed book 5 in the Hereward series and it follows closely the previous episode which both take place within the Byzantine Empire (or Eastern Roman Empire) in the 1070s. This one, like the previous one, have a good deal of fiction and even fantasy at times, built upon a more or less historical context.The historical context is that of the Eastern Roman Empire in the year 1073 AD and, more precisely, the (historical) rebellion of Roussel de Bailleuil, a mercenary commander of a Tagma (regiment) of Norman mercenaries. The historical outline is more or less accurate. The rebellion did take place. Roussel did try to carve a principality for himself in Asia Minor and did defeat a Byzantine army commanded by the Caesar John Doukas, the Emperor’s uncle, whom he captured. He did have the Caesar crowned, but it is quite unlikely that the Caesar had much of a choice. Finally, the rebellion was crushed when the Byzantines essentially called in a large Turkish war band to do the work for them.It is in the details that the author has taken a number of limitations. The Athanatoi or Immortals was a crack Byzantine heavy cavalry regiment made up of nobles, but it was highly trained and not the ill-disciplined and totally inexperienced – if brave - bunch that appears in the novel. There is also some uncertainty as to whether this regiment, which existed in 1078, had already been formed five years before. It was formed when Nikephoritzes (a historical character, although perhaps not as sinister as described in the book) was in power, but seems to have been raised and put together after 1073-74.Some of the Byzantine families and the Nepotes in particular, are completely fictional. The main rivalry was between the Doukai and the Comnenes, as mentioned by the author is his foreword, although, contrary to his assertion, neither had “a strong claim to the throne”. The members of the Doukai had and were sitting on it and that the uncle of Alexis Comnene had been Emperor for a couple of years after having come to power through a military coup in the 1050s. As for the Court at Constantinople having “become a nest of vipers”, this was not exactly new, to put it very mildly. It had been such a nest for at least half a century by the time this story begins, that is at least since the death in AD 1025 of the Emperor Basil II and, three years later of his brother Constantine, both without male heirs.Also, statements according to which the Byzantine army had deteriorated and was heavily relying upon foreign mercenaries need to be somewhat qualified. The byzantine army had, just like the Roman one from which it had evolved, always been open to professional soldiers originating from beyond the Empire’s borders, at least as long as the Empire could pay for them. Regarding the Imperial Varenguard in particular, they were indeed extremely well paid and highly regarded for their prowess, but also for their loyalty to their pay master.  Seriously doubt, however, that “they were adored by the people” of Constantinople, especially since Emperors could use them, at times, as enforcers of the Emperor’s will. So, feared probably, higly-regarded, certainly, but it is very unlikely that they were adored, especially since they wer ""Barbarians"" in the eyes of the Byzantines.Regarding the quality of the Byzantine army, there is some truths that the territorial units - known as themata – had deteriorated and were no more than local militias. However, this was not entirely the case for the professional army – the tagmata (or “regiments”) – within which the foreign mercenaries were found. With regards to troop quality, and when compared to the 10th century for instance, it also seems that the infantry deteriorated perhaps more than the cavalry. What might be more accurate is that the Byzantines had few indigenous troops of horse archers, which put them at a disadvantage against the Turks, and did not use the same shock tactics as the Franks in general, and the Normans in particular. Unsurprisingly, Turks and Franks, for cavalry, and Russ, Viking and Anglo-Danes, for heavy infantry, were the most sought “foreign mercenaries” because they provided troop-types that were better adapted to the fighting tactics of Byzantium’s enemies.Then there is the characterisation. I will not mention much here, in order to avoid so-called spoilers. Some of the characters are somewhat hard to believe. This includes Hereward himself, who rather curiously, appears “more emotional”, at times, as another reviewer puts it, while being also a fierce and, at times, a berserker killer. Frankly, Hereward presented as some kind of “compassionate killer” did not seem terribly plausible to me. Also, having one of the female Byzantine characters believe she is the reincarnation of a deceased female war lady from North Africa was not very convincing, nor did the sadistic Byzantine child (a boy this time!).Then there is the action. The battle scenes are mostly good, although, here again, there are glitches. One of these are head and limbs flying left, right and centre. The author is far being from the only one to go for this kind of “gory” ploy. However, both he and his colleagues need to understand how difficult and therefore how improbable such features are in reality, especially when the warriors happen to be covered in chain mail. Although I confess that I have no personal experience in the matter, chopping off arms and heads in battle is unlikely to have been as easy as James Wilde makes it look. Also, it is quite impossible for a warrior on horseback to wield the two-handed Danish long axe for which the Varenguard became famous.All in all, this was not an unpleasant, although perhaps not quite among the best. Readers wanting to compare with another novel with the same historical background can read the much older “the Lady for Ransom” from Alfred Duggan, which is also on Roussel de Bailleuil, and which I found much easier to believe. After hesitating between three and four stars, I will finally settle on the latter, although I feel I am being somewhat generous.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8TLTI8ZK54P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDZUES4#wasThisHelpful","RV8TLTI8ZK54P","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first – and perhaps the main – merit of this book is to present Constantine in context. First and foremost, he was - and wanted to be – an Emperor. He was a power-hungry autocrat even if, to prevail over his rivals, he chose to become a Christian. It is in fact because he became a Christian and because this transformed the Empire and was the first step towards ensuring that Christianity would survive, prevail and then become the Empire’s religion, that Constantine has received so much attention over the centuries, and still does. This started with the Christian bishops of the fourth century, some of which were quick in recasting some of the most momentous events of Constantine’s character in a Christian light and eager to put a positive (that is a Christian) spin on them. They have been so successful in doing this that most people associate closely Constantine with Christianity, and some, including among historians, define him exclusively as the “Christian Emperor”.This is where David Potter’s book is truly excellent, even if, as other reviewers have also mentioned, it is perhaps not the best starting point for “beginners” (this would rather be Stephenson’s “Constantine: Roman Emperor. Christian Victor” published). In particular, and this second revised edition, David Potter shows to what extent Constantine conformed to traditional imperial patterns, that of a power hungry Emperor who could have no rivals and for whom religion, and State religion in particular, was a way to enhance and establish his legitimacy so as to make it unassailable and uncontested. Interestingly, Constantine did not start out as a Christian ad did not become one overnight, contrary to what the Christian sources may want us to believe and as the author shows very well. Interestingly also, he was very careful not to alienate other religions. Although it did become clear over time that becoming Christian was an asset for ambitious men who wanted a career in the palatial administration, this was never imposed, and even less so in the army where most still worshipped a range of other divinities (Mithras, among others, being particularly popular). Also quite fascinating are the author’s analyses showing how various events, such as Constantine’s “escape from the clutches” of the Court of Galerius or the Milvian Bridge miraculous apparitions, were remodelled over time in the most traditional fashion, as imperial propaganda had been doing for centuries.Another strongpoint of this book is the author’s intellectual honesty. This is most apparent when describing the fate of Maximian, whose supposed attempt to murder Constantine after having been put under house arrest is rather implausible and rightfully dismissed by the author as a piece of propaganda. It also appears with the fates of Crispus and of Fausta. We do know that Constantine had his eldest son executed in AD 326, but we simply do not know the real reason for this. We also know that Fausta disappears from all official records and nothing more is officially heard of her. It does seem that Constantine had her removed and perhaps even executed, although the later accounts about her demise are somewhat implausible. An interesting point mentioned that the author is that Constantin never remarried after her death, although his interpretation, that this was because Constantine still deeply loved Fausta, is somewhat speculative. It may just as well have been because she have left him with plenty of heirs so that he had no need to contract yet another political marriage which could have created issues.All in all, the narrative of Constantine’s life, his involvement in Church affairs and is role as a legislator are perhaps the best pieces of the book, together with the foundation of Constantinople as a new imperial capital. The latter, and the rationales or it, is particularly good. In addition to the advantages afforded by the location of Constantinople, the author elaborates on a particularly interesting reason for the Emperor to move to the eastern part of the Empire, one that is rarely mentioned and that I will leave the reader to discover. Constantin’s role as a legislator, with detailed examination of his rescripts, is perhaps the section of the book which is the hardest to read for a so-called “general reader”. It does however show rather well to what extent Constantine’s conceptions of family, marriage and slaves, in particular, was conservative, rooted in “Roman” traditions, and therefore far from novel. Also very interesting are the sections about his involvement in Church affairs, whether the Donatist controversy or the Council of Nicea and the Arian controversy. All in all, the picture shown throughout the book is that of an autocratic Emperor deeply concerned about his duty and the need to ensure “law and order”, rather than that of a reformer or even a revolutionary, even when his decisions had far reaching consequences for his successors and future generations.There is however one significant weakness of this book: there is little on military events and on the army in general. It is as if the author was simply not interested in the topic. This is rather surprising given that Constantine was – and is claimed to be by David Potter – an excellent general. There is, for instance, not very much about Constantine’s invasion of Italy and war against Maxentius, although what little there is exceeds the bare minimum on the two civil wars against Licinius and the next to nothing about Constantine’s multiple campaigns on and beyond the Rhine and Danube frontiers. This is a bit of a pity for it leads the author to make a number of statements about the superiority of Constantine’s general ship and the better quality of his troops that are essentially unsubstantiated. Also missing is Constantine’s policies about recruiting non-Romans into the army or settling them within the Empire in exchange of military obligations, both of which are continuations of previous practices. Finally, there is simply no discussion at all on military reforms – the separation between comitatenses and limitanei and the fortification of the frontiers and the reasons underpinning them. I was rather surprised (and a bit disappointed) by what must have been the author’s deliberate (but unexplained) choice.Four stars because of this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDCZSD6MR0LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199755868#wasThisHelpful","R1JDCZSD6MR0LC","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good and, at times, a very good presentation of Emperor Aurelian, the Roman Empire and the so-called “Third century crisis”. It is written in an easy to read way. The author’s use of numismatic evidence is extremely interesting, largely convincing, and particularly useful for analysing the kind of economic problems that the Empire was facing and how the Emperor tried to solve them. Also largely - but not entirely – convincing are Alaric Watson’s efforts to portray his hero, for which he has obvious sympathies, in a positive light and to identify the attempts of some of the sources to denigrate this emperor and his tremendous efforts. The book is divided into two somewhat uneven parts.The first and longest is entitled “Restorer of the World”. It focuses on the tremendous upheavals that saw the fragmentation of the Empire and its reunification thanks to Aurelian’s achievements, hence the title of this review and this first part. This, title, however, was also a key piece of Aurelian’s propaganda. The point here is that I would have expected Alaric Watson to demonstrate to what extent the sweeping and boasting claim to have “restored the world” was justified, as opposed to somewhat excessive, and I did not really find such a discussion in the book. What I had instead was the impression that the author’s apparent sympathy from his subject translated into a willingness to take Aurelian’s claim at face value.There is no doubt that the Empire fragmented in AD 260, under the reign of Emperor Gallienus and following the defeat, capture and death of his father Emperor Valerian at the hands of the Sassanids. There is no doubt either that it was Aurelian’s military skills and sheer determination that reunified the Empire. There is no doubt either that Aurelian’s achievements were herculean, especially when keeping in mind that they took place during a short reign of five and had a half years. However, what is somewhat missing in a thorough assessment of the Empire’s fragmentation and its causes, and a thorough assessment as to whether Aurelian, by forcefully reconquering the splinter regimes, really put an end to the Empire’s divisions.The reunification, while real, was also short-term and perhaps also superficial and this is what Alaric Watson does not really discuss. Attempts at break-away regimes in Gaul continued, for much the same reasons as those mentioned in the book. There was one during the reign of Probus, which he forcefully put down, and there was the usurpation of Carausius during the reign of Diocletian, at a minimum. In the East, Aurelian did destroy the “separatist” regime of Palmyra, although one could also discuss whether and to what extent it really was “separatist” since Palmyra’s survival depended upon trade with the Empire. However, this did not solve unrest in the East, including insurrections in Egypt which Diocletian had to put down.The second part of the book is about Aurelian’s internal policies. His economic reforms are mainly about his attempts to reform the currency. The chapter on public works and administration include his fortification of Rome while the chapter on his relations with the Senate and the army are largely about explaining the somewhat mixed reputation and ambivalent treatment that this Emperor receives in the sources. The final chapter – “the Emperor and the Divine” – explores and describes Aurelian’s religious policy and, in particular, the cult to the “Unvanquished Sun” (Sol Invictus) which he put in place and which would inspire both Constantine and Julian during the next century.Here again, the contents are mostly good, but only as far as they go. Here again, the author largely avoids discussions that would show Aurelian’s achievements to be less than stellar. First, Aurelian’s “economic reforms”, mainly his attempts to reform the currency, were essentially aimed at the army, and at increasing the Emperor’s financial resources. In modern terms, this could be seen as an attempt to restore faith and confidence in the currency, except that the aim was to restore the soldiers’ trust and to bolster resources to pay them. This was achieved by cracking down on fraud and peculation and restructuring the mints, but also by modifying and slightly improving the silver title in some of the issues. The consequence, especially during the next two reigns, was galloping inflation. Aurelian is also shown to have reformed the urban dole. Here again, the Emperor’s objectives and intentions could have been worth a discussion. Although Aurelian may have sought to improve the well-being of his subjects, it is as least as likely that he wanted to ensure that they would be no unrest when he was away fighting on the borders of the Empire. A similar concern can be identified when discussing Aurelian’s walls around Rome. In fact, just about all of his “reforms” were designed to protect, to put the Empire’s in a state of defence and to give the army the means to be victorious. This, and the extent to which Diocletian developed and pursued similar policies because of similar needs, would have been worth showing.Another surprise is that the author has managed to write it while having comparatively little to say on the Roman army itself, on its performances in the field, and on those of its general and Emperor. Aurelian is mentioned as being an excellent tactician and general but, apart from the fact that he was victorious, there is little discussion to make the case with the campaigns only described in general terms and not very much about the battles themselves. Also somewhat missing is a discussion on the changes that may have started to affect the army, and its equipment and tactics in particular. Even the cavalry force that Gallienus formed and in which Aurelian served and then commanded could have merited a more thorough discussion.However, there are reasons for rating this book four stars instead of the three stars that the previous comments would suggest. This is because some of the limitations listed above, in particular those related to the army, have, to some extent, to do with unsatisfactory sources. Not very much is known for certain, for instance, about most of Aurelian’s victories against the Germanic invasions and incursions across the Rhine and the Danube, although his victories against the Palmyrean armies, and his campaign more generally, could perhaps have been described in more detail.Perhaps one of the most significant merits of this book is to put pay to Aurelian’s reputation for cruelty, and the blackening of his reputation, more generally. It is also to show where this reputation comes from, and why and how it was established, and how misleading such a reputation happens to be. He did execute some Senators, because they plotted against him, but so did the so-called “good Emperors”, such as Trajan or Hadrian. Unlike them, however, he had little time to spare on establishing good relations with them and was much more interested in the army and the Empire’s defences. Simply put, this was because he was, that is he was a pragmatic soldier first and foremost and probably also a disciplinarian.He believed in Roma Aeterna and the traditional Roman ideology of eternal victory. He would do whatever it took to turn the tide and make sure that, ultimately, the Empire would prevail and survive, and this is exactly what he did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPJIVMGV0UY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415301874#wasThisHelpful","R1EPJIVMGV0UY6","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For someone looking for a comprehensive, affordable and up to date reference on the Roman Army over some twelve centuries, this is probably your best bet. However, it is not perfect.First of all, the book’s coverage seemed (to me at least) to be pretty comprehensive and covers all aspects including logistics, sieges, organisation command and so on, all within slightly over 500 pages of text. To this is added a bunch of maps, a chronology of main events, a glossary and a basic bibliography including most if not all of the main references on each period and theme, all of which are very conveniently listed by chapter and theme.A second advantage is its affordability. To my knowledge at least, there is no other book offering such coverage of the Roman Army throughout its history within a similar price range. A third advantage is that many of the sections are good summaries of the main points and issues, with the author carefully presenting what is really known as opposed to the various assumptions that are taken for granted because they have been repeated time and again over decades.There are however also limitations. The book could have done with some better editing and presenting. The paragraphs are dense. There are multiple repetitions and this is simply not a book that you are going to spend an afternoon reading on the couch! There also seem to be a few mistakes that could have been avoided. If I remember correctly, it is at the battle of Illipa that Scipio (soon to be Africanus) used the unorthodox strategy to post his Roman legions on the wings and his allied troops in the centre, and NOT at Zama. There are a few other similar “glitches.” Regarding substance, the contents read at times like a compilation, with bits and pieces summarised from the main references on each subject, including some of the author’s books.More seriously perhaps, these contents are uneven. The sections on early Rome and on the Republic are acceptable, although they often largely paraphrase and summarise other titles (such as Keppie’s “Making of the Roman Army”). The bits on the Principate are good. Those on the third century, and on Roman fortifications throughout the period are probably the best sections, but others are average or even poor. There is, for instance, very little on the Roman Navy. The pieces on the Dominate from Diocletian to Constantine included are rather average, although all the main points are made. However, the next sections, and those on the second half of the Fourth century, the Fifth century and the demise of the Roman Army in particular, are rather disappointing.Here again, a number of excellent points are made, such as the choice to increasingly recruit Barbarians, the lack of time to train and integrate them and the decline in discipline. However, other points are not as clearly made. It would, for instance, have been worthwhile discussing and explaining more why recruitment became such a problem during this period although it had not been before. Another missing point is a discussion of the Roman Army’s performances after the death of Theodosius.A third problem is a tendency to oversimplify. Stilicho, for instance, was not only “a Vandal”. He was half-Roman and had been thoroughly Romanised, like dozens of senior officers and thousands of soldiers. Moreover, “Barbarians” - a term whose meaning became increasingly blurred overtime – did not monopolise the highest military positions neither in the West not in the East. I seem to remember that, according to statistics brought together by Mc Mullen, they occupied between a quarter and a third of the senior commands. Contrary to what the author suggests, the armies of Stilicho, Constantius, Aetius, and some of their successors (Majorian or Anthemius in particular) were not entirely or even perhaps mostly made up of barbarians.Overall, and despite the limitations listed above, this is probably just about worth four stars (three stars would be too harsh in my view). It is not perfect, but it is the most up to date title. It also covers the whole period, and it is the most affordable in doing so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIEBTX19HZOVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1445620898#wasThisHelpful","RIEBTX19HZOVX","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this book a bit by accident and, after reading some of the reviews on both of Amazon’s site (the UK and the US one), I decided to give it try and read a historical novel set in what he rapidly becoming a fashionable period: seventh century Britain. Others have already noted that the story told by Matthew Harfyy has been inspired by Bernard Cornwell’s hugely successful “Warrior Chronicles”. It is, however, also original in its own right and not set during the same period with the action taking place some 250 years before. The inspiration, in my view, mostly comes from Matthew Harffy’s methods and efforts in bringing together the main ingredients of a successful historical novel, those that I have mentioned in this review’s title.First, the author has meticulously researched his topic. His historical note, although only five pages, is to the point regarding both the military retinues of major Saxon warlords and their equipment. Also accurate are the small numbers involved in what were the major “battles” of the time: a few hundred or, at most, a couple of thousand on each side. There were several reasons for this. One was that most of this battles occurred during raids and counter-raids, when one “King” attacked the lands of another to gather the loot and plunder that was necessary for him to reward his military followers as the “ring-giver” that he was supposed to be. Another, perhaps even more important, was about logistics and transport. With roads in a poor state and logistics very limited, keeping a large army in the field for more than a few weeks was an impossible task. Limited transportation capability was also the reason why early Anglo-Saxon Kings tended to move with their respective courts and following from one domain to another.Another well designed feature is the interactions and relationships between the Anglo-Saxon warlord lord and the members of his trusted warband of retainers. These are described in a way that “looks and feel” realistic, with different levels of status and equipment. An interesting feature around which much of the novel is built is the relative rarity of hugely expensive good quality swords, with these, in addition to torques, rings of silver or gold but also armour and helmets, being among the main gifts and rewards that a King to bestow onto his followers.Second, the characters are well-designed and their behaviours reflect what may have been those of the times. At the very least, they are plausible. The hero himself, one Beobrand from Kent who follows his brother to Northumbria and wants to become a warrior like him, is believable. He is subject to fear and unsure of himself, but he is also driven by vengeance and blood feud and experiences to battle rage. He survives his first battle and fights at least as much through luck than because of skill. He also gets “bashed about” and wounded and is far from being constantly successful and heroic. In, other words, he comes across as a gifted and brave warrior, but also as a believable human as opposed to some unbelievable “super hero”. Other characters and their human emotions are also well drawn, including the murderous and sadistic Hengist who has lost his way because of jealousy and envy or Strang, the huge, bitter, dour and brave smith, who is so afraid of losing his daughter after having lost his wife.Third, there is the historical context. Here again, the author mostly scores high marks, even if he does “confess” to having distorted some events. For instance, it does not seem that Oswald was already in Bernicia and he was not holding Bebbanburg. It seems rather than he came from the west with a large following of Dal Riata warriors in addition to his and his brother’s own retinues of exiles. Together, they defeated Cadwallon, probably catching him by surprise, somewhere near to (or at) Hadrian’s Wall, but this will no doubt be for the next book. Another relative weakness is that the book essentially focuses on the last months of Edwin’s reign and does not show how he became the Bretwalda of Britain.I can only highly recommend this rather superb read and will rate it five stars, despite my little grip above. Finally, and for those wanting to read more about this period, but something non-fictional, I can also warmly recommend “King of the North” by Max Adams, which is very readable, much more than only about Oswald and covers the whole period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120RUL2JYX5JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508995702#wasThisHelpful","R120RUL2JYX5JQ","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This, which is instalment three of the series, is an exciting book to read, but only if you have read the two previous titles. Otherwise, you will be rather lost, will miss a lot of the background, and will find that many of the characters that appear in this volume are poorly described, partly because the reader will have meet them before. The bottom line here is that this is NOT a standalone book.My second problem with this title is not so much the first person writing in itself. Although some reviewers make no bones in disliking this, I do not really mind, when it works well. The issue here is that he does not always work out well, although I will refrain from giving specific examples in order to avoid spoilers. A related “stylistic” point is the overuse of dialogues where the characters speak in acronyms, most of which are even explained in this volume. I counted up to six per page and could not help finding this rather annoying at times. This could have been mitigated if the author had replicated the little annex he came up for one of the previous titles. Unfortunately, he did not bother to do so.Then there is the story itself. Our hero, his mates and friends, and the task force to which he belongs and which has been fighting another bloc (Sino-Russians, of course) are stranded far away from Earth and the Solar System which is being threatened by ruthless aliens bent on destroying the human race. The North American Commonwealth’s elites are, of course, corrupt, incompetent and interested in saving their own skins rather than fighting the Aliens that have already destroyed the human colonies and bases on Mars and killed millions. I don’t need and do not want to tell the rest: it is painfully obvious. The last feature, with our hero, his girlfriend – well, more than that in fact – and his favourite squadron leader will, of course, join the forces of “good” to defend Earth (and Detroit in particular!) and its downtrodden populations against the terrible aliens just like that…Three stars for what was an exciting but also a shallow read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BANMW5DGYAX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477828311#wasThisHelpful","R1BANMW5DGYAX4","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The commercial blurb that accompanies this book describes it as “a soundly researched and elegantly written history of Rome's decline and one of its most important empresses.” It also presents Galla Placidia as a “forgotten” Empress, which is, at best, an exaggeration. Once again, the blurb does not do justice to a rather good book, which may be questionable at times, but is also quite original in its approach.First of all, there has been more than half a dozen books on this remarkable daughter of Theodosius over the last half century or so, including so recent ones in English, French and Italian. So, Galla Placidia is hardly a “forgotten” topic and not a very original one either.What is more original, however, is the way that Joyce Salisbury has dealt with her topic. As indicated by the book’s title (Rome’s Christian Empress), she has chosen to show and emphasise her use of the Christian faith to sacralise her power, combined with her genuine piety and her tendency to bargain with God. This slant is certainly the most valuable aspect of the whole book which does indeed give the impression of being soundly researched.Also valuable is the skill with which the author shows Galla Placidia somewhat walking in the footsteps of her father the Emperor Theodosius, and being for Rome what the Empress Pulcheria was for Constantinople. The problem here is that although Theodosius did “credit his victories to God’s blessings”, these were in fact due to his military skills and were hard won. His sons did not have such skills, to put mildly, and neither did Galla Placidia or Pulcheria meaning that all had to rely on strong loyal and successful generals, with the later term tending to become self-contradictory, or to “divide and rule” by playing the generals against each other, which meant ensuring that none of them became strong enough to become threatening.Such a construction was not realistically viable over the long-term, especially at a time when the two halves of the Empire were at bay and under pressure and when military skills would therefore be at a premium. Accordingly, I could not help feeling that while the description of the sources of Galla Placidia were fascinating, the somewhat limited attention given to political and military events, and to the successful campaigns of Aetius in Gaul in particular, were perhaps a weakness of this book.Another well-made point is the Galla Placidia’s “Gothic marriage” and what would then become her “gothic connection”, and her personal guard of Gothic retainers. In this, however, she was not unique. Count Bonifatius also had Gothic Buccellari, while Aetius had Hunnish cavalry through most of the 430s and it is with these that some of his major victories were won.I was however much less convinced by the author’s efforts to show how important and far-reaching her legacy was. Some points, such as her role - and the role of Pulcheria in the Eastern half of the Empire - in promoting the cult of the Virgin Mary are well described. I was however, and unlike the author, not quite convinced to what extent “the blending of cultures” between Roman and Germanic “places Placidia once more into the centre of this story”. While she may have made the most of it, she was, at least initially, a captive of the Goth and how much influence she really wielded over Athaulf during his relatively short reign is subject to interpretation.Some points remain largely uncovered or undicussed. For instance, Placidia is presented as ambitious and very self-conscious of her ""right to rule"" because she belonged to the House of Theodosius. While this is true to a large extent, the author does not really discuss whether and to what extent  she was able to dominate, and whether she was really trying to exercise power on her own, as the author at times seems to imply, or on behalf of her son Valentinian as an Empress-mother and regent.Anyway, this was a fascinating and rather original perspective on “the Twilight of the (Western) Empire” which is well worth reading even if you remain not totally convinced by the time you have reached the last page.

"I cannot state that I disliked this book. It was easy to read and I rather enjoyed it so I will rate it three stars, despite everything else.“Everything else” essentially means that the book gave me the impression of being written to a formula. For me, the story was totally unoriginal to the extent that I had already read quite a few similar stories about “nasty” aliens with vastly more advanced technology destroying Earth (or simply threatening it, in milder versions), and the survivors becoming some kind of shock troops or mercenary force doing other aliens’ “dirty work” for them.Character description is rather limited, to put it nicely. Our hero is, of course, a relentless though guy and a real “badass”, and some would say. He will, of course, kill the opposition and always be among the survivors, however impossible the odds may be and, of course, they are.The problem with all this is that the story becomes unbelievable, at least at times, and some would say quite frequently! The various aliens are initially shown as terrifying, but the human assault troopers, despite horrific losses, always seem able to cut them to pieces and leave just about no survivors behind them.The last point I will make is about style. This is one of these military science fiction pieces which are written in the first person in order to convey a sense of immediacy and urgency. Again, while unoriginal, it is the kind of ploy that works quite well here. Needless to say perhaps, do not expect any long and beautiful pieces of literature describing sceneries in choice terms! You simply will not find this in what is a rather typical “action-packed” military sci-fi novel.No surprises at all here, as far as I was concerned, meaning neither “bad” nor “good” surprises.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REMX0SETDJQBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496094115#wasThisHelpful","REMX0SETDJQBT","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second instalment of the White Hawk, the emblem of the noble Bolton family of Staffordshire, and of their fights on the Lancastrian side during the Wars of the Roses. The pattern is similar to that chosen in the first book, and it works almost as well. All of the “action” (of which there is plenty) is concentrated in a period of no more than a year, from April 1470, and the beginning of the conflict between Edward IV and the Earl of Warwick, to April 1471 and the final victory of the former against the last of the Lancastrians at Tewkesbury.You will very much find the same kind of features as those included in the first volume of the White Hawk, with battles described in a brutally realistic way with all their horror and savagery, and the warriors on both sides subject to fear, rage and terror. You will also see, if you bother to check, that the author has been rather careful when reconstructing both the battles and the general (and rather traitorous) atmosphere within the nobility.Again, there are no “shinning heroes”, with Geoffrey of Malvern, the despicable coward on the side of the Yorkists, and Martin and James, the two surviving Bolton brothers, still fighting their own personal feud against the former, but quite capable .The historical characters are rather well drawn, especially that of King Edward and his brothers the untrustworthy Clarence and the fanatical and ruthless Gloucester (the future Richard III). Those of Margaret of Anjou and of the young Lancastrian Prince of Wales are also very plausible, as is the last Duke of Somerset.There are however a few things for which I had some regrets. Because of the author’s choice, the action here begins some nine years after the first book and at the time when the hero of the first book (Richard Bolton) who the reader left escaping the crushing Lancastrian defeat of Towton, is dead after having been killed in a further battle. The point here is that you will hear little about him and only in passing in this book. The interesting piece, however, is that you see his two brothers struggling to live up to his example and pick up the fight for the Lancastrian cause and their own family and lands that have fallen under the control of their arch-enemy Geoffrey of Malvern.Another little glitch which I do not remember finding in the previous instalment is that author having heads and limbs flying during at least one of the battles. Such “clean-cuts” were rarely achieved on battlefields, regardless of what authors’ may want their readers to believe and how eager they may be to “overdo” the gory bits. This was especially the case during the 15th century, given the tendency to wear more armour. However, injuries caused by poleaxes, maces and various other pole weapons could be just as horrific and lethal but with less bits and pieces flying about.Four strong stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FJWTUHR0JJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYEXVJK#wasThisHelpful","R38FJWTUHR0JJ7","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I very much had mixed feelings, despite having liked some of the author’s previous books (his Empire series). I cannot claim that I did not like this book. I clearly did, but it was a bit of a “mixed bag” to me, with some strongpoints and great ideas but also a number of problems.Starting with the positive elements, the author has clearly done his homework thoroughly. This shows throughout the novel and particularly in his descriptions of Rome towards the end of the second century AD, but also, even if it less visible perhaps, in the end of the Danubian campaigns and the death of Marcus Aurelius.Another great set of features are the ways in which Simon Turney creates a piece of fiction, inserts it into the known facts, and manages to make his take of the historical events just about plausible. Marcus Aurelius did die towards the end of the campaign, after the last battle, but was not assassinated, regardless of what you find in Gladiator (the film). Another wink from the author is his description of the battlefield (but not the battle): it is – more or less – the same as in the film (the opening scenes of Gladiator, again), with the Marcommani being cornered and making their last stand. The (simply great!) original piece is the aftermath of the battle, with Roman legionaries hunting down the fugitives through the snow.A related feature here is the shift in the cast of characters, with Commodus portrayed as more or less sympathetic, at the beginning of his reign at least, and his sister Lucilla presented the over-arrogant and ambitious villain. Commodus happens to be one of the most maligned Roman Emperors, along with quite a few others, some of whom are mentioned in the (excellent) author’s historical note. He may, however, have started out relatively well and is likely to have become (as many others) increasingly paranoid over time, after a few foiled plots and attempts against his life. Also, the fact that the sources for his reign are generally hostile is unsurprising since they largely originated from the senatorial class who opposed him and which he purged repeatedly, as other Emperors had done before him and would do after him.I nevertheless quickly started to have problems with the way the plot was delivered. As another reviewer has mentioned, Rufinus, our hero, gets repeatedly beaten up, wounded, and saved at the eleventh hour (three or four times across the book) in ways that are barely credible. It is for instance simply beyond belief to have someone who has just been bashed up and tortured jumping on his horse, galloping away to Rome and, of course, saving it all (almost) single handed, regardless of how good his doctor happens to be and how powerful the painkillers that he is administered.I also had quite a bit of a problem with the pace of this book. It starts of well with the bits on the Danube frontier. It then slows down to a crawl with a long section where the hero becomes a private guard but during which not much happens. The rest of the plot, during which the pace picks up again, is very, very predictable.I also had a bit of a problem with the cast of fictional characters, which are not terribly original. Our hero is the son of a disgraced senator who becomes a (Roman) boxing champion after joining the legion. Some might be reminded of Anthony Riches’ Aquila, with the “Two knives” replaced by two fists… Also, this Rufinus develops a soft spot for a slave girl belonging to someone else, which is another not so original feature, except that here the slave girl happens to be a Briton. One interesting character was that of a Sarmatian guard with two huge hunting dogs. However, another shady character – a giant with filed pointed teeth which is portrayed as a cannibal – was simply incredible. Finally, the book also includes a collection of modern expressions inserted into the various dialogues between the characters, and these anachronisms tend to grate...At the end of this book which I nevertheless did enjoy reading, I could not stop myself from having mixed feelings and being a bit disappointed. There were some great ideas underpinning the book and some interesting features, but I was somewhat disappointed by the delivery, hence the rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LG3PUDUHFDZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508551707#wasThisHelpful","R2LG3PUDUHFDZR","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"his book’s subtitle better reflects its content (“the rise and fall of English supremacy at arms”) more faithfully than its “Medieval Warfare” title. Even the subtitle, however, does not exactly match the contents. As another reviewer has mentioned, this book is essentially about England’s wars against Scotland and France (the so-called Hundred Years’ War) and her civil wars commonly known as the War of the Roses.As well-shown in the book, the Kings of England learnt some hard lessons during the early wars against Scotland during the first decades of the 14th century. Once these were learnt and once new tactics combining longbow archers and men-at-arms were developed, with the later fighting either on foot or on horse, they were able to overpower the Scottish schiltrons. These tactics were then applied so very successfully against the French and led to Crecy, Poitiers and Azincourt, and a few other less well known victories such as Cravant and Verneuil which were won over combined Franco-Scottish armies.Another major advantage of this book is that it is written in an engaging way, although there are at times some repetitions. The author’s background - a retired Major General – helps in making this read even more interesting in several ways.One is the author’s focus on logistics, and their frequent inadequacy at the time, with the need for most armies of the time, and for English armies campaigning in France in particular, being often obliged to live off the country. Hence, when the smaller English armies just before Crecy, Poitiers or Azincourt, after being hunted and cornered, were finally forced to turn and fight, the troops were not only tired but also hungry and very low on food. A related strongpoint is to show the importance of these logistics on both sides during the siege of Orleans. He also presents a careful analysis of the reasons explaining the failure of the siege. One of the these was certainly the morale boost that the French received from Joan of Arc’s presence, but there were quite a few other factors, most of which, including mistakes made by Lord Talbot, being mentioned.A second focus is the author’s careful descriptions and analyses of the campaigns, tactical deployments and battles of the period. According to him, the English triumphed against the French during the Hundred Years’ War against the odds not because they had better soldiers but because of what he terms “better discipline”, an expression which includes better control of the troops by their commanders and a better use of them. The author does show that the French commanders strived to solve the problem that the use of massive archery combined with hobilars and dismounted men at arms created for them and came up with innovative ways to do so. However, these were often not successful because of poor implementation.A third interesting point is the author’s reasons for the final French victory of the Hundred Years’ War. These, as well as his whole analysis and description of the war during the fifteenth century, have heavily inspired Juliet Barker’s more detailed “Conquest: the English Kingdom of France in the Hundred Years’ War” where many of the same points are also made. Perhaps the most salient point is the increasing difficulties to prosecute the war after the death of Henry V and, even more so, after the death of his brother John Duke of Bedford, both in financing the expeditions to France and in recruiting volunteers. He also shows how and to what extent the French after 1431 reorganised their forces and developed what was the first permanent and professional army of the late Middle Ages and a first class artillery train.Another interesting and well-told section is the author’s take on the War of the Roses. Here, however, I had a bit of a problem. The narrative is well told. However, the author did not really show to what extent these civil wars exhibited English supremacy at war or even its fall, given their very nature. If anything, the slow fall of English medieval supremacy seems to have taken place during the last twenty years of the Wars in France, and the Wars of the Roses seem to have little to do with it.However, while the author tries hard, and largely succeeds, to remain even-handed, at times, biases tend to surface. This is a bit of a pity and it could have been perhaps avoided with more thorough editing. I will mention just four examples (there are a few others).One is a mention of the Black Prince confidently preparing for battle at Poitiers while a few sentences further the author mentions that he attempted to steal a march on the French when trying to get the baggage (and the loot) across a river. He clearly was not at all confident about the outcome of a possible battle which he did his utmost to avoid, and neither was his father ten years earlier at Crecy or Henry V at Azincourt. Given the odds, with the English forces tired, hungry and so heavily outnumbered in all three instances, it is easy to understand why.The second example concerns Talbot who had been made into the “English Achilles” and for which the author clearly has a soft spot. His track record is more mixed than what the author is prepared to concede, and not only because of the disastrous English defeat at Castillon which put an end to the Hundred Years War. His rashness had also cost the English another defeat almost a quarter of a century before at Patay during which their lost most of their very hard to replace field army.A third example is the ruthless decision taken by Henry V to massacre his prisoners at Azincourt. However the author may want to paint this decision as “understandable”, this, even at the time, was somewhat beyond the pale. It was a stain on his reputation and was, of course, exploited and used against him by his enemies.A fourth example is the English defeat at Baugé in 1421. This was entirely due to the recklessness of Henry V’s younger brother, Thomas, Duke of Clarence, who lost his life alongside almost 1500 of his men. While clearly not on the same scale as Azincourt, this was clearly not “only a skirmish”, contrary to the author’s assertion and (obvious) attempt to minimise the disaster.Finally, some of the battle descriptions may be a bit questionable. One the main examples is the battle of Verneuil in 1424 where the Lombard heavy cavalry seems to have done more damage to the English archers that the author mentions, as shown in a recent book on this little-known battle.Four stars for what remains a fascinating read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2KZSBC1NNL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786720719#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2KZSBC1NNL5","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good “Men-at-Arms” title, even if it is not the appropriate format for the author’s lofty ambitions. John M.D. Pohl is quite correct in stating that, when studying Late Medieval History, attention shifts to Spain only with the fall of Granada (1492) and the first conquests of the Americas, or in connection with the Hundred Years War during the 1360s. However, such a title simply cannot suffice to explain how “the Catholic Monarchs” (Fernando and Isabella) were able to lay “the foundation for the first world empire”, nor does it have the space to describe the dynastic struggles that took place from 1370 onwards and for a century and a half.It nevertheless tries to do so and some sections, however limited and perhaps even superficial, had, at least for me, the merit of making me want to learn more on the period or events that they were describing. This was particularly the case for the multi-year conquest of Granada, which proved to be a rather tougher nut to crack than what the general reader may assume and which was largely conquered while taking advantage of “Muslim disunity”, as the author puts it so nicely (read “civil war”).Another particularly interesting bit was the growing involvement of Aragon in Southern Italy, its conquest of the Kingdom of Naples, and the role of Gonzalo de Cordoba, sometimes presented as the founder of Spanish Tercio regiments, in Italy. Each of these topics would have deserved a (our several) book of several hundred pages to do it justice.A third little known aspect which this booklet touches on is the development of Spanish sea-power and of that of Castile in particular, during the Late Middle Ages. Unfortunately, it does mention its Aragonese equivalent in the Mediterranean, and how this allowed the Kings of Aragon to maintain their rule over Sicily during the fourteenth century in Sicily and allowed them to expand to Southern Italy during the next century.Also interesting is the very brief summary of the reigns of “the Catholic Monarchs” and their very complementary roles, with Fernando the soldier and Isabella the organiser. There are perhaps several missing elements here. One is how they governed their two kingdoms. Another is their religious policies. To be fair, however, both these aspects go beyond the scope of a Men-at-Arms title but this might show you how much I, at least, was left wanting for more once I had finished.Also to be fair, there are relatively short but good descriptions of weaponry, tactics and campaigns during the late 14th, the 15th and the first decade of the 16th century. These are rather well supported by the plates, which I found good, even if they may not be the “best” that I have ever come across. There is also a useful chronology and a family tree if only because, since the names and events are somewhat compressed into a limited format, you might tend to get confused with kings bearing the same name when reading about a period and royal families that you may not know much about beforehand.Finally, there is a short bibliography. Here, for those wanting to learn more about Spain and who may be willing to read books in English that are not targeted at the so-called “general reader” (i.e. they are more scholarly and much more detailed), I can recommend the two following titles in the History of Spain collection (although there are certainly other good ones!) which cover the same period as this title, but include all aspects:- Spain’s centuries of crisis: 1300-1474, by Teofilo F. Ruiz and- The Spain of the Catholic Monarchs (1474-1520), by John Edwards","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TJR2FQWUAJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZYPWOG#wasThisHelpful","R7TJR2FQWUAJI","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have mentioned, this is the author’s debut novel and it is a rather remarkable one. The topic – the Wars of the Roses – is hardly original. In fact, it is becoming a rather fashionable one among writers of historical fiction who seem intent on copying each other and coming up with their own take on this period of cruel civil war, full of bloody battles and treachery, and therefore “ideal” for anyone wanting to write an “exciting page-turner”.At first, and after looking at the title of this new series (“Kingmaker”), I thought I knew what to expect: yet another story about a knightly family feud, or perhaps a couple of them, with each family siding either with the Lancastrians or the Yorkists and, of course, taking the opposite side from that chosen by the other family. Do not get me wrong: this would have been perfectly fine for me, although it would hardly have been original. In fact, you get quite a bit of this in this book, with the infamous Lord Riven taking advantage of the civil war to appropriate his neighbours’ lands after killing them. You do get the impression that there might have been quite a few “nobles” during the War of the Roses at all levels who took advantage of the break down in law and order to either settle scores or grab the land of others, especially if the men had been killed in battle.However well-shown, this is however not the book’s best feature. In fact there are at least three other features which are perhaps more remarkable.One is the minute attention to historical details that the author displays. This comes across in his reconstitution of the historical events, with his description of the battle of Towton, often presented as the bloodiest to have taken place in England, being one example, among many others. You can check the various phases of the battle in your favourite reference book on the War of the Roses and you will see to what extent the author has researched his topic. The same goes for a number of other clashes that took place between 149 and 1461, such as the battle of Northampton, where the glamorous Earl of Warwick was at least partly responsible for losing the battle for failing to come to the rescue of his brother’s division sufficiently quickly.Another feature, related to the previous one, is the author’s careful description of some of the historical characters. One is the charismatic and brave giant (Edward Earl of March and future Edward IV), at least at this stage of his life (he 18-19 at the time). Another is his arrogant, gifted but devious and ruthless friend Richard, Earl of Warwick, of the powerful Neville clan (the future “Kingmaker” who has yet to earn his nickname). A third is William Neville, Lord Fauconberg, the old and experienced warrior and the uncle of the Kingmaker. A fourth and a fifth were Lord Montagu, the Kingmaker’s younger brother, and Hastings, another of the prominent Yorkist captains. One limit, perhaps, is that the story is clearly told from the Yorkist side, and in particular from the side of two Thomas and Katherine, respectively escaped monk and nun, so you do get hardly any glimpse at all of the Lancastrian leadership.The second excellent feature of the book is the author’s effort to paint the “everyday life” of his characters as realistically as possible. The battles are brutal and terrible, but depicted without feeling the need to be over-gory (no heads or limbs flying all over the place, as in some other novels!). Nevertheless, the story clearly shows how lethal a poleaxe could be when wielded by someone who knew how to use it. The desperate lack of food, the cold, the sea-storms when the heroes get caught out at sea, are also quite vividly shown. So is the gruesome training while part of the Calais garrison, with endless practising, day after day after day. Deserted villages and countryside, with all the population taking refuge within the nearest castle, are also a feature of the time, especially since both sides tended to “live on the country” and since it was very difficult for any commander to prevent pillaging and foraging, even in “friendly” lands. At times, I even felt that the grim pictures being described where perhaps a bit too much. For instance, would our heroes and three other soldiers really set off to cross the whole country from Lincoln to Wales in the middle of the freezing winter and under the snow? This feature felt a bit overdone and not entirely credible.The third feature which I particularly appreciated was the author’s ability to “tell the story” through dialogues between the characters without this becoming phoney or too obvious. So Thomas the monk, who has spent the largest part of his life in a priory cut off from the rest of the world is, at various points, “briefed” by Walter, the gruff but brave veteran soldier, who essentially tells him what he is fighting for and what has been happening in the world. A feature that I did not like so much was to have just about the whole story told in the present tense. I understand that this is supposed to give a sense of rhythm, perhaps even of urgency, to the story but somehow this grated a bit, although it was not a major issue.All in all, this was a rather superb read and quite a performance for a first novel, even if there were perhaps a few little minor glitches here and there. I would have rated this book 4.75 stars, but since this is not possible, I will go for five stars…","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZP8JXP366KG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4EM530#wasThisHelpful","R2ZP8JXP366KG0","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit surprised by some of the lukewarm reviews of this Osprey Campaign by Christopher Gravett. It is not quite perfect, of course, given its limited size, and perhaps also the fact that it is now a dozen years old. I will however give it the highest ratings because, within the limits of the series, this is a title that is just about “as good as it gets”, with all the main components present, presented, and discussed.To begin with, the introduction includes some necessarily limited but nevertheless interesting considerations on the sources. For once, as the author mentions, they are abundant and varied. Several are from eyewitnesses. There are four chronicles representing the viewpoints of several sides. Finally, there is archaeology, and in particular the skeletons and skulls discovered in one of the mass graves dug after the battle, and which offer grim testimony of its ferocity, and much more besides.All along, the author follows the usual Campaign series format and walks you through, step by step, starting with the origins of the campaign and brief summary of the early phases of the War of the Roses before presenting the opposing commanders and armies.Although succinct by necessity, the author manages to present the main characteristics of both, with, in particular, very interesting portraits of Edward IV, the young, brave and dashing giant war lord, and his glamourous but “more nervous” (to use the author’s apt expression, because his military leadership was not always equal to his political skills or his huge wealth) Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, the future “Kingmaker”. The presentation of the respective forces also includes a comprehensive discussion of the respective forces, with the numbers favoured by the author – 20000 for the Yorkists and 25000 for the Lancastrians – being the most plausible. Also included in a brief description of troop types and how they were recruited and equipped.The author then moves on to the march to Towton, with a comprehensive description of the first clash – the battle at Ferrybridge. This is where John, Lord Clifford, a dashing, talented and ruthless (as most were) Lancastrian commander, succeeded in holding up for a while the whole Yorkist army and gave it a hard time when it attempted to storm the crossing. Although well described, this episode is where I had my only reservation regarding this title. This is because Clifford’s force is mentioned as totalling 500 but the total casualties come up to some 3000 according to the author. Since Clifford and his force were pursued as they retreated and caught and destroyed before managing to reach the main Lancastrian army, something does not seem to add up. Either the Yorkists suffered massive and disproportionate losses when trying to force the crossing or perhaps the 3000 include both fatalities and wounded. Alternatively, the 500 mentioned for Clifford’s force may only represent his mounted vanguard, with additional men reaching him after he had occupied the bridge and thrown back the Yorkist reconnaissance party.The next stage is a careful and thorough description of the positioning of the two armies. In particular, Christopher Gravett meticulously presents the alternative options which have been argued between historians before explaining the reasons for his own personal preference. He also presents the rather terrible weather conditions under which the battle was fought - cold, with wind and a snowstorm blowing in the face of the Lancastrians – and how the Yorkists, and Lord Falconberg (the Kingmaker’s uncle) in particular, took advantage of it to poor arrows into them and trick them into attacking.Although the battle turned out to be a massive triumph for the Yorkists, these are well shown to have had a hard time. They almost lost as superior Lancastrian numbers began to tell before being essentially saved by the very timely arrival of the fresh troops of the Duke of Suffolk. As in all late medieval battles, once the Lancastrian broke and were pursued by the Yorkists, the slaughter started. Also interesting is the discussion on the respective losses, at least 8000 for the Lancastrians or a third of their force, and some 5000 for the Yorkists, a number which I found high, not entirely convincing and somewhat inconsistent with the previous point made about most fatalities taking place once one side broke and the rout began.The most fascinating (however morbid this may sound!) part for me, however, was the five pages (a bit less) on the grave pits, the detailed analysis of the grievous wounds inflicted to some 28 skulls that have been found in one of these pits, and the types of weapons that could inflict such wounds.Four very strong stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34YCD4QN5EUEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841765139#wasThisHelpful","R34YCD4QN5EUEX","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the fact that it concentrates of what seems to be a limited period of the life of Pablo Escobar, a few years before the time where he constituted himself prisoner in 1991 and put an end to his assassination campaign in exchange for a lenient treatment and sentence, and a promise that he would not be extradited to the United States.The story is that of a young Canadian surfer (Josh Hutcherson) established on a beach in Columbia who falls in love with the niece of Pablo Escobar (Benicio Del Toro) without knowing so. He gets increasingly dragged into Escobar’s hyper violent and ruthless universe and is increasingly reluctant to become part of it, hence the film’s title: Paradise Lost.I will, of course, not mention the plot or how it ends but will just mention that this is a dark, rather despairing and hyper violent thriller. More than the violence itself, it is the tension and the almost suffocating atmosphere that comes across which makes this film so worthwhile. Most of this is due to the fantastic performance of Benicio Del Toro who manages to make to make his character into someone that is simply terrifying and utterly ruthless, as the real drug lord probably was.Also well presented in the scenario are a number of features associated with the “reign” of the drug baron.One of these was the carefully cultivated image of a “Latin American Robin Hood” that he created for himself and behind which he tended to hide. It may even have been sincere, given his own modest origins, but it was also very convenient and very useful for him to play the protector and the defender of the poor and destitute. It seems to have largely worked since, at least in his own region, he seems to have been very popular, had tens of thousands of supporters and was even elected in the early 80s as a member of the Columbian House of Representatives.Another feature, linked to some extent to the previous one, was the collusion that existed between him, the local police and even some of the armed forces whose services he had bought after eliminating those (allegedly hundreds) that disagreed.However, because the whole film revolves around the personality of Pablo Escobar and the fantastic performance of Benicio, the main events of his “career”, while mentioned, tend to take a backseat. For instance, the film never shows explicitly to what extent he managed to control the cocaine traffic towards the United States. At one point, it is estimated that 80% of what reached the US was sent by him or his associates.Another limit is that the film contains virtually nothing about his relations with other Colombian drug lords at the beginning of his “career”, and nothing at all about his constant and merciless war of assassinations against his rivals of the Cali cartel. A third weakness is that the effort deployed the Reagan and Clinton administrations to combat drugs, the huge financial and military support provided to the Columbian government and the just as important constant pressure put on it to combat both the left-wing guerrillas and the drug lords are either barely mentioned and entirely omitted.Essentially, the whole film is about the personality of Pablo and Benicio’s very powerful incarnation of the drug lord, with the benevolent mask and pretence slipping at times and then disappearing completely to be replaced by the merciless monster lurking beneath it. This is both the main strength of this superb film, but also perhaps also its main limitation. Four stars, with at least two for Benicio’s performance…","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4FNW02ZU04ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WP3ZRVC#wasThisHelpful","R4FNW02ZU04ZZ","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 22 February 2015As another reviewer has mentioned a couple of weeks before (on the UK site), this is indeed an excellent book. This is both because of its form - it is easy to read - and because of its contents - it is nevertheless scholarly, provides masses of context and also clearly explains the most interesting point surrounding the battle itself and both its prequels and its sequels. This is why, just like this previous reviewer, I will rate it five stars.Although I will come back shortly to the many reasons underpinning such a high rating, it is also worth mentioning that the book is nevertheless not quite perfect. The main contention of this book, to quote its summary, is that ""despite its importance, the battle of Verneuil is largely overlooked in accounts of the Hundred Years War, and this book is the first proper account of the battle and its significance.""These statements are not quite accurate. They may have something to do with commercial hype and they need to be qualified. The fact that the battle itself was presented - with some exaggeration - as ""the second Agincourt"" years before this book' publication is already revealing. Moreover, a look at other books covering the same period, for instance Juliet Barker's ""Conquest"", to mention just one of them, shows that not all authors have ""largely overlooked"" this battle.A related point is that this book does not entirely explain why the battle may have been overlooked, assuming, of course, that the battle and its importance have been underestimated. Richard Wadge does provide some elements in response to this, but only some. His contention is that this was because no king was present on the battlefield, unlike Crécy (where both Edward III and Philip VI were present), Poitiers (where John II, his sons and the Black Prince were present) and Agincourt (where Henry V was present and faced a number of Royal Dukes on the French side). At Verneuil, the only ""Royal"" among the commanders on both sides was John, Duke of Bedford, brother to the recently deceased Henry V, Regent of the English Kingdom of Franc on bahalf of his Young nephew Henry VI, and who was struggling to keep the dream of a united Anglo-French kingdom alive.Another key difference on which, this time, the author does not really elaborate, is that while Verneuil was a crushing English victory after having almost been a disaster, it was hardly as decisive as the other three major battles. Crécy, Poitiers and Agincourt saw trapped, retreating, exhausted and badly outnumbered English armies winning crushing victories against all odds and therefore themselves avoiding utter destruction. Verneuil was somewhat different, although the English forces were certainly outnumbered and had been skilfully manoeuvred onto a battlefield of the Frenchs' choosing. This is something that the author shows rather well when discussing the battle itself.A third difference lies in the aftermath of the respective battles. The consequence of Crécy was to allow the English to settle for a long siege (about a year) of Calais, capture it, and retain it for over two centuries as a permanent base for trading and a permanent threat of invasion against France. The consequences of Poitiers were even more far-reaching largely because of the capture of King John II. The French side, bereft of its King and beset by insurrections, was forced to negotiate the Treaty of Brétigny (signed in 1360) and pay a huge ransom for its King. The consequences of Agincourt is that it essentially allowed Henry V to conquer Normandy through multiple sieges over several years until the Treaty of Troyes which, in 1420, saw him become the heir to the mad King of France.Next to this, the victory of Verneuil in 1424, two years after the death of Henry V, ensured that the ""English Kingdom of France"" still had a fighting chance to survive the death of its founder, but this is about all it really brought. It stopped the French counter-strike into Normandy and it allowed Bedford's captains to continue their efforts into expanding towards the South towards the Loire and the South West into Anjou, in an attempt to make Normandy and Maine secure. Ironically, and with some hindsight perhaps, it allowed the smallish English forces which were becoming ever more difficult to sustain and replace to overstretch themselves even more. Five years later, the dual disasters of the failed siege of Orléans and the destruction of the English field army at Patay happened and put a stop forever to English conquest.Apart from not emphasising this, Richard Wadge does an excellent job in presenting the battle of Verneuil in its context to the extent that this is a book that you can read even if you know next to nothing about the Hundred Years War. You are also treated to a brief history of the conflict, the military aspects of medieval warfare in the early fifteenth century (arms, armour, troop types, organisations, respective tactics and battle plans). As the other reviewer has also noted, one of the key qualities of this book has been the author's ability to provide just enough context and detail to make the story fully understandable but not too much, therefore avoiding the duel risks of either overwhelming or of boring the non-specialist reader. This is certainly one of the main reasons for finding this book so successful. There are many others.One of these is the attention and importance given to the ""Auld Alliance"" between France and Scotland, and how the French Kings used it (rather skilfully) against the English by providing help to Scotland, but also to raise large forces of though Scottish lance and bow infantry to continue the war in France. Interestingly, the author shows the importance of these Scottich troops at both the battle of Baugé in 1421, which the French won, and at Verneuil, which they lost and where the Scots were cut down almost to a man because they were encircled. He also shows the rather ambivalent attitude of the French King towards them (Charles VII), an attitude which stems at least in part from the jealousy and small mindedness of some of the French nobility.Another fascinating theme which is well dealt with is the organisation of the English forces, their growing professionalism, their cost, the soldiers' motivations - a mixture of serving the King and personal enrichment - but also their relatively small numbers and the growing reluctance of the English in England to contribute to the endless war, either in money or in men, and especially after the death of the charismatic Henry V. A related theme is the contrast between the two sides, with the French Kingdom side still more populated and still richer than the English one, despite its conquests. An implicit conclusion, that the author does not make in his book and which may owe something to hindsight, is that the French could - just about - afford the crushing defeats that they suffered, and they could certainly afford them more than the English could.A further theme is to try to explain how and why the English won these crushing victories against the odds. This is also an extremely valuable piece of the book because it shows that the reasons for the English triumphs against the odds cannot be solely explained by the presence and effective use of the Anglo-Welsh long bowmen, even if this was one of the factors, and one that was already acknowledged at the time. However, English archers were far from invulnerable and far from always efficient. They could be cut to pieces if ambushed, as they were at Baugé, or if caught by cavalry before they could organise an effective defence and deploy, as at Patay. They could also be incapable of stopping fully armoured cavalry, as they were at Verneuil. This leads the author to develop a couple of complementary ideas.In all of the four main battles, and perhaps through the largest part of the Hundred Years' War, the English were often more disciplined and better lead than the French. Each of these differences on its own - discipline and leadership - had at least as much to do with the English victories than the long bow, and probably more. Superior discipline and professionalism certainly did play a role and was important in explaining how the outmatched English forces held, fought ferociously and won against all odds. This is especially true when compared to the heterogeneous and quarrelsome contingents of most French armies in general, and of the arrogant French nobles in particular.The issue of leadership - and military leadership in particular - is perhaps one of the most interesting and most crucial ones. It is dealt with across the whole book, and it is one of the ones that is best dealt with. The English were fortunate enough to have two Kings (Edward III and Henry V) and at least one Royal Prince, if not two (Edward the Black Prince and John, Duke of Bedford) who were either remarkable commanders or were wise enough to act on the advice of their better commanders. The French had none of the former, and only two of the latter (Charles V and Charles VII). At a lower level, that of command of field armies, English command was generally less divided and, with the possible exception of the last two to three decades of the war, leaders either did not tend to quarrel as much as on the French side, or, at least, they made sure that their diverging views did not negatively affect their troops morale and performances in the field.Finally, there is a related point about leadership which is made in a way that I could not help finding simply excellent: there were good and bad commanders on both sides. Accordingly, the French leaders were neither all incompetents and arrogant individuals, nor were they powerless and inefficient. In fact, as this book shows with Verneuil, and others have shown with both Agincourt and Poitiers, the French tried hard to learn from their mistakes, as their battle plans show and, at Verneuil more than in any of the other major battles, they almost got it right. However, ""almost"" was not enough, and, at Verneuil in particular, all of the main leaders on the French paid the price for this by getting themelves killed.This book is simply a ""must read"" for anyone interested in the last phase of the Hundred Years' War, in this conflict, and in military history more generally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7439075GCORX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0750961139#wasThisHelpful","R7439075GCORX","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a relatively old book, or, more accurately, it is two books initially published separately in 1967 and 1970, which can currently be bought together as a single volume. These two volumes tell the rather extraordinary story of “The Normans in the South” (the title of the first book) up to the crowning of Roger II as their first King in 1130, and of “The Kingdom in the Sun” which he founded but which only lasted some 64 years down to 1194 when the last Norman King died and the Kingdom was overrun by the German Emperor.Together, the two books add up to a bit more than 750 pages of text, plus the bibliography and a few other things that bring the grand total close to 800. They can, of course, be read separately, although I think it preferable to read them together and one after the other in order to get the full and continuous story. Both volumes include maps of Southern Italy and Sicily which allow the reader to closely “follow the action.”At first sight, the overall size could seem daunting and could put off a general reader for which these books were written. This, however, would be a pity, because such a first impression would be quite misleading. This is because the two books read almost like historical novels, as opposed to pieces of first-class scholarship. In fact, they are neither one nor the other, but something in between and this is largely what makes them so valuable up to this day.Despite the author’s modesty and claim to be no scholar, they are meticulously researched and backed by a rather impressive bibliography, even if it is no longer up to date. They are not, however, the “usual” pieces of academic scholarship that you might expect because the author strived, and, in my view, fully succeeded, in making them lively. They do not contain the king of rigorous, comprehensive but cold analysis that you might expect to find in pieces of scholarship. Instead, the authors prose and views are, at times, somewhat biased, with the author clearly showing to what extent he found his subject fascinating and presenting the Hautevilles as open-minded and tolerant founders of an outstanding and cosmopolitan Kingdom. They seem to have been that, but they also had darker sides which the author gives, at times, the impression of minimising.The way the story is told and the book is written will however allow you to fully empathise with many of the characters that it contains, whether the willy and ruthless Robert Guiscard, his dashing and just as skilful younger brother Roger or the various Kings, starting with Roger II, the first and the greatest of them. Empathising with his characters is certainly what the author does, to the extent that his prose becomes lyrical or even poetic at times. There is even what seems to be a touch of nostalgia as if the author regretted what he presents as almost a “Golden Age” where Christians, both Catholics and Orthodox, cohabited peacefully with Muslims within the same religiously tolerant and multicultural Kingdom. While the portrait may be somewhat idealised, it is certainly true that no other Kingdom around the Mediterranean exhibited such a level of tolerance. This was the result of a deliberate Hauteville policy which begun with the very founders (Robert and Roger) and which reflected their pragmatism. Norman warriors were few and tolerance was a tool allowing them to gain acceptance and adherence from their subjects.Another characteristic of these books is the author’s deliberate attempt to reflect the intentions, feelings and emotions of his principal characters. This, of course, is rather risky for an academic and a professional historian, which John Julius Norwich claims not to be. However, he offers plausible, if unverifiable, insights about their possible state of mind, and it certainly makes the story telling both more entertaining and much livelier.Then there are the stories of the main characters, starting with the founding brothers. They are so fantastic that they could be seen as implausible pieces of fiction, if they were not historically true. One reviewer mentioned these as being the “real Game of Thrones”. Apart from being incorrect - Game of Thrones is rather inspired from the Hundred Years War and the Wars of the Roses according to its author – R.R. Martin’s fiction does not come even close, in my view, and despite being remarkable in its own way. This, the story of the “other Norman Conquest”, of the foundation of a Kingdom that became very prosper, powerful and dominated the Central Mediterranean, and of its decline and demise, is a true story which is told in a rather breath taking way.I can only recommend you to read it, as its author would have wanted you to.

"This is the sequel of Swords of Good Men, where the action (and lots of fighting) was mainly concentrated in and around Stanvik, which is besieged and assaulted by one pagan army, and then “liberated” by a second army, that of the “Christian” Battle King Olaf Tryggvasson who forcefully united most of Norway under his iron rule in the last years of the tenth century. You get a couple more glimpses of what it meant to be “Christian” according to Olaf. The conversion and christening of vanquished pagans was more like an exercise in “waterboarding” rather than anything else. You are also treated to Olaf’s very personal and utterly ruthless interpretation on doing unto others what they have done to you and of rendering summary justice, of sorts. This is part of his campaign to “win hearts and minds”. The Norse King made his point in a “crystal clear” way, that is a rather crude, extremely brutal, but very effective way than everyone and anyone can relate to immediately.This volume therefore paints in a little more of the historical context, as King Olaf continues to subdue the various jarls of Norway, and the lone in Tronheim in particular. Meanwhile, the Danish King (Swein Forkbeard, the future conqueror of Anglo-Saxon England), is busy subduing the southern part of Sweden with his own army, and acting just as ruthlessly and brutally by letting his war bands loose on the countryside. Here, instead of overwhelming the reader with grim and gory details, the author suggests the endless pillaging, burning, raping and killing than one of the heroes takes more or less part in, day after day, after having joined one of these bands.Interestingly, however, this volume is much less focused on fights and battles. In fact, there is none of the later. The book could even have been a bit of filler between the previous instalment and the last volume of the trilogy when the climax will supposedly be reached. That it was much more than that, and quite different from the previous book, while being just as griping is to the credit of the author. This had been achieved by focusing more on the main characters of the story, as another reviewer mentioned, but also, and perhaps even more importantly, by showing to what extent the two main heroes - and one of the arch-villains - are being increasingly manipulated by forces far beyond them, justifying the title of the whole series (The Valhalla Saga).The difference with this book is the shift in focus, with the Old Gods coming very much into play, walking the earth among human beings, taking human forms and competing against each other. I will not mention them by name but you will certainly recognise at least three of them, if not more. A related difference with this book is an increase in fantastic features and in suspense, with a number of new characters that the reader comes across not being who they seem to be.So while the first volume was more about the clash of battles, with armies fighting for the New God or the Old Gods, the second one borders more on the fantastic and on the mysterious and not exactly friendly intentions that they seem to have in store for the main human characters. I cannot help wondering what the author will come up with in the next volume. Meanwhile, and despite a rather abrupt ending, this one was just as much a griping read as its predecessor and is therefore also worth a strong four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0ORJN63LN5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623658721#wasThisHelpful","R3A0ORJN63LN5F","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first instalment of the White Hawk, the emblem of the noble Bolton family of Staffordshire, and of their fights on the Lancastrian side and their survival during what is now called the Wars of the Roses. It only covers some eighteen months of the conflict but includes half a dozen battles, four of which are described vividly, in a brutally realistic way and with a remarkable care in getting all of the historical features, events and details, including armour and weapons, “right”. For instance, the sheer savagery involved in fighting at close quarters and the fearful damage inflicted by medieval weaponry in general, and the poleaxe in particular, is rendered in a rather amazing way.The battle of Towton, which saw the two largest Lancastrian and Yorkist armies of the whole war clash, is particularly well told - which does not imply in any way that the others are not - including the preliminary events that lead to it, and the demise of “Butcher Clifford”, as the Yorkist got to call him, in particular. It was the largest, and perhaps the bloodiest, of the Wars, with plenty of archaeological evidence – the terrible wounds sustained on the skeletons that have been found buried after the battle – to attest to its savagery. Well aware of this, David Pilling has made full and efficient use of it, including the slaughter of the defeated as these turned their backs on their victors, dropped their weapons, sometimes even got rid of their helmets to run away faster and got stabbed and speared while trying to do so.Another very realistic feature is to depict the warriors on both sides as men subject to fear, rage and terror. There are no “shinning heroes” in this book, with even Richard Bolton, the main character of the book, seeking to save his skin by hiding among the dead once the battle is lost and capable of horrific behaviours when seeking revenge. On the other side, the Geoffrey, the younger Malvern, is a rather despicable coward, the exact contrary to his father.The historical characters are also well-developed and accurate including the mad King Henry VI and his headstrong and ambitious Queen, the over-arrogant Duke of York and his giant young son Edward Earl of March (Edward IV) or the Dukes of Somerset (both father and son). The Neville clan are also presented in a historically accurate way, in particular the fifth Earl of Salisbury (Thomas Neville), his brother Lord Falconberg (William Neville) and his son Lord Montagu (John Neville). The only character for which there is a bit of a doubt is that of Richard Neville, Montagu’s brother and the 16th Earl of Warwick (better known as the “Kingmaker”). This is because the author has chosen to show him as brave warrior but an indecisive general, at best, and an incompetent one, at worst, given his defeat at the Second Battle of Saint Albans. Whether he was responsible for turning a setback into a debacle as shown in the book is doubtful (meaning maybe he was). What is certain, however, is that Montagu was the better soldier of the two but Warwick was the better diplomat.The grimness and horror of civil war in general, and this one in particular, is remarkably well shown, with the Bolton and the Malverne families choosing different sides and therefore at each other’s throats (literally and graphically!). In fact, whether longstanding or recent, rivalries between noble family burst out into blood feuds with each murder inciting retaliation and drawing in generations (fathers and sons), relatives, allies and retainers.The blood feud between the Malvernes (and the Huntleys) and the Boltons (father and son and Henry of Sedgley), and their respective allies reflect the reality of the war where neighbours and men who had trained and practised at arms together since childhood turned against each other. These feuds only mirror those opposing the greater lords, for instance the Percy versus Neville feud or the Clifford versus York one, but there were numerous others as well. The feuds involved plain and cold-blooded murders, such as executing prisoners that had surrendered or seeking out specific targets on the battlefield, ganging up against a single man, and “taken him out” without any possibility of honourable surrender and no quarter either asked or given. The deaths of the hero’s father at Blore Heath and of Richard Duke of York at Sandal Castle with the latter falling into what seems to have been a cunning trap are the two main examples of such behaviours.Another well-illustrated feature is to show to what extent these feuds spilled over to the families at large and did not necessarily spare either women or children, to say nothing about family castles and manors. The assault against one of the Huntleys and against the Malvern estate, the kidnapping (and worse) of one of the Boltons and the assault of their own manor are all illustrations of what may have been happening as order broke down and noble families took law into their own hands to settle scores directly.This was a superb read worth four stars and three-quarters (rounded up to five) with my only regret being that the story begins in 1459 only, leaving out the prequels to the War of the Roses and the initial events, including the First Battle of Saint Albans in 1455.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJ4LCDQZTSTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150309720X#wasThisHelpful","RVJ4LCDQZTSTV","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a particularly interesting and well-presented book on the Roman navy during the Empire and, more specifically, its role in Roman Britain. I would want to emphasise the latter point. While this is no way a criticism, the topic covered by this book is essentially the Roman navy in Britain, a narrower topic than a history of the Roman navy during the Empire.Having mentioned this at the outset to ensure that confusions are avoided and potential buyers not disappointed, this is a rather excellent book in several respects. It also does include, in the introduction and the next three chapters, an overview of Rome’s naval history up to Actium (31 BC), the end of the Republic, and how the imperial navy was set up and organised by Augustus and how it evolved during the Empire. The chapter on shipbuilding, ship types and naval bases, while succinct, is particularly interesting.The next chapters focus almost entirely on the Roman navy in Britain. The presentation is chronological and easy to follow and to read with each chapter centred on a major event or a major period.Chapter five is therefore about Caesar’s two “invasions” of Britain, with the first attempt being a reconnaissance in force and both attempts resulting in having the Romans “learn the hard way” that sailing across the Channel could be quite risky, especially for those who ignored the tides.Chapter six is about the invasion and conquest. It shows that the navy’s role and importance went well beyond just ferrying the original expeditionary force across and that its ability to supply the invasion force for at least the first months was just as essential to the success of the whole enterprise. Also included in this chapter is the navy’s role in seaborne and combined operations for conquering the rest of the island, up to and including Agricola’s conquest of (most of) Scotland.The next four chapters are about the navy’s missions in Britain once the island was conquered and how these evolved over time, which a shift from offensive to increasingly defensive operations. These are perhaps the most interesting sections of the book, although they are also the most speculative given the limitations of our sources. The author reviews thoroughly the various bases, forts and naval infrastructures (lighthouses, ports, shipyards) built by the Romans along the island’s coasts. He shows rather superbly how these evolved, with his reviews backed up by a considerable amount of research and illustrations including numerous maps, schematics, photos and descriptions of the sites. He also makes full use of the various excavations that have taken place.As another reviewer had also noticed, the last sections, and the bits on the Saxon Shore defences in particular, are a bit weaker than the rest. I was, for instance, expecting the author to review each and every of the forts associated with the so-called “Saxon Shore” in as much detail as he had provided for the previous periods. To be fair however, the book does contain enough references to satisfy those wanting more. Besides, those wanting more, and more “visuals” on the Saxon Shore forts of the late third and (mostly) the fourth century AD can read the excellent Osprey title that is now devoted to them.Finally, the book also contains some very interesting references about the mixed garrisons of at least some of these forts and naval stations which seem to have sheltered a naval squadron of light ships, which were ideal for patrolling the coast and spotting the sea raiders, and a force of cavalry which would, of course, be the best suited for “rapid interventions” as a strike force once the raiders had landed.This book is a great read, even if I would have wished for the very last section on the end of Roman Britain and the demise of its navy to be a bit more developed instead of being limited to an (nevertheless interesting) outline of the main events. This, given the dearth in sources, may however have been asking for too much.

"There are dozens of books on the First Crusade. There are dozens more of various aspects of it, in particular in “the Idea of Crusading” and on who were “the First Crusaders”, just to mention two titles from Jonathan Riley-Smith, or on the military aspects of it (see “Victory in the East” by John France). There are also quite a few biographies on various prominent characters that took part in it (for instance biographies of Raymond Count of Toulouse, Bohemond of Tarento, Robert “Courtheuse”, pope Urbain II, to mention just these). I should probably also mention R. J. Lilie (Byzantium and the Crusader States), Jonathan Philips, Steven Runciman and Peter Frankopan on the Byzantine connection and could go on, and on listing pages and pages of titles……And then, there is this one, which is an excellent overview and introduction to the subject, regardless of whether you happen to agree with the author’s conclusions or not, because it brings most of the elements and titles mentioned above together. It also presents a clear, well-laid out and comprehensive narrative of what happened, and why. This book’s subtitle - ”A New History” - might sound a bit overblown, if only because so much of its contents is NOT new but is made up of bits and pieces drawn and summarised from most of the authors mentioned above (and a number of others, as well).However, this book is not simply a compilation and a skilful and easy to read summary about the First Crusade and the current historical consensus among (western) historians. It also includes elements drawn from the author’s own works and in particular from his own (excellent) thesis on the creation of the Principality of Antioch. The most interesting contribution here is the author’s presentation and his interpretation about what happened during the period following the Crusaders’ victory at Antioch and why it took so long for them to reach Jerusalem. In a nutshell, the leaders were divided and their personal ambitions compromised almost fatally the Crusade.A related feature upon which the author dwells quite a bit, as a few other authors have also done, is the complexity and paradoxes of what it meant to be one of the Crusaders at the time. One of the most interesting features of this book is the attempt to present the medieval mind set, and that of the Frankish warrior class in particular, and show to what extent it differed from ours and was dominated by violence, by the fear of committing unforgivable and by greed and ambition. As the author shows well, this does not at all imply that the Crusaders were not religiously motivated. They very much were, but these motivations and beliefs were quite different and should not be confounded with modern views.Another worthy feature of this book is to show how the “idea of crusading” developed and, in particular, how popes, and Gregory VII and Urbain II in particular, shifted and distorted Christian thought to further elaborate on the Augustinian concept of “Just War”. Also well shown are the ways in which this doctrine was made compatible with the warrior ethos of what would become the ideals of “chivalry” a century or two later.A further excellent point is to show the Byzantine perspective, and how, after hordes of armed pilgrims crossed into his Empire and threatened to go on a rampage, the byzantine Emperor Alexis I deployed his considerable diplomatic skills to harness them and use them as tools to further his own objectives. An additional point shows how and why the relations largely soured between the Crusaders and the Emperor after Antioch was captured by the former against all expectations.There is one weak element, however. The author does not really show that the deteriorating relations between the Emperor and the Crusaders were encouraged by Bohemond”s ambitions. His military genius, upon which Thomas Asbridge insists so much and quite correctly, was matched by his devious and quite unscrupulous diplomatic skills, which the author barely mentions. In all fairness, however, the break with the Emperor took place after August 1099 and the victory at Ascalon, which is where the book stops. Nevertheless, since this is the choice made by the author, his claim that the Crusaders’ conquest had been made secure by this victory is somewhat shaky. Over the next six years, the Fatimids would attempt several times to reconquer Palestine and Baldwin I, starved of soldiers as he initially was, would have fight some more desperate battles to ensure the survival of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.This relative weakness is largely made up by the multiple strongpoints which I have already mentioned and also by the presentation of the somewhat shifty behaviours of Count Raymond of Toulouse. By showing that the latter’s actions were just as much driven by ambition and self-interest as those of Bohemond (and some of the younger leaders, in particular Tancred and Baldwin himself), Thomas Asbridge’s narrative does somewhat help to set the record straight. Bohemond, sometimes presented as “one of the villains” in this story, was certainly driven by personnel ambition. He was not an isolated case, although some of the leaders were clearly not driven by ambition at all. In military terms, however, his contribution to the success of the First Crusade up to and including the capture of Antioch was simply considerable and exceeded that of any of the other leaders by far. This included that of Raymond of Toulouse, whose leadership and political skills are shown by the author as being less than impressive.Five stars for a very good overview and introduction which is well supported by excellent maps and schematics of the main sieges and a comprehensive bibliography for anyone wanting to go further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JM4TXQ58ZAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195189051#wasThisHelpful","R1JM4TXQ58ZAW","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is episode 4 of the Legionary series and the build up towards the disastrous battle of Adrianople which will probably be the topic of the author’s next volume. To me at least (and, it seems, for a number of other reviewers), this one is the best title of the series so far, even if it still has a few “glitches”. Whether, and to what extent a potential reader considers these glitches are important is largely a matter of opinion.As far as I am concerned, they can be important in two respects. One is when certain features are hard to believe and make the story implausible. Another is when an author written a so-called “historical fiction” has distorted what little is known of certain events to fit her/his own purposes. While this may be acceptable to some and it often is a question of degree about how much you are ready to put up with, altering known “historical facts” (as they are sometimes called) also exacerbates the tension between the two terms “historical” and “fiction”. In other words, the more an author will distort the “historical record” to fit his plot and the dramatic effects he wants to introduce, the more he will be producing a piece of fiction rather than a “historical novel”.To me at least, this title is “the best of the lot” largely because the author has “stuck with” the historical context, and has done so more than in some of his other titles (in particular more than in episodes 1 and 3). The sections about the ultimately failed blockade of the Haemus Mountain Passes by the talented Magister Equitum Sebastianus and about the successful defense of the Succi Pass (or Trajan’s Gate) and defeat of a large Gothic warband lead by Farnobius are rather good, even if they do contain bits of fiction and even if some of these might be a bit questionable.Perhaps the main positive feature about both events is the clear way in which the author explains the huge strategic value of both sets of places in the book itself and in his historical note. The Roman strategy of containing the Goths until the Emperors could arrive with their mobile and elite forces and of denying them access to the Southern Thrace plains and their food supplies is also well described. Implementing this strategy seems to have been Sebastianus’ task and it is to this effect that he had been allowed to select up to 300 men from each of the units of the Roman forces in Thrace. These, although they had sustained (and inflicted) heavy losses, were not “in tatters” after the drawn battle of Ad Salices, contrary to what the over-dramatic commercial blurb for the book, and the book itself tend to show. The fighting qualities of the legions themselves (oddly, there is very little mention of auxiliary units) do not seem to have been as uneven as shown in the book, judging by their performances in the field. Rather, and probably more than anything else, the Romans were outnumbered and remained so even why the (limited in both numbers and time) help they received with the troops of Count Richomere.What the historical sources do not really explain is the reason why the blockade of the Passes and the harassing of the Gothic forces beyond it, both of which were initially successful, were lifted and stopped after some 6 to 9 months. There are several possible explanations. Gordon Doherty has chosen the most dramatic one, but perhaps the most plausible one as well – that the fortifications at one of the passes were finally stormed after numerous unsuccessful attempts. Two alternatives could be that Sebastianus withdraw deliberately either when he realized that the positions could no longer be held or when he decided that the time had come to attract the Goths onto the Thracian plain where they could be defeated once and for all, since the Emperor and the Praesental army were approaching. The author’s choice, which is here perfectly compatible with the historical record, is also the most exciting and allows for a Roman version of a “mini-Thermopylae” to take place.A related feature is the storming of the Roman camp and the defeat of the main Roman army because of sheer incompetence. This piece is entirely invented by the author. However, the level of incompetence displayed on the Roman side, and its disastrous consequences, are not implausible. What is harder to believe is the (usual, by the time you have reached episode 4!) “heroic last stand” of our little bunch of heroes who see their partly reconstituted XI Claudia legion cut to pieces but one again manage to get through with barely a few scratches. This, of course, was a bit less plausible.The third interesting feature is the very successful defense of the strategic Trajan Gates with, again, their strategic importance being well presented. Here I had perhaps more of a problem with some of the features because the author has presented them in such an exaggerated way that they become implausible. It is, for instance, highly unlikely that the military road and the fort defending the pass were in the state of decay and disrepair that is shown in the book. Both had been used as recently as the early 360s when Emperor Julian moved the bulk of his army to the East in preparation of his campaign against the Sassanid King of Kings, at a time when the Empire certainly had the financial means to maintain fortifications and strategic roads. It is also quite unlikely that the fort – given its importance - would be defended by a mere century of archers. Finally, it is also quite unlikely that these archers, along with a scratch force of three other centuries – less than 500 all told – could inflict such massive casualties and successfully resist against a force of ten times their size. Also unlikely is their “eleventh hour” relief, with our heroes (still among the survivors, of course) being saved by the cavalry (quite literally).Other features are also worth emphasizing, whether good or not very plausible. Even when exaggerated - with the author seeming to have a propensity for heads flying all other the place and guts spilled just about everywhere – the battle scenes are rather exciting. I also liked the opposing characters of Farnobius the Gothic leader and the old war horse, Count Geridus (who seems to have been invented), however stereotyped they may appear to some. Also interesting are the descriptions and attitudes of the civilian Governors at Tremontium and Sardica. These are also fictitious but nevertheless plausible. A feature that is not at all fictitious is the freeing of the mine slaves by Gothic war bands, with these (and other) slaves joining them and providing valuable intelligence to them. Also well shown is the mixed nature of the so-called “Gothic horde”. The multiple leaders of the Gothic forces, with their associated tensions and rivalries, are also well depicted and seem very plausible, even if the sources (exclusively Roman) do not mention such tensions explicitly. The composition of Farnobius’ force with its associated leaders seems to have been fairly typical, even if the size of his break-away force may not have been large and well beyond that of most other war bands rampaging through Moesia and Northern Thrace.Finally, there are the main characters: Numerius Vitellius Pavo, his beloved Felicia, his lost half-brother, Dexion, Tribune Gallus, and a few others. There are quite a few interesting twists and turns which I will mostly, of course, refrain from mentioning to avoid spoilers. Some, however, are not plausible, in particular the two following.The book starts with our little band of five (the survivors of the very implausible Persian episode) walking on their own from Constantinople to Adrianople (over 150 kilometers) on their own through a part of Thrace ravaged by Gothic raiders and their allies. It is very hard to believe that out five heroes would even set out on their own on foot and would be allowed to do so, to put it mildly.The second implausible feature is the expedition from Trajan’s Gates to Emperor Gratian undertaken by Tribune Gallus and Dexion. First, it is rather hard to believe that both the commanding officer and his second in command would leave together on such an errand. Second, some of the events seem excessive, with perhaps too much crammed into too short of a timeframe. Third, the rather cynical description of young Emperor Gratian was a bit hard to believe when you know that his main concerns were to defend his own threatened frontiers but also to limit the influence of Merobaudes, his chief general who would play a major role in his overthrow a few years later. The point here is that he had much more pressing concerns much closer to home so that the limited and somewhat reluctant help that he provided to his uncle could really have been just about as much as he could afford to provide.Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33YZ4R20J5GD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1507561369#wasThisHelpful","R33YZ4R20J5GD8","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Macedonian War Machine” is a unique reference on the Macedonian army under Philip II, Alexander III and the Successors down to 281 BC and the battle of Couropedion which saw the victory of Seleukos over Lysimachos, and was shortly followed by the murder of the former. It is not, however, fully comprehensive because the author has chosen to focus on just about everything except campaigns, battles and sieges, which tend to be better known and covered more frequently in other books. What this book tends to be therefore is a review and study of the daily life ofMacedonian armies, their soldiers and their officers over the reference period.In doing this, the author and his book are largely successful. Besides, this is, to my (arguably limited) knowledge, the only book to achieve this in English. In fact, the main merit of this book is to achieve what has been done numerous times for the Roman Army: coming up with a single volume that brings together most, if not all, of the aspects related to the Macedonian soldier and Macedonian armies and therefore providing a very valuable reference and a starting point for anyone wanting to go further and investigate any given specific aspect. A related feature is the sheer amount of work that underpins this compilation. This is reflected by the bibliography with the list of modern works used for the purpose of this book exceeding thirty pages (in relatively small characters!).Having mentioned these features which make this book well worth four stars (and probably a “must have” for Macedonian “fans”), it is however not quite perfect and contains some rather questionable aspects and behaviours.One general comment is that much of the contents and interpretations are speculative. To some extent, this is unavoidable. However, the author’s methods when presenting certain aspects, especially the dress and panoplies, are quite questionable. They include sweeping statements and generalisations based on flimsy and very limited evidence. For instance, a few traces of paint on a couple of shields found in a tomb and described with a level of detail that be almost overwhelming will be used as a basis to state that shields were of a certain colour. A related feature which sometimes borders on the inelegant, immodest and the unpleasant is the author’s tendency to criticise previous authors while very heavily relying upon their work for his own, and presenting his own assumptions (or layers of assumptions) as “solving the problem.Despite these few limitations, this book achieved what seems to have been one of its main objectives: once you have finished it, and although this is often no “easy read”, you will have learnt how much the Romans seem to have borrowed from their Macedonian predecessors. You will also see to what extent “the Macedonian war machine” was a very sophisticated one on multiple levels, on par with the earlier Assyrian and the latter Roman ones. Four strong stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNGMXU553GVA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848846185#wasThisHelpful","RNGMXU553GVA0","A1HS4595P8TLG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HS4595P8TLG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SOUNDS INTERESTING, to quote---okay, it's cut'n'paste: >>>>>>>Picture this: a full-grown moose comes crashing through the roof of your garage! And not only does it fly - if a bit carelessly - it talks! It seems that Mr Moose was on a test drive with Santa Claus when he lost control of his sleigh. Max appreciates the uninvited visit, even if he stopped believing in Santa ages ago. With his parents recently separated, a new friend is always welcome. In Mr Moose he finds a partner with whom to watch movies, an unusual ally against bullies and, most important of all, someone who understands how much he misses his father. But Max soon finds out that being friends with a moose isn't all that simple. Especially since the grumpy neighbour Mr Panneman is keen on adding moose antlers to his hunting trophies.Actors: Dennis Reinsma, Dana Goldberg, Jelka Van Houten, Arjan Ederveen, Derek de LintStudio: BBC Home Entertainment ; DVD Release Date: December 1, 2015 ; 85 minutes <<<<<<<This ISN'T a review, per-se.

"Bought this in the deep blue and wore it to a casual wedding with a cute white crochet bolero and white hat. Yes, the foam ""cups"" (they're actually thin foam pads, attached to the dress at the bottom of the pad only) do shift a bit and weren't my ""shape"" at all. One even had a ""nipple"" look to it that wasn't very attractive. Before wearing, I also cut mine out (thanks to the other reviewers who said they had done this successfully!)I was a bit nervous, but it worked perfectly! For anyone else interested, here's how I did it: on the inside fabric layer of the bust (the one that lays against your skin), I carefully cut a 1"" or so horizontal (parallel to the waistband) slit right in the middle (between where the breasts sit). That way, if it pulled there wouldn't be a weird gap shape showing through. Plus, I could access both ""pads"" from the center. (Surely, there are other good places to cut this hole, too). Then, I simply dug around a little until I had the left pad in hand, gently pulled it toward the slit, and then rolled/folded it a bit until it fit through the hole. Then, I took a sharp pair of scissors and cut the little fabric tab that held the pad in place. I cut it in the middle of the pad and the dress, in case I needed to reattach it, or something else, to the dress. Then, I did the same thing with the right side pad. If I was more industrious, I'd sew up the hole (and maybe I will someday), but even without that, it worked perfectly.I was really nervous about messing up the dress, but I'd tried on dozens, even after after buying this one, and this one really did look the best (besides the pad issue). I wore a bra with clear straps (a little tacky and not super comfy, but supportive and not too visible), and a pair of high-waisted Hanes support short things underneath just to smooth everything out for photos and stuff. Got lots of compliments and, despite being ""dressed up"" (ugh!) and it being almost 90-degrees F and humid, I was EXTREMELY comfortable from start to finish (even went to a lively birthday party after the day-long wedding!). Seriously, wearing this dress is like wearing pajamas! It's just stretchy enough, and it's super soft. I'm considering buying the other colors, too! If you're courageous, you could even wear this dress with a good strapless bra, as the empire waist helps a little with support. I was dancing and moving around a lot, so I'm glad I had the extra security of the clear straps.Also, I'm 5'2"" and thankfully, didn't have to hem it (of note, I did buy both my usual size, and one size up, just in case, and the size up was a tad longer). I don't wear heels, but I did wear a pair of white fitflops, which do have a 1"" or so platform on the bottom. I danced barefoot and it didn't drag too much, but not sure if I would have been ok walking around in true flats in this dress. If you're my height, just something to consider. I'm very short-waisted, narrow-waisted, wide hips and bust, with longer legs, and it's not easy for me to find dresses that fit right and fall in just the right places. This one was pretty much perfect. Didn't even come up too high under the arms (a common problem I find).The main downside to this dress is that it almost seems like a ""disposable"" dress (or, at least only wear it once to a nicer function), as the fabric around the bust/under the arms was very ""pilled"" by the end of the night (albeit a very long night!). I would expect this from knits after extensive wearings/washings, but just one wearing!?!? I'm even a little hesitant to wash it now, as I'm concerned about the construction and the ""jewels"" around the waist. Fortunately, it wasn't very expensive, and it hit the mark in all the other areas that I am focused on.Overall, I'm very glad I bought it. So far, I've gotten one great day out of it, and plan to wear it to other casual/comfy functions.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCQQ5Z3G0EN95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QS9KZF2#wasThisHelpful","RCQQ5Z3G0EN95","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used 4 packs of these for my wedding invitations. I printed directly on them using a large office laser printer, then cut them, and shaped the corners. All handling (printing/cutting/shaping) response was appropriate for the method & the medium.Individual sheets varied in thickness from one to the next - not enough to affect printing, but enough to notice the difference. I liked that aspect, but that's my personal preference. These papers are a bit thicker than typical papers so you cut fewer at once.There are ""pieces"" of things in the paper (bits of straw and other ""elephant treats""), some sheets had very small holes, and the color varied a bit (I believe the packs I got had been stored in the sun, as there was some obvious shelf fading). This was in early 2014 and they were out of stock for a while, so this fading may no longer be an issue. It only bothered me a little.Ink disbursement on them can be somewhat inconsistent, due to the uneven surface and ""natural effects"" listed above. I was able to use all prints, and I preferred the natural/organic look for my wedding. If you're considering using these papers, I'm guessing you like that look, too.I loved the eco-friendliness, and the unique-ness of the paper. In some places, it has somewhat of a soft ""hand feel"", kind of like a natural felt.Oh, and people really dug the dung aspect!I rely on reviews to help me make informed product decisions.

"I happened upon this option while looking for more natural ""bandages"". I was intrigued by the claims to heal eczema and so I bought a bottle. I had an awfully stubborn patch on my palm that wasn't responding well to the other natural remedies I'd tried (that do work well for other things). I began to see improvement within the first two days. Four days later, the patch was almost history. I couldn't believe how well this worked, but I'm thankful!Yes, it smells funky, kind of like bad plastic, and it looks like watery milk, and it's a bit runny when you first spray it, and you have to rinse the nozzle after you use it to keep it clear, but all that is so worth it to me, as none of those are as bothersome as the eczema that I dealt with for months, and was healed in a few days with the Natural Seal.Many thanks to the woman who invented it and put in the market.

"1. This is listed as a 24-pack, but I received ONE 3-pack of filters. To the seller's (Coalburn) credit, they fixed it without fuss; although, it's been over a month and it's still listed as a 24-pack. The price listed has gone up substantially, and it's a different seller, so maybe this is actually for a 24-pack. Just a heads-up.2. The filters are pretty good.

"This may be the most painful review I've ever written...My hubby and I found these bars a year or more ago and have been buying them (this flavor, and others) consistently ever since. They are (have been) much better than all other ""better"" chocolate bars we've tried (and we've tried most of them - I even toured the only single-origin organic chocolate factory in Italy).I favor this flavor, and my hubby favors their coffee flavored bar. We are very happy they are organic, dark, RA certified, and help support a charity. We like the cool, outdoorsy photos on the bars, as well.Shortly after we started buying them, it seemed like Salazon reduced the amount of caramel inside the bar. All else was the same, so we didn't mind too much. After all, their chocolate, itself, was the smoothest and tastiest we'd found. And, that's before the salt and caramel (YUM.) are added to the mix.Then, with our last purchase, we found that they made the bars SMALLER (from 3 oz to 2.75 oz), but the cost was the same. At first, we were irritated (and sad), but we figured hey, as long as the inside is still the same, then maybe it's a good thing they're ""limiting"" our intake. Unfortunately, this is not the case. They have also messed up the ratio of caramel to chocolate in the wrong direction. They increased the thickness of the chocolate on the edge and in certain places on the imprint (""continents"") and now it seems as if there's less caramel-to-chocolate in the mix. (see photo of NEW bar) This reduced surface area also makes it seem like there's less salt sprinkled on the bar, too. The salt is reportedly ""hand sprinkled"", so maybe I just got a scant one, but the Sodium reported in the Nutrition Facts has gone from 201mg to 110mg, so maybe they have in fact also reduced the amount of salt by almost half. (I have uploaded the NEW Nutrition Facts label, as the one currently on Amazon is old) This increase in edge thickness also makes the bar much less ""melt in your mouth"", causing you to have to chew it a bit to achieve the same mouth feel as before. In addition, they have changed the shape (again?) of the mold, and have effectively eliminated the sectioning that used to break into nice, fairly even ""pieces"". Albeit, the map relief is cool, but honestly, it comes ""face down"" in the wrapper and I never flip it over to look at the full bar, anyway. Who cares what it looks like - I enjoy this bar for the other senses it appeals to. The molded ""pieces"" used to be a good size to fit singly in your mouth (possibly even better in their earlier days), but now the ""breaks"" are bigger, so the smaller bar gives you even less ""mouth mileage"". And, along with the increased chocolate thickness, makes for a much less pleasant sensation when savoring the flavor/texture.Salazon, in your description, you report that the bar is less calories than others. Well, now it's 17 less calories than it was before, it's SMALLER (by 7 grams / almost 9% smaller) and has half the sodium. Also, there's 1 gram less each of Fat, Sugar, & Fiber. Oh, and the new shape makes it a much less enjoyable indulgence. Humph.I used to have to exert immense self-control to only eat 2 or 3 pieces in a sitting. Now, it seems as if I have to force myself to eat one piece, period.So, thank you Salazon. You have effectively ruined for me an almost perfect chocolate bar. A bar that was in my grocery cart every time the store had it in stock. A bar that we would buy multiples of to ensure we always had at least one on hand. A bar that served as my only chocolate ration in the house. A bar that, even though it was expensive, we'd always make room for in the budget.

"Fits either one of two of my HP Laptops perfectly, plus, I can stash a mouse or Ethernet cable, etc in the pocket.

The zipper works great - no snags and is still in great condition.The inner surface of this sleeve is soft and fleecy and has done a great job (since 2011) of helping to keep my laptops looking new.The stream pattern is nice, in that it gives a little bit of style, without sacrificing ""professionalism"".Highly recommended!!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review was helpful to you! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1BHEFQKKTTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OGNXZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1W1BHEFQKKTTG","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried several different styles/shapes/sizes/forms/raw materials of alternative disposable plates and these are my absolute favorite. We've used them in hotel rooms, and we even used them for our 150-person wedding reception. They were probably a bit more sturdy than we needed, as we just had small bites but I liked their style. Some guests even took theirs home!When considering size, if they are truly 9 inches, they might compare more to a 7 or 8"" plate, as the shape kind of ""bowls"" (which is really great for saucy things, or for food that tends to roll around). They have been the perfect size for any meal I've used them for (not too big, not too small, just the right balance of curve and flat center). They are very sturdy, and hold up to water/moisture/sauce quite well (we even rinse them off and re-use them a few times, when travelling). They are so sturdy, in fact, that I often feel bad throwing them away after just one fairly dry use. They are compostable, however, so that's a bonus (we composted all of the ones used at our wedding - along with the cups, napkins, and utensils). If you microwave them, they won't get super hot, they won't deteriorate right away, and they probably won't leach nasty chemicals into your food.Note that the color/pattern is VERY ""organic"" in that EACH one is different, and sometimes, VERY different (many have dark brown veins/splotches/patches). Like a snowflake, no two are the same. The photo they're showing now is one of the more plain ones I've seen. So, if you're looking for an even-colored or pale-colored plate, you'd have to pick-and-choose from a batch to get what you want. I like the various colors (I dig the ""natural"" look AND it makes it easier to recognize ""your"" plate!)The ""feel"" of these plates is also ""organic"". Some have very noticeable, thin ridges (further security for free-wheelin' food), some are a little rougher on the back (where your hand or table goes), but never any splinters or anything like that. Some bamboo plates we've gotten had those. From what I can tell, these plates are made from one piece of palm-thing, so you don't have to worry about adhesives or the plate falling apart/leaking. Also, I have a friend with an aversion to cardboard, even paper plates, and she was fine with these.They stack securely, but not tightly, so they will take up much more space than a stack of another, more uniformly-shaped plate. This does make them easier to grab, as a single. They do not stick together. They are also fairly thick in material, maybe 1-2mm - but again, this varies, as the raw material is ""organic"" (in the ""natural shape"" sense; but I doubt there's pesticides, either). They're not as eco-friendly to transport - as mine came in a huge box (seriously, be prepared for like a 2-3 foot cube for 400 plates), and the plates were wrapped in plastic, inside the box. Maybe 25 plates per wrap? There wasn't much space left over at all in the box, as the plates took up most of it. They fared well in transport, no broken plates or anything like that.The company claims these are harvested from fallen palm leaves and my hubby and I questioned if this is really true. Well, soon after, we happened to visit a Palm Grove Rainforest and yes, thousands of these palm-leaf things had naturally fallen to the ground and covered it in a thick carpet. Of course, we also questioned the harm that picking them up in large quantities would do (aren't they needed, in order to decompose, and help nourish the new plants...etc. but, surely, they're much more environmentally-friendly than anything that has to be ""made"" - these are simply cut and ""formed"").The company also makes smaller ones and ones in different shapes - we used a few smaller ones for some decorations, and we used the heart ones for dessert - they were perfect for a few mini-cupcakes and some cookies. YUM!Yes, these are considerably more expensive than your typical paper plate, but they are also considerably much cooler and considerably better for the environment. After our wedding, people were talking about the cool plates as much as they raved about the food!HIGHLY Recommended!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"...and inspired me to write a corny headline for my review! Yep, consider me another G7 /  4000K LED bulb fan!Personally, I prefer a whiter light in my office/gym/sewing/craft room (less tiring on eyes and enthusiasm, and usually, better color rendering), so I went looking for a cooler/higher K bulb. I was happy to find this 4000K, as I thought it would be a nice ""happy medium"" between a yellow incandescent or LED around 2700K and the science lab blue-white of a 5500K+.Fortunately, I was right! I bought this and the G7 Carlin bulb (LOVE that they have names!) which is also 4000K, standard socket-style, but considerably smaller and less bright (850 lumens vs 1200 for the Tahoe). I have them paired in a floor lamp that's 1/2 Torchiere (Tahoe) and 1/2 gooseneck (Carlin) and it works great! The torchiere part is a 3-way, but I'm fine with just using it as on-off-off, as I like full brightness and, 3-way LED's are costly and difficult to find in a 4000K / Hi-Lumen / ""100W"" style.Of note, I replaced two ""Reveal"" bulbs (one had died and the other was too dull and yellow after I saw what these G7's could do). Both Reveal bulbs were of equal ""wattage"" rating to their respective G7 counterparts (I know that's different for LEDs, but I don't have a Lumens measurement for the Reveals). The light from these G7's is so much ""cleaner"" and really brightens up my office, without being ""fluorescent-sterile"", if that makes sense.Also, this Tahoe is quite large and considerably heavier than it's non-LED counterpart (due to all those sexy electronics!). It's fine for my use, as up-light in a torchiere, but definitely weighed a bit on the gooseneck (just making sure it worked before I reached all up in the top). I also bought their Eureka bulb, which was massively heavy for a bulb and weighed down the gooseneck considerably more (not the purpose it was purchased for, but good to know).Two things I have not tested on this bulb are: dimmability and longevity, as I do not have it in a dimmable socket, nor have I had it for the length of its stated ""life"" (22.8 years, at 3 hrs/day). I'm happy that it will (should) last so long and is also dimmable, as I might put it in a dimming fixture in the future.Something that many of us overlook (or don't always have access to), is the Company behind the product. I have contacted them a few times for questions, etc., and was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a friendly, knowledgeable HUMAN being EACH time. WOW!!In addition, in their follow-up email to my order, they claim:""A few G7 advantages:Our highly efficient bulbs provide more quality light for your dollar.We are a U.S. based, veteran owned and operated business.Unlike other LED manufacturers, we do not accept Federal Tax Dollars to subsidize our business.""I also love that it's Mercury Free, no UV Rays, UL Listed, FCC and RoHS certified (no crazy toxics!), shatter resistant, lower heat output, and high lumen per watt (= efficient).It seems they are a smaller, locally-owned (USA), eco-minded, self-sustaining company, with great products - and I'm happy to support that.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

I like that they are not uncomfortably tight around my wrists or fingers.There is a bit of a scent/""feeling"" when you remove them, but that's pretty common with most gloves.

"I own two of these lights.I LOVE that:- this light makes it easier to READ and DO (I have perfect eyesight, but this light still helps make things even easier to see!)- the base has a fairly small footprint, while still being very stable.- the neck is flexible, without being noisy (in fact, it's silent!)- the light is just the right amount and color for a task (keyboarding, sewing, makeup, checking for ticks...)- the bulb does not get hot (it does get warm, but you can touch it without any discomfort)- the power cord is removable (I often move the lamp from A to B, and being able to pull out the plug during transport helps to reduce the possibility of it being damaged; also would make for easier replacement, if ever needed)- the silver finish goes with everything and is unobtrusiveI have made one modification. The light coming from the ""bulbs"" area is quite bright and I don't like to look at that, directly. One night, I simply took a cheap white cocktail napkin and taped it into a cone shape, around the ""bulbs"" area. I have it ""open"" at the neck, so it can slide around, as needed. This provides a great ""visor"" to shied my eyes from the bright light, while also allowing full brightness to be shone down upon my work area.

I hope this review helped you, too!I know the ""bulbs"" are not user-replaceable, but they are marketed as: ""(40,000 hours at 8 hours a day equates to an expected life of 5,000 days, or over 13 1/2 years)"" (taken from majormusiclover's review). I use it fewer than 8 hrs per day, so it should last me much longer than 13.5 years.

"I normally wear a size 10 women's, so I bought the L-XL. They fit fine and are just roomy enough to be able to slip on easily right out of the shower (well, after I safely step on a towel). Cleanliness is important to me, so I prefer to go right from these to clean socks after a shower. I only use them for that purpose, and never wear them unless I have just showered. It used to bother me a bit to walk around on the carpet with damp feet before putting my feet in shoes. Solved!#1, I LOVE that they are ORGANIC and Fair-trade certified. I LOVE that they pack so flat and are easy to travel with. They also dry fairly quickly (by the next day's shower). Recently, I used them in an RV where space is at a premium. I'd leave them and the floor towel outside of the bathroom and after the shower, step onto the towel and then right into my cozy slippers. Win!I've worn these every day or so for the past six months and they are still holding up quite well.The bottoms/soles are not rubbery, but a softer, diamond-patterned material (cotton?). The top part that covers your toes is really soft and fluffy.The color of the binding is not as dark tan as the photo. On my pair, the binding and the rest all blend together nicely. They are actually much better-looking in person.Note: these aren't like ""cloud-fluffy"", where each step is super-cushioned and bouncy. Rather, they are slim and made for fast-drying with minimal materials (who knows what is off-gassing from all that foam in those other styles??)The tags are all very ""official-looking"" with appropriate certified organic notations. There are two main tags and both are made from a soft fabric. You could cut them out, but I've left mine in and I don't really feel them.

"I've owned the NEX-6 for about six months now and have been fairly happy. Of course, when the ""upgrade"" came out, I had to have it (after I did my research, of course!). So, now I have both (and intend to keep both, as I always like to have a 'back-up' camera handy).For those of you looking for a review on image quality and other points of usability, well, I can tell you that there are dozens (or more) excellent reviews out there that already cover that (generally they give pretty high marks for IQ, DR, etc). I read and viewed many of them before making the decision to buy and here are a few things that those reviews omitted:THE GRIP:- the grip on the a6000 is not as nice (for me) as the NEX-6. Like a good woman, the NEX-6 was ""curvy"" in all the right places, offering superb grip when dancing or running around (as I often do, camera-in-hand; yes, I always use a wrist strap, just in case). The a6000, despite what I've seen in my research, seems to have a shallower grip (due to a thicker body/mid-section). If you have even moderately long nails, you will find the need to trim them so that you can get the same grip you may be used to on the NEX6.- the bottom (where the hands' ""moon"" spot, in palmistry, sits) seems a bit ""edgier/sharper"" and doesn't nestle into that part of the hand as easily.- the rear thumbgrip on the a6000 is more vertical than the more organic ""diagonal"" of the NEX6. Ergo, the thumb has to be in a tighter, more upright angle to the rest of the hand, in order to have a more fully supported shot. I prefer the more ""C"" shaped gripping style of the NEX6, again.- the top rear edge of the a6000 is at a 90-degree angle, with two levels. On the NEX-6, this is a smooth, beveled edge (more like a 45-degree angle). Sometimes, I have to put my thumb in non-optimal places on the camera, to get just the right angle. On the NEX-6, there were quite a few places where this was comfortable. On the a6000, there's really only one (the default) and it's still not as comfortable as the NEX6. :(BUTTONRY/DO-HICKEYS:- my main pet peeve in this category is the On-Off switch. I didn't like it on the NEX6 and what's worse, they switched the order of On and Off on the a6000, but used the same ""push/pull in the opposite direction as what you read on the dial"" format! Maybe my brain is odd, but if On is left and Off is written to the right of that, my brain would be happiest with a switch that MOVED left for On and right for off (or vice-versa, as long as it's logical.) The good news is that the text is now white on black, versus white on champagne/silver on the NEX6, so it's a little easier to read.- I also really liked the smoothness and shininess of the NEX6 power switch/shutter release. It left no indent on my finger during extended shooting sessions and, gave me a soft spot for my index finger to make contact when not ""pressing"" buttons. And, when letting someone else take your photo, like when at a party or when travelling, it's easier for new/temporary users to see the shiny, champagne-colored button than the black, matchy-matchy button. Especially when you have to answer questions like ""what do I push?"" and it can be confused with other 'black buttons' in that area. Also, the a6000 power/shutter button flat surface is smaller and there's a ""groove"" around it which I fear will collect grime, over time (despite my very particular care-taking of my 'stuff')- speaking of smooth and shiny colors, the MI (multi-interface) shoe and lens mount were both finished in a 'dull' silver on my otherwise black NEX-6. These are both black on my black a6000. The teeny ridges on the lens mount are also less pronounced on the a6000. I generally don't see it, though, as my elastic strap lens cap keeper sits there and covers some of it. I kinda liked having the silver accents, though, as some of my lenses are silver and it integrates them a bit better.- the MI shoe on the NEX-6 came with a protective insert, which I thought was a very smart idea (protection & better-looking). In fact, I put them on all my ""shoe'ed"" cameras. The a6000 does NOT come with this. The NEX-6 one works in either camera. If you don't have one, I recommend it, as there are some sensitive contacts in that MI shoe. Options can be found for a few dollars on ebay (surely, they'd be cheap enough - especially in bulk - for Sony to include one with a ~$700 camera, but who knows...?) {NOTE: if this point is important to you, please see my 6/9 comment to this review for links and clarification.}- the screen - ok, Sony, you only give us image capture ratios of 3:2 or 16:9 to choose from and the screen is 16:9 (altho, it'd be great to have the otherwise fairly standard 4:3 and 1:1, as well, just for fun). I get it, there's the black bars alongside the photo for settings icons (in that one display mode). Whatever. But, why do you not center the display part of the screen in the non-display part of the screen?? And, why move it to the opposite side in the a6000? Oh, so you have to make (and we have to buy) new screen protectors (if we're loyal enough to buy them from you in the first place, that is). Um, ok. I happen to have an extra one here and it looks like I'll be putting it on upside-down, to save the $10-15 from buying a new one (if I could even find one in stock, at this point, anywhere). {UPDATE: yep, I put it on, upside-down, and sharpie'd the logo so it wouldn't drive me nuts - it isn't super-pretty, but satisfies me good enough. Doesn't work great in 'portrait' when wearing polarized sunglasses. This is pretty typical, and the result is just barely passable, so just fyi.}. SONY: please center it next time. It's nice to have a centered point-of-reference when composing via the LCD screen.CONNECTIVITY:- I currently have no use for NFC (still using my trusty old E72 nokia {RIP Symbian s60} & an ipod that won't upgrade to iOS7). I know that NFC isn't 'activated' until another NFC-enabled device 'bumps' it, but I'd like to turn it off completely. I've searched the in-camera menu and the manual and have not found a way to ""deactivate"" it. Selecting NFC in the the menu just keeps returning me back to the menu page, to select it again. I'd rather not have it using battery power (however minimal) while it's waiting to be bumped with another NFC device (nor, do I want yet more ""waves"" pulsating through my hand as I carry my camera all day.) If it serves a purpose in my life, I'm fine with that, but this currently does not.- they've swapped the HDMI port/jack from a mini (NEX-6), to a mirco (a6000). Just fyi, in case you need to buy a new cable (like I do). This may confuse some users, as the ports now look very similar. USB still at the top, near the Charge light. And, I'm one of the people who love the in-camera USB charging. (I also bought an external wall/car charger, as I always carry a second battery - LOVE that I can charge two batteries at the same time OR, carry a 'stick charge box' thingie in my bag and recharge it during down time at an event, regardless of access to an outlet. So cool, sony!)- the Wi-Fi has the WPS option, but I could not get it to work (I have, on other devices, tho; yet, I do have a somewhat old router, c.2011). YMMV. Entering the SSID & PWD isn't a huge problem, and you only need to do it once. Navigating the 'keyboard' isn't super-easy, but it works. Same as the NEX-6. It does ask two questions that aren't addressed in the manual (or via the internet, as far as I've found): IP setting and Priority.MENU:- yes, the menu on the a6000 is much improved! It's not perfect, but it's got a better (or, existent!) hierarchy, so if you want, you can remember X > Y > Z > 1,2,3... vs. X > scroll, scroll, scroll, loop, scroll, scroll, scroll back > Z > 1,2,3... of course, smart planning of your several customizable buttons, as mentioned in other reviews, can significantly reduce 'searching', as well.- if you liked the old ""tiled"" style - you can turn that option on (and it's better-looking now). But, once you choose one of 6 main categories, you're right back into the default a6000 menu. I do kinda like this option (it's pretty); however, with the other option, it seems to remember what setting you were on and returns to it, after you leave the menu. I did not see an option to customize this behavior, as I've seen in other cameras. I'm ok with it returning to last point, as navigating the tabs in order to change other settings is fairly easy.- the 'descriptions' of the mode-dial modes all now have a background image, depicting an example of what each might be used for (waterfalls for shutter priority, fireworks for manual, etc). This makes it a bit easier to remember, and maybe even use, for beginning enthusiasts, but can also make the text a bit harder to read.- the SCN modes are all the same, but the animated on-screen 'dial' is on the left now, (rather than on the right, as with the NEX-6). There are also navigation choices on the bottom, which the NEX-6 didn't have (self-explanatory, but still helpful to have). In addition, the selection of SCN modes rolls in the opposite direction as what you may be used to on the NEX6 ('right' now goes down the list, instead of selecting up the list). I somewhat prefer the new way, as, for the first 5 modes, the highlight is what moves and not the menu choices, (which got dizzying after a while on the NEX-6). They will eventually scroll on the a6000 as well, however, as you move further down/up the list. They are also in a slightly different order, now. And, while the font size is larger, it seems still hard to read. The background images are mostly the same, but have been ""punched up"" and cropped a bit. My old panasonic was great in this aspect, as it showed a chart of icons that could be quickly navigated via up/down/left/right. If I needed more info/description on a less-used mode, there was a button for that. Otherwise, I had a handy, easy chart that allowed me to find what I needed quickly (icons always in the same place), and i could discover new ones, along the way. Sony needs an update here, as there are many fewer icons and much more confusion. I'd welcome a fix to this in a Firmware update (with the option to keep it the old way, for those who've gotten used to it).So, despite the nits I've picked above, I plan to keep this camera as the ""important"" specs far outweigh these little issues listed. If they'd kept some of the ergonomics from the NEX-6 (not all, but some) and thought out a few things a little better, it'd be a 5-star camera. But, if it takes excellent pics and checks all your boxes, then maybe it WILL be a 5-star camera for you!I rely on reviews to help me make buying decisions.

"Bought this after learning about BPA in recycled TP (toilet paper). Took a leap of faith and I'm glad I did.This TP is soft, fairly strong, doesn't fall apart (too much) when wet (we sometimes use it with a bidet), and the cores seem significantly stronger than other TPs I've tried (great for preventing floppy rolls and, when empty, for crafts; personally, I donate my cores to a friend's gerbils; she says it takes them longer to chew through them, than other cores). Kora claims it to be elemental chlorine free, which is also important to me (note: as answered via Amazon Questions, but this is NOT listed on their packaging). I also like that it's not individually wrapped (the outer wrapper is a thicker plastic, which has a plain recycling symbol on it). And, they seem to be customer-service oriented. That's good, and certainly unusual for a TP company! They've sent me correspondence via email and post and I've read their answers to other Amazon users' questions on this TP.2015-04 UPDATE on previous review:This TP is NOW 5-STAR TP! It was out of stock for a short while then when my next order arrived, it seemed like they had improved on most of the ""nits"" I picked in my previous review - yay!! Kora, if you took note, so have I! (& thanks for the holiday card last year) The perforation now tears properly, and the core is slightly shorter in length (by a mm or so?), allowing for a more suitable fit in my holder (again, depending on your holder, might not be an issue for you). It rarely (if ever) falls off my holder now, and I don't have shredded sheets from bad perf's. And, sometimes, the sticker is fully on one sheet, with the first sheet being ""impressed"" to the next layer and not glued (again, yay!) The sheets work great in their wiping - soft but not linty at all, and smooth but still durable enough for a more aggressive wipe.This is EXCELLENT TP. I never cared about TP much before, but now, I can't imagine life without Kora! And, yes, I even travel with it!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!-------------------------------------------------------------------------PREVIOUS REVIEW - NOW UPDATED:This is not quite 5-star TP, just yet. Nits:- the perforation isn't great, so if you're not focusing on what you're doing, you often get a shredded sheet or two in your hand and also left on the roll after you tug. I think the problem is that the blade-space-blade-space setting allows for a touch too much TP to be left in the non-cut areas, and, due to its strength, this prevents a clean tear. I think I'd prefer a dot-dot-dot... style of perforation for this strength of paper. Regardless, if you focus (or have a ""grippy"" or euro-flap holder, this might not be an issue for you).- the roll is a tad longer (wider?) than other TP I've tried. And, most of my Kora rolls have been a bit too wide to fit in my preferred dispenser (so they sit kind of cock-eyed, and the sheets get a bit crinkled near the center). No other TP I've used in the 5 years I've had the holder has been too wide (even, bulk-packs/commercial-style papers),- add those two together (imperfect perforation + too-wide roll) and you get a lot of fumbling with the roll and a lot of it falling off the holder. This happens 70-80% of the time, i.e. much more often than not. (I despise the spring-loaded holders, so I use a double-prong ""open"" style holder, which has never been a problem in all my other years of use). Making sure it doesn't do that requires too much thinking on my part, when I'm busy thinking about other, more important things (like checking AMZ GBD).- they use a sticker on the beginning of the roll (and a bit of a fold/crimp), in place of the ""typical"" glue line on the first sheet. (I believe older rolls may have had both the sticker AND the glue). The sticker is cute, but leads to more shredded sheets. Not sure if the sticker is considered flushable, etc. I'd rather they use a paper/flushable/tearable/perforated sticker, that might have less of a destructive effect on the surrounding sheet. Not a huge problem, but an annoyance with each new roll, none-the-less. As an aside, I've gotten some rolls that do NOT have the glue on the last sheet, either. The paper is just kind of folded over itself and the core. I MUCH prefer this as it always bothered me to have shredded sheets at the end (and my donated cores are now also cleaner, for the gerbils). So, THANK YOU, Kora!- the bunny is both cute and a little creepy (and, I generally like bunnies). Not sure what the purpose is, I guess to convey softness?- this is personal preference, but i do prefer a ""core-less"" TP where the sheets just roll into their own small roll where the core would be. I'm glad I can make my friend's gerbils happy with the cardboard cores; however, I think it might be more eco-friendly for manufacturers to eschew the core altogether (at least, offering core-less or small-core as an alternative would be nice).Despite these ""nits"", this is still our household's preferred TP (as of this review). Thanks, Kora, for making a ""much better than average"" tree-free TP! (and, if you're reading this, take note!)Disclaimer: a few months ago, the company did send me an envelope with a nominal *$'s GC, and a letter welcoming a review. While I write reviews for my own personal pleasure, and to help ""give back"" to the review community, I thought it was a nice gesture that they'd sent me a letter and a thank you gift. I was planning on writing a review, anyway, and I don't go to *$'s. Plus, I lost the card (it's been a crazy few months). If I find it, I'll give it to a friend in need of a latte, along with a roll of this pretty great TP (I hear that coffee makes you poo).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"Thinking of using this and switching from fish-eye effect to zoomed-in ""straight"" horizons? Learn from my mistake...Ok, so I probably should have known better. Cheap equipment = cheap tricks. I was trying to take a shortcut and I'd read that if you zoom in a bit with this ""converter"", then the distortion (curve) decreases. Lots of reviews said it was sharp and clean, so I thought it would be perfect for my needs.I went to New Zealand, yes, THE gorgeous New Zealand and had this converter on most of the time (fish-eye style). I figured big landscapes = fisheye, and I zoomed in when I needed a straighter horizon. I was in a rush before the trip and didn't test images on my hi-res monitor, nor did I do thorough testing during the trip. BIG MISTAKE!This thing is fun; however, the images are often washed out, soft at best and more-often-than not... blurry (especially around the edges), and I usually got a halo effect, chromatic aberrations (very noticeable red and blue fringing on certain outlines in the image), and lots of lens flare (which was pretty cool, sometimes). I was using a size adapter for my Sony NEX-6 w/kit lens - yes, I know the kit lens is carp. ;) Sidenote: I originally purchased this for my Panasonic FZ-150 (& FZ-200, which I later returned). I then wanted an increase in image quality, so I bought a NEX6, instead and decided to keep the fisheye for fun and buy an adapter for the NEX6 kit lens.80% (or more) of my images shot with this converter are unusable (as in, already deleted). 10% are passable. 10% are quite cool. (I'm even being generous with that last figure). I mostly used it with the fish-eye setup and not just the macro (which always seemed to be blurry; but I didn't really fuss with it a whole lot).Upon my return home, I excitedly began to review my 2,000 ""kept"" photos. So many were terrible that I initially thought my camera had broken, or that I'd suddenly become an awful photographer (I'm no expert, but I've gotten some pretty good images before!), or that I was hallucinating all the beauteous grandeur that is NZ. Seriously, it's enough to make me a bit teary-eyed.Fortunately, I did take a few ""with & without"" shots (just in case) and whoa! the ""without"" shots are FAR superior. Examples posted in image gallery (as of right now, they start at image 36 - four NZ landscapes showing difference with/without, and two showing better use of fisheye, its intended purpose). For some reason, not all are showing, despite my attempt to upload them a few times; but, there are enough for you to get the idea. And, yes, I kept the converter clean throughout the trip (other than just after the waterfall).If I had it to do all over again: 1. I'd test my equipment before I leave - duh! and, 2. I'd rely on the ""without"" setup 90% of the time and only use the ""with"" setup for a few select shots where the full benefit of a fisheye is needed. (and, sharpness is not as high of a priority).New shooters, learn from my mistake. This thing can be pretty cool, but despite the ""HD2"" branding and claims of sharpness, you will risk the integrity of your images if you rely on this too much. Have fun with it, but take it off for anything really needing sharp edges, or a clean and balanced profile. I realize the responsibility for many of my unusable NZ pics mostly lies in my lack of pre-trip testing, and that this is not ""pro"" glass, but, my images with it were so awfully soft/blurry, fringed, etc, that I do believe it's a 3-star item, regardless.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"I've got a Sony Nex-6 (and, now an a6000) and they both fit great in this case, with the kit zoom lens (or the sony 50mm/SEL50F18). With the Kit lens attached, I can also tuck an extra battery in the front, (wrapped in a plastic baggie, sitting in front of the lens); and there's room to spare in the back, if I wanna put my driv lic or credit cards or some cash behind the flap that covers the LCD screen. The sonys will NOT fit in this Kroo case if you have the Opteka HD2 fisheye attachment on the front of the kit lens - the one I have is  bit too wide to fit in the ""lens section"". (see my review of that accessory, as well as my a6000 review, on their respective product pages).- The inside flap is especially soft on the side that sits against your camera. It is also padded and features slots for cards.- The inside of the case is also velvety-soft and seems to be pretty lint-free.- The ""shell"" is hard enough to withstand most bumps and potential low-to-medium-impact crushes.- I use it both alone, as well as stored, lens down, in my bags (Pacsafe Metrosafe 200 & 250), where I sometimes leave it unzipped for quick access.- The zipper works great: smooth action along the trail, and the grippie pulls are a nice touch.- I like the green strip (kind of a deep jade-color?) The blue's also very nice. Both are pretty true to my computer screen.- Although it had two D-rings for a strap, I don't have a strap on it, because I just let my camera wrist strap (polaroid cushioned strap), peek out in-between the two zippers for easy access. The zipper holds tight against it, but I don't go swinging it around, either.- There's a tightly-attached, thick belt loop thingie on the back, so you can somewhat secure it to various items, if you'd like. My Nokia e72 and also iPod Touch and Samsung Galaxy MP3 device fit in there, snugly (not all at the same time, of course), if I need a quick spot to stash them.- There's a loop-fabric-covered foam 'block' that can be affixed in a few places, via velcro/hook & loop, to stabilize the camera in the case. I have it on the side of the camera, opposite the hand grip, to balance the structure on that side. Works great with the NEX-6 or a6000.I do wish they made a somewhat smaller case that fit the NEX-6 / a6000 more snugly, but then they might have to make it much more expensive, as it would be a specialty item and not a generic ""system camera"" item, that fits several brands/models. (I'd own two sizes, depending on which bag I had that day). For what it claims to be, it earns 5 stars. It seems to be well-made, with properly aligned seams, and materials and workmanship of reasonably high quality. I thank the person who returned theirs, so I could buy one used.Cameras are big investments (of money and time to research the best for your needs), protect them as best you can.This Kroo case works great for my needs!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"An adapter that doesn't really ""adapt""?? I bought this because my fiancee really enjoys the Ettore squeegee/scrubbers I gave him, and wants to use them with his favorite extension pole (one-handed operation, lightweight, sturdy, standard threading for other uses on the job, etc). The Ettore pieces fit over a ""pole with a button"" for security. His pole has the standard ""screw-on top"". I thought this ""adapter"" by Ettore would fit into their pieces securely. It does not. As the other reviewer pointed out, they just get shoved on top of this piece, which then potentially allows them to spin around, during use.ETTORE: please manufacture a tip like this, but that has the little buttons. I paid over $8 and would have kept this silly piece of plastic if it worked properly and had the buttons that are a great feature, on your products. Surely, it can't cost too much more to add a little spring-loaded button mechanism inside.Currently, my guy is using an old wooden pole, jammed into the attachments. The wooden pole then has the standard screw receptacle, for when he needs his extension pole. We have considered drilling a hole in this plastic adapter and attaching a screw through the hole, but are concerned it may split. Plus, why would we need to ""rig"" something that is specifically manufactured to be an adapter??I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"I didn't buy this for use solely as a camera case. In fact, I intended to use it as my purse-wallet (cash, ATM/CCs, IDs, phone or ipod, misc scraps of paper/biz cards). I often don't need a full-sized purse, but do need to carry a few essentials, so I like to have something small and light I can grab when I run out of the house. With the hard side, I know my phone/ipod has an extra layer of protection. And, the rest is roomy enough for 10 or so cards/papers.The wrist strap is nice, for convenience. It is flat and very silky soft. I found it to be too big to be secure, so I looped a knot in it, 2/3 down. Attachments seem secure enough for lightweight cargo. Clip allows for removal and replacement/upgrade, if desired.The inside is nice, the zipper is fine, the zipper pull is comfortable, handy, and matches the color.My main problem with this handy and otherwise cute case is the color. I bought the ""green"". It's really awful (looks like my monitor's rendition of product photo, but a little ""darker"" & blah). I am normally a fan of teals/aquas/blue-greens/greens/sages and the like and I mostly bought this for the color, but it looked dingy as soon as I took it out of the packaging. It's too ""pretty"" to be solely utilitarian-looking, and too dingy-looking to be pretty. Plus, within a day or two, it got a small droplet of water splashed on it and it immediately turned dark and now looks like a food stain. Ew.Comparatively, it is my least favorite looking case and it's almost embarrassing to carry around. Not a pleasant color at all. YMMV, but I'm still on the search for a better-looking one. Size and other functions/features are fine.In case you are wondering, it fits a 4th generation ipod (with incipio case) and a nokia e72.

"I used this on a month-long trip to Europe. [2015 UPDATE: and another month-long trip to India, as well as several trips in-between]. I knew I'd be staying with host families (and some hotels) and I was unsure if I'd be bothered by the chemicals they use in their laundry, so I did a lot of research and decided to buy this, just in case.Here's my EXPERIENCE, including several TIPS I learned from my use:- Yes, i often encountered sheets with heavy fragrances (detergent, fabric softener, and even linen sprays) - this Cocoon helped to ""protect"" me from direct contact, and may help others with a ""super sniffer"" or those with MCS.- I also encountered ""unchanged"" sheets (indicative of the short body hairs and other human lint still on the bed) - this Cocoon helped to ""protect"" me from picking up any foreign hairs, lint, body oils/sprays/odors (etc??) while I slept. (does this really matter? who knows, but it helps ME sleep better, and may help those with OCD). Some reviewers claimed the Cocoon protected them from bugs - I cannot attest to this other than I received no bites during the sleeping times of my travels. There may have simply been no bugs.- I prefer to sleep unclothed, and I felt more comfortable doing this in ""my"" cocoon, than on someone else's sheets (both for my sake, AND for theirs).- I bought the largest size (94x46), allowing for some shrinkage (it's cotton, after all) and because I prefer a roomy sack in which to sleep - it packs up fairly small, but does take up a bit of space (like that of a thin sweatshirt or pair of jeans?). I'll leave something else home (spare pj's?) so I can have room for my Cocoon. I found the size to be just right for me and I never felt restricted.- For sleeping on a twin bed, i tucked the ""pillow cover"" part under, around the mattress (like a fitted sheet), then i straightened the bottom of the cocoon out and it was like a normal sheet set-up and stayed tight during my 4 or 5-night stays. (for larger mattresses, you could also tuck just one corner. This will stay, but obviously not as securely as tucking both corners). I always travel with my own small kapok pillow & case, so i used that for my neck and i tucked the pillow my hosts provided to me, under the cocoon, under my knees, as a bolster. Slept great!- As much as I usually prefer unbleached/undyed, I'm glad I bought a colored one - this helped remind me to pack it up and take it home or to the next stop with me (especially during some frantic mornings). And, also prevented housekeepers from mistakenly gathering it up with the rest of their linens. I bought a color I like, which adds a bit to the ""comforts of home"" factor. Thank you to the person who returned it, so that I could buy it used and save a little $ for my travels!IDEAS:(i) - I plan to use this on top of my Byer of Maine Easy Cot (which is awesome, BTW), for hot-weather camping and overnight homestays. Maybe I'll pair it with a small fleece throw for an added touch of comfort or chilly nights (I sleep hot). [2015 UPDATE: yep, that was a good idea - have done this several times](i) - I recently bought a 25"" wide ALPS Mountaineering Comfort Series Air Pad and plan to slip the pillow pocket of the Cocoon over that (and, when paired with the cot, the top of that, too) for even more comfort. [2015 UPDATE: another good idea, implemented with success](i) - I might try to use this with my hammock, too (i think I'll get in the Cocoon first, tho!).(i) - When I need to use a sleeping bag, I will use this Cocoon as a liner, to add a touch of warmth (and the flexibility to ""pop the top"" of my bag open if it's too warm); this will also help keep my bag cleaner and will aid in cleaning. Also, will allow me to choose a bag without being restricted to whether the inside fabric is cotton or nylon (I'm picky about that and now, how it feels won't matter as much as other factors). I might just pair it with a fleece sleepsack/sleeping bag for warm-weather camping.(i) - I'm considering buying or making a second one for guests, as we have a comfy couch and using this Cocoon would prevent the difficulties encountered when trying to ""sheet up"" the couch for overnight sleeping.WISHES:- that it was certified organic cotton- that it was less money (kinda pricey for what is essentially a folded flat sheet with a few extra seams, and a bag)- that it was a bit softer (it's not scratchy, but not quite as ""worn-in"" as my soft organic sheets at home)- that it had an opening on both sides (because of the way I use the pillow pocket, it's not really ""ambidextrous"", but it is not impossible to slide into, if the opening happens to be on the ""wall side"")- that the velcro didn't catch on my hair (minor complaint, I might replace with a magnet, swap the hook side to the loop side and vice-versa, or remove it entirely, as it does collect some lint) [2015 UPDATE: I finally just snipped the threads that (loosely) held the velcro on. MUCH better!]- that the stuff sack was attached (like a flap you fold the sheet into, just less for me to have to keep track of) {2015 UPDATE: um, surely, it's around here, somewhere...]- that there was an easy way to open one side and the bottom to ""pair"" it with another travelsheet (for those times when travelling with a snuggle/cuddle-partner)The Cocoon washes well in my Maytag Front Loader (using baking soda, soap nuts, & white vinegar) & dries in my dryer (using wool balls and EO). It does wrinkle a little bit if I don't remove promptly, but I don't really care about that sort of thing. I also considered a silk one (real silk, not icky silk-like polyester), but decided the cotton was best for me. I sleep on cotton at home (always organic) and, I kinda feel bad for the little silkworms who are sacrificed for our comfort.I will continue to use it and wash it (in the hopes it gets softer). If it starts to break down, or I need to replace it, I might try to fashion my own with an old, comfy, organic sheet from my linen closet. This is certainly possible, but for my first travel sheet, due to time and sewing space restrictions, I chose to purchase a ""pre-made"" one. [2015 UPDATE: have used (& washed) it dozens of times, on many travels, and it shows no negative signs of wear and is soft enough to be totally comfortable - zzzzz....]I highly recommend all frequent travelers (especially couchsurfers/hostellers...) consider some travel sheet option (there are many out there, so decide which is best for you based on size needs - both unfolded and packed up; material - not all ""silk"" ones are actually silk; price; durability/reviews; and, if it matters, color). I am very happy with my decision to purchase and travel with this sheet, even if I have to mod it a bit for my specific preferences. While it gives ME comfort for the reasons listed above, I also like that my hosts have fewer additional housekeeping duties, due to my stay (I also bring my own towel).I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"I have several other MH Safe-er products and have been happy with the suction. So, when needing a hook for the shower, I thought this might be a good option. I am happy to report that I was correct :)This is a sturdy soap dish, with small linear slots for drainage. Holds my man's natural round soap that's a little too big to fit in other dishes.It will also very nicely hold your razor (great for mid-shave, when you need to set your razor somewhere and lather up the other leg/armpit...) Check out these razors, they fit well and are good for the earth Recyclable Razor w/ 2 Triple Blade Cartridges 1 Count (and no animal testing!)And, I use the other side to hold my fiancee's washcloth (he lets it dry in the shower before tossing in the hamper).As with the other MH products, this must be mounted on a completely smooth & dry surface (no grout lines or textures). I ""manually"" push the suction cup in and THEN flip the grey switch. They always hold great for me.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"Travel power can be confusing, and getting it wrong can potentially be dangerous, even if just to your devices. (Note: if you don't know the difference between ""input voltage"" and ""plug type"", please read the Travel Power info at the bottom. It is very important.)With regard to these specific adapters, I was recently in Italy for 30 days, stayed in 5 different hotels and 5 different homes - some old and some new. These adapters worked everywhere I tried them. (EDIT 2014: I later bought the Australia/China Type I and used them in New Zealand - same positive experience, but mainly used in an RV/Campervan).The receptacles (USA, anyway) are tight enough so plugs do not fall out of them, but not overly so (so you can still pull your plugs out!).The added benefit that I didn't read (realize?) until I received them was that you can actually plug two devices in at one time (but only one 3-prong at a time & as a safety precaution, don't daisy-chain them). The 3-prong goes into the ""holed"" side you can see in the photo, and the two prong would go into the side you cannot see (also has holes) - so, if there's just one outlet at the bedside, you can charge your phone/tablet while also leaving the lamp plugged in (just remember to take it with you when you leave - the adapter, not the lamp).If you think you will only need one, then bring two. That way you will have a back-up in case you lose one/break one/lend one out. I figured two would be good, so I brought three. It worked out, as I did lend one out and I was able to keep one in my purse and one in my suitcase - for easy access.I used these with polarized, non-polarized, & 3-prong USA plugs (camera battery, phone, ipod, laptop, usb-block, various lamps), plugged into various 3-prong italian outlets.It was nice to have the added benefit of the second-device feature, but I would have also preferred these plugs be white, as they would be easier to find in my bag (and blend into the walls better - most were white). {The product photo is currently showing a white plug, which is the color I expected to receive}. (EDIT, 2014: mine came black)EDIT 2015, with TIPS on Travel Power:Many people I talk to about this subject don't know what to look for and often, they end up spending more than they really need to. So, I'm augmenting my review with a basic overview of what's needed for travel power purposes. If you don't already know the difference between plug and voltage converters, check out the info below. This is what I tell my peeps when they travel.You'll need to consider two things when it comes to travel power: 1. Shape and 2. Voltage1. ShapeIf your home-country-shaped plugs are different than your destination-country-shaped plugs, you'll have to buy the plug adapters that convert them. They are usually a ""Type"", like these Italian Type-L plugs. (you can find the specifics of your countries with a google search). Many countries share a type, so if you are traveling to more than one country, you might get lucky with one type (or have a type already from another trip that works for a different trip). Be sure to buy an adapter that has the ""male"" type/shape of your destination, and the ""female"" of your home country (if you don't know what that means, just liken them to basic 'human genital anatomy'). Some, like these, have multiple ""female"" type options. And, others have multiple ""male"" type options, using a variety of sliders. The simplest version of these plugs (one type to one other type) are usually pretty inexpensive (US $2-20), depending on the Type and the supplier. The grounded and also the multi-type versions are usually on the mid-to-higher end of that cost spectrum. Even more expensive, are some that have the added benefit of also claiming to have surge protection. I bought one of these for India, due to their high incidence of power issues.2. VoltageYou'll have to check the typical outlet voltage for the country(-ies) you're visiting and compare that to your home country to know if you'll need to consider voltage conversion while you're on your trip. Again, a simple google search (or peek at the respective travel books) will give you this info. You're generally looking for numbers like 100V, 110V, 220V, 240V, etc.If they differ, you usually have two options:A. Buy a converter.I've never bought one, but I've seen them in the usual places, including here on Amazon, as well as the ""Travel"" aisles in Target, Walmart, etc. Airports and travel stores also usually have them.B. Use / Buy ""switching"" or universal adapters for your electronics.Most actually already come with them, especially many phones, laptops, and mobile devices. In addition, USB-powered chargers are usually (if not always) universal. This is based on my experience, I am not an expert. So, before you spend money on a converter (that will take up precious space and weight in your luggage), check the very, very, very fine print on the wall plugs/brick adapters of your devices for writing that says something like ""Input: 100-240V"". See photos for what to look for. If the country(-ies) you are visiting are within that range (which you'll know from that google search), then you don't need a voltage adapter, just a ""shape / outlet"" adapter. Yay for $avings!Most of the stories I've heard about travelers blowing outlets and whatnot involve heating devices such as curling irons or hair dryers. I don't travel with those, but I do know that they make ""travel"" ones that, in addition to folding or being smaller, also usually have a ""voltage switching"" option. With mobile phones and the smaller devices, this switching is usually done automatically. With these heating devices, the switching may need to be done manually, so be SURE to double-check that for yourself or others in your party, in order to prevent a dangerous or at least embarrassing situation.Of course, your third option would be to ""unplug"" completely and travel like it's 1985. Radical!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"Many others have detailed the benefits of this bottle. After 50 days of constant use, here's MY glowing testimonial.MY USE:Initially, 30 days of trekking around Italy. 15-hour days. Bedside use at night. Hung by the clip from my bag the whole time. Bouncing around. In the sun and the rain, hot and cold, various altitudes (we also went to Switzerland). It survived four airplane flights, several underground/metro rides, four funicular rides, a ferryboat ride, and dozens of quick change car rides, and was: plopped on the floor several times, tossed on the bed A LOT, partially sat on a few times, smooshed a bunch, clipped and unclipped over a dozen times a day, filled and refilled too many times to count. Oh, and still going strong with daily use back home, so a total of 50 days STRAIGHT in constant use. I wouldn't say that I abused the bottle, but I definitely know I USED the bonkers out of it!MY PROFILE:I get dehydrated easily and quickly, especially in warm weather (I sweat a lot), so I am a ""water carrier"" - I like (need?) to have water with me at all times and I cannot stand disposable bottles (or 'manufactured' spring water). I was getting ready for a 30-day trip to Italy when I found these bottles (I didn't care that it made me ""look like an American"" - I can move past that). I ordered one (color:blue/water) for next-day air, the day before I left. I had high hopes. I normally drink highly-filtered tap water from a glass bottle (we have a whole-house system with 5 different filtration stages). I knew that in Italy, this would not generally be the case, but I still wanted clean water, on demand, wherever I went (without always buying it or searching for it). Oh, and the bottle had to be lightweight and easy to carry. Yes, I know, first world problems.I almost brought my own glass bottle, then I almost bought the Sport Berkey, the GoBerkey, a Katadyn... (I know, overkill) - This Vapur bottle fit the bill perfectly and delivered on that promise FAR better than I ever imagined!MY EXPERIENCE:- the size was perfect for a day of walking around/light hiking, and sometimes, I only filled it halfway, pushed the air out, folded it in half, and stuffed it in my pacsafe metro 200 bag = awesome!- the clip fit around my pacsafe strap, as well as other various anchors, and was comfortable and durable to carry on my fingers- the lid stayed shut (except one freaky time at an espresso bar, but I quickly realized it was open and only a little water spilled on the floor - i had clipped it funny a few minutes before that and didn't clip it like that again and it never opened accidentally again)- when shut, it never spilled or leaked- it stands up, even with a small amount of water on a semi-level surface - great for refilling from a jug, on the go- the plastic was durable, never cracked, leaked, etc. and still going strong- the ""pour"" opening was big enough for filling (discreetly, from water bottles in restaurants {water was always served from new bottles, so I would take the ""leftover water"", like ya do with a 'doggie bag'}; in hotel bathroom sinks, etc), and for cleaning (used a few drops of Dr Bronner's Peppermint - LOVE that stuff!)- the ""drink"" opening was big enough for a good gulp, but small enough that it doesn't spill all over (can't stand big ""drink"" openings)- while the rest of my team foraged for a sip of refreshing water on every excursion, several times a day (all that wine & coffee makes ya thirsty!), I was forever confident in my hydration supply and only needed a trip to the nearest sink every so often when I was close to empty - my well never ran dryOk, here's the bizarre part...I have a very, very sensitive palate (among other senses) and I am very picky about my water (among other things). No, that's not the bizarre part. I had been to Italy twice before and knew that water suited to my taste would be challenging to find (hence the search for filters). As long as the BOTTLE itself didn't give off a taste (or odor), I thought, ""it's only 30 days, I can deal with off-tasting water"" (yes, i know, 1st world problems). In fact, taste is one of the main reasons I drink from glass at home. SO, I made sure to test the Vapur in the few hours I had between delivery and flight and it tasted fine (no plastic taste), so I figured that part would be ok. What I didn't expect is for the bottle to actually make the water taste BETTER. Yes, I know, freaky. I don't know why, but water in my Vapur tastes better coming out than going in. Once I realized it, I tested it several times, with water from several different ""sources"" (bottle, cold, warm, tap, hotel bathroom sink {ew}) and every time, the water was DELICIOUS coming back out! (note: I always drink 'naturale/senza gas/uncarbonated/still water - italy always offers water drinkers both kinds). This made me so happy (seriously happy)!! I can't explain it, and I'm not planning on going to a lab with it, but I wanted to share my experience to help ease concern of any ""bottle"" taste-tainting. YMMV, and your bottle may not improve the flavor of water, but I'm so happy mine did! In fact, I'm going to have a sip now, to celebrate!UPDATE (2015-04):So, I've taken a Vapur bottle on every trip since I bought my first one. I usually treat myself to a new one for each trip. This helps further ensure that it won't break during the trip, and it's a nice pre-trip treat to have a fresh water bottle. Plus, they're not super-expensive and I sometimes get lazy after a trip and don't always unpack them or wash them out right away - I really hate housework. Anyway, I've also tried two filters available for water bottles: the Vapur Charcoal Bag, and the ""interesting-looking"" Charcoal Stick. I like both of them, although the Vapur bag is less ""dangerous"" without the sharper edges of the stick and it certainly gets less curious looks. The stick looks like a piece of poo bobbing around in your water ""bag"". I think it's funny, but not great for professional meetings where you can't explain to everyone what it is. I recently went to India and of course, brought a Vapur bottle, along with a few Vapur filters (they don't really filter the water, just claim to help it taste a little better). Since I wasn't sure of the ""water situation"" - I even brought a Sawyer Filter and SteriPen, just in case - I thought the filters would be smart, too. I like to be uber-prepared, so I also brought a Platypus flexible bottle; but, clean water in it (from my multi-filtered tap at home) tasted like a beach ball, so I never used it in India - may have been due to the SteriPen? Anyway, in India, we were advised to not even brush our teeth with the water that came from the faucet, which meant I couldn't really wash the bottle with that water and then fill it with clean water and confidently drink it. I wasn't necessarily fearful of the ""reaction"" (if it's just me, I consider it a ""cleansing""); however, I didn't want to be uncomfortable or even anxious, and possibly affect my traveling companion's enjoyment of the trip, therefore, I was extra cautious. Which meant I couldn't really wash the bottle out as much as I'd have liked to, for the whole month I was in India. I did wash the mouthpiece a few times, using bottled water, and I rinsed it with bottled water and a few drops of Dr. Bronner's once or twice, but otherwise, I just kept a check on it and actually, it didn't get funky at all. I used it everyday, including crammed into auto rickshaws and cars, carried on EIGHT flights, and again, it got bumped, dropped, smooshed, twisted, filled/refilled, rolled... and I had ZERO problems with it. Another stellar experience with the Vapur bottle! Thank you, Vapur!!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I thank the other reviewers who informed my decision to buy this product and I hope this review helped you, too :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUOGSPTTMTTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HRISF2#wasThisHelpful","R3NUOGSPTTMTTK","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow - somebody really thought about the details when designing this hat!! I bought this (in aqua), along with the Adventure Hat by Sunday Afternoon Hats - in medium cream. (Details on both hats, below)I liked both hats, but I ended up giving the cream Sunday Afternoons (hereafter: SA) hat to my father and never had a chance to wear it out of the house, myself. (He needed a hat just like it and he saw mine when he came over for Father's Day; he chose the SA cream hat over this Tuga aqua hat, simply due to his color preference). I have included SA features below, where memory serves, for those who may also be comparison shopping.*FIT/SIZING*- I found the Tuga to be a bit more tight-fitting, circumference-wise, than the medium SA one, but not totally unwearably-so. Even with the barrel-clasp loosened all the way, this still stays snug on my head on a windy day (on a jetty). The size is One Size (listed as: 22.5"")... My head is 22"" (where the hat sits), but I believe that this hat would be uncomfortably tight for anyone with even a slightly larger head, as, on certain days, I hesitate to wear it, due to the very tight fit (I'm hoping it stretches out a bit). Your preferences/hat cut may be different, however. Note to Tuga: I wish the band was looser/larger; there is plenty of adjustment available in the barrel clip - I'd rather use that a bit more functionally than have the hat be so snug all of the time. THEN, it would be a 5-STAR hat!*WANT JUST A FEW DETAILS?*If you only were curious about the fit and don't need a lot of details on the hat(s), skip below to the section you need, or the SUMMARY at the bottom. For those in search of specifics, here ya go, from hat top to flap bottom... Features-wise, this Tuga hat has a lot to offer. To expand on the details in the listing, here are my observations of the functional features:*CROWN*- White mesh fabric lines the entire inside of the cap part, with sporty baseball-cap-style seaming, which gives a nice ""sloped-domed"" crown fit. -- I think the SA just had the solid fabric.*VENTING*- While the front and rear of the cap part is one layer of solid fabric over the white mesh, the two sides are ""triple"" vented (1. three layers of three different types of white mesh; 2. under a 3/4 attached solid shading fabric (like a rain-fly on a tent); 3. which also has two riveted metal mesh vents on each side - wow! -- SA was just one layer of fabric all-around (solid and, on the sides, mesh).*ADJUSTABLE FIT CORD*- There is a barrel-slider on the back (with securing, adjustable, sprocketed end-nut) to further tighten the hat (or hang it on a hook) - the cording is braided black shiny something (of medium quality) and is strung through two holes reinforced inside and outside, with color-matched thread. -- SA hat had a nicer-looking flat belted-style contraption for this purpose, it seemed less-easily adjusted; functionality undetermined.- Inside the hat, this adjustable fit cord is then strung through two roomy color-matched loops on the underneath of the sweatband and the ends are heat-sealed and then stitched to the sweat band, using white thread. Mine are stitched very unevenly on the band, but I don't use the cord much, anyway. This ""mounting"" makes it easy to reinforce, remove, replace, etc., if desired.*SWEATBAND/ELASTIC*- There is 1"" thick elastic in the back, and, (other than that 2-3"" {unstretched-stretched} of elastic), plush, soft white terry fabric lines the entire inner circumference of the ""sweat band"" area. This is only secured along one edge, to allow flexibility (and, a peep at the layers underneath). Note to Tuga: The elastic is nice, but I would have preferred a ""ponytail"" hole in this spot, instead (or, in addition to). -- The SA hat sweatband was not terry, but a lightweight unwoven material. Not offensive, but not as plush as the Tuga; and, possibly allowing ""sweat-through"" for heavy forehead sweaters, especially along the unprotected ""sides"", as the SA sweatband is more of a sweat patch, covering only the forehead area.*FRONT BRIM*- There is a color-matched 3"" brim around the front that makes up almost exactly half of the hat (back flap is the other half). This half-brim design makes it easier to ride in a car (maybe not safe if you're the driver, tho!), or on a train/bus/amusement ride while wearing the hat. A full-circumference brimmed hat would restrict this. The brim is stiff enough to not flop down in your face, yet flexible enough to be comfortable and roll down for packing. It seems to have a 1/8"" foam core, with the color-matched nylon fabric on top and underneath. My hat's brim has 11 seams running around it, to keep the layers (foam/fabric...) together. These seams are not perfectly even, but not distractingly crooked, either. -- The SA hat also had a half brim/half flap design and the brim (equally firm/flexible) had much fewer seams, which were almost perfectly aligned (doesn't affect use, though). I will point out that I quickly noticed the SA hat brim to be clearly creased in several areas (where it had been bent?). This was only with very light, indoor use and I kept it flat in the bag most of the time. The Tuga hat got the same initial treatment, and, I have since taken it on two full-day excursions (packing, unpacking, wearing, rolling, tossing, cramming, etc.); however, the brim shows no defined creases.*CHIN STRAP*- There is a removable chin strap (matching fabric, attaches to two hat color-matched loops on either side of the wearer's face, under the hat's brim, via two black, swivel, squeeze clips attached to the ends of the strap). The swivel, squeeze clips MAY catch on loose/exposed hair, on a windy day (untested). The cord has a barrel clip for adjustment and it can also be removed, one side at a time, and possibly used in alternate ways (add a badge-style clip and attach to shirt for when back attachment is holding up the flap? Attach to small clutch purse for matching hat/bag accessory?). Also, see TIP below for storage. -- The SA hat also has a chin strap, but it is permanently secured (and always black or white/cream?).*SHIRT CORD*- There is a ""shirt attachment"" cord originating from underneath the back flap at the rear elastic section, which is made of the same braided black cording, is heat sealed at the end, and simply tied to a metal spring clip (like the kind used for many employee badges). The cord on mine is about 13"", from end to clip, allowing for reasonable range of motion when wearing. You can also clip it to itself, and make a loop for secure hanging/drying. Personally, I removed the front chin strap and use this shirt clip to secure the hat to the back of my shirt. The chin strap will be more secure (like, if you are on a boat or, during a very windy day), but I prefer the back clip for comfort. Although, it may also get caught in long hair.) The clip can easily be replaced with one of your preference (carabiner, spring loop, etc.) if you so choose. The clip and most of the cord can be secured in the zipper pocket when not needed, or, the cord can be cut off entirely, if you think you won't ever need it. -- The SA hat does not have this feature, but it could easily be added by a moderately crafty person.*BACK FLAP*- There is a color-matched back flap for sun protection of the back of the neck and ears. The flap material starts about halfway around the brim, and is about 12.5"" long, from that connection point. More importantly, the flap extends 8.5"" from the bottom of the back elastic area, and the flap is 15"" wide, with rounded corners at the bottom. -- The SA hat has a velcro (hook and loop) patch if you want to flip up the flap. I bought these hats specifically for the flap and don't see myself needing to secure it up. The lack of this feature on the Tuga hat does not bother me. If I really needed to temporarily shorten the flap (maybe while it was drying & on my head?), I could fold it and secure the clip to the rear adjustment cording to hold it. In fact, I'd much prefer this, to having a velcro patch rub against my hair all day (and, I did not like how the exposed patch looked & I was concerned it would pick up lint in its travels). With the shirt attachment cord in alternate service, I gotta find that chin strap, though, just in case...*ZIPPER POCKET*- There is a ""concealed"" zipper pocket underneath the back flap (5"" opening, estimated 14.5x8.5"" cargo space +/-). The zipper (on mine) is white and the ""invisible"" style (although, here, you can see there is a zipper there, but the teeth are covered by fabric) - this is a smart design choice, as the ""invisible"" zipper fabric prevents the teeth from catching on my hair. Yay! This zipper pocket makes the back flap two layers (more function, less ventilation) -- The SA hat does not have this zipper feature, yet, I do think it has two layers of fabric, so, if desperate, you might be able to craft a pocket with a pair of scissors and some duct tape...**TIPS/OTHER:- If you do remove the Chin Strap, it might be a good idea to store it in the rear zipper pocket (I may have already lost mine...)- I've read that the back zipper pocket is a good place for ice cubes or a water bottle on a hot day (haven't tried it myself, but I can confirm that you can fit a ""standard"" 20oz plastic water bottle or an 18oz glass Aquasana bottle in the pocket - zipped). I would be very cautious about putting a bottle in there (especially if in any moving vehicle), and a half-full plastic bottle might be a smarter choice than glass. Avoid any additional weight if you have neck/shoulder/spine problems, etc.- You might also be able to stuff a t-shirt, etc. in the zipper pocket, to use as a secured pillow, for long rides. Sun protection AND comfort = a nice nap!- Back flap can be secured ""up"" by simply using the shirt cord (no velcro needed). See BACK FLAP section above for details.- TAG Reads: Cold Water Wash - Tumble Dry Low Heat - Do not Wring.

It is fairly true to the color my monitor shows, maybe ever-so slightly darker (due to LCD light), but still quite vibrant. It is definitely a ""look at me hat"" in this color, and doesn't match every outfit. While there are certainly places you wouldn't wear it, and many might find it too ""over the top"" even for the beach or pool, I think it's fun and it makes me happy to wear it. I like seeing the color underneath the brim (the SA hat had a darker, color-coordinated color under the brim, which is also nice, for reducing sun glare).**Untested:-- Does it float? Never tried, but I can see there IS foam in the full length of the brim, so, maybe it does float.-- SPF 50+? I wear sunblock anyway, but I usually sweat it off in a few minutes. I hope this is 50+ (in addition to the ""shade"" factor""), but I have no lab to test. I use more natural sunblock (Badger), but no chemicals/smear is even better.-- Quick Drying? Haven't gotten it wet yet, but fabric seems to be that ""swim shorts"" style that dries fast.-- Long Term Durability/Color-Fastness? Seems like it will hold up pretty well (sans chlorine, of course), only time will tell.*It's just a Hat! Why is this review so long?*I went back-and-forth between this hat, the SA Hat, an LL Bean Hat, and a few other brands, before buying the two I finally settled on. Many of the features I detail in this review were not covered in-depth in the descriptions of the two hats. This being my first purchase of a hat with a back flap, I wasn't sure which features were more important and why. This hat currently only has two other reviews and I wanted to share my experience with other potential buyers. (oh, and I like details)**SUMMARY:**This is a great hat, smartly-designed, quite well made, and definitely full of useful features. It is more ""plush"", more feature-filled, and the brim is potentially more durable (for looks, anyway) than the SA hat I also purchased. The features also make it more substantial-feeling and possibly, a bit heavier on the head. I liked having both of them, in two different colors, as it was hard for me to decide between the two, due to the great features and bright color of this one and the lighter weight and better fit of the other. I plan to buy another lighter-weight cream-colored hat, since my father now owns the SA hat. Due to the snug fit of this hat and the lack of features in the SA hat, I might try a different brand, altogether (or, maybe a parasol). However, if your head is 22"" or less, or you like a snug fit, I highly recommend this Tuga Pacifico hat!I rely on reviews to help me make informed choices. I hope this review helped you! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JU0Z3PRWRW4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005304YG8#wasThisHelpful","R1JU0Z3PRWRW4W","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Man, I really liked this thing! Perfect size, loved the ""use your own bottle"" aspect, and the adjustability was great! I could get saturation on high, or a gentle mist on low (didn't get the sheets all wet AND made the bottle last through the night!).I took this with me to a hotel room one night, too, and it was GREAT!!True, the light is BRIGHT. Too bright for me. Projects cool ""water"" patterns on the ceiling, though! I wrapped the unit in some black tape, and was planning to paint over the LED, but it didn't last that long.I used it happily for about 10 nights and, apparently, the inevitable happened. Same as everyone else: bubbles and blow, but no more vapor. Bummer!Fortunately, Amazon will take the return...but, SOOOO tempted to try again. I see some 5 star reviews, praising its durability. Maybe they have a high failure rate. Maybe I'll get lucky with the next one. If I could find another model, similar to this, with a better record of reliability, I'd take that one.

"My fiancee and I are about 10"" apart in height. In addition, he likes a really a high showerhead and I like a really low showerhead. Our house is new, so the showerhead is pretty high. Add to that, we have only a stand-up shower stall (3/4 the width of a shower/tub combo) in our ""ensuite"", so geometry tells us that I would need to stand quite close to the opposite wall of the shower, in order to get just the right angle.Enter the Mommy's Helper Safer Grip Portable Shower Arm. NOTE: the teal handle is now grey in color. I have ordered two more this week and both arrived with a grey/gray handle. All else seems to be the same.I attached it to the back wall of the shower (NOT the wall where the water comes out), and positioned it lower, to my liking, and VIOLA! The perfect shower height and angle for me!! It even makes my shower feel LARGER, since my elbows are pointing to the far corners, and not sandwiched between the curtain and back wall. I LOVE this item!! When my fiancee showers, he lifts the showerhead from the Helper and puts it up in his giant's-height holder (that came with the house), and when he's done, he puts it back in my ""maria-height"" Helper so it's ready for when I shower. (He's awesome!)I have used this item daily since I purchased it in 2010 (almost 4 years, now!) The Helper has only fallen once in three years, and that was my fault (didn't push hard enough when mounting it), and the showerhead only fell out of the Helper once (again, my fault*).It is IMPORTANT that you follow these basic guidelines:- #1: the Helper must be on a completely smooth & flat surface (we have a one-piece fiberglass surround). It will NOT stay on if the rubber disc is overlapping tiles/grout/textures. Basic physics of suction, NOT a product flaw.- #1a: After installing and moving these a few times, I noticed that they work MUCH better on DRY surfaces. So, install before you start your shower  water (even humid walls are less effective) - you know it's right when you push it a little and it sticks good even before flipping the ""suction switch"".- #2: Keep the showerhead mostly upright. *The time my showerhead fell out was when I had the Helper adjusted so the showerhead was almost prone/level/flat/facing down, whatever you wanna call it. Again, basic physics, not product malfunction.- Other things to consider: if you will be using around children, make sure they do not push on it or the showerhead or otherwise play with it. It could look like a toy to a child who may not understand the consequences of misuse. (the new grey version may reduce the possibility of this, but still...)- Not all showerheads will fit properly. I have tried it with both the Waterpik ECO 563 EcoFlow 5-Mode Water Saving Handheld Shower, Chrome and an older model of the Waterpik VBE-459 EcoFlow Hand Held Showerhead (maybe the 459PB?). The 563 does NOT work well with the Helper, while the 459(ish) works PERFECTLY! The difference is that the 459 has your typical shower collar thingie, but the 563 has a little rubber nub that's supposed to hold it more securely in the holder. Unfortunately, that means it takes up more space in the Helper and does not sit securely. When combined with the stiff hose, it just makes a mess. I love the settings on the 563, but I really should buy a different showerhead for the guest bath. Anyway...if you have a standard shower collar thingie on your handheld shower hose, you should be fine. Maybe test it before you put little ones in there with it, though.- UPDATE: I have decided to swap my hose for a better one (apparently, this is common). I have tried both the Inox Extended Length Stainless Steel Shower Hose - 100 inches (2.54 meters) as well as the Delta 75007 140 60-Inch Stainless Steel Replacement Hose, Chrome; both sit well. Not 100% perfectly, but functionally and 98% well. The metal collar on the Inox seems to be a little narrower (maybe 1-2mm?) in outside girth than the Mommy's Helper Safer Grip PSA, but it sits in there fine. The Delta hose slips in well, but because of it's smooth surface, the showerhead will now swing a little to the most ""gravity-satisfying"" spot; I just have to adjust the MH-SG-PSA angle to get it to ""stop"" where I want. No biggie. There is a small bottom lip on the Helper, where the shower hose collar rests.Added benefit: I have actually bought a few of these Helpers. Yes, they are easy to remove when you want to, BUT they also suction to the wall REALLY well, so I have a second one in my shower, at an even lower height. This is great for when I just want to do a quick foot bath and need both hands, or I am short on time (& soil) and want to do a ""navy bath"" without risking getting my hair wet or splashing all over the bathroom. At less than $10, it's a nice convenience that makes getting ready in a hurry that much faster and easier! Plus, with more than one, I can set my favorite angles and leave them that way! Also, I use it to hold up a Bidet Spray handle next to the toilet, instead of the awful holder the Bidet company gave me. The MH-SG-PSA is SOOOO much better & no holes in my walls!! It's the little luxuries in life...I'm not a mommy, but this Mommy's Helper Safer Grip Portable Shower Arm sure does help me!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"Ok, so this might not be it's intended use, but it works great for me in this manner: my nightstand is really far away from the bed, and we often keep our bedroom temp between 65 and 70 deg F in the cooler months. I often wake up in the middle of the night needing a sip of water. Also, like most of us, I like to keep my phone close (but not too close) while I am sleeping - it makes it easier to hit snooze in the am - haha! So, to prevent a chilly trip to the night stand, I use this caddy beside my bed to hold a bottle of water on one end, my phone (in the soap dish part), and pens and misc items on the other end. It's on the side of my bed that only I see. It might look a little tacky to others, so I may be hesitant to use it if it would be in plain sight. Actually, if it's in plain sight, I would just never attach it to the bed (or, if there was no way to). See below. That way, when guests come over, I can just ""disassemble"" the stand and hide it away until privacy returns.When I first got it, I didn't know if it would work and I was wary of ""wasting"" the neat-o strips on my ""experiment"". So, I took an appropriately-sized rectangular box, closed it with the fold-over flap-securing method, put it on its side, and then placed it next to my side of the bed. I then took the caddy and sat it on the ""sidewall"" of the box (which was now facing up). There are hard plastic fins at the back, which drop below the flat ""floor"" of the caddy (you can see them in the picture, they look like nubs). These are what help brace it against the wall and give it additional strength against things with strong downward force like full shampoo bottles and stuff. I sandwiched these behind the edge of the box, and my bed-rail (what the mattress sits on), sitting the ""floor"" of the caddy flat on the sidewall (top) of the box. It gave the caddy excellent stability to hold all of my items securely. I put a 16 oz aquasana glass bottle in there, full of water, every night and sleepily fumble around in the dark to take it out and put it back in and I've never had a problem with it tipping over. Of course, YMMV, and please be sensible when putting items in there and don't use it with fragile heirlooms, or over a crib, and all that common-sense stuff...But, it works great for me and bonus: if my needs change, I can use it at the office, in the laundry room, in a closet, and yes, even in the shower!I've also used several of the other 3M Command Strip products and have always been very satisfied with their functionality.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"The short: Despite my wanting them to be awesome, I believe these gave me painful headaches.The long: I hate to give these a two-star rating, as they have such great ""specs"" and I really wanted them to work. They are also much less expensive than my usual once daily vitamin. (all of these factors prevented them from being a 1-star item). However, I experienced terrible headaches that only started when I initially began taking the vitamins and stopped when I stopped taking them, and I otherwise never have headaches. I have been taking various multivitamins (usually a women's formula, once daily type) for well over a decade and whenever possible, I purchase a food-based, organic, vegetarian multi. I really liked that these were also raw, as I try to incorporate as much raw as possible. Sidenote: It does worry me that the ""raw"" on their packaging is spelled weird, as I am familiar with ""greenwashing"" or other misrepresentations such as the word ""organics"". ""Organics"" is very different than the word ""organic"" when it comes to product labeling guidelines and can be very misleading. My concern is that ""RΔW"" in this case is different than ""RAW"" or ""raw"" as I would prefer. The website does claim the product is RAW, and says uncooked & untreated (not unheated, if that matters). So, the use of the Δ, instead of an A, could simply be a design-choice and not intended to mislead consumers. Regardless, I believe my ""hands on"" experience overrides my minor skepticism about the ""rawness"" of the product.Anyway, I took these vitamins for almost two months, until I couldn't stand it anymore. Within the first week, I noticed that I was getting severe headaches that would last for hours. I almost never get headaches (maybe once a year, when really stressed), so after the first two, I started to wonder. A few weeks later (yes, I know I probably let it go too long), I was experiencing long-lasting, painful headaches almost daily. They were interfering with my daily life. Being in school and working, tasks were very difficult with such debilitating headaches. I made an appointment with my doc, just in case it was something serious. Doc said all looked fine, but sent me for some bloodwork, for a more thorough look. It was at this point that I started to suspect the vitamins, but I was reluctant, since they had so much going for them. I had to wait a while to get the bloodwork done, as the doctor wanted it to correspond with a certain time in my cycle. I stuck with the vitamins for a few more weeks, until one day when I just couldn't take it anymore and, even though I had already bought a second bottle (I bought it just after I bought the first one, to be ready for when the first ran out), I switched back to the multivitamin I had taken previously. The headaches dissipated within the first two days and by the third day, they were all but gone. It's been almost two months since I stopped taking them and I've had maybe 4 headaches in that time (mostly occurring in the time just after the cessation of the ""RΔW"" vitamins), and none of which were as painful as those that I had when I was taking the RAW ONE vitamins. I am able to work a full day again, and have a much stronger sense of well-being.I'm glad that so many others have had positive experiences with this vitamin and I don't want this review to dissuade anyone from trying this product. Rather, I'm posting this to share my experience perchance that it might help another to determine the source of an otherwise unexplained ""side effect"".I do like other products from this company, including their Raw Organic Protein, their Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and their Living Foods Chocolate Raspberry Bars. However, I will continue to purchase my multi from another supplement company.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35J2YRWM9Z9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039LF4Y4#wasThisHelpful","R35J2YRWM9Z9A","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned this light for several years and am very happy with its function. I use it in my bathroom and it adds a nice decorative touch. I really enjoy the soft amber flickering glow. This is not a utility light and will not ""light up"" an area like a hallway, or even a countertop or sink. In a completely dark room, it will light up its own face-plate, as well as an inch or so border on the wall surrounding it. Mine is plugged into an outlet next to a mirror, so that helps to reflect a bit more light. However, it still will not illuminate anything more than a few inches or so away from it, and even up close, the illumination is wonderfully dim. Some light does come off of it, but it is mainly for decorative purposes. It can, however, be seen from afar. There are several doors in the hall, so I close the others and I leave the bathroom door slightly open for guests, and this light, which can be seen from the hall, is a nice ""welcome"" into the room.PROS:- LED (saves, energy, money, and does not get hot)- not overly bright; in fact, perfectly dim- flicker looks almost ""real""- IMO, beautiful design- covers whole outlet, almost looks like a sconce (protects other outlet, too)GOOD TO KNOW:- will not ""light up"" an area (I like this and have other lights for other areas)- takes up the space of two electrical outlets (I like this feature, but might not work for other users)- ambient light sensitive (turns on if no light in area, dims if some light in area, will not turn on if brighter light in area) - cool feature, but the light is so pretty that I kinda would like it on all the time. However, this auto-off feature does save energy and extends the life of the bulb.Light makes me happy and this one makes me especially happy. When I walk past my bathroom, I feel like inside is an old medieval castle, sans rats, drafts, and invaders. It makes me smile :)INFO ADDED:For comparison, I also have:Cooper Lighting HS8 90-Degree Motion-Activated Night LightAmerTac 73092CC LED Motion-Activated Nite LiteMr. Beams MB852 Wireless Motion Sensing LED Under Cabinet Light, White, 2-PackMr. Beams MB723 Battery-Powered Motion-Sensing LED Stick-Anywhere Nightlight, 3-PackAmong several other LED lighting products (bulbs, lanterns, flashlights, headlamps, outdoor, ribbon, etc).At this point, it's hard to say which area/nightlight in this list is my favorite, as it depends on the application. I really like the Cooper Lighting HS8, for its high brightness and soft fade off feature. The AmerTac 73092cc (both styles listed together on Amazon) are nice because they are not too bright, but each light up a short hall in my home, offering increased safety, and since they plug-in, I don't have to think about batteries. The Mr Beams MB852 is super bright and great as a ""utility"" light or in a closet or pantry. The MB723 is nice because the light can be easily ""directed"" and it's not quite as bright as the MB852's. Plus, it has a light-detection feature, so if there's other light, it won't activate. It's nice to have battery operated lights, for areas where no outlet is available. I have bought several Mr Beams products and have been happy with all of them.I believe lighting is very important, for safety, decoration, function, convenience, and when done properly, beauty!

"We have one of these in each of three bathrooms in our house. We'd put one in the kitchen, but have one of those big-head pull-down faucets and it won't fit. We bought our first one in May 2009, and have been using it daily, ever since, without any concerns. We then bought two more in Nov 2009 and as of this review, we still have the same ones, on all three bathroom sinks - all 3 - 3.5 years old and all in perfect working order!PROS:- use LESS water: eco- and water-bill friendly!- easier to wash hands and brush teeth, just click the stick!- less water mess around faucet- less grimy mess behind faucet (none, actually!)- keep faucet handles cleaner and with less germs (think about what you touch and when)- easier for those under 5' tall to wash their hands (no reaching for handles)- may be safer, as you set the pressure and temperature, so difficult to mistakenly set ""too hot"" water- claims to ""fix"" leaky faucets (ours never leaked, so we can't test that)CONS (just things to be aware of):- the spray is more like a showerhead spray, with individual streams of water, in a circular pattern, which splashes a bit more. Without it attached, the water is simply aerated in a single, thick stream, which does not splash as much. (minus one star)- if you have the pressure set high, it will make a loud ""thud""-like sound when turning it on and off. We keep our pressure moderate, so this is not an issue for us.- although most of our guests think the sticks are neat, especially the youthful ones, a few guests have been curiously unable to figure them out (despite my well-placed signage).I did make a little sign, laminated it, and taped it to the top of our faucet handles, blocking quick access, to remind guests how to use it. In addition, I let new guests know to ""read the signs"" when they head into the loo for the first time. (We have signs for our dual-flush-style toilets, as well) This makes for funny discussions as well as an opportunity to tell people about the wonderful benefits of these ""faucet sticks"".My mom, and our other frequent guests, are happy to use them. :)I think it encourages young kids to wash their hands, as they seem intrigued by it.We get a lot of questions about germs, but once we point out that, in ""mainstream"" bathrooms you are using the toilet, touching the handles, washing your hands and then touching the germy handles again; and in our bathroom, you swipe the stick with the BACK of your hand, without touching any handles, it makes sense to people.We are buying more as gifts for people. They're Great!!PS - we bought ours at a local home building store (with an orange logo), for around 6 bux. Also, if you google instant-off and check out their site, you will see a variety of lengths in both white plastic and stainless steel, etc. Ours are white plastic. They generally ""blend"" into the color of our sink. We wipe the stick and the spray part when we clean our bathroom.Not sure about his one here, but ours came with a 13/16"" Price-Pfister faucet adapter. We did not need it, as ours fit without them.I have also posted photos at: Instant Off Water Saver.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices.

"My mechanic installed this kit when he replaced my rear drums. I have a '96 Subaru Legacy Wagon 2.2 AWD Automatic.He reported that all the pieces in the kit worked and fit properly. A few hundred miles later, and I can still report that everything is working as it should.N.B.: I buy the parts for my mechanic. While he didn't ask me to buy this kit when I bought the drums (he said everything he needed came with the drums I would buy {also purchased on Amazon}, or could be re-used), I bought this hardware kit anyway, as a precaution, so he'd have it while he did the install. My concern was that, due to the age of the car, some of the old parts might break during dis-assembly, or might break just after re-installation. Since he found some of the old parts to be fused together, he decided to use all of the parts from this hardware kit, and since he already had it, he didn't have to wait for a parts delivery, AND I got my car back faster. * * * TIP: Consider having this on hand, even if you don't think you'll need it.I rely on Amazon to help me make informed buying decisions.

We then bought two more in Nov 2009 and as of this update (Oct 2012), we still have the same ones, on all three bathroom sinks - all 3 - 3.5 years old and all in perfect working order!PROS:- use LESS water: eco- and water-bill friendly!- easier to wash hands and brush teeth, just click the stick!- less water mess around faucet- less grimy mess behind faucet (none, actually!)- keep faucet handles cleaner and with less germs (think about what you touch and when)- easier for those under 5' tall to wash their hands (no reaching for handles)- may be safer, as you set the pressure and temperature, so difficult to mistakenly set ""too hot"" water- claims to ""fix"" leaky faucets (ours never leaked, so we can't test that)CONS (just things to be aware of):- the spray is more like a showerhead spray, with individual streams of water, in a circular pattern, which splashes a bit more. Without it attached, the water is simply aerated in a single, thick stream, which does not splash as much. (minus one star)- if you have the pressure set high, it will make a loud ""thud""-like sound when turning it on and off. We keep our pressure moderate, so this is not an issue for us.- although most of our guests think the sticks are neat, especially the youthful ones, a few guests have been curiously unable to figure them out (despite my well-placed signage).I did make a little sign, laminated it, and taped it to the top of our faucet handles, blocking quick access, to remind guests how to use it. In addition, I let new guests know to ""read the signs"" when they head into the loo for the first time. (We have signs for our dual-flush-style toilets, as well) This makes for funny discussions as well as an opportunity to tell people about the wonderful benefits of these ""faucet sticks"".My mom, and our other frequent guests, are happy to use them. :)I think it encourages young kids to wash their hands, as they seem intrigued by it.We get a lot of questions about germs, but once we point out that, in ""mainstream"" bathrooms you are using the toilet, touching the handles, washing your hands and then touching the germy handles again; and in our bathroom, you swipe the stick with the BACK of your hand, without touching any handles, it makes sense to people.We are buying more as gifts for people. They're Great!!PS - we bought ours at a local home building store (with an orange logo), for around 6 bux. Also, if you google instant-off and check out their site, you will see a variety of lengths in both white plastic and stainless steel, etc. Ours are white plastic. They generally ""blend"" into the color of our sink. We wipe the stick and the spray part when we clean our bathroom.Not sure about his one here, but ours came with a 13/16"" Price-Pfister faucet adapter. We did not need it, as ours fit without them.I have also posted photos at: Instant Off Water Saver.I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7E8OTHSOKYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006428FHS#wasThisHelpful","R1R7E8OTHSOKYQ","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a massage therapist and have experience with several products which aim to reduce pain. In fact, it's a staple that I travel with, whereever I go, and I keep a bottle in the car, one at the office, and a few at home (just in case). People come to me with their aches and pains and, in addition to other options, I usually tell them about a spray like this (and give them a bottle I happen to have closeby!).I mainly use Biofreeze spray and when comparing the two, I like that much better. It seems more concentrated than CryoDerm, as I can feel the effects better and the spray goes more on my skin, rather than floating around in the air, like the CryoDerm. It's like the particles are smaller and lighter with CD.I can spray biofreeze in the car and others can smell it, but it doesn't affect their breathing. When I spray this in the car (and I notice it, too), it goes into mouth and eyes and makes breathing difficult. This is with windows closed or open climate control on or off. I use a muscle spray in the car often, so I have tried various ""configurations"".Also, I can ""feel"" the BioFreeze working for many minutes after I've applied it. With the CryoDerm, in my experience, the effect wears off quickly, so I need to reapply (if my passengers can stand it).One good thing to report is that, with both sprays, I do not experience any skin irritation or ill effects from using it. I generally have sensitive skin and use only natural products, organic when feasible.Just a note, I have been known to spray products such as this on the back of my neck on an especially hot day, to help feel a bit cooler.I see a lot of positive reviews, so it may just be a personal preference. I recommend that you try a few different brands and find the one that works best for you. For me and my clients, friends, & family, that product is BioFreeze Spray.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"I purchased this for my mother's use. She was able to pair it right away (she's never paired anything before). I was shocked when she called me, using it.Shocked, for two reasons (the first being how truly easy it was for her to set up, despite her somewhat limited tech experience).The second being that I could just barely understand what she was saying.She's had a blackberry for several years and we talk ALL THE TIME, so I am quite familiar with how she SHOULD sound, on the other end. I've heard her through various phone appliances and this was, by far, the worst.She was really happy with how easy it was for her to set up and how I sounded to her, through the speaker. She not happy that she had to repeat things and was concerned that her voice wasn't clear on the other end of the line. She often works while on the road, so this part is extremely important.I purchased this after doing extensive research to make sure it was easy to use and sounded great. Easy to use: check. Sounded great: not so much. Bummer.Based on reading other reviews, it seems as if only a few others have had this issue. My unit was purchased brand new, so it's possible that I got a bad one, among a sea of great ones. She was quite happy to return it, and not interested in trying another one.Personally, I have a Jabra SP200 which I am very happy with (why'd I wait so long!?!), but I wanted one with more fetaures for her (pairing more than one device, etc.) and I thought this would be a good deal. Nope.Buyer beware. If you buy this, be sure to try it out right away, to allow time to return it if you get one of the rare bad ones. Call someone you call all the time, or call your voicemail and leave a lengthy message, both before you pair it and again after you pair it and compare the sound.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"I really, really, really wanted to like this. I like other things from this company and I LOVE coconut water - especially straight outta the nut! No sweeteners needed. (I also like coconut manna, and coconut smell, and coconut milk, shredded coconut, etc). This tastes nothing like coconut water. I think the stuff they add to it is what ruins it. It tastes salty and fake. I wish they could/would just dehydrate the coconut and powder it and package that. Maybe it would be different.I love coconut water, but don't feel comfortable with the environmental cost of shipping, etc. i was happy to find it in powdered form, and happy that there were so few ingredients. I REALLY wanted to like this. I'm so bummed. I can't even give it away.I see it is out of stock - maybe they are reformulating it??

"I bought these for my fiancee. He is a very lean size 12. He thinks he is a ninja, and likes to spring around the house, so I thought these would complement his springing nicely. Plus, I bought Zem ninja shoes for myself and didn't want him to feel left out. Unfortunately, these socks were way too tight on his calf. He wears calf-high dress socks almost every day, so he is used to the feeling of socks on his leg. He really likes Nautica & Gold Toe brand dress socks, and has never had a problem with socks being too tight. He wears a 32x32 pant, and is about 6' tall, so IMO he does not have exceptionally large calves (they measure 13.25"" at the widest point). I even slid one over my forearm (10"" circum), and it was really tight.The socks are 21"" from end to end. And are anatomically correct, with room for the big toe and a separate, larger slot for the other toes, with the heel cup on the back.They are kind of a scratchy, thick fabric. Also, as the other reviewer states, these socks are black, not brown.I cannot recommend these, unless the person has exceptionally small calves.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"I am a ""hook fan"". I already have a lot of hooks in my house so, I bought this hook primarily for travelling. I figured it would always fit on the door I need it to. I just returned from a long vacation, where I stayed in eight different places, ranging from the floor at a friend's house on the side of a mountain, to a luxury 5-star hotel in the city. I was so happy to have this hook with me! It worked in every situation! Sharing a bathroom with others and they took all the hooks to dry their towels? No problem! I brought my own! Come back to the hotel room on a rainy day with no place to hang your coat? No problem! I brought my own! Trying on clothes and the store just doesn't have enough hooks? No problem! I brought my own!Of course, you do need to have a place from which to hang the hook, but there's usually a door, the back of a chair, a towelbar, or even a dresser drawer closeby that works great!I used to travel with 3m command hooks, but was hesitant to use them, due to their ""permanence"" (use the sticky stuff just once). This hook is great since can be moved quickly and easily. So glad I found this, as this hook works very well - it is coated metal (magnet sticks to it), strong, thin along the top (to facilitate door closing), has two sizes for various applications, a prominent ""lip"" to catch the hanging item(s), and there's even a hole drilled into one of the lips, (if you wanted to secure it to something). Could also be used to run narrow twine in a creative set-up, hanging laundry while on the road, etc. (I have a twisted bungee cord for travel laundry, tho).The magnet idea allows for a good place to leave notes for yourself (shopping list, reminder), or for a loved one (have a great day! i love you! see you at 7p for dinner, etc), if you use the hook for something daily, like: a towel, robe, purse, jacket, keys, bag, dog leash, etc. I like the 'snap! strong magnets by threebythree' that I got at the c0ntainer st0re.While I haven't tested the *limits* of this hook (I do wanna use it as long as possible), I did just toss two 3-lb wrist weights in a tote bag (total weight, according to bathroom scale: 6.2 lbs), then, I put them on a hook that was over a door. Seemed sturdy, so I swung the door open and closed several times. Still Sturdy. You might be successful in going up to 8 lbs, but that's on you to test. 10 lbs might be pushing it. Also, the more weight you put on this hook, the more stress you will put on the door hinges/screws, or whatever you have ""hooked"" the hook onto. Once or twice might be ok, but over a few days or weeks or more, you might have alignment issues with the door. Just something to consider, if heavy loads are intended. [many thanks to L. DeFrenne for the question]Note on c0st: I have seen it range from 12 to 5 d0llars here on amazon; and as low as 2 d0llars at the C0ntainer St0re (they also have it in white)! I may have pd more than I could have, but it was definitely handy to have when i needed it. Just an fyi to others.I highly recommend this hook - especially for travelling! With it, you know you will always have a place to hang your hat (...or your towel, or bathing suit, or jacket...)I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"My fiancée had been clacking his teeth at night (waking me), so I had bought him a few night guards, including this one. He prefers the ""football type"", partly because, I think, he can imagine that he's football player. Personally, I can't imagine how anyone would find that comfortable. Lo and behold, my dentist recently recommended I use a night guard (is grinding contagious??). Luckily, these came in a 2-pack, so to follow my dentist's orders, as well as support my guy in wearing his, I tried out the remaining den-tek guard.USER EXPERIENCE:I was anxious about it staying in place, but so far, it stays in place perfectly. I have a very small mouth (dentist uses kid-sized implements on me), and this guard does not feel bulky. In fact, I find it extremely comfortable.I love that it's adjustable and has numbers on the adjustable part! The first few nights, I was guessing, but I quickly found that it fits me best at 2 on the left and 3 on the right.I can easily talk and smile while wearing it! In most circumstances, it's hardly detectable.I don't feel it promotes excessive saliva production, ""morning breath"", or drooling.In the beginning, I discovered these little, horizontal ""bumps"" (like a road speed bump) along the inside of my cheeks when I woke up. One on each side. I was worried, but upon investigation, found that there are similarly-sized slots in the guard and my cheeks must be pressing against them, creating the ""imprint"". The bumps go away within a half hour of removing the guard, and now, several weeks later, they are much flatter and hardly noticeable when I wake up.Fortunately, I have not noticed any sores, scrapes, or areas of discomfort on either my my cheeks or gums, as other users have reported.TIPS:I clean the guard with soap & water (dr bronner's peppermint) upon removal AND prior to insertion. I slide the adjustable spine thing in and out several times, under running water, to help cleanse that part. A few times per week, I also brush the guard with my toothbrush (oral-b, powered) & toothpaste (uncle harry's glycerin-free).My first pack did not come with a case, but the second one did and it's HUGE! I might give it to my guy for his hulk-sized guard. I have found that the dark blue, round, pill-stacker canisters from the Vitamin Shoppe work perfectly. They are much, much smaller (& they stack!). So far, I keep the lid off, but before we travel, I'll have my guy drill a few holes in the side, to help with air circulation when I do cap it.OTHER PRODUCT DETAILS:In the packs I have received, so far, the ""pad"" part is blue, not white, as currently seen in the official product photo. I wish they were white, or clear, as the blue makes them more noticable when I talk or open wide.Also not easily seen in the official photo: the front ""bracket piece"" has a wave to it, so it fits over the frenulum labii inferioris.Check out the product picture posted by Logan Dillard, which has notes. If you are on the mobile site, you have to switch to viewing the desktop site to see it. This pic is a better representation than the official product photo, of the guard I received. The wave part in the front is still somewhat hidden, though.The package states: ""Always been BPA FREE"" & ""Made in USA"". They recommend you ""see your dentist for a consultation within the first 3 months of using the product"". Their # is 800-4DENTEK, if you have questions. Be sure to read the lengthy notes on the back of the package, as there are some important considerations, such as TMJ, bite changes, etc., that users need to keep in mind. The info may be similar, but my package looks different than the one posted by another user (newer version?).Many thanks to amazon for offering this on subscribe & save, and many thanks to the other reviewers for sharing their experience.

"I have bought several of these in the past, and have just bought a few more. They are very handy to have around the house and make great gifts. I have given them to all the appreciated contractors & mechanics in my life and they love them! I keep one hanging on my bedpost, for occassional night reading, as well as to have a pretty handy light at night (just cause it has a strap doesnt mean you can't also carry it, every so often!). They're perfect for those ""what's that noise?"" or, ""where'd i put my..."" moments. Also, for carrying things/laundry into a dark basement, or for older kids running around at night. They are also great for camping (especially when setting up camp in the dark or using a porta-pot: look ma! no hands!). They are super for crafters/sewing folk, to give a bright spot of light right where you need it.I also toss one in my suitcase when I travel. Better to have a flashlight with a headstrap, in case I need one, than to not.I have purchased two other models, and, while they do have their ""pros"", I like this one the best, as it is overall better.I have made one modification, a small piece of black electrical tape placed on the clear underbelly of the lens helps reduce light backflow when I need to tilt it down. Easy-peasy!Are there better ones for industrial (heavy duty) or backpacking (light weight) use? Surely. However, for $15-20, this is still a handy item, well worth the cost. For many of my gift-recipients, it turns out to be one of those ""I never would have thought I needed this, but I use it all the time"" items.PS: I use sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries to power it; saves $, eco-better, & also highly recommended.I rely on Amazon reviews to help me make informed buying decisions; I hope this review helped you with your purchase research.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFQ3FQUIWFV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MFK7H2#wasThisHelpful","R1TFQ3FQUIWFV1","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought to use in a Maytag Mgde500 dryer (performance series).It was easy to put together (what you see in the pic is 2 separate pieces). And, although I apparently had chosen the correct ""holes"" for the bracket the first time, I also tried a different set, just in case.Once assembled, it simply sits in your dryer, with the wire bracket in the back and the plastic tray resting on the front/lint screen area.The dryer can then spin ""around"" it, while the rack remains stationary. My old dryer, a Maytag Ensignia (super awesome, but not stackable) had one, and since I had bought it used, the previous owner showed me how it worked. That previous knowledge was helpful in using this new one for the first time.This new rack fits less snugly, and the front part does not rest evenly in its place. Maybe if I put something really heavy across it and dried it at a high heat for a long tine, it might sit better. Regardless, it works with my machine, as is, and I'm happy to have a drying rack once again.PS - as this can be used for more than sweaters, the rack turns the dryer into a much more useful appliance! Consider using it to more quickly dry delicates, shoes, camping gear, tools, toys, art supplies, things with nooks and crannies/small parts that are difficult to get to with a towel, things that can't be tumbled, etc. I'm considering trying to dehydrate food in there at some point... Of course, the usual warnings apply: no oil or flammables, etc.NB: for several reasons, we have never used fabric softener liquid or dryer sheets with our new dryer. If we did, I would not consider putting food in there. Our clothes are still soft and without static.Happy Drying!I rely on amazon reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"I like that this has better ingredients than other protein powders (no artificial sweeteners, no solvents - google hexane and isolate for info, no radiation, and vegan). I do not like the heavy stevia taste. I know that part is subjective, but if you are at all sensitive to the taste of stevia (as me and my fiancée are), you may have a difficult time with the taste of this flavor.I called Sun Warrior and asked about a non-stevia product (among other questions) and they were very helpful (& friendly!) steering me in the direction of the Natural flavor, which has ONLY the protein powders & MCT. As we await the package of Natural in the mail, we'll use bananas and peanut butter to help cover the taste of the stevia in the Chocolate.N.B.: My mom (who doesn't mind stevia) finds this to taste amazing and will be the happy recipient of our remaining chocolate powder.I do wish this also had Brown Rice Protein, and that the ingredients were organic, but, as it is now, the ingredients and the ""Cold Extrusion process"" which is ""free of solvents, GMOs, radiation, artifical colors, & preservatives"", along with superior mixability, help make this protein powder my top contender among all others.I rely on Amazon to help me make informed buying choices.

"If you have a house with indoor plumbing, these can save you money and frustration. They did for me!We have 5 sinks, 3 toilets, 2 showers, an ice-maker line in our fridge, a dryer that needs water, plus the washing machine and the water heater. That's 14 opportunities for damage. I personally know of 6 households who have suffered damage from a flood that began inside the house. That's enough for me to want to find ways protect my home. These little devices help put my mind at ease.I recently had some plumbing work done (6 months ago). I placed one of these devices in the area where the work was, in case there was a leak.Today, after sitting silently for months, the little guy let out a scream (it beeps SOS in Morse Code). Apparently, one of the connections was allowing water to drip on the floor, and it had, by that point, created a 6"" wide puddle on the floor. It was under a sink, behind a trash can and a cabinet. Had the alarm not gone off, I would have not seen the leak until it was much farther out and caused damage. But today, I just turned off the water at the shut-off, and a single microfiber washcloth wiped up the little bit that had dripped. Easy-peasy.I HIGHLY recommend these. I tested each of mine when they arrived and have not experienced any false positives since I set them up (18 months ago). I have found them to be very loud and effective. For the price, I think it's smart to have one strategically placed at each point of water in your home. At the current price of ~$25/3, that's just over $8 each. Considering the cost and frustration of the aftermath of a flood (even a small one), early detection by one of these little guys could prove to be a huge savings.These make great gifts, too! Especially for housewarming, ""Relative's"" Day, or a practical-minded loved-one. Don't let the 1-star reviews make you look elsewhere. It seems as if most of them are about volume and are at least a few years old. I believe the manufacturer made some changes, as mine (and according to other reviews, others') are plenty loud.Side note: I purchased rechargeable 9V batteries (Tenergy LSD) and a 9v charger (Tenergy V-9688), to use with these and other detectors in the house.

While I have purchased many helpful gadgets, this one is his favorite.We've owned it for just over a year and he uses it several times per week. He makes soups in the pot, smoothies in the glass, sauces in the bowl, and clean-up is in the bag! Well, just a few drops of Eco-friendly dishsoap and whirr it around with some water in a container gets the bulk of the mess off!The blades are very sharp, and although there aren't myriad settings, it seems to always blend at just the right speed.The kicker? He likes it better than our $400 BlendTec blender.Yep. He also refuses to use a hand mixer, preferring a wooden spoon, instead. But he loves his smartstick so much that it goes on vacation with us!In our opinion, every kitchen should have a hand blender. They are easy to use, easy to store, and easy to clean. Being portable is also a bonus! From our experience, this particular one is especially good and, therefore, we highly recommend it!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

"Three reasons my guy likes these better than any other spong he's tried: (in our house, he does the dishes & I write the reviews)1. The scrubby part is scrubby enough that it gets gunk off dishes but not so sctratchy that it damages finishes (we've had other scrubby sponges that have ruined the finish of our flatware). Either way, proceed with caution, just in case.2. The spongey part (even though it's like velvety-soft) is more durable than other sponges, in that it lasts longer when washing dishes and it holds up better to ""sanitizing"" (we prefer the microwave method).3. They're better for the planet! (and, we like that they're tan, too!)So, if these sponges cost a few cents more than others, we believe they are worth it, since they are gentler on finishes (while still being effective), eco-friendly, and they hold up better.With 'subscribe & save' and the coupon that's avail now, they are even a better deal!Hope that helps in your sponge-buying process!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4JSO0CGRY70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015MO4F4#wasThisHelpful","R2B4JSO0CGRY70","A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PQ3WXMKCT4NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vichy's sunscreen is a light and pleasant sunscreen.  It looks and feels just like any other sunscreen, an off-white creamy lotion, but the Vichy does not have a strong odor and absorbs quickly, without a greasy residue.  The slight fragrance that the Vichy does have smells pleasant, and is barely noticeable.  In fact the Vichy reminds me more of a facial moisturizer with SPF 15 sunscreen that a straight-up SPF 60 sunscreen.  With that said, I won't be slathering the Vichy on my face daily, since it is not intended to be a daily moisturizer.  Rather I've been using it on my forearms and neck when I'm working in the yard, or spending a lot of time outdoors.  It's kept me protected for hours, and I haven't noticed any skin issues or irritation when using the Vichy.All in all... a pleasant alternative to typical smelly and sticky sunscreens.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OL7NMU4ZPV27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050IJRM4#wasThisHelpful","R1OL7NMU4ZPV27","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Invicta's stainless steel watch is quite the timepiece.  It's well made and attractive, but it is substantial.The Invicta is made nicely from stainless steel.  Everything is well assembled and it feels substantial in the hand.  That's because it is substantial, at 6.20oz in weight and 1.75"" across the face.  This is a big watch, and it will attract attention.  Yet, since the color and style is restrained, it does not appear garish.Not only is the face huge, but also the band.  That will be a god send for people with large wrists, but if your wrist is small you will need to have lots of links taken out.  At 5'7"" and 135 pounds I was able to slip the watch on without even unclasping it.  Thankfully the watch is easy to size at a jeweler and there is some adjustability in the clasp if your wrist falls between sizes as you remove links.  With all of that said, the Invicta is not uncomfortable to wear and does not feel like a burden.The face's design is simple, but elegant, and work well for both casual and dressy events.  There are three chronograph dials and a date window within the face.  Despite the complexity the watch is easy to read with large markings and big hands.  The hands and hour markers also glow in the dark.  The buttons to control the chronographs are on the side, along with the crown.  The crown is stiff and hard to pull out, however.  Perhaps it will get better in time.The Invicta is rated at 100M water resistant, and while I will never go that deep, based on my experiences with other Invicta watches in pools and the ocean, it should be fine.  It has also kept perfect time.The included box and case are both well done and make a nice presentation, but the case smells strongly of the cheap plastics that it is made from.All in all... a big, beautiful watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R263ZAMIKO8V8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y23Q#wasThisHelpful","R263ZAMIKO8V8A","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DII's heavyweight dishclothes are nicely made and colorful, but they are tiny.The dishclothes are quite nice is appearance.  They feature a subtle woven pattern that uses different purples.  The overall look is that of a deep purple, and I would consider their description of the color as ""eggplant"" to be quite accurate.They are also very nicely made.  The stitching is well finished and there were no loose threads.  They are made of a heavy fabric that absorbs water well and doesn't leave fibers behind.Please note that they are 12"" x 12"", so unlike most dishtowels that are long and rectangular, these ""dishclothes"" are closer in size and shape to a dinner napkin.I washed them in my front load washer on a regular cycle (they recommend the gentle cycle, but I don't want to have to do a special load just for these) and dried them on low heat.

"Solid Gold's Sunday Sunrise food is a hit with both my Wheaton Terrier and Italian Greyhound.The Sunday Sunrise food consists of small flat pellets. They are about the size of a dime. All of the pellets are hard, there are no soft or chewy pieces.My 12 year old Italian Grayhound and 6 year old Wheaton Terrier both love this food. Now admittedly my Terrier will eat anything, but the Grayhound is very picky and even she likes Sunday Sunrise.  The one negative is that the pellets are a bit large for her and since her teeth aren't what they used to be, she can sometimes have trouble chewing it.They have had no issues with the frequency or consistsncy of their stools, and neither of them has had any grumbly tummies.All in all... great dog food.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNT8D46IIQQSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIG7BG#wasThisHelpful","RNT8D46IIQQSA","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dan Cruikshank's book A History of Architecture in 100 Buildings is a wonderful piece.  It's well written, interesting, and contains fabulous photographs.The books breaks up the 100 buildings by grouping them in the following categories; Pioneers, Rhetoric, Sacred, Urban Visions, Big and Beautiful, Material Matters, and Lost and Found.  Each group contains a short entry for each structure.  The entries are usually no more than 2 pages long, and describe who built the structure, what it was used for, how it was built, and the materials used to build it.  It's all very straightforward and easy to read, but it's also quite interesting.  Making up the list of building are some expected suspects; The Great Pyramid, The Flatiron Building, The Taj Mahal, etc.  Also, however, are buildings you've probably never heard of before, at least I didn't!  The author chooses structures from all time periods and places.  This isn't a book you would necessarily read from cover to cover, and I found it more interesting to pick and choose entries based on what caught my eye as I thumbed through.The photographs that accompany each entry are well chosen and beautiful.  Each entry has at least two photographs accompanying it.  Some of them are small, while other spread over two pages.The book itself is also quite nicely made and printed.  It's a hefty volume, that feels great in the hand, and looks wonderful on a coffee table.All in all... beautiful buildings in a beautiful book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178PA9POZ198B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770855998#wasThisHelpful","R178PA9POZ198B","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenox's holiday train salt and pepper shakers are well made, nicely detailed, and a decent size.The shakers are made from your typical Lenox ceramic.  It's a nice ivory white.

They won't get lost on the dinner table, and guests will notice them.  They are about 3.5"" long, 2"" inches deep, and 3"" tall.You fill them from the bottom, by pulling out a rubber plug.  Since the pieces are so large they will hold a lot of salt and pepper.  The engine releases its contents from the top of the steam stack, through one hole.

"Who doesn't know and love Reese's peanut butter cups, Hershey's chocolate bars, KitKats, and Almond Joys?  Well now you can have all of those tasty treats in a cardboard box with a drop down door.The treats you'll find inside are similar to what you would find in a Halloween bag of candy.

Unfortunately the mix is random from box to box, so there's no telling how many of each you will get.The box is very sturdy and all of the treats were undamaged.

"Medieval LEGO is a great way to learn about important events and people from the Middle Ages.  The book covers the years 1028-1485.  There are many important people (eg: Robin Hood, William Wallace, etc.) and events (eg: Treaty of York, The Black Death, etc.).  Each entry is only a couple of pages long at most and the typeface is quite large.  There are great LEGO model photos to go along with each event, which are detailed and well done.The way this book is designed makes learning about the Middle Ages both fun and simple.

"Okidokeys Smart-Lock is a nifty device, and has real potential, but some of its features just don't work reliably.The Okidokeys is very easy to install.  You simply remove the back of your deadbolt (the non-keyed side) and install the Okidokeys in its place, the front of the lock remains the same and operates as it always did with the same key.  The whole process is very straightforward and took me about 20 minutes.  Unfortunately, two necessary pieces were missing from my box.  I called Okidokeys and they sent out replacement parts and had them to me in two days.  They were very nice and easy to work with.Once the Okidokeys is installed you'll need to create an account on their website, download the app to your phone (Android or iOS), and sync the lock with you phone.  This process wasn't that complicated, and took me about 15 minutes, but the website and app are both very rudimentary looking, and not very user friendly.  They can both use some polish.The lock itself is quite large.  Size-wise, it reminds me of the boxes real estate agents hang off of your front door.  With that in mind you'll want to make sure that your door doesn't have any trim pieces or windows very close to the deadbolt, as it could make installing the Okidokeys impossible.The Okidokeys comes with three covers, brushed silver, brushed brass, and shiny brass.  I used the shiny brass cover to match my other hardware.  The covers, and a great deal of the lock itself are made of plastic.  This is unfortunate, as it makes the lock feel cheaply made.  Moreover, when the lock is operating it's very loud and sounds like a child's toy.  Appearance-wise it's sleek and will work well with most decors.In use the Okidokeys is a mixed bag.  Firstly, you'll have to be within your phone's bluetooth range to use it.  That's not a problem, but unlike a Nest thermostat (which runs off of Wi-Fi), you can't access the Okidokeys from afar.  Thankfully the lock always responded to the app and unlocked and locked the door without issue.  From opening the app, to having the door unlocked or locked, it took about 10 seconds total.  Your total time will probably vary depending on your phone set-up.  When you're inside the house you can use the button on the Okidokeys itself to operate the lock as well.One feature I had about a 75% success rate with was the hands free unlocking.  In theory you tell the Okidokeys the location of your house on a map, and when you get within a certain radius your phone will start trying to communicate with the Okidokeys to unlock it for you without having to reach for your phone.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, sometimes it just didn't work.  Just remember, you have to have the Okidokeys app running in the background for hands free to work, and I found that when I increased increase the search radius I had better results.Some other features of the Okidokeys is automatic re-locking, but to use that you'll have to attach a small sensor to your door frame and inside the lock.  I did not try this feature, as I figured it would lead to trouble, and I'd probably lock myself out unintentionally (if anyone is good at that, it's me!).  One feature I really liked was the ability to receive notification on your phone of when the door is locked / unlocked and by whom.FYI: I have a Kwikset deadbolt and an iPhone 5s running OS 8.4.1.All in all... it's convenient, but I wish it was more consistant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25IRS0PAY4Z00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVKGF3C#wasThisHelpful","R25IRS0PAY4Z00","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Manhattan Toy's Deer Play Mat is a wonderful little play mat with an adorable design and high quality materials.The play mat is nicely made from a variety of different fabrics, but all of the fabrics are high-quality and the mat is nicely stitched and finished.  There are no loose threads, bunched fabric, or sloppy seams.  The pay mat comes very nicely presented.  It is folded and bound with a white fabric ribbon.The mat is basically round (it has a few small appendages), and about 2.5 feet in diameter.  It's a decent size and not only gives a baby plenty of space to lay about but also can be used as a small blanket.The design of the mat is quite adorable.  In person in looks exactly like the photo, a sleeping deer.  The color scheme is definitely aimed towards girls, with a mixture of light pinks, whites, and blacks.There are lots of different fabrics and textures throughout the mat.  There are soft fleece parts, fuzzy parts, satin parts, corduroy parts, and a bed-sheet type part.  Besides all of the different textures there are also some sections that are filled with crinkle materials, for some audible and tactile fun.  The bottom of the mat is done in one single piece of soft fleece fabric.All in all... a wonderful little mat.09/25/2015 Update: I've washed it a couple of times on the gentle cycle in my front loading washer and on low heat in my dryer and it came out perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30J6JTNGY3S8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V408WVE#wasThisHelpful","R30J6JTNGY3S8X","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glasstic's water bottle is nicely made, works well, and people notice it and like it.The Glasstic consists of four pieces.  There is the flip-top cap, the screw-on base, the plastic outer shell, and the glass inner shell.  There are also a few silicone o-rings to complete the necessary seals.  Basically the glass inner shell slips into the plastic outer shell.  The bottle will come completely assembled, but it's easy to take apart and clean as necessary.  The bottle feels high quality and nice in the hand.In use the Glasstic is a great water bottle.  It holds 16 oz. of liquid and since there is bit of a vacuum created by the two chambers the bottle doesn't sweat (only a little bit of water condenses inside the two chambers) and beverages stay cold or hot for longer periods of time.  It's not a true vacuum, mind you, but it's better than a single-walled bottle.  The lid opens easily and swings back 270 so it will be completely out of your way.  The opening is not huge, but I had no trouble drinking out of it, and there's plenty of room for a straw.  The lid locks closed as well, but on my bottle the lock / unlock indictors were mixed up.  So when the bottle was locked, it showed as unlocked, and vice versa.  When everything is sealed and locked the bottle doesn't leak at all.  On the back of the lid is a sturdy handle to carry the Glasstic.Cleaning the Glassic will necessitate a bottle brush.  The opening for the glass insert is simply too small to get a hand down inside of.  Alternatively, you can place the whole thing in your dishwasher.  Glasstic recommends hand washing the silicone seals, however.  I ran the whole thing though my dishwasher, and it came out great.All in all... a great idea, and it works great!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2METXV2P6OZXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDTZVAI#wasThisHelpful","R2METXV2P6OZXX","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AXE's Phoenix deodorant works well for me and has a nice scent.The deodorant comes packaged in your standard variety container, with a twist bottom and a pop-off cap.The AXE has a very masculine scent.

Therefore, on both days I was fairly active.  I was never sweating profusely, but I certainly did work up a sheen.  At the end of both days the deodorant worked well.

"Yellowknife's Lightning cables are well-made, come in fun colors, and have a unique flat design.The Yellowknife cable is made of a thick and pliable plastic.  Instead of a traditional round cable, the Yellowknife is done in a flat design.  It looks and feels like a heavy-duty rubber band without the ability to stretch.  It does, however, share a rubber band's ability to easily flex into manny different shapes.  Construction quality is definitely a step-up from Apple's standard cable and should take a beating before it breaks down.

"Shacke's luggage tags are pretty much the best luggage tags you'll ever use.These tags are bright and fun in appearance, and will make your luggage stand out while it's rotating on the carousel.  The pattern is a fun geometric design, and while both tags have the same pattern they do have a different color scheme.Not only do they stand out appearance-wise, but also in build quality.  The tags themselves are made of thick and pliable rubber.  They remind me of the bottom of a sneaker.  They are also quite thick and would take considerable effort to tear.  Additionally, the well-finished leather straps make sure the tags stay securely attached to your luggage.All in all... while luggage tags might seem somewhat of an unimportant purchase, when one gets ripped off of your luggage they won't seem so insignifigant, so get the best tags you can!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRKTF8TQUG6G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EWSSCY#wasThisHelpful","RRKTF8TQUG6G2","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hershey's S'mores kit is a great idea, and makes tasty S'mores effortlessly.The S'mores kit consists of a large box, which has a bag of marshmallows, 4 packs of honey graham crackers, and 18 full-size Hershey chocolate bars inside.  The marshmallows and graham crackers are unbranded.  The marshmallows and graham crackers are very tasty though, so they don't feel like a ""cut-rate store brand"", or anything.  Additionally, everything inside the box was undamaged, and very fresh tasting.I've been making the S'mores in my microwave.  I have a 1300 watt microwave.  The box says to place the graham cracker, half a chocolate bar, and the marshmallow in the microwave at 50% power for 10 to 15 seconds and then place the other graham cracker on top.  That works out fine, but I like to melt chocolate a bit first and then place the marshmallow on top for a few seconds after that.  I feel the chocolate needs more time to soften up before the marshmallow goes in.  You can make them over a fire, or in a grill, but I prefer the ease of the microwave (and I'm making them as a snack at work!).All in all... easy, tasty treats!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJHFWYPUE0BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZAWFK8#wasThisHelpful","R3CJHFWYPUE0BK","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tresemme's Perfectly Undone conditioner is a great, high-quality conditioner.  It's very thick and coats my hair evenly and smoothly.  I typically use Pantene conditioners, but this Tresemme is even thicker than Pantene's.  It really feel luxurious and pampering for your hair.It smells really nice as well.  A little sweet, a little fruity, and leaves my hair smelling great.  It's not a feminine or masculine scent so it's great for everyone.It rinses cleanly and easily and leaves my hair easy to control and frizz and fly-away free.  I even put a little in my damp hair to aid in styling it.Now as far as it making my hair look perfectly un-done... I'm not so sure.  It seems to behave like every other conditioner I've ever used.  If pushed, I'd say it leaves my hair a touch more matte in appearance than the Pantene conditioner.It comes in a large push top bottle, which is fine, but for such a large bottle I would have preferred a pump.All in all... great conditioner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOBUVRR5HH2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJUO8#wasThisHelpful","R2SOBUVRR5HH2S","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honeywell's Quiet Set Personal Table fan is compact, works well, and is nicely made.The Honeywell comes completely assembled out of the box and is nicely assembled.  It's made entirely of plastics but they are high quality, feel good in the hand, and look good in your room.  The controls on the front are also nicely done, with good feel.  Included with the fan is a detachable plug.  The fan runs on DC power, which basically means that unlike a normal thin plug this has a power brick.  It's not very big and it seems to be pretty efficient as it doesn't get hot to the touch.  Indeed, Honeywell boasts that this fan uses up to 50% less power because it runs on DC.  It's a shame they didn't offer the option of battery power as well.The fan is very simple to use.  There are 4 buttons on the front; a power button, a fan speed button, an oscillation button (which has a 90º sweep), and a timer button.  The timer offers options of 2, 4, and 8 hours before shutting down, and there are 4 fan speeds.  Instead of listing the speeds as low, medium, high, etc., they are described as Sleep, White Noise, Refresh, and Power Cool.  There is a blue light to indicate which speed you are on.  A really thoughtful feature is that the light for the Sleep speed is much dimmer than the rest, making it great for a dark bedroom environment.  Another nice touch is that when you change a setting the oscillation pauses for a second so the fan doesn't try to keep rotating while you're pressing buttons.This is a small fan with a big grill, but looks can be deceiving.  Unlike some other tower fans that a have turbine-like vertical fan system, this Honeywell has a small circular fan inside of the large grill.  The fan itself is about 3.5"" inches in diameter, taking up only about half of the grill opening.  With all of this information in mind, you should know that this is a fan for small spaces and modest needs.  Even on Power Cool, you're not going to feel much air movement if you're more than a few feet away.  Ideally this will work well in a bedroom as a supplement for an air conditioner, on a desk, or just for some white noise while you sleep.Speaking of noise, even on its highest setting it is not very loud and the Sleep setting is the perfect volume to do just that... sleep.One thing I don't like is that you cannot take off the grill to clean the fan's blades.All in all... more of a breeze than a gust of wind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19X1D9NF2QQLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YU1O15U#wasThisHelpful","R19X1D9NF2QQLC","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OXO's salad dressing shaker is nicely made, works well, and cleans up well.The dispenser consists of two pieces, the top and the bottom.  They screw apart by the black rubber grip that runs around the top of the base.  The whole dispenser is made of plastic, but the plastics are high quality and feel great in the hand.I make my dressings in my food processor, but I use the OXO to store it, shake it up, and pour it.  It works well for those purposes, but some of the dressing having chopped nuts and scallions in them and the pouring spout on the top can be a little constrictive causing the dressing to pour out at a trickle.  I've solved that problem by chopping my ingredients more finely, but I still find the opening to be a bit smaller than I'd like for any creamy dressings.  Creamy dressing need a slow and deliberate pour to keep them from spilling over the top of the spout's stopper as well.Speaking of the stopper, opening the OXO to pour out dressing couldn't be simpler.  You just tip back the silicon-lined stopper.  The stopper seals tightly and no dressing escapes while shaking the OXO.I've washed the OXO many times in my dishwasher without problem.All in all... another great OXO product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P0L6I455CV25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L0OOR6#wasThisHelpful","R1P0L6I455CV25","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The SOFI zipper tote is a great little storage solution.  It's well made, nice looking, and works well.The SOFI is made of a mixture of a linen-like fabric on the outside and a square pattern on the inside.  The outside fabric has a nice sheen to it and looks high quality.  The outside fabric is goodish-brown in color, while the interior is done in a light blueish-lilac color.  The small canvas handle and large zippers are also nicely made and the SOFI feels sturdy in the hand.The SOFI consists of two pieces, there is the box itself and the reinforced base.  Without the base in place the walls of the box collapse down and the SOFI folds flat for easy storage.  One downside, however, is that the base does not fit inside the folded SOFI so out have to make sure to keep the two pieces together or you'll be stuck with a SOFI that will collapse down on itself.  Once the base is in place the SOFI is very sturdy and easy to move around.I've been using the SOFI in my hallway closet and have filled it with scarves, mittens, and earmuffs.  It's perfect to place on a high shelf because you don't have to bring it down to remove an item, you only need to unzip the front.  The zippers are large and smooth in action, with no snagging.  If, however, you want to get the whole box down, it's easy to do so with the large handle on the front.All in all... a stylish storage box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29F6MSWFG9WO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRZ7D44#wasThisHelpful","R29F6MSWFG9WO2","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The GreenWorks Twin Force lawn mower, is powerful, quiet, and works really well.The GreenWorks mower is very nicely made.  It’s constructed primarily of plastic, but it feels very robust and well screwed together.  All of the components feel of high quality in the hand.  Assembling the GreenWorks is easy; you just take it out of the box and attach the handle.  The process involves no tools and takes only minutes.It’s an amazingly simple lawnmower to use.  Once the batteries are charged you pop them into the two slots on the top of the mower.  Then set the cut height using the sliding lever on the top – no need to set each wheel individually!  Lastly, press the button on the handle and pull back on the safety bar.  Once that’s done… boom… the GreenWorks comes to life.In use the GreenWorks is a revelation, especially if you’ve only used gasoline mowers.  All of my previous mower experience was with manual-push gas-powered Craftsman mowers.  They were powerful, but they were also heavy and loud.  The GreenWorks packs all of the power of those machines, but it’s very light, easy to maneuver, and so quiet.  My neighbor also has a cordless electric mower (an older Black & Decker) and even he commented on how quiet the GreenWorks is.  It sounds no louder than a powerful fan on low speed, and even high speed is very subdued.  Lastly, it’s such a joy to not have to get and store gas.Moving performance was quite good.  First about my lawn, I have a .30 acre lawn that is basically flat and has a few patchy/bald spots underneath large trees.  I never let my lawn get too long and mow it every weekend.  In my case, 99% of the time the GreenWorks operates on its low speed, but when it hits a thick patch of lawn, or some twigs, it ramps up to high speed.  It does this only until it clears the obstacle, and then lowers down again instantly.  The switch between high and low speeds is automatic and not user controlled.  I found my lawn to be cut very evenly and I did not have to do multiple passes to get an effective cut.  I used the GreenWorks’ mulching feature and the clippings that were left behind were small and inconspicuous.  I have yet to use the included bag, and have no plans to.Battery life is quite good.  I’m able to mow my whole yard without having to stop and recharge.  Once one battery dies the second battery automatically kicks in.  One thing to bear in mind is that the GreenWorks will always draw power from the battery on the left hand side compartment first, and then switch to the other.  I find it best to place the small battery on the left.  This way after the small battery dies, and the GreenWorks switches to the large battery, I can pop the small battery in the charger just in case I need some extra juice.  The charger is quite quick and even just a half hour of charging will yield a decent amount of run time.  Thoughtfully both batteries have external charge indicator lights.If you’re using the mulching feature, you’ll want to remove the mulching plug in the back of the mower after each use, as it gets quite full of grass clippings.  Be prepared for a bit of a mess when you remove it.  I also like to clean the underside and body of the mower with a brush to keep everything clean.  I store the GreenWorks in my one car garage.  It fits between the wall and my car, and I fold down the handle to make it as compact as possible.All in all… a great mover, that’s also tremendously convenient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B3E06K75JE2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GX9WNP2#wasThisHelpful","R1B3E06K75JE2P","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mudder's tongs are really well made and feel sturdy.  The weight of the stainless steel used in the construction is impressive.  The arms of these tongs don't bend or twist when in use.  The silicone tips are nicely made and attached, and have scalloped edges.  The one quality flaw was that the silicone grips on the sides of the tongs were not securely fastened.  I had the push them into place.  It was easy to do, but still.I've used lots of tongs at my part time job as a kitchen assistant, and I much prefer tongs that don't have silicon tips, because they handle direct heat and large firm items better.  I find that the tips of silicon tongs flex a bit too much when lifting heavy bulky objects.  For instance when removing ramekins from a water bath the silicone tips of these tongs do not get as strong of a grip as medal tipped tongs.  Still, they work great for most other kitchen tasks like moving chicken breasts around, mixing salads, and pulling soft items out of boiling water.  The grippy tips also make them great to grab items off a high shelf!The tongs clean up well in my dishwasher.All in all... they won't perform every kitchen task perfectly, but work well for most.(sample provided)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NWDEW2LSLCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V67PONY#wasThisHelpful","R23NWDEW2LSLCU","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kurtzy's shell pearl stud earrings make a great gift for young girls, or women who want something elegant to wear while running day-to-day errands.The earnings come in a small silver gift box with a bow.

The colors are all subtle and neutral, so you won't have to worry about the earrings standing out and calling attention to themselves.  The overall construction quality is high and they feel well made in the hand.On closer inspection, however, you'll find that not all of the ""pearls"" are round or the same size and there are some slight finish issues with some darker spots.  While regular pearls have many of the same issues, for some reason with these earrings it looked artificial.  With that said, unless you're looking at them up close, they look great overall.They are small and light.

"SO & CO's stainless watch looks great and works well, but the details belie the upscale look they are going for.The SO & CO makes a great first impression. The stainless is shiny and well finished, and the watch face is clean and tasteful. Looking at the SO & CO more closely, however, is not so great. Two things stood out, the rotating bezel around the watch face is very loose and wobbly feeling, and the small magnifying glass over the date window is just glued onto the watch face instead of being an integral part of the crystal. Still, the SO & CO feels well made in the hand.The SO & CO has a modest sized face and band. I am a 5'7"" male weighing about 135 pounds and I found the scale of the watch to be perfect for me. The band was much bigger then ideal, but that's to be expected. There is some adjusting you can do without taking links out (by pushing the band further back into the clasp), but I needed links taken out to get a proper fit. Additionally, when you adjust the band by pushing it all the way back into the clasp, the clasp does not lay flat anymore.The watch is quite heavy and bulky. Don't expect to forget you're wearing it.Looks wise the SO & CO is quite stylish. Everyone who saw it liked the look. The face is simple and understated, but also modern and stylish.The large white markings on the black watch face are easy to read at a glance, and during the two weeks that I tested it the time was accurate.The watch is 100 meters water resistant, has a screw down crown and a locking clasp.All in all... nice looking and nicely made, but they didn't sweat the details, more like 3.5 stars overall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91WVKZ86J54N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCW277K#wasThisHelpful","R91WVKZ86J54N","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One thing to be mindful of is that it pulls easily.  My wooden dinning room table has been better days, and has a bit of a rough edge, which resulted in a few small pulls in the fabric.It fits my oval dinning room table just fine, but it would probably fit better on a rectangular table because on my oval table the corners of the tablecloth hang down quite low.  My dinning room table fits 6 seats, and is 60"" long and 45"" wide, but this cloth would easily fit a larger table since there is about a foot of extra fabric hanging off of each side.The tablecloth washed well in my front load washer and came out wrinkle free from the dryer.All in all... a nice simple, but not cheap looking, tablecloth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCULHN4VK39I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R68JMH6#wasThisHelpful","R1YCULHN4VK39I","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DeWalt's Max Hedge Trimmer is quite a machine.  It has lots of power, a long reach, and a long battery life.The DeWalt is very nicely made.  The blade is sharp and nicely finished.  The plastics that make up the body of the trimmer are good quality and well assembled.  Overall, it feels like a quality piece that can take a beating.  Adding to the sense of sturdiness is the significant weight of the DeWalt.  When you first pick it up it can seem almost absurdly heavy, but thankfully it balances well in use and the weight almost seems to disappear.The DeWalt is very easy to use.  You just pop in the battery, release the trigger safety, and then pull the trigger.  Once the battery dies you simply place it on the charger and a few hours later it's ready to go again.  On the battery itself is a 3-led status meter to keep an eye on the charge level.Speaking of, the battery packs a serious punch.  The DeWalt is very powerful and made easy work of my shrubbery and tree branches.  It cuts through new growth, old growth, and dead growth with ease.  There was only one time it got jammed, and it recovered instantly.  The battery also lasts a long time.  I used the DeWalt for 15 minutes of continuous use and it was still indicating a full battery.  You can easily complete most yards in one charge.As I mentioned before the DeWalt balances nicely and the rubberized handles are large and easy to grip.  The 22"" blade makes it easy to reach far off branches and complete the top of most hedges in one pass.  It's also not very loud.  You can't really converse over it, but you won'r need to wear ear protection, although you may want to consider protecting your eyes, as branches can sometimes go flying.  Overall, it's a pleasure to work with.All in all... a powerful yard work buddy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141QO4XDHD2N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF02T3M#wasThisHelpful","R141QO4XDHD2N3","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kitchen Aid’s 14-Cup food processor is powerful, versatile, and well made.The Kitchen Aid is a large machine.  It positively dwarfs my older 7-cup Kitchen Aid food processor, and just about makes it underneath my kitchen cabinets.  It’s made entirely of plastic, but feels very solid and well assembled.  The bowls and the accessories are very robust and dense feeling.  The only quality snafu I noticed is that the buttons on the front feel a bit spongy, I’d prefer them to have a more positive feel when pressed.The Kitchen Aid includes an extensive array of attachments and accessories.  There is the 14-cup large bowl and a smaller 7-cup bowl that nests inside the larger one.  There are also two standard blades, a dough blade, a reversible grating disc, an adjustable slicing disc, and a small brush for cleaning smaller parts of the processor.  Thoughtfully Kitchen Aid includes an organizing storage container so you won’t have food processor pieces scattered throughout the kitchen.  Also included with this Kitchen Aid is a dicing kit.  It consists of a storage container, a dicing tray, a spinning blade, and a food removal tool.  As you can see, this Kitchen Aid is very versatile.Using the Kitchen Aid couldn’t be easier.  You simply lock the bowl into place, choose your chopping blade, lock the lid, and turn it on.  A nice touch is that this Kitchen Aid had not only has your typical on and pulse function, but also it also lets you choose between high and low speeds when not pulsing.  You can you the low speed for softer foods and the high speed for denser items.  It performed admirably and chopped up all sorts of foods without issue or mess.  The slicing and grating discs also worked well, and you can adjust the thickness of the slicing disc externally, and on the fly, with the sliding control on the front of the Kitchen Aid.  The large feed tube has a two-piece pusher so you can have a small opening for narrow items (carrots) and a larger opening for bulkier ones (blocks of cheese).The dicing kit also works well.  To use it you insert the dicing tray into the large bowl and connect the rotating dicing blade to the accessory shaft, then turn the Kitchen Aid on and insert your food into the spout.  It works quickly and easily.  The dices it produces are around the size of M&Ms and uniform in shape.  Unfortunately, you can’t adjust the size of the dice, and you’ll need to clean out the dicing grid with the included tool frequently, since food gets trapped in there.  Food will also get trapped in the rotating blade and lid.  Additionally, when dicing soft and fleshy foods there will be some juice spray out of the top feed tube.  I find the dicing tool to be very convenient when you have a lot of food to dice, but probably not something I’ll use to dice one or two items.The Kitchen Aid is quiet when operating, especially for a food processor, and thanks to the large rubber feet on the bottom, also very steady and stable.  The motor is powerful and I had no issues chopping, shredding, and dicing a multitude of foods.Cleaning up is a snap.  All of the pieces are dishwasher safe, and there are very few places for food to get trapped.  Be aware though that the large bowl may not fit in the top rack of some dishwashers.  Kitchen Aid also recommends that you do not use a high temperature rinse in the dishwasher.  I’ve washed everything multiple times in my Bosch dishwasher with the high temperature rinse and have not had any issues, but your mileage may vary.My previous food processor was also a Kitchen Aid.  I bought it in 2006 and it’s never given me any issues, so I trust that this one will also be trouble free.  If that’s not the case I’ll be sure to update this review.In additional to this Kitchen Aid I’ve had extensive experience with Breville’s 14-cup sous chef food processor and can say that they are both very capable machines.  I find the Breville to be a bit more compact, quieter, and have nicer controls, but the Kitchen Aid has the dicing kit, two speeds, and an externally adjustable slicing thickness.All in all… a powerhouse processor.9/17/15 Update: I've used the processor quite a bit more since the initial review.  I'd say I use it about once a week.  I've made pizza and pasta dough in it as well, using the dough blade.  Everything comes out great, and it continues to perform well.  It also has been washed in the dishwasher many, many times more with no issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4G1SSHMLC7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEWUQHA#wasThisHelpful","R1E4G1SSHMLC7K","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kate Spade's Metro watch is very nicely made, looks great, and gets lots of compliments.Let's get something out of the way first... the size of this watch.  If you're petite you may find that this watch is a bit cumbersome.  To put it in perspective my mother is 5'0"" tall and 100 pounds with a small bone structure, and the watch face pretty much covers her wrist completely.  Additionally, the band, even on the smallest size, is still a bit too loose.  Now, I'm not considering any of these issues to be demerits for the watch, but I just wanted to give you some perspective.With all of that said, the watch is not heavy or bulky.  It's quite thin and very light.  In fact, you can barely tell that you're wearing it... until someone compliments you on it, and they will.It's quite an attractive watch and people will notice, and appreciate, it.  The colors are very subtle and warm, and the watch will go with most looks.  The crystals that surround the face are very brilliant and well set.  There are also crystals making up each of the hour markers, save the 12 o'clock position, which is a spade.  There's also a spade on the crown, which is a nice touch.  The rose gold case and leather band are also well done.  Overall, it's a stylish and quality time piece.The face of the watch is large and clear and makes telling time easy.  It's also rated 3ATM water resistant.All in all... a wonderful, beautiful watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQ6Q0FFYOUBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX8ELJS#wasThisHelpful","R2IQ6Q0FFYOUBC","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ullu's leather iPhone 5/5s case is very nicely made, and feels awesome in the hand, but it's not going to protect a phone that gets dropped a lot.The ullu case has a plastic base over which real leather is applied.  Therefore the inside of the case is done in a rubberized plastic, while the outside is done in supple, high-quality leather.  The case fits my iPhone 5s perfectly and leaves plenty of space to access the various ports and buttons.  The case is easy to put on and also remove when necessary.The case feels great in the hand.  The leather is soft and dense and give a nice grippy surface so your phone does not slide out of your hand in use.  In a world where there are literally thousands of cases made for the iPhone, the ullu stands out for it great feel and quality.This case will offer modest protection, but since it doesn't have a lip that extends above the screen, the screen is still vulnerable to breaking and scratching.  Thankfully, a screen protector film is included.  Moreover, the top and bottom of the case are completely open.  Still, if you tend to treat you iPhone well and only need something for the occasional drop onto softer surfaces, this case should fit the bill.All in all... a great feeling and looking case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2THTXNLWZ5G3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUYVX5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2THTXNLWZ5G3Z","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CobraCo's fire pit is easy to put together, feels study, and is quite attractive.The CobraCo comes in a large rectangular box.  It's not huge and should fit in most car trunks.  It is a bit heavy and ungainly to carry though.  Inside you'll find all of the pit's pieces, a package of bolts and nuts, and instructions.  The only tool you'll need to assemble it is a screwdriver.  The instructions are very simple, but so is the assembly process.  Just make sure you follow them exactly, especially the order of tightening the bolts.  Putting it together was a one person process and took me about 15 minutes.Once everything is assembled you'll find the fire pit is very sturdy and well made (the one exception being the mesh top, on mine it has some small dents).  The base is quite large so it would take a lot of effort to tip the fire pit over.  The basin that holds the fire sits nicely in the frame, as does the mesh top.  It's not overly heavy, but it's not something you'll want to bring in and out every time you use it.The fire pit's base is done in a scroll design and the finish is a rubbed/antique brass look.  The basin for the fire and screen are done in a matte black and they scratch fairly easily.  You can touch them up with fire-resistant touch up paint, the manual says, but it doesn't seem worth the effort.  You can also wash out the basin if you're so inclined.The pit is very large and would easily accommodate a group of four people sitting around it.Included with the pit are a grate to put on the bottom of the basin to keep the wood off of the bottom, a fire prodding stick, and a vinyl cover.All in all... a nice looking and well made fire pit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG485BRRLCGL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3GEH28#wasThisHelpful","RG485BRRLCGL7","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rinker Buck's The Oregon Trail is a great book for those who love travel-logs and American history, and since Mr. Buck's writing style is so enjoyable almost anyone can enjoy it.The book follows Mr. Buck as he decides he wants to travel the trail, has a wagon built, puts together his mule team, and negotiates with his eccentric brother, Nick, as to who will be doing what along the way.  Speaking of Nick, he has excellent knowledge about wagons, and his colorful personality offsets the more reserved and thoughtful demeanor of the author.The book is not only a travel-log, following the struggles and adventures they have while traveling the Oregon Trail in modern day American, but also a wonderful history lesson.  Usually I prefer my travel-logs to be more travel and less history lesson, but this book is about a 50/50 mix.  Thankfully the facts, stories, and historical journal entries used in the book are all well written, informative, and enjoyable.  You'll learn about who traveled the trail, how it came to be, all about wagons and mules, and much more.The writing style is light, fun, and witty.  It's not dry or boring, as some might imagine this topic could be.All in all... Having grown up playing The Oregon Trail on my old Windows 95 computer, and loving every minute of it, I immediately jumped at the chance to read this book and I'm very glad I did.  I bet you'll enjoy it to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FP21KY26G1VG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451659164#wasThisHelpful","R3FP21KY26G1VG","A1O229NVVDJUX2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O229NVVDJUX2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The notion of the “wheel of fortune” as a mediating force in the affairs of men dates to the Roman Republic or earlier, but it was especially popular in Europe in the 12th to 14th centuries. Individuals farther down the ladder could prosper and rise in society, but those closer to the top might also stumble and slide down through the ranks. In other words, medieval society wasn’t fossilized, as if often assumed, though all men were subject to the whims of fortune. Cheering on celebrity-toppling scandals is still a popular pastime -- the farther the fall, the more entertaining it is. Schadenfreude comes naturally.The bestowal of “nobility” itself was often seen as a gift of fortune, which meant that no one was safe. In England, beginning with the Conquest, royal favor was essential to acquiring real prosperity, and that’s always a chancy thing. Royal disfavor could destroy the most highly-placed aristocrat. This system of chance-based rise and fall of individuals and families reached its peak under the Tudors, who at least were generally competent at governing. After the failure of the Stewarts, and then the Commonwealth and the Glorious Revolution, the process became much more subtle, with success or failure of the nobility being spread over a much wider base of political decision-making.Bothwell is concerned with that earlier period, from William I through the Plantagenets, and with how those who fell from favor dealt with their changed circumstances, especially since giving sufficient annoyance to the king inevitably meant losing popularity with the rest of the upper class, and with the general populace. If you were out of favor, you were *really* out.What did being out of favor entail? One certainly would be banished from the court, perhaps allowed to retreat to a far estate and keep one’s head down pending future developments (assuming those estates weren’t forfeit to the Crown), or one could be exiled from the entire country. But changes in circumstances, or in policy, or the death of the monarch, or of one’s more powerful aristocratic enemies, could bring redemption and restoration to grace.The author examines a variety of cases during the nearly four centuries of his focus, from Simon de Montfort, Piers Gaveston, and several dukes of Norfolk, to Earl Waltheof, Robert de Vere, and Lady Oxford. Some kings, like the inadequate John and the weak Henry III, were constantly shuffling through their high-ranking retainers, advancing one while arresting and possibly executing another. (And if you had been really thoughtless in your dealings with the king, your body would be mutilated as well.)Each account is packed with detail, all of it with citations to both primary and secondary sources, and an extensive bibliography will lead the reader to further research. An excellent piece of political and social history and interpretation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPGRVI1T1QHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=071907522X#wasThisHelpful","R3UPGRVI1T1QHL","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve never heard of Ardman but this one came to my notice because I’m a long-time fan of alternate histories. What-if-ing is great intellectual fun -- if you do it right and play by the rules. Ardman has written some twenty books, nearly all of them workmanlike nonfiction, and has produced a number of television documentaries (and lots of commercials, apparently), but this appears to be his first attempt at fiction.It’s a straight-to-Kindle novel and the premise -- the Point of Departure -- is simple: What if the newly-elected is Lincoln in 1861 decided to just let the Southern states go rather than committing the country to a war in which he feared as many as 10,000 men might be killed? Now it’s 150 years later, the Confederacy is running out of steam, the U.S. has morphed into the North American Union by taking in Ontario, and Mexico took back Texas in 2005, though Hurricane Katrina prevented them from capturing NOLA as well. Things are heading for a three-way crisis and the long-time Good Ol’ Boy CSA president and the newly elected (and Black) NAU president decide to meet in person at a summit -- which hasn’t happened in more than a century. They both have long shared a dream, too -- the reunification of North and South. But how are they going to convince the people of their respective nations that it’s the best thing to do?As a novel, the book has problems, mostly in the clichéd characters and the attempts to reproduce regional speech patterns. Many of the interpersonal relationships are pretty predictable, though there are a few surprises there. And while the plot never gets out of control, the narrative style tends to wander from relatively sophisticated to rather nave.As a construct in alternate history, however -- the sort of thing a group of geeks might come up with over a long weekend -- it’s a pretty interesting set-up. Slavery has finally been eliminated in the South but Blacks are very much second-class citizens. The old-line plantation-owners, those who have run the CSA for generations now for their own ends, have finally accepted that their time is coming to an end. And Ardman seems to understand the cause and effects of these forces.However, there are also anomalies that an historian would catch: Since North America stayed out of the Great War, the Kaiser won and Germany is still the wealthiest and most powerful Western nation (which is one of the motivations for reunion: To make English-speaking North America a serious competitor) -- but the author refers to NAU President Callaway as “the leader of the free world.” Moreover, there was never a Hitler or a World War II (nor, apparently, a Bolshevik revolution), but there is nevertheless a global Internet, despite the fact that ARPA never existed. (Younger people might assume that this would be “inevitable,” but given the much slower pace of technological development, I don’t think I buy it.) There’s even a Google, and a Skype -- and under those names, too, though the author often plays with other products’ brand names. Laptops seem identical to those in our own 21st century, but would computers really have developed so rapidly and so far without the impetus of wartime and Cold War military spending? Again, he makes cultural assumptions for the purpose of his story without considering all the ramifications. (That’s why good alternate history is so difficult to do.)Having said all that, it’s not a *horrible* book. If you like alternate history yarns, you’ll probably enjoy this one. Ardman is at least as good a writer as Turtledove in this field -- though that might not be saying much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZ5MX7C8IFID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYHSCEI#wasThisHelpful","RQZ5MX7C8IFID","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been twenty-one previous novels featuring DCI Alan Banks of Yorkshire CID and they’ve generally been quite good, earning the author a number of honors and literary awards. Banks is a fully rounded character, now facing his last few years before retirement, and the homicide squad he has slowly built up is his pride and joy, staffed by characters who are also nicely developed and interesting. Of special interest is DI Annie Cabbot, once Banks’s lover and now his strong right hand, and who is gradually making her way back psychologically from having been shot a few books back. The six-foot-tall Jamaican Detective Sergeant, Winsome Jackman, also gets a larger part this time out. The plot is a straightforward procedural this time, beginning with the theft of a large and very expensive tractor from a local farmer (more of a hobbyist, having retired from a banking career in the City of London). At the same time, human blood is found at a deserted air hanger, and a young man who apparently witnessed something he shouldn’t have is on the run for his life. His girlfriend and her young son are under threat from the people who want to find him, and Annie takes the younger woman under her wing as well as providing protection. The two incidents, of course, gradually blend into a single, rather sprawling case involving illegal slaughtering, a murder committed with a rather bizarre weapon, a deadly crash in a mountain pass that reveals unexpected human body parts, and a wide range of rural crime.In many ways, this is a somewhat routine adventure for Banks and his crew, but that’s not really a criticism. The narrative adheres closely to the real world of police work and that makes it believable. And Robinson does a very professional job of telling the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TVGN7AUI8QT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0VXO4U#wasThisHelpful","R2TVGN7AUI8QT6","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lady Georgiana Rannoch is thirty-fourth in line for the British throne but the fact that she’s a card-carrying aristocrat doesn’t means she’s wealthy, or even eating regularly -- especially since it’s late winter 1933 and nearly everyone, including her, is out of work. (Not that her toffee-nosed relatives approve of her working in the first place, of course.) She’s been trying, since the beginning of this delightful series, to make her own way in London, but it looks like she’s going to have to fall back to the family castle in Scotland to survive when her half-brother (the duke) and sister-in-law decide to escape to the Riviera for awhile. Then the Queen (who has come to depend on Georgie’s loyalty and willingness to perform confidential little errands) sends her off to Nice to try to retrieve a very valuable snuffbox that was pinched from Buckingham Palace by an upstart baronet auto manufacturer, and she gets to ride the Blue Train after all. On the way, she makes the acquaintance of Coco Chanel, who is throwing a fashion show and who recruits Georgie as an amateur runway model. And she ends up at a villa owned by her mother, a still-beautiful ex-actress, just up the hill from where the wayward baronet is staying -- is then promptly killed in his own swimming pool.Bowen writes amusing mysteries, a superior sort of fluff, but she does it well. Georgie is an observant and sympathetic character and the setting is well-handled and pretty accurate. (And, yes, Chanel really was doing a show on the Côte d'Azur at that time.) The regular supporting cast (including the Prince of Wales and the abrasive Mrs. Simpson) are here, too. The clues are there but you probably won’t figure out whodunit before the big climax. And there’s her continuing but still tentative romance with the rakish Darcy O’Mara to keep things interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PGQTZNCIVZ9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1445886162#wasThisHelpful","R1PGQTZNCIVZ9C","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since discovering _French Milk,_ her first graphic work, several years ago, I’ve become a solid fan of Lucy Knisley (“Nighsley,” silent “K”). She doesn’t do superheroes or abstract philosophy but concentrates almost entirely on retelling the events of her own life and experiences and what she’s learned from them. She’s had the sort of adventures any of us might have had, but she thinks a lot harder about what they mean. This volume, her second, is rather different. After high school (four schools in four years -- the subject of an upcoming book), she went back to Chicago to the Art Institute for her BFA. She meant to study painting but she ended up doing comics and these mostly short visual essays tell the story of her widely varied experiences, from “hourly journal” assignments to quirky ruminations on her friends and classmates, and also on the city itself. It’s an interesting read because she was just beginning to figure things out and so her style changes almost from one page to the next.The longest piece, “Bookshop: Three Days to Closing,” is also possibly the best -- and not autobiographical. (I don’t think.) Other highlights include “The Drama King,” about the only fight she was ever in -- against a boy. (And she won, sort of.) Immediately after the Art Institute, she went off to do a graduate degree at the Center for Cartoon Studies in Vermont, a very small and isolated school, which led to cabin fever, which led to an expedition to the nearest outlet mall. “Un-Learning Curve” takes you through that adventure and has some good points to make. And then there’s the unnamed story about being stuck in an elevator with a nice boy and an impossible older sister on the way to have wedding photos made. Very nice. And I especially like “Boys’ Dorm,” about a reverse panty raid in a co-ed private school.This probably isn’t the best book to start with, but if you’re already familiar with Lucy’s award-winning work, it’s a great way to find out where she came from and how she got there. And it will bring back memories for anyone who has slogged through art school.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21AHJ16HW41E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979882850#wasThisHelpful","R21AHJ16HW41E7","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m well into this long-running detective series now, featuring the working-class Detective Chief Superintendent “Fat Andy” Dalziel (not pronounced the way it looks, but only Scots and Yorkshiremen know that, probably), and DI Peter Pascoe, a university graduate. And I’ve gotten to know the main continuing characters and the way their minds work. You can depend on Dalziel to be demanding, boorish, and just a little bit on the margin of what’s legally or professionally acceptable, and you can expect the (relatively) liberal Pascoe to suffer from his boss’s actions. A third important player has joined the regular cast now in the person of Ellie, Pascoe’s sometimes strident and always independent wife, a university lecturer (except the school is about to close down) and mother of their infant daughter, Rose. Ellie is loyal and supportive but she’s also very much her own person and she has a justifiably low opinion of Dalziel. (Who, to be fair, asks for it with his paternalistic, anti-feminist attitudes.)This episode is rather different, in that it’s not clear for most of the book that any crime has even been committed. Dick Elgood, the founder and head of a small kitchen-and-bathroom fixtures empire, thinks there have been some unexplained deaths among his upper management, and he’s suspicious of Patrick Aldermann, an account of very average abilities, who has seemed to benefit from all of them. (He spends far more time and effort on his gardens and especially his cultivation of new rose varieties than on his job.) Elgood asks his old buddy, Dalziel, to look into things, and Pascoe gets the job of quietly snooping around and asking questions. Aldermann has a wife in the classic English country mold, who happenstantially becomes acquainted with Ellie and the two women become semi-friends and part-time antagonists in interesting ways. Then a couple more people die and suddenly Pascoe is taking a much closer look at the circumstances, while Elgood equally suddenly is trying to call them off.It’s a well-done caper with deeply developed characters, interesting interrelationships, and plenty of the author’s nicely dry humor, and I recommend it unreservedly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QTLR1P08N83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934609595#wasThisHelpful","R13QTLR1P08N83","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chief Superintendent Dalziel and Inspector Pascoe are back, this time in a rather sophisticated case -- or a collection of related case, actually. The trigger is the nearly concurrent deaths of three elderly men one freezing winter night, one apparently of exposure in a vacant field, one brutally murdered in his bath, and one knocked off his bicycle by a car in which a heavily inebriated Dalziel says he was a passenger, though witnesses say he may have been the driver. Pascoe gets the call-out on all three -- he’s spending a lot of time at the hospital this time around -- but only the bathtub murder really draws his attention. The Deputy Chief Constable (whom Dalziel regularly gives headaches to) is trying to keep a lid on the possible DUI and wants Fat Andy on the sidelines with his head down, but we know that isn’t going to happen. On the other hand, there are hints that Dalziel may have a finger in some iffy importing from the Continent, just to help out an old friend, and Pascoe doesn’t like that at all.Nobody’s getting much sleep this time, and Ellie Pascoe is having to deal with her own aging father’s gradual slide into dementia (the fact that she admits she doesn’t quite know what to do is shocking to her husband, to whom she’s the steadfast pillar of his life). And there’s the hotel restaurant chef/manager who probably knows a good deal more about everything than he lets one. And there’s the murdered man’s grandson, now in the army in Germany, who has a fiancée who’s a real piece of work. And there’s growing evidence that the dead man in the field may have been attacked. It’s a complicated skein of events, some connected and some not, and Hill does a very good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGS8O6WGMSEX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934609609#wasThisHelpful","RGS8O6WGMSEX7","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was Rendell’s last novel -- her 65th in fifty years of published work -- and it’s a good one. It’s marketed as a “murder mystery,” but that’s not really true since we know from the outset who killed the adulterous young wife and her lover back in the summer of 1944. But the murder, and the rediscovery of the victims’ amputated hands as symbolic revenge, is really only the catalyst that brings back together in an ensemble drama the now-elderly Londoners who played together as kids in the last year of the war: Michael, Alan, Rosemary (whom Alan eventually married), Lewis (who became a doctor), and the Batchelor kids, most of whom shared in a construction firm. And Daphne, of course, the precocious sexual focus of the group, and “the girl next door.” They all played in the “tunnels” on the hill all that summer until a parent chased them away.It was Michael Winwood’s mother who disappeared and he was told by his father that she had run off. And then he himself was shunted off to live with an aunt. Now Michael is a widower in his eighties who still hasn’t come to terms with his wife’s death, and his father, John, whom he hasn’t seen in sixty years, is nearing his hundredth birthday. After having done some laboring as a young man, John resolved never to work at a job again, and he found three wealthy wives to allow him to do that, as we learn as the story progresses, with the ex-kids remembering their youth and rediscovering their old playmates, and the young detective deciding none of this matters because everybody’s old anyway.Much of the book, though, focuses on Alan, whose life, as he sees it, “hadn’t been unhappy, only dull.” And when he meets up Daphne again after many years, he wants only to resume their torrid affair from before he married Rosemary. His wife doesn’t deal well with being abandoned (she has trouble accepting change of any kind) but she’ll eventually learn to cope with it -- and Alan will come to regret that. The author uses the relationships of Alan, Rosemary, and Daphne to make a distinction between growing old and growing up, and watching the group interact can be uncomfortable for an older reader -- which tells me that Rendell pretty much nailed it. It’s not at all a conventional thriller and it’s a good one for the author to be going out with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZYTIJZYS8R0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWTWH1G#wasThisHelpful","R27ZYTIJZYS8R0","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the middle volume of a historical fiction/almost-fantasy/alternate history trilogy, and it fills that function quite well. The first volume of a trilogy introduces the plot and the characters and the closing volume answers the questions, resolves the problems, and ties everything up. The middle volume has to advance the narrative, to explain to the reader why all this is important, but it's allowed to close with a cliffhanger. The middle volume is frequently the weakest part of a three-decker, but not this time.The story began in The Hammer and the Cross with a depiction of Northern Europe in the 9th century, the world of Ragnar Lothbrok and Alfred the Great, but it adds in the Way, a sort of evangelical Norse-myth-based religion that has a bone to pick with the invasion of Christianity. And it bringsin Shef, a young peasant, half-English and half-Danish, who is destined (literally) to change the world.The author paints the Church as a very unpleasant institution to be under the thumb of, as its English slaves can testify, and in that he's entirely correct. Not that the old Norse beliefs were any less bloody-minded (though much more pessimistic), but the priests of the Way, who work for a living, may be able to find a balance between them.So Shef has killed Ivar the Boneless, one of the most vicious semi-fictional characters you're likely to come across. He has become head of an Anglo-Norse army determined to defeat the rest of the Ragnarsson brothers. And he has become Jarl of East Anglia and a close ally of Alfred, the new king of Wessex, who has driven the Church out of his country. All of this was accomplished largely because Shef has a very technologically inventive mind, and now he has designed a new kind of warship, a ""battle-ship,"" which includes the catapults that were so effective in his earlier campaigns. And his English recruits -- nothing like the individualistic Viking warriors, who sneer at them -- have become a force to be reckoned with, armed with halberds and rapid-loading crossbows.Shef's intention is to bring the Ragnarssons to battle on the sea, therefore protecting England, but in the first half-successful skirmish, he gets separated from his ship and finds himself embarking on an extended journey into the far North. At the same time, the German bishops who are slowly taking control of the Church (via assassination much of the time) have instituted an elite armed force, the Lanzenorden, to protect Christian priests who venture into pagan territory. But their real quest is to locate the Holy Lance with which the Roman soldier (a German) killed Christ on the cross. And that appears to have disappeared into the North, too.The overarching theme this time is the ""king's way,"" the path any man who wants to be (or remain) king in the Northern lands must follow to prove his right to rule. And Shef is following that path, though he doesn't realize it until nearly the end. The Way has a prophecy regarding a coming King of the North, and maybe Shef is it.Harry's writing is clear and to the point and even when he brings in bits of fantasy about quasi-trolls, he makes the whole thing perfectly believable. The characters are nicely developed, from the English soldiers who have acquired pride and taught larger warriors to respect them, to Viga Brand, ""Killer Brand,"" whose personality is undergoing a slow shift, but who is still one scary son of a bitch. Have the closing volume ready to hand, because you will want to go straight to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDL2O470T4YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KP3QFS#wasThisHelpful","R3MDL2O470T4YZ","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel of Mid-Yorkshire CID (pronounced ""Dee-ell"" -- I think) is a large, sloppy-looking person -- his recent diet has gotten him down to 250 pounds -- but he has a brain that can spot a motive or a specious excuse a furlong away. His right-hand, the recently promoted DI Peter Pascoe, is off on his honeymoon and Dalziel, having just departed the wedding down in Oxfordshire, is trying to take everyone's advice by going off on a relaxing little holiday.It's been raining a lot, though, and his old car floods out, so he has to make his way (by punt) to refuge at a nearby country estate that has seen far better days. There's just been what seems to be an accidental death of the master of the house, though the widow doesn't seem to be taking it too hard. She just keeps working, along with her son, daughter, and a few of their friends and investors on renovating one of the out-buildings as a ""Medieval Banqueting Hall,"" with an eye to the tourist dollar.Dalziel finds himself becoming involved, even though it's not his patch and he's not even on duty, and the local CID isn't thrilled to have him stirring things up. And various of the estate's residents, both family and employees, are acting suspiciously. Maybe that death wasn't an accident after all. And maybe Dalziel ought not to get too personally involved with the widow.This isn't a bad story, though it sort of reeks of the 1970s in many ways and follows many of the tropes common to classic ""country house"" mysteries -- though with a decidedly plebian twist.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNRZM41BZMERA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934609323#wasThisHelpful","RNRZM41BZMERA","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A fellow graphic-novel fan recommended this one to me but I'm afraid I have to question his judgment. It's the old problem: Good writing with mediocre art, or vice versa. The setting is 19th-century London (re-imagined, sort of) and the main character is Pharaoh Imhotep IV, now a museum mummy, but somehow abroad in the streets in top hat and tails. He's escorting Lillian, the young woman of the title, who doesn't get out much, and they get caught up in an unintended murder, and Imhotep's relationship with his father (the III), and she gets kidnapped, and Imhotep (both of them) haves to rescue her, and there's a trial, and a jail-break, and Queen Victoria gets thrown in the Thames. Yeah.It's all more than a little confusing, with the action coming out of nowhere in particular and going nowhere in particular, and the dialogue is rather clunky for the most part. It was first published in France in 1997, so maybe the translator is to blame. Guibert's artwork isn't bad, but there's not really much story to hang it on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZFQN8RAOOJ2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159643130X#wasThisHelpful","R1ZFQN8RAOOJ2K","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Subtitled ""A Novel of Obsession,"" I had my doubts about this one at first. It started out rather like a ""women's novel"" (sorry), with a recently widowed book conservator and dealer relocating from North Carolina to a village in Oxfordshire to escape his ghosts. But it soon turns into a full-bore romp involving the authorship of Shakespeare's plays, the arcane world of bibliomania, and the history of collectors with money to spend. But Lovett also deals with the nature of grief and how to survive it, and the nascent love story that creeps in toward the end is very nicely, and realistically, handled.Peter Byerly is a born bookman, as he discovers his first semester in college. He's always been reclusive, a loner -- partly because of his drunken parents, partly because of his own neuroses -- and hiding out in the library is his idea of heaven. (As a lifelong librarian and book-junky, I can relate to that feeling very easily.) And then he meets Amanda, a year younger, for whom he falls very heavily. She's a very different sort of person -- and wealthy, too -- but they turn out to be the perfect couple. But nothing lasts and suddenly she's gone.Moving to the English cottage they had only recently acquired was Peter's way of hiding out once again, but then he discovers a 19th-century watercolor tucked inside a book that appears to be his late wife. No, this isn't a time-travel romance, and the watercolor will take a back seat to a further discovery -- one that will answer once and for all the questions regarding William Shakespeare the London playwright and Mr. Shakspeare the Stratford businessman. The story is told in alternating sections set in the 1980s (how Peter and Amanda met and got together), the 16th to 19th centuries (as a certain important and amazing book makes its way down to us), and the present day (as Peter unravels the puzzle and deals with the implications -- and a couple of murders. And he manages to get his life back under control, too.For a first novel (though he has apparently been writing children's plays for years), this is a very well written book. The plotting is well handled, the dialogue rings true, and the emotional aspects are adult and believable. And Lovett is himself a former antiquarian bookseller with what is obviously a deep understanding of his field -- which is to say, I found nothing to pick nits about regarding the hypnotic world of books. He apparently has several more out now and I'll be interested to see if he can do it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QHRH2OCLVF9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143125389#wasThisHelpful","R2QHRH2OCLVF9M","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mina has a knack for taking a novel, supposedly a single story, and reworking it as a cluster of related and converging stories, each with its own principal characters, its own interrelationships, its own plotline. The POV person in one will be a supporting player in one or more of the others. It ends up as a symphony in which you can pay attention to just the brass or just the woodwinds, but the experience as a whole will be greater than the sum of the parts. That's a talent many other writers should be jealous of.She first attracted notice with her ""Garnethill"" trilogy, set in her native Glasgow, a very good mystery series that was also an exercise in grittiness. This new series, featuring Detective Sergeant Alex Morrow of Glasgow CIS, is quite different but also excellent. We met her in _Still Midnight,_ when her marriage and personal life was falling apart, all while she struggled to solve a kidnapping before it turned into a murder, and also had to deal with a real idiot of a fast-tracked colleague.In this second helping, Morrow is still a very tough nut but she's beginning to get her life together. She's back with her husband (the split wasn't his fault, or anyone's, really), and she's pregnant with twins (and loving it), though that colleague, DS Bannerman, has been promoted over her (it was inevitable). He no longer cares about trying to get along with anyone junior to him, just impressing those above him. And making it into the papers as often as possible. And there's lots of potential publicity for Bannerman in this case.Sarah Erroll, a young woman living alone in a big, old country house (the surrounding land has now been subdivided and developed) is found stomped to death at the bottom of her staircase. Bannerman, who has no imagination, thinks it was just a random break-in that went bad -- but that's before half a million Euros is found hidden under the kitchen table. While doing the preliminary investigation, Alex discovers the dead woman's daily house-cleaner is Kay Murray, a woman she grew up with in their working-class neighborhood, now a single mother, and that rekindled relationship becomes one of the plotlines.Meanwhile, the multimillionaire head of a financial company down south hangs himself on his front lawn, to absolutely no sympathy from anyone. He was directly responsible for the loss of many people's savings and was on the point of being indicted, so he offs himself and leaves a note blaming his wife. He's been abusing her and his two kids all their lives (another plotline there), and they all actually celebrate his demise with great relief. But we know from the outset that the fifteen-year-old son, Thomas, who attends a private school up in Perth, had a direct part in Sarah's murder, along with his buddy, Squeak. We just don't know how and Mina makes you work for it.And then there's Morrow's brother, Danny, one of Glasgow's more successful gangsters, with whom she has as little contact these days as she can manage, and her connection with whom she keeps a tight secret from everyone except her husband. But Kay also knows him, from the old days, and that becomes yet another converging plotline. Because everything here does eventually come together. Everything is connected to everything else. And while there's no happy ending (except maybe for Kay), everything is more or less satisfactorily resolved. A terrific piece of writing, and the series continues, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT26F3AWRUG7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316069345#wasThisHelpful","RT26F3AWRUG7M","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourth volume in what was (I think) originally meant to be a trilogy, and it's not a bad wind-up to the series. Still, it suffers from the same absence of Sir Terry's off-the-wall brand of humor as the first three books. If you hadn't seen the title page, you might be hard put to identify him as one of the authors, which makes me think the ideas mostly came from Pratchett and the actual, not-very-inspired writing from Baxter.All the previous major characters are here, plus some new ones. There's Joshua Valiente, the poster boy for ""stepping""(traveling by augmented mental effort into adjacent, alternate Earths, mostly heavily forested and none with native humans in them), who, over the past forty years, has become the Official Folk Hero of the Long Earth. There's Lobsang, the self-aware computer system/cyborg in multiple ambulant units, who also claims to be the reincarnation of a Tibetan motorbike mechanic, and who is almost too intelligent to tolerate. There's Sally Linsay, ""Queen of the Long Earth,"" an extreme loner with frequent fits of vigilantism, and probably the most talented ""natural stepper"" alive (she doesn't even need the potato, even though it was her father who invented the stepper box). There's Agnes, once ""Sister Agnes,"" the nun who raised Joshua at the children's home in Madison, but whom Lobsang resurrected after her death and installed in a cyborg body similar to his own. There's Roberta, one of the first of the Next -- the post-homo sapiens grooming themselves to take over the multiple Earths, and whom Sally helped to rescue in the previous book. And now there's young Stan Berg, perhaps the most powerful of the Next yet born, but he doesn't want any part of their program. He just wants to preach what amounts to a new humanist religion.And there are the drifters, the ""combers,"" who just throw out civilization altogether and go off ""into the green."" To them, it's all a kind of endless now, where location and time don't really matter. Weather turning ugly? Just step into the next Earth, or to one a few thousand steps away. Want to be a pioneer? Pick a world you like and go.But the literally earth-shaking explosion of the Yellowstone caldera a few years before has brought about the beginnings of a new ice age to Datum Earth. Now it's 2059 and the English Channel is filled with icebergs, Paris has the climate of Lapland, and everyone who can has fled to refugee camps in the Low Earths. (Not everyone is cut out for pioneering.) Human society has changed completely in little more than a single generation. And now there's a new threat to the survival of the Long Earth from a completely unexpected and thoroughly alien direction, and it involves Von Neumann replicators and a Dyson motor. And not everyone we've come to know will survive the solution to the problem.It's not a bad book, though the emergency everyone has to deal with the second half seems a bit contrived and coincidental. Occasionally stiff plotting has been a problem all along with this series. The writing, though humorless as noted, is reasonably competent and professional. But where I re-read all the Discworld stories every few years, I think I'm unlikely to do that with the Long Earth.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQBU4CDKFJHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062297333#wasThisHelpful","RKQBU4CDKFJHB","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As both an historian and an archivist, I've long been fascinated by Domesday Book, the oldest surviving government-produced document in the English-speaking world, ordered by the Conqueror and completed about 1087 -- a surprisingly short time. It was part-census, part-inquest, compiled to establish a base for taxation and to record the pre- and post-Conquest control of the land in detail. And even though the information it provides is highly compacted and abbreviated (and even though certain parts of the country are entirely omitted, including London), it provides a fascinating look at the country from the ground up.But in 2000, Roffe published a book questioning the assumptions of the past 900 years regarding the real motivations behind the Domesday project, and the uproar in certain corners of academia has continued ever since. This present volume is the author's attempt to answer his critics, to evaluate relevant recent scholarship, and to expand on his earlier points with new evidence and interpretations.His main point being, the intentions behind the gathering of all that data aren't necessarily the same as the motives of those who actually put Domesday Book together. The first thing that made me think of as a point of comparison is the U.S. Census, which is gathered every ten years for the explicit purpose of apportioning Congressional representation. But the data has also been subsequently published for at least the past century and a half for the use of historians and sociologists, not to mention genealogists, who motives are quite different from those of the Census Bureau.The result here is a frequently technical but understandable analysis of every aspect of Domesday -- how the original inquest worked, how and why the questions the surveyors asked were selected, had happened to the gathered material (there's more than one copy, and they're all a little different), how the country was divided, what the relationships were between various local authorities, the meaning of the manor and of ""service,"" how values were assigned to land in different areas and how disputes on this matter were handled, the structure of lordship among the large post-Conquest landowners, and the effects of Domesday from a long perspective.Some basic understanding of medieval England is necessary -- this is not a picture book for sating a casual interest -- but it's really not a difficult read. I only wish some maps had been included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SVQ6H7BVWV0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1843833077#wasThisHelpful","R2SVQ6H7BVWV0S","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The late Harry Harrison is best known for his rather tongue-in-cheek science fiction, especially the ""Deathworld"" and ""Stainless Steel Rat"" series. But he also had a more straightforward side, as with this first volume in a trilogy set in 9th-century England, and focusing on the invasion of the Viking Great Army, led by the four sons of the murdered Ragnar Lothbrok. Ragnar is considered by some to be a semi-mythical person but his offspring and descendants were certainly real enough, and they took a gruesome revenge on Aella of Northumberland.But the main character of the story is Shef, a thrall (slave), whose mother was a local lord's lady in East Anglia, raped by a Danish raider twenty years before. His mother's husband loathes him for all he represents, and so does his half-brother, the heir, and both of them make sure he knows it. (""Shef"" is a dog's name.) And then there's Godive, gotten by the lord on a concubine, which means Shef and the girl have no actual blood-tie. It's complicated.When the Great Army shows up, Shef's English ""father"" is captured and treated horrendously, and Godive is abducted. Shef pretends to go over to the invaders in order to penetrate their camp and effect a rescue, but one thing leads to another, and before long he's an accepted member of a crew. More important, he finds he has a natural military sense, a shrewd command of strategy and tactics, and visions of revolutionary new weapons -- all of which seem to come from his dreams, which take him to the halls of the Norse gods.And at this point, you begin to realize that (obvious fictional characters aside) the author is actually writing an alternate history novel. These Vikings are far more tenacious than in our history. They're highly independent and individualistic, but they also manage to function cooperatively with a high degree of success. And there's an Norse evangelical movement, started a couple of centuries before, the priests of which are warriors and craftsmen themselves, and whose goal is to fight the repressive and obscenely wealthy Christian Church. (There's no doubt about Harry's opinions on *that* subject.)Shef makes possible the capture of York, and the defeat of the Mercian king, who is trying to move into the power vacuum in Norfolk. He frees, recruits, and trains other English slaves who have no love for the Church. He becomes first a carl -- a free soldier -- and then a jarl, or earl. He makes common cause with Alfred, the new king of Wessex, who is also having problems with the gold-and-power-mad Christian priests. And then he has to deal with an entirely new invasion from the Continent, promulgated by the pope and led by Charles the Bald.This world is going to be very different from our own, and Harry does an excellent and highly accurate job with the social setting, the complex politics, the psychology of the time, and the military details. It's a frequently bloodthirsty story, but that's how things were at the time. It's also an interesting contrast with Bernard Cornwell's more strictly historical treatment of the same period and many of the same events. I recommend you have the next two volumes ready to hand because you're going to want to know what happens next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DD407STSRDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KP3WD4#wasThisHelpful","R27DD407STSRDA","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Niven is one of those SF authors who, in my opinion, did excellent work when they were young and just starting out, but whose later efforts got lazy and rather sloppy. This volume brings together the five Beowulf Shaeffer stories published in the pulps in the 1960s and early '70s, plus one more written especially for this collection, which kind of brings it all to a conclusion. There's also a frame story (""Ghost"") to add connective tissue and provide coherency. And the whole series, of course, is set in ""Known Space"" -- the future that includes the Pierson's Puppeteers, the Ringworld, the wars with the Kzin, and the ARM (the U.N. military). These are mostly hard-science ""problem"" stories, the sort of thing ASTOUNDING and ANALOG used to offer, and which you don't really see much of anymore.""Neutron Star"" is a true classic, in which Beowulf, a skilled but currently unemployed space pilot from the colony world of We Made It, is blackmailed into doing a job for the puppeteers (one of the more interesting alien species ever invented) to approach and survey one of the few neutron stars ever invented. It killed the previous expedition, but Beowulf survives the experience through a combination of quick thinking and dumb luck. Then, in ""At the Core,"" the puppeteers, against all the odds, give him another commission -- to take their newly designed super-fast ship (they have a functional monopoly on spacecraft hulls) and take a close-up look at the center of our galaxy. And what he discovers there is enough to cause the puppeteers to pack up and flee -- and take their planets with them.""Flatlander"" introduces the hyper-wealthy Elephant (his ancestor invented the transport booth), who becomes Beowulf's best friend on Earth, and the two of them go off on an adventure to check out what the Outsiders (another odd alien species) claim is the ""most peculiar"" planet around. Quick thinking saves them again, but the ARM is beginning to take an interest in our Beowulf. In ""Grendel,"" he gets involved in the kidnapping of a famous alien artist and its aftermath and not only foils the plot itself  but rescues the victim. ""The Borderland of Sol"" is about space pirates who have found a way to yank a ship right out of hyperspace, and Beowulf's plan to identify them and stop them. (This is the last of the original stories and it isn't quite as good as the others.)Finally, there's the new story, ""Procrustes,"" which is less a science problem story (though there are a lot of problems to be solved along the way) and more about Beowulf trying to protect his family and get them all out from under the scrutiny of ARM. It flows nicely into the frame story, too. All in all, this is a collection well worth the reading, especially since Niven manages to wrestle them into nearly a continuous narrative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJNIRCXB0TTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345381688#wasThisHelpful","R2IJNIRCXB0TTQ","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lucy is one of my favorite cartoonists, and has been since I discovered _French Milk_ a few years ago. She doesn't do superheroes or any of that. She does real people, mostly herself, living real life, with an autobiographical concentration on food (her parents are a chef and a gourmet) and travel (which, even in her late 20s, she still gets nervous about). This one, set in 2011, revolves around her invitation to be a featured guest at the Raptus comics fest in Bergen, Norway. She was having an opportunistic affair with a handsome Swedish vegetarian mathematician (who also used to dance professionally) who was visiting in New York, and she figured she could work in a visit to him in Stockholm. And see some friends who were honeymooning in Berlin. And another friend working in wine in Beaune. And some time with her mother, who was vacationing in Royan, on the Bay of Biscay. And another few days with the Norwegian in Paris before returning home.Travel is important, she says, because ""it unhomes you."" You need new experiences, and those are best gotten in entirely new surroundings. Lucy, in fact, has been traveling periodically most of her life, but she's not sure it's working. Especially since she's still suffering from a two-year-old break-up and she's still in love with the guy. (Good news -- they finally got married in 2014.)So the book is largely an account of the stages in Lucy's European trip: The people she meets, the sights she sees, the things she pauses to reflect on and the insights she occasionally gains (""Love is complicated; I'm not sure I'm very good at it""), and, of course, her star turn at Raptus. Oh, and the title? ""The French have a saying for the time when you're young and experimenting with your lives and careers. They call it `L'Age License'. As in, license to experience, mess up, license to fail, license to do . . . whatever, before you're settled.""Her drawing style could be called ""gentle,"" and the words she puts with her art are a delight to read. You can't help thinking Lucy is the sort of person you would love to have as a friend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZMC05DZ6KFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606997688#wasThisHelpful","R3OZMC05DZ6KFQ","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been reading Grisham off and on for some time, but I haven't been systematic about it and I don't sit and wait for his latest. I just read the jacket copy and pick up whatever looks like an entertaining read at the moment.  This one, which kept me focused all the way through, is perhaps the best of his I've come across.The setting is Biloxi, down here on the Gulf Coast, and the subject is the latest multi-million-dollar civil suit against the tobacco companies by the widow of an addicted cigarette-smoker who died of lung cancer. On one side, a group of big-time tort specialists has each put up a million dollars of his own money to finance the attack, under the leadership of Wendall Rohr, the most successful of them all. And on the other side, the four largest manufacturers of cigarettes have a huge, secret slush fund to finance the defense. And they have Rankin Fitch to manage the whole thing. Fitch will fight as dirty as necessary to win -- he's done it in the last eight suits and his clients have never lost a dime in a judgment -- and he's perfectly willing to break the law in whatever way seems most useful. There's billions in profits at stake and the tobacco CEOs trust him to win for them yet again.But Fitch has never come up against a jury like this one. Nicholas Easter has gotten himself selected (he's been trying to get himself selected for years, moving around the country from one trial venue to the next, changing his name and registering to vote as soon as he gets there) and he's going to take these people exactly where he wants. He's a very convincing manipulator, even though he's on the side of the Angels. More or less. Though he'll bend the rules to the breaking point, too, to get what he wants. And Nicholas isn't alone, either.Grisham does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the various members of the jury, who represent the whole spectrum of society (as they are intended to), and who all are being closely studied by a large gang of expensive ""jury consultants"" on both sides. We learn their vulnerabilities as Fitch does, and we watch as he figures out who can be pressured, or frightened, or bribed, or blackmailed.  And we meet the trial team on each side in depth, and what drives them. (Money, mostly.) There's plenty of rather sly humor, too. What's more, even though the setting is nearly two decades ago now, it's very easy to believe that Big Tobacco still does work this way, which makes the story even better. And you'll learn a great deal about the physical consequences of smoking, if you didn't know already. (It's not difficult to pick sides in this story.)You won't be quite sure for most of the book about the true motivations of Nicholas and his co-conspirator, and even when you think you've figured it all out, Grisham throws in a few new twists that will make you stop and think. And that's true even in the last ten pages. Avery well-written and very entertaining read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30C5JVZ6XBIZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385472943#wasThisHelpful","R30C5JVZ6XBIZV","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of Grisham's lighter, non-courtroom yarns, and it's pretty good. Joel Backman (the wheeling-dealing lobbyist and power broker of the title) was about to go to trial for various sorts of bribery and international corruption six years ago, and was giving as good as he got, but then he suddenly pled guilty and practically fled to a federal prison for protection. Various other governments, both theoretically friendly and definitely otherwise, would like a piece of him, all because of a super-secret surveillance satellite system high-jacked by a group of hackers -- and to which Joel now has the only key.Now the President is about to leave office (having carried only Alaska during the election -- and that was only because he didn't visit that state during the campaign) and is sorting through the traditional stack of pardon requests. And Teddy Maynard, Director of the CIA (a loathsome type who has showed up in a couple of Grisham's other books) wants a pardon for Backman. They'll park him in Europe somewhere (safely off U.S. soil) and then wait to see who kills him. They expect to be able to draw various conclusions from this and Backman will be gone forever.So off he goes to northeastern Italy (an area the author himself is very fond of, no surprise), where he becomes ""Marco Lazzeri,"" Canadian by birth and Italian by ancestry, supposedly there on an extended vacation and to learn the language. His handlers plan to drug him and work him over to get the information they couldn't get six years ago, but Joel isn't stupid and he manages not only to keep a certain degree of freedom while he begins to figure things out, he also makes a couple of local friends. Prison has changed him and he doesn't want to be a power in Washington anymore. He just wants to be left alone -- and to stay alive. And the feds are definitely going to have their hands full.Grisham admits up front he doesn't know beans about satellites, or the technical side of intelligence (this was also made clear in _The Racketeer_), but it all sounds entirely plausible -- especially the casual attitude of the CIA toward killing American citizens as a matter of convenience. Even though Joel was not a nice person in his earlier life, he becomes very sympathetic in his post-prison struggles. And the descriptive passages will make you want to hop a plane for Bologna.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5KR6SWXD1J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003B02PF4#wasThisHelpful","R3U5KR6SWXD1J7","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read a lot of graphic novels, but not often of the superhero variety. Comic books, in the traditional sense, just don't do much for me, especially those from DC and Marvel. Still, I know who the main characters are, and the Justice League and all that -- it's been part of American cultural history since the '60s, after all -- and this one was highly recommended, so I gave it a shot. What it is, is the purported history of Marvel's costumed heroes from their first appearance of the Human Torch in the New York of the late 1930s, as seen from the perspective of Phil Sheldon, a news photographer who chases them around town, making a living with his camera, through apparently the '70s, when Phil retires. His buddies at the beginning include Jonah Jameson, who eventually becomes Spiderman's editor (so to speak), but Spidey never gets much time on-screen. None of the heroes do, actually. We only see them the way the average New Yorker does -- bigger than life, often scary, and never to be trusted. In fact, these flying types flip from hero to villain and back quicker than you can say ""story arc."" And if you're not already a longtime fan of basically *all* the Marvel series, none of that will make a lot of sense to you. Still, it's an interesting take on the whole phenomenon.But there's one problem: The story just stops. There's no resolution of the conflicts Bushiek has been developing through the whole book. We never find out about Phil's book. We don't know whether Spiderman is ever cleared of murder. This thing was originally published in monthly installments, of course, but it feels as if the final year's worth has been omitted. Busiek is usually pretty good, but this is not one of his better efforts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5A5HE32GIVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078514286X#wasThisHelpful","R2V5A5HE32GIVO","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"French began her police procedural mystery series about the Dublin Murder Squad (which doesn't actually exist, by the way) in 2007 with _In the Woods_ -- an amazingly adept piece of work for a first novel. This one is her fifth book and each has been better than the one that came before. Everything she previously did well, she's doing even better now. But this isn't Connelly's LAPD or Rankin's Edinburgh police force, either, with the same faces showing up in case after case. Rather than deal with the same gang of detectives each time, each new book takes a secondary cop, a supporting character, from a previous installment and makes them the focus of the new story. I've never seen that done before and it works very well.The other thing about this series is that, even though they're all set in and near Dublin, and they all have recent events as part of their background -- the country's economic problems were especially important in _Broken Harbor_ -- some of the books are much more ""Irish"" than others. This latest one could equally have taken place in a toney London suburb, or in Boston or Santa Barbara. That's because the key focus is on what it means to be a sixteen-year-old girl in an expensive boarding school, and what it means to have friends who are like part of yourself, and that's a universal. Teenagers are teenagers, and friendship is friendship, and not even money or the lack of it makes all that much difference.We met Holly Mackey as a bright ten-year-old in _Faithful Place,_ the daughter of Frank Mackey, a very hardcore and highly manipulative undercover investigator whom you do not cross casually. Now Holly is sixteen and a student at St. Kilda's, her mother's alma mater, and her three roommates are the people to whom she is closest in the world. All of them would do anything for each other -- and they will before the story is finished. A few blocks away is Colm's, the counterpart boys' school, and early one morning the body of a murdered Colm's boy is found in a glade on the grounds of St. Kilda's: Chris Harper, a total babe in the judgment of most of the girls, with more than a few of whom he had a history. The police and the forensics techs descend on the school, interviews are held, an investigation is under way -- and it all goes nowhere.A year later, and a photo of Chris is posted at ""the secret place,"" the school's anonymous notice board, saying ""I know who killed him."" Being a cop's kid, Holly snags the photo in a plastic bag and takes it downtown to Stephen Moran, whom she knows from that earlier case (he had to prep her as a trial witness) and has some regard for. And Moran, who has been working Cold Cases but wants a good shot at the Murder Squad, takes it to Antoinette Conway, whose first big case the Harper killing was. Conway is hard work since she's interested only in doing her job and solving murders, not in playing nice with the Good Old Boys on the squad, and she agrees to take Stephen along as her back-up on a visit to St. Kilda's to check out this new evidence.French tells the story in alternating chapters, one set of which follows Conway and Moran through a single very long, exhausting day of investigation as they try to figure out the dynamics of Holly's set of four girls and also the rival gang of four honchoed by Joanne Heffernan, a viciously nasty piece of work who would be delighted to topple the first group, if only because they don't bother to follow all the unwritten rules of the teen world, including the competition for boyfriends. The second set of chapters goes back to the months and weeks leading up to Chris's murder and shows you, very subtly, how things got to that point. Again, it's a matter of group dynamics and love and friendship and trying to figure out what's really important in life. And the last page of the last chapter wraps around to a few minutes before the first page of the first chapter -- a very neat device. But rather sad, too, since we now know what she's about to set in motion.Throughout, we gradually learn the ins and outs of these girls, and how they deal with each other and with the world, and we see them both through each other's eyes and through the older (but not all that much older) eyes of Stephen and Conway, whose background is inner-city and who are not naturally sympathetic to a place like St. Kilda's. But they're both smart and they're both first-rate detectives, in different ways, and they'll get the job done. And for Holly and her friends, nothing will ever be the same.I've become a firm fan of French's work and I'll be watching for the next installment. Based on what has come before, I know it will be excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KWCCGSW8Z44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026328#wasThisHelpful","R26KWCCGSW8Z44","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author has certainly hit the big time with a bang, first with _The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August_ last year, and now this one. Both of them deal with variations on the same idea, too: The ability to survive indefinitely by escaping death. Harry August was able to go back in time and be reborn with full memories and adult knowledge of his previous lives, while the nameless narrator of _Touch_ (whom some call Kepler) is one of a tiny, tiny fraction of the human race who can simply jump from one body to another -- any age, any gender -- simply by touching a bit of exposed skin. In a crowd, he can practically surf, skipping quickly from one host to the next, but his kind have learned to prefer extended residence -- assuming you can find the proper ""skin."" The host's mind just goes to sleep for the duration, however, so the jumper has no access to his/her memory or thoughts. This requires research of the potential to avoid unpleasant surprises. (Terminal cancer is no fun, nor is even athlete's foot.) Kepler has made a living as a sort of realtor, searching out and providing access to new hosts for others of his kind, based on their particular requirement. Because ""we always see how something else could be better than what we have.""Given certain psychological weirdnesses, the sort of thing you might expect in these circumstances, Kepler has been surviving comfortably for several hundred years now, but he's also aware that over the centuries various groups have become aware of the existence of the jumpers among them and have attempted repeatedly to eradicate them, driven mostly by fear and often motivated by religion. And now a host he had become especially fond of has been murdered in an attempt to kill him -- because he certainly can die if he can't escape into another body in time. Kepler is pissed. His kind tend to run in the face of danger (it's so easy), but it's finally time to strike back.North takes her premise, tacks it up on the wall for close study, and then proceeds to ring every change she can think of on the possibilities of Kepler's existence and situation. Some of them are obvious: If you don't have money, simply jump into the cashier behind the counter, hand your dazed previous host a fistful of cash from the register, and immediately jump back. But other ideas and their implications are highly original. (""I love the internet. Online banking! Facebook!"") Watching Kepler and his peers deal with events will have you thinking up interesting situations for them yourself. But he's deeper than most, and more thoughtful about those who bodies he borrows. ""All that your death would be to me, as I carried on with my life, was a few seconds. Consequences are for the flesh.""But North has also shown herself adept with the language generally, and especially with description: ""There is a face which I have rarely seen since the 1880s. It was the face of that age, when sideburns erupted from the side of the head like whiskers on a water rat; when the moustache was an explosion of curling wax and could scowl something extraordinary."" That's lovely stuff. And I will definitely be in queue for whatever this author comes up with next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FAUYIESPK6RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316335924#wasThisHelpful","R3FAUYIESPK6RV","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fourth volume in French's ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series and I've been hooked since the first one. She has an interesting method, too: As you start each book, you discover that the protagonist in the new one was a minor or supporting character in the previous one. The person you thought was just a spear-carrier for the narrator to interact with turns out to be far more complex and very interesting in his (or her) own right.Detective Sergeant Michael ""Scorcher"" Kennedy, who had a professional run-in with Inspector Frank Mackey in the last book that caused some damage to his career, nevertheless has the highest solve rate on the Murder Squad year after year, and he'll tell you up front that it's not because he's more brilliant than anyone else. It's because he maintains complete control -- both of himself and of the case he's working on -- and because he never quits. But this new case, which should have gone like clockwork, which should have been ""the dream case,"" is nearly the end of him.There's a fishing village with a beach up the coast called Broken Harbor where Kennedy used to go with his family as a kid for two weeks every year, and it provided some of his best memories -- and some of his very worst. Now the place has been renamed ""Brianstown"" by a gang of shady, slovenly developers and the community they began has been abandoned as the Irish recession took hold. The few families who bought new homes there are stuck with them. And one of those families has been almost wiped out one night -- young father and two small children dead, young mother in critical condition. There's no sign of who the attacker might have been, and that's Kennedy's job. So off he goes with his partner, Richie Curran, in tow who has been on the squad all of two weeks. Kennedy does a lot of training and mentoring new detectives and he's good at it, though he would really like to have a full-time, long-term partner like everyone else. The scene of the multiple murders is a bloody mess, the forensics team in their white suits are delighted (in professional terms), and there's the sister of the wife having a loud breakdown in a patrol car. And as he looks over the bodies, Kennedy is already beginning to get a good idea of what happened. Boy, is he wrong.French weaves a complex, mesmerizing plot with two disparate detectives, a stalker, and the histories of the ""golden couple"" (as Kennedy begins to think of them) as the warp, and the nuts and bolts of the procedural investigation as the woof. The narration is first-person this time, so you'll learn things as the investigators do. And not to forget Kennedy's younger sister, who is mad as a hatter on an intermittent basis. He has always looked after her, but it's a serious trial. And now she's interfering in his case, and in his developing professional relationship with Richie. A first-rate detective story with an unpredictable ending. And I'm wondering who among the cast of characters will be the focal point in the author's next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JO46FVXRUZSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143123300#wasThisHelpful","R3JO46FVXRUZSL","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fox is a noted anthropologist (as are her father and her sister) who decided to forego South Sea islanders and African tribal villages for the study of her own country. Her objectivity (always a problem for an anthropologist) was enhanced by the fact that much of her childhood was spent in the States, and then in France. Her books on the culture of horseracing and the life of the ubiquitous English pub have already become classics. Still, she was startled when the first edition of this book, published in 2008, became a best-seller. It was even informally adopted by visitors as a guide to what to do (and what not) while visiting England. This new edition is both an update in data and observations and a response to questions raised by readers of the first one. And it's thoroughly fascinating.The first thing to grasp in trying to understand a society  is that every human culture, and every smaller subculture within it, is governed by rules. Not rules imposed from outside but standards and practices and customs that have evolved from within. We grow up learning those rules without being aware of it. We know what constitutes expected behavior in almost any situation within our own group, and we identify ""outsiders"" by the fact that they *don't* know the rules. Every Englishman knows he's expected to wait his turn for service, or to board a bus, or to buy a ticket. Queuing is a fundamental part of behavior and no one has to think about it. And that, like so much of the English personality, comes down to a passion for fairness, which underlies everything. An Englishman also hates to stand out, which he accomplishes by continual self-deprecation. (This is a real problem when you have to ""sell"" yourself to a personnel manager.) And above all, there's humor, of a particularly Eeyorish type. You can't take yourself -- or anything else -- too seriously. Not even in the face of trauma and tragedy.That's just the tiniest tip of the iceberg, though. Fox approaches her subject in a highly organized and thoroughly scientific fashion. She carries out field tests in bumping into people, to see how many will say ""Sorry"" for having been the bump-ee (nearly all of them), she asks forbidden personal and serious questions in pub conversations just to see what will happen (horrified looks), and generally accosts strangers and makes herself obnoxious, taking notes all the while. And she admits that this was very, very hard since she's as much a product of her culture as everyone else.The results divide (though with many overlaps) into chapters on conversation (and the function of meaningless small talk as grooming behavior), how cell phones have changed things, the rules of driving, work and play, dress and food and how class radar works (the U.S. doesn't really have ""class"" in the traditional English sense), and the social rules of sex and of rites of passage. Her style is both light and serious, leavened with a quirky sense of humor. This is a book to read in small bites and to think about. And it doesn't even matter whether you know any Englishmen yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LK6D1ZTEXL2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=185788616X#wasThisHelpful","R3LK6D1ZTEXL2N","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kehoe is one of the very few professional archaeologists willing to argue with the orthodox position regarding the possibility of Europeans in the interior of North America before the 16th century -- and it says something about the more common rigidity of scientific thinking that she had to go to such an obscure publisher to get this short book published. A great deal has been written about the runestone discovered by a Minnesota farmer in 1898, very little of it at all objective. In fact, the usual doctrine has been that Olaf Ohman obviously *must* have faked the stone, since it was already known in advance that there were no Norse fur-trappers in the neighborhood in 1362, and evidence to the contrary must therefore be false. This a priori nonsense is very bad science indeed and it has been driving me crazy for a long, long time. I've been reading in the field of pre-Columbian exploration since college in the '60s and the ""No Europeans Before Columbus"" principle that American historians adhere to so slavishly has seriously impeded research, from the Smithsonian on down. Taking the ""pro"" position on this issue, in fact, can lose you your job. The author does an excellent job describing the psychological mechanism behind this problem, and the role played by myth-making in American history, and the fact that nearly everyone involved has turf to protect. She goes at the question from all angles, pointing out how many new discoveries in linguistics, for instance, have come out in favor of the runestone's authenticity, and drawing parallels between Kensington and the major discoveries by the Ingstads at L'Anse-aux-Meadows -- which also were loudly denounced as fraudulent, until the sheer amount of clear evidence made that assumption no longer tenable. A first-rate study in a longstanding historical problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENQYJ1KA71JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1577663713#wasThisHelpful","R3ENQYJ1KA71JX","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steve, who died recently at a shockingly young age, was one of the best of the handful of first-rate science fiction authors whom Texas produced in the 1970s and '80s, and whom hardly anyone except their avid fans has ever heard of. (I take that back: Most of the leading literary lights of science fiction themselves had a very high regard for Mr. Utley's work. They recognized quality when they saw it.) He could write about anything, too; give him a topic and he'd come up with an interesting and original take on it. And one of his favorite playgrounds within the field was time travel. Well, everyone enjoys time travel because there are so many possibilities, but only Steve would decide to stake a claim to a period in prehistory before even modern-type plant life, much less land animals. Why mess around with dinosaurs and sabertooths when you can have slime and trilobites? And how you get there is via a wormhole, not a machine, which means you can't choose your target. You're stuck in the Age of Mud, take it or leave it. And the nineteen stories in this volume -- which had to go to Australia to find a publisher, for crying out loud -- are only the first installment. The rest of the Silurian Tales are in _Vol. 2: Invisible Kingdoms_.""All of Creation"" is about the earliest hint that something has happened to spacetime, as a high school science teacher and his old friend, a marine biologist, stroll on a Gulf Coast beach and stumble across several hundred recently alive trilobites along the surf line. How the hell did *those* get there? But it's not just the fact that it's happened, it's the realization that the paradigms are about to shift. ""The Woman Under the World"" tells of an early accident in traveling to the past and what happens to the facet of the traveler that didn't quite make it. More of a portrait of a situation than a story and probably the weakest piece here, relatively speaking. ""Walking in Circles"" is a lovely little mood-setter about one of the first sample-gathering teams pottering about happily in the slime and ooze. ""Beyond the Sea,"" on the other hand, is about decision-making and the necessity of explaining oneself to those who have their own plans for you -- always difficult, especially when it's your parents, and they want you to be a classical musician rather than a geologist. ""The Gift Horse"" is another not-quite-story, just a few pages of an interview with a noted physicist trying to explain that it isn't really ""time travel"" but travel to an alternate Earth in the nearly infinite multiverse (because time travel is impossible), so how to you know that what you discover there is the same as what existed in our own ""real"" past? And does it matter?""Promised Land"" is one of my favorites in this volume. Consider a famous paleobiologist dying of cancer, more or less pleased with his life and his career, just waiting patiently for The End. And then, on the television in his hospital room, the announcement is made of the discovery of actual time travel! His colleagues are fighting to queue up for access to the past. And he's not going. Can you imagine the bitterness, the rage? But maybe he'll get there anyway. Damn, this is good stuff.Of course, it isn't only excited scientists going off to the Paleozoic. As time passes and the project expands, they also come to require a support staff -- in this case, the U.S. Navy, who transport an entire ship through ""the Hole"" to provide official structure. And that means a crew of professional sailors who couldn't care less about millipedes and moss. ""The Age of Mud and Slime"" follows three bluejackets on liberty, sprawled up in the highlands overlooking the research station's Quonset huts (known as ""Stinktown""), trying hard to consume enough 3.2 beer to acquire a buzz and kicking around the whole ""butterfly effect"" question. Possibly the best story in this volume is ""The Wind Over the World,"" a deeply affecting piece about Bonnie Leveritt, a young grad student making her first journey into the distant past as part of a field team, and her five-minute acquaintance with Ed Morris, an accountant going back to talk to people about budgets. (Yeah, any big project needs bean-counters.) Bonnie's nervous and Ed, a middle-aged guy in ""a Jungle Jim suit,"" gives her a little pep talk as they wait, trying to sooth her nerves and offering to go first. But Bonnie wants to get it over with and he smiles and says ""Go ahead."" And she makes it, though the jump through the worm hole always leaves you shaky. But something goes wrong somewhere and Ed never comes out the other side. He's the project's first casualty and they don't even know where -- or when -- he is. It takes Bonnie some time to come to terms with all this; if Ed had gone first, it would have been her who was lost in transition. But she's resourceful and reflective and she finally finds a way.There's a mini-trilogy of stories, each of them following immediately after the one before in its action and all featuring the same group of characters, but with a different POV each time. You've got Helen Wheeler, the non-sexy soil scientist and amateur painter, who, in ""Cloud by Van Gogh,"" tries to explain to Gabbert, the saturnine astronomer, why art and science go together. And in ""Half a Loaf,"" there's Chaplain Madiel of the Navy, who joins Wheeler at Gabbert's satellite-watching party (it's their first successful prehistoric launch) and who gets into a convoluted discussion with Ovington the meteorologist of the place of revealed religion in a time almost before the Creation. And with different lengths to the day and the year, you don't even know when Sunday is. That theme continues in ""Chaos and the Gods"" as the party winds down (""now that Gab's insulted everybody at least once""), with the addition of creation myths in the mythologies of various cultures, as well as the fundamental nature of God, or the gods. Some very thoughtful (and poetic) commentary in this one.And then, for a change of pace, there's ""The Tortoise Grows Elate,"" which investigates the group dynamics of assembling a field team that will be working in isolation for months in such a way that none of its members will murder any of the others. Can Tamiko (""By the way, I'm a dyke"") hook up with her old buddy, the rather dorky and very ugly (but also nice and easy-going) SeePee? Will their boss, The Wasp Woman, find her own partner? This one is hilarious in a slyly droll way, the sort of story that might be read out loud at a con. It might also have been titled ""Love Among the Eurypterids."" ""Foodstuff"" considers the question of a few people staying behind in the Paleozoic and living off the land as hunter-gatherers, without even chordates or proper plants, much less technology. Putting aside why they might want to attempt such a thing, or whether they ethically should. would it be possible to do it? Oh, and fishing, for sport as well as research. ""Chain of Life"" focuses on the personal problems of a young volcanologist with a biologist girlfriend and the macho boss (he lives to ""peek down Vulcan's chimney"") who expects him to casually take unnecessary chances the girlfriend doesn't like at all. It's all about relationships, both between people and rocks and people and other people. And babies.Now several decades have passed since the wormhole appeared and it's even more difficult to qualify for a research team in the Paleozoic, there's so much competition. The slightest mistake -- like a gig as assistant to an expert who is crucified for faking his research -- and you'll have no chance at all. Then you might end up as a mere technician at the present-day end of the jump station, managing toilet paper deliveries, because that's as close as you'll ever get. And that's the lesson learned in ""Exile,"" a rather sad little story. ""The End in Eden"" is about the entrance of sin into the Garden in the form of crime -- and not even of passion but for cold-blooded financial gain. There's a lot of anger among the characters in this one, and for good reason. ""Lost Places in the Earth"" is also a different sort of story, about the sometimes nefarious practices of senior academics when it comes to young, attractive, female grad students. The worm hole is only tangential to this one, actually, though it has some interesting things to say about maps and cartography. ""A Silurian Tale"" considers the problems of readjustment to the 21st century after a year spent in the peace and quiet of the Silurian Era. Is the presence of intrusive advertising balanced out by the equal presence of green grass and flowers and trees? And then you have to explain to your young niece why you didn't see any dinosaurs. And finally, in ""The 400-Million-Year Itch,"" one of the pioneering scientists in the Paleozoic is being interviewed years later and she has a hard time getting the young reporter to understand that the Silurian wasn't at all an exciting place. And people are still people, regardless of when they are in time, and Great Men are still Great Men, even when they turn out to be somewhat ordinary, and occasionally annoying.These stories were published over a period of nearly two decades, so it's a different experience to sit down and read them all straight through, one after another. Steven's generally quiet and reflective writing style, however, makes it an easy mission. And you'll soon find yourself sinking into the stories and the setting and  joining the scientists and the Navy men and the civilian staff in their far distant past. Needless to say, I will be acquiring Vol. 2 of the Silurian Tales at the first opportunity and I expect to be revisiting all these stories every couple of years. This is a much longer review than I usually indulge in, but some writers simply deserve all the publicity they can get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HU2F1JZHM18N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=192185717X#wasThisHelpful","R2HU2F1JZHM18N","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mina has done a couple of pretty good mystery/thriller series but this is a one-off and I don't think it's entirely successful. Dr. Lachlan Harriot is a Glasgow physician whose life has just fallen apart. He's fully qualified but has never actually had a practice (he apparently has psychological problems dealing with strangers), leaving that instead to his wife, Susie, a psychiatrist working at a prison. He's a ""househusband"" instead, raising their eighteen-month-old daughter, Margie, and drifting apart from his wife. But now she's been arrested and charged with the murder of Andrew Gow, a convicted serial killer (the ""Riverside Ripper"") released from custody when supposed new evidence turned up. Was Susie in love with Gow? Did she also kill Donna, Gow's new wife (who married him in prison, never dreaming he might soon get out)? Lachlan can't believe any of it is happening and he begins going through all the papers and computer files in her home office, looking for any scrap of information that might serve as the basis for an appeal, or even to mitigate her sentencing.But as he delves into her private life, he begins to discover a whole other side of Susie. Or at least he thinks it is. Or at least the reader thinks it is. Because it becomes clear that Lachlan is a very self-involved person and not very sympathetic. When the tabloids snatch unexpected photos of him taking his daughter to the nursery, his main concern is that he look good in the pictures. And that the other parents think well of him, especially Harry's Mum. And then there's the family's rather fat au pair, Yeni, whom Lachlan is beginning to find strangely attractive. And the reader begins to wonder, as the story moves along, just how reliable this narrator is. There's a good deal of wince-producing humor, too, especially when all the competitively supportive relatives come to visit.There are numerous questions to be answered in the plot, both for Lachlan and for us, but some of them are left hanging at the end. In fact, at the finish, you won't be quite sure exactly whodunit, or what they did. And it's hard to believe the police would be as sloppy in their investigation as they are portrayed here. The final results of the author's machinations simply are not entirely satisfactory.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MVVE9K9H7Q7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316058572#wasThisHelpful","R1MVVE9K9H7Q7E","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fifty years ago, as an undergrad student picking up some sociology credits, I took a seminar in the ""anthropology of everyday life,"" which turned out to be a fascinating introduction to ethnography and its methods. As part of this, we were told to record every mundane event and action in which we participated on a given day and then to analyze the results. Turns out this was done systematically in Britain in the 1930s by the Mass-Observation project, which queried ordinary people about the detailed ordinary events of their ordinary lives. Now, three-quarters of a century later, that ethnographic data has become a gold mine of material for comparison against similar quotidian activities in the present day, especially in exploring the changes since World War II.Moran's academic qualifications are never stated but he seems to have done quite a good job, dividing his observations into sixteen not-long chapters tied more or less to the hours of the normal waking day. Chapter 1 considers the place of the ""Full English"" breakfast in the traditional Englishman's life, which is supposed to consist of bacon, eggs, tomato, sausage, and toast -- but finds that this repast actually was disappearing at about the time it was being enshrined in tradition, a victim of wartime rationing and the invention of dry breakfast cereal. And then the postwar commuter culture didn't allow time for a hot breakfast. Now, most people make do with a tub of yogurt or a ""breakfast bar,"" as long as tea is available. Subsequent chapters deal with the growth of commuting to work by train or bus, the evolution of contemporary office culture (the bullpen of rows of desks gave way to the  open-plan office, then to the cubical, always in search of greater efficiency and a more contented workforce, but the worker always seems to lose out along the way), the role of water-cooler gossip, the business lunch (which now means eating almost entirely at your desk), the rise and decline of the public smoker, after-work pub culture (even though we invented ""happy hour,"" the U.S. doesn't really have the equivalent of the local), the role of the sofa as the center of the home, and so on.The author obviously has done his research and there are a great many citations, so it's pretty clear that his observations in recent social history are accurate. However, they're also often extremely British, with no clear parallel to the lifestyle of the American office worker. Fair enough: It's a British book intended to British readers. But it's also very London-centric, ignoring the large percentage of workers, especially younger ones, in smaller towns. There's no mention of those in the military, or in government jobs, or who work for small, innovative start-ups, or are self-employed. It's an interesting book but be aware of its limitations and generalizations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPCB72ABTK7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1861978367#wasThisHelpful","RGPCB72ABTK7Y","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a whole clutch recently of new young authors of gritty, noir thrillers and Gischler is one of the best. This is his fifth novel of that type (he's done a couple of zombie/vampire yarns, too, which simply aren't my thing) and it's great fun -- in a rather bloody sort of way.Toby Sawyer escaped from Coyote Crossing, out in western Oklahoma, with his guitar and a determination to make it in the world, but then he went back to bury his mother and inherited her double-wide. Then he found himself married and a father. And now he's working as a part-time deputy to Chief Krueger, stuck in the ass-end of nowhere where even cell phones don't work and where he does most of his shopping at the Texaco's convenience store.Then Luke Jordan gets himself shot up in his pickup on Main Street and Toby is told to watch the body while the Chief goes and talks to people. Unfortunately, he goes off for a quickie with a young girl he knows and when he returns to the scene the body's gone. Now he wishes all this would just go away, but while searching frantically for the corpse, he discovers a tractor trailer full of Mexican illegals. And ends up killing another deputy in self-defense. Luke's gang of brothers (all criminals) aren't going to be happy , either.And that's just the beginning of Toby's long night. He's not stupid, really, just a little slow on the uptake. But he wants to do this lawman thing right, and he want to make the police force full-time, and he wants to protect his infant son. And if that means shooting a few people who are trying to shoot him, well, so be it.The action in this one begins on the first page and never lets up. It's a fast read and a highly entertaining one, filled with gallows humor. And all through the story, two words kept going through my mind: ""Coen Brothers.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJNC2V9THCNPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJXZDYK#wasThisHelpful","RJNC2V9THCNPV","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"French has established herself as a first-rate author of mystery novels, all set in and around Dublin and reeking of Irishness, both past and present. But she has an odd way of picking her focus characters. The protagonist of her second novel was the second lead in her first book, and Frank Mackey, the POV character of this third novel was only a supporting character in her second. Perhaps it's because each of these people has sort of used themselves up in the course of the story.When Frank was nineteen, back in December 1985, living in a depressed working-class part of the city, he and the girl he loved, Rosie Daly from up the block, were planning to run away to England together. Rosie was the greatest catch in the neighborhood and Frank knows it, and they both were desperate to get away from their mostly dysfunctional families. They had their ferry tickets and their birth certificates and that was all you needed in those days. But Frank waited in the rain all through the appointed night and Rosie never showed up. He figured he'd been dumped. But since he already had the get-out-of-town momentum, he just went off by himself, living in a squat and doing casual labor until he decided to join the police. He kept searching the official databases for Rosie, assuming she was living and working in London by then, but he never found her. He eventually got married, and then divorced, but his daughter (now ten) keeps him going, but Frank is still very much a loner.He never went back home, either, not even for a visit. His favorite sister, Jackie, keeps him updated on the family but he has no interest in seeing any of the rest of them ever again. And then one day, Rosie's rotted suitcase is found stuffed up a chimney in the abandoned house where the neighborhood kids used to hang out to do all the things their parents wouldn't approve of. Jackie calls her brother and he comes and snoops around, hoping it isn't what he dreads -- but, of course, it is. Rosie didn't abandon him and go off without him. She never made it off the block that December night. And one way or another, Frank is going to find out what happened and who's responsible for taking all of Rosie's life and most of his own. Moreover, that isn't the only death of someone close to him that Frank Mackey will suffer.In some ways, this can be a painful novel to read, as you discover what their earlier lives were like for Frank and all his now-grown siblings. Because only half the story is about Frank the cop trying to solve the multiple murders. The other half is about Frank the son trying to solve the multiple mysteries of his own family. And then, as you begin to suspect, working your way through this jungle, it all finally comes together.In addition to the very strong portrayals of every character in the story, major and minor, and the twists and turns of a very adroit plotline, there is a great deal of just really good writing on practically every page. French wields the English language and the Irish idiom like a sword, cutting through the reader's assumptions and unfounded expectations. Frank's often drunken father and Rosie's old man loathe each other, but ""Ma and Mrs. Daly were on speaking terms, most of the time; women prefer to hate each other at close range, where you get more bang for your buck."" Or, after the second murder, ""the Place had decided to welcome me back with open arms; I had apparently played enough of my cards right over the weekend, and a good slice of bereavement always helps, especially with a scandal-flavored topping."" Or, ""I had spent my whole life growing around a scar shaped like Rosie Daly's absence."" Now that's writing.This is French's best work yet and I strongly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UBGIA43G1XZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143119494#wasThisHelpful","R1UBGIA43G1XZW","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By internal chronology, this book ended up being the fifth in the lengthy series featuring Richard Bolitho of the Royal Navy, but it was actually the first one written, so this is where the author (who was really Douglas Reeman) first delineated the major continuing characters. Kent/Reeman was already well known for his World War II naval thrillers, but this was his first venture into earlier history and he nailed it from the outset.It's 1782 and Bolitho is the second son of a very old naval family of Cornwall with a big, old house in Falmouth. Most series of this type concentrate on the Napoleonic wars, but Kent decided to begin a generation earlier, with the American Revolution -- which, to be fair, was in many ways a sideshow to Britain's much deeper conflict with France, who accordingly aligned themselves with the colonial rebels for their own reasons. Things are winding down now, with the surrender at Yorktown (Bolitho was present there as a very junior captain) and now he's made post and is caught up in the continuing British-French struggle in the Caribbean, culminating in the Battle of the Saintes. He's given PHALAROPE, a bad-luck ship whose previous captain avoided battle and found himself cashiered as a result, and whose first lieutenant is a semi-pathological tyrant who quickly comes to despise Bolitho for his natural humanity as well as his charisma as a leader.The admiral in charge of the squadron at Antigua doesn't have much use for the ship, either, and send it off on lonely patrol duty -- after dumping a party of troublemaking crew on Bolitho to make up his always insufficient numbers. Several of the men thus acquired will turn out to be a major problem, while several others, and some of his junior officers, will become fixtures in Bolitho's later career.The author is extremely knowledgeable about naval matters, regardless of the period, and was also very familiar with the eastern Caribbean, so the verisimilitude in the story is very high indeed. Bolitho is also a very nicely drawn and fully realized character, a mix of caring leader and strict disciplinarian, a skilled tactician as well as a natural strategist at a time when originality was neither expected nor desired among naval officers. He's also perfectly aware of the part sheer luck plays in warfare and in the ups and downs of a professional soldier's or sailor's career. He shares many attributes, of course, with Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey and all the others, or there would be no fun in reading about him. An excellent series for the fan of naval adventure in the age of sail. And now you can go back and begin the series with _Richard Bolitho, Midshipman,_ set in 1772 at the beginning of the character's own career.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MRHITIS9SN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005E8AP5I#wasThisHelpful","R37MRHITIS9SN7","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First published in 1975, this is the second in the police procedural series featuring ""Fat Andy"" Dalziel and Peter Pascoe of the CID somewhere in darkest Yorkshire. Pascoe is a recently promoted Detective Sergeant here, though he advances to DCI as the series progresses -- but Dalziel is already a very experienced Detective Superintendent in his fifties, which means he must be pushing 100 by the second decade of the 21st century and is still going strong. There's no way around that real-world impossibility, though, if you want to keep reading the stories.The setting is a second-tier college (it used to be a teachers' training institute before British higher education was ""industrialized"") which is expanding its campus and the removal of a large statue to the memory of a previous head of the school reveals a murdered body underneath -- which turns out to be the head herself. In come Dalziel and Pascoe to look into the five-year-old murder. There has also been a recent scandal involving an apparent unprofessional relationship between a professor and one of his students. And Pascoe -- a ""graduate copper"" when advanced education was still very unusual among the police -- discovers an old flame on the faculty from his own university days. And then there's the strangely charismatic senior student who enjoys manipulating those around him for his own mostly carnal ends. The original murder won't be the only one, either.There's a lot of what feels like social archaeology in this book, the mid-'70s was such a different world. (And I remember it well.) The characters are generally well-drawn, though Dalziel is extremely boorish in a way that would not be permitted these days, and the quite complex plot is pretty good. Just approach it as a period piece and settle in. There are plenty more cases to come.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OFHCJGM94NBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934609080#wasThisHelpful","R3OFHCJGM94NBL","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an alternate history story in graphic novel form, and of considerable inventiveness. Suppose a couple of physicists fifty years from now discover a method of time travel -- physical transport back to the past. But these physicists work for the Vatican Observatory, so they keep their work quiet and take it directly to the pope. The pontiff immediately sees the possibilities: They can prevent the rise of Islam, and of Protestantism. They can correct key strategic mistakes in the Church's history, like the crusades. But the pope is not going to allow anyone to go messing around with the life of Christ. And any changes will have to be made before the birth of Muhammad. And that means Rome -- and that means Constantine the Great.So the most scientifically educated of the pope's advising cardinals is put in charge of the project, and he recruits American General Nicholas Chase to command the military contingent -- because force will certainly be necessary. But when the time travelers -- all 5,000 of them, mostly soldiers -- arrive shortly before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in A.D. 312, and Chase hears the details of the plan, he has other ideas. He's not going to allow the Church to put its hard heel on all the important parts of civilization, then and forever after.So that's where it all starts, though the story itself begins a few centuries after  Chase and his men begin stirring things up. Now Rome, as a civil authority, pretty much runs all of Europe (with the Catholic Church firmly subordinated to it) while a unified kingdom has been established in Africa, with a ""refuge"" in Britain, run by a splinter group. And the people who were once in charge in Rome are still running things, more or less, via DNA manipulation. And by the mid-15th century, there's already a city of a million on the Moon and Mars is being likewise colonized. (That's what the absence of runaway Christianity can do.)Hickman's approach is far more intellectual than the superhero sort of graphic fiction, with lengthy discussions by various groups of characters on the nature of civilization, and freedom, and what ""rights"" must be abridged now so they can be fully protected later on. This would be a great argument-starting book to give to a college freshman class in political theory. The art is also rather less representational than the kind of thing you would find in DC Comics, with odd lighting of scenes and abstractions in the background. Fascinating stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTUZMUAFWCHQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582408734#wasThisHelpful","RTUZMUAFWCHQN","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy reading graphic novels, but not usually the classic superhero comics. Just not my thing. This is a special case, though, an alternate history approach to one of the icons of American popular culture: What if young Kal-L's rescue ship had arrived on Earth twelve hours later and had crash-landed on a Ukrainian agricultural collective instead of a Kansas farmstead? We're all the product of our surroundings and upbringing, so it's reasonable to think that Superman would become a champion of Stalinism instead of American democracy, right?It's an interesting premise and Millar does some neat things with it. Superman wants only to help people, but in this world, that means taking complete control after Stalin's death and instituting a global Warsaw Pact. Of course, that also means his lifelong adversary, the genius Lex Luthor, has to become America's only hope in opposing ""the alien."" Luthor marries Lois Lane along the way but doesn't have much time for her (he's too busy playing chess in between inventing things), so she replaces Perry White as editor of the DAILY PLANET instead. The Batman is here, too, in full revenge mode.Millar strikes a good balance between tongue-in-cheek irony and straightforward action. I wish he could have worked in a few more of the classic villains, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAKOLXHBZZ94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009POHHR6#wasThisHelpful","R2PAKOLXHBZZ94","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fifteenth volume is what has become the masterwork of one of the best science fiction authors around. It's also the close of the fifth trilogy, or story arc, within the series, so lots of loose ends are tied up. Ordinarily, when I review an ongoing series, I'll say a word or two about the overarching theme, or setting, or continuing characters, or something -- but after close to 6,000 pages and with no end in sight, there doesn't seem much point -- except to note that you shouldn't even think of starting this saga anywhere but at the beginning. After all that has gone before, there's no way the author can make allowances for casual drop-ins.I will say, though, that the story picks up on the first page about an hour after the close of the previous volume, with the padhi-aji, Bren Cameron headed back at high speed on a secret train to the atevi capital in company with Ilisidi, the Dowager, Cajeiri, the young heir to the ajinate, and a crowd of very annoyed Assassins, who have recently discovered the menacing forces behind the disruption of their Guild ever since the three-year overthrow of Tabini, the aji, or ruler of their world. Oh, and those three young humans from the space station are along, too, having been brought down for Cajeiri's very important (for numerological reasons) ninth birthday celebration (but the years are longer on the atevi world, so he's about the equivalent of human thirteen or fourteen). If anything happens to the kids, there will be major hell to pay, along with all Bren's other problems. And Cajeiri still hasn't gotten his party. There will be action sequences during which the padhi will acquire a few more scars, and there will be political negotiations and sessions of thoughtful analysis during which crucial decisions will be reached.Bren is the focus of the story, of course, and the series traces his career over several decades, during which he has been instrumental in changing almost everything about this world and the societies on it. But the cast of major and continuing minor characters is now quite large and Cherryh doesn't scant any of them. Cajeiri, especially, was introduced as a second POV character and his take on the world is very illuminating. Seeing the same events through Bren's eyes, and then from the young heir's limited (and closely protected) perspective adds another entire layer to the experience. And one of the fascinating things about the saga is that, if you've paid attention to the politics and the alien psychology (both very major themes), you will be able to predict what's likely to happen next, given a certain set of circumstances. Cherryh is just that good.She has also included a historical outline (written by Lord Geigi, up on the space station, with addenda by the padhi) of events since the Landing three centuries before, the course of relations between atevi and humans (friendly, then strained, then violent), and the return of the long-absent starship and the rehabilitation of the station, through the arrival in the capital of young Bren. The reader will have learned most of this over the course of the series, but it's useful to have it all in one place for a refresher.The author and I are approximately the same age (I first met her at AggieCon, the very beginning of her career) and I can only hope I live long enough to see the completion of this amazing work. Like a number of other fans with whom I've compared notes on the experience, I also have some ideas of my own on future plot points that she ought to consider.

"This is the second in a spinoff series from the adventures of Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond, in this case featuring DCI ""Hen"" Mallin of Chichester. The Diamond stories are told entirely from his own POV but these are different, with multiple narrative points of view. Gemma is the personal assistant to the head of a local job-printing company and she has come to loathe her boss, who seems to be having a affair with a woman from accounting, the latter being after her own job. She and Jo, her buddy from yoga class, who works in a gardening center, start joking about killing off the boss and the current boyfriend chimes in with practical advice, and then they forget about it. But a week later, Jo finds a woman drowned on the beach and that's where Mallin comes into the story. But it's only the first of several drowning deaths, all of which seem to involve Jo and Gemma and Jake, the large, painfully shy young environmentalist in whom Jo has become interested. Mallin is think serial killings and the small group of friends is soon being raked over the coals.Early on, when I was trying to guess whodunit from the clues offered (and keeping in mind that Lovesey plays fair by not introducing new suspects in the next-to-last chapter), I dismissed the actual killer. Caught me there. It's a pretty good story with well-done characters, though I don't resonate with Hen Mallin the way I have come to do with Diamond. Not a bad way to spend a rainy weekend, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NO42J7D18AZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HYHA7Q#wasThisHelpful","R3NO42J7D18AZ9","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 11th outing for Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond of Bath CID and in certain ways, it's one of the best yet. The background to the story this time is the city's 200-year-old Theater Royal, in which Lovesey obviously has a personal interest. A pop music star beginning the long slide from the peak of her career has been recruited to play the lead in a dramatic production on the grounds that, even if she isn't likely to be much of an actress, her legions of fans will guarantee a good gate for the theater. The old pros with whom she will share the stage are realists about finances -- but then she begins to scream. Her makeup has caused serious burns to her face and she's carried off to the hospital.Even though it's not a murder, Diamond is sent in to investigate the apparent attack (his boss has hopes of being chosen for a role in an upcoming amateur production), but it doesn't take long before the obvious suspect -- the dresser who made the star up that evening -- is found dead backstage. Maybe it's a suicide, but maybe it isn't. And then things begin to get complicated.At the very beginning, we're introduced to Sergeant Horatio ""Fred"" Dawkins, who has been trying to get himself into CID, and who is also the amateur theater's choreographer. Again, Diamond's boss likes him so the Super is stuck with him. He's a PITA but he does seem to have a brain and makes some useful suggestions, so maybe he's not all bad, even though most of the regular CID crew would like to strangle him.This plotline didn't exactly go where I was expecting it to and I was rather caught off guard by developments late in the story. That's the mark of a good mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJ6360IFCLDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q9THS2#wasThisHelpful","R1WJ6360IFCLDW","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cornell once produced a lengthy series of brief introductory but scholarly texts for students on many aspects of ""Western Civilization."" Painter, a noted medievalist and the go-to person of his generation on the subject of feudalism, covers the development of the European feudal system and the monarchical system to which it led in less than 140 pages, divided into three chapters: France, England, and the Holy Roman Empire. This is a historical survey of the institution from the ""Germanic"" monarchies of the 7th-10th centuries, through the earliest hints of constitutionalism. He does not specifically discuss the various crowned heads, though famous names appear throughout. Some basic knowledge of European history is necessary, but the intended audience means this should all be accessible to any undergraduate.

"There's a tendency in schools to begin the extended study of the British monarchy, even of British history, with William the Conqueror and his Normans, the several centuries of Saxon kingship and culture being dismissed to a brief introduction. The author attempts to redress that short shrift with this heavily illustrated volume that begins with the departure of the Romans, the arrival of adventurers and then parties of settlers between 450 and around 550 AD. By the latter date, four major kingdoms had been established and the Anglo-Saxon period of English history was under way. Everyone (every English student, anyway) has heard of Alfred, the only English king to be called ""the Great,"" and he was the first to make a pretense to being a ""King of England"" -- the Danes notwithstanding. Humble does an excellent job of describing not only the dynastic ins and outs of the period and the development of key political institutions, but also examining the Saxon monarchs as individuals, each with his own personality and style. Humble is a working historian but a non-academic with several previous books of popular history to his credit, so his style is very accessible and he makes note of sources (though without footnotes).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AWNNXYTFLNZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=029777784X#wasThisHelpful","R1AWNNXYTFLNZV","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Osprey is well known to students and enthusiasts of military history of all periods, as well as modelers and gamers, for its concisely written and heavily illustrated studies of wars, campaigns, individual battles, military units, arms and armor, and uniforms. This volume is a bit of a departure. Where most books on heraldry concentrate on the theory and practice of the art itself, this one is more interested in the practical uses to which it was put by armored knights and their followers, both in battle and in the lists. This includes such topics as liveries, surcoats, banners, and horse trappers. Also, where heraldry books written in English tend to consider English practice almost to the complete exclusion of the Continent, Wise knows that the institution of knighthood was much broader than a single country, and that the loyalties and interests of its members were more than merely national. The first section lays out the origins and purpose of heraldry, including its spread beyond the nobility and the knights to the merchant class, and even lower. Then comes the shield, both as armor and as a canvas for display, and a short but accurate discussion of its divisions and the charges placed upon it (again, including patterns and symbols that were common in France and Germany but seldom if ever seen in Britain). A section on the livery and maintenance system includes the fashion for badges and the association of certain color combinations with certain families or ruling houses. Crests originally were actual three-dimensional constructions worn atop the helm (at least, when ""on parade""), and the introduction of mantling, scarves, and wreaths were an outgrowth of this. Finally, a knight's mount shared in some of the glory by displaying all or part of its riders arms on its caparison. Overall, this is an excellent introduction to the other side of heraldry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YHL0AK4FI5SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0850453488#wasThisHelpful","R2YHL0AK4FI5SR","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Half a century ago, in _They All Discovered America,_ Michael Boland identified what he called the ""NEBC Principle"" -- ""No Europeans Before Columbus."" This is the general attitude of most professional academic historians and they tend to condemn any contrary discussion without even considering the alternatives. Boland went somewhat overboard, but since the discovery and excavation of L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland by Helge Ingstad in the early 1960s, there has been no question that the Norse were present at least on the coast of North America -- and in surprisingly large numbers. Davis follows the ""baby steps"" approach, from Norway to Iceland to Greenland to the western continent, which hardly requires that one sail out of sight of land. He examines apparent artifacts found in the Canadian Arctic as well as reconsidering Yale's ""Vinland Map"" (which caused riots in New Haven among Hispanics and Italians when it was unveiled), the Kensington Rune Stone (usually dismissed out of hand on the grounds that it must not be real because it ""couldn't"" be real), an assortment of Norse coins that have turned up over the years (""obvious plants or fakes,"" is the default judgment), and quite a few other types of putative evidence that significant parts of the eastern U.S. and Canada were at least visited and partly explored if not colonized several centuries before Columbus sailed. The author is a ""believer,"" but not a nave or uncritical one. There certainly *have* been fakes and plants and misunderstandings, of which the Newport Tower and ""Pattee's Caves"" are the most likely, but there are plenty of other sites and artifacts worthy of consideration. His careful approach and smooth style make this a useful update to the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYTIC9YJTM7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841589594#wasThisHelpful","R2SYTIC9YJTM7A","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's 1812 and Captain Sir Horatio Hornblower has been ashore for six months. He's the new squire of Smallbridge and that life is beginning to chafe. Then he's called to the Admiralty and offered a commodore's job -- first-class with a broad pennant, like a temporary, small-scale admiral. Napoleon is contemplating an invasion of Russia but the Czar wants to avoid a fight. At the same time, Sweden (now under Bernadotte) is considering war against France, but Russia recently invaded and absorbed Finland, which has pissed off the Swedes. Can Britain convince both those countries to join her against the Emperor? So Hornblower's little squadron is sent off to the Baltic with very loose orders.Hornblower has an intuitive knack for diplomatics, so when the opportunity comes for him to visit the court of Czar Alexander at the Peterhof, he jumps at it. And Bernadotte just happens to be visiting Alexander at the moment. But what the commodore doesn't know is that Mr. Braun, the Finnish interpreter he's been assigned, and who has reason to hate both monarchs, has a double assassination in his mind. Happily for the Czar, even though the Commodore is getting older (he's around 36 years old now), he's still a warrior and he still wears a sword. ""There are very few occasions in history when timidity was wise.""Most of this series (of which this is the ninth volume by internal chronology) don't really follow a particular historical theme, but this is the exception, and the theme is the beginning of the end for the French Imperium. And Hornblower is right at the tip of the pointy end of the weapon -- the Royal Navy squadron supporting the defense of Riga -- that caused it all to happen. Or at least had a very major supporting role. Forester has a style, and a grasp of the minutiae of naval life, that holds the reader's attention, and which will have you reading the entire series again every decade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNK492TL19DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KKMBWY#wasThisHelpful","R3VNK492TL19DD","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The marketing of this book is certainly tabloidish, but there's actually a good deal of useful information. Much of history is, in fact, gossip. The author is an American newspaper journalist, but he has also written some popular history and he knows how to conduct research, at least in secondary sources. The majority of the coverage is of Britain, but the multinational Habsburg, Bourbon, and Valois families are close behind, followed by the descendants of Peter the Great in Russia. And he includes a couple of long chapters on the Roman emperors and the popes just to round things out. Not all the behavior he details is ""scandalous"" by the definition of the word, nor by its own contemporary standards. Some of it -- assassinating monarchs, for instance -- is just politics as usual. Overbreeding by restricting marriage to a single family (the Habsburgs are the champions there) results simply from a lack of modern genetics added to political necessity. Other actions are the result of a sovereign being raised to believe there was nothing he couldn't do. (This often was a problem when an inexperienced teenager took the throne.) And some, like Mary I, were religious fanatics who unfortunately had nearly unlimited power. Still, there were some legendarily dissolute rulers, including Henry VIII, Louis XIV, and Catherine the Great. There was Joanna the Mad, whose descendants are a good argument for the inheritance of insanity. And there were the Hanoverians, with every one of five successive kings loathing both his father and his sons. Considering his subject, the author's style is relatively balanced and fair-minded and the style is not at all shallow. He makes clear distinctions between the weak-minded and the bloody-minded and spreads the blame for poor child-rearing. He also tends to steer clear of anyone after Edward VIII's abdication, so there's no coverage of, for instance, the often egregious behavior of the Duke of Edinburgh. And he sources much of what he shares.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1463GJW7PSQ3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140280243#wasThisHelpful","R1463GJW7PSQ3V","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Martin has been taking time off, apparently from the apparently endless ""Song of Fire and Ice"" series to produce some much shorter and very different works. And while I don't ordinarily care for werewolf novels, this graphic adaptation by Daniel Abraham and Mike Wolfer isn't bad. Willie Flambeaux is a repo man specializing in consumer goods, who tries to ameliorate his job by giving people good advice about cutting up their credit cards and not being too much of a bastard. He's made friends that way, one of whom is Randi, once a small town cop and now a private investigator, and that's who he goes to when another of his acquaintances, a young woman in a wheel chair, is not only killed but mangled, apparently by some kind of animal. As it happens, Randi's father, also a cop, died in similar circumstances, and the guy who went to prison for it is now out, so she's on the case. Turns out the town is a hot bed of secret goings-on with ""skin-changers,"" though, and nothing is as it seems.Avatar tends to specialize in darker graphic fiction, especially creator-owned work (as opposed to DC and Marvel Comics stuff) and they don't require content restrictions.

"It's an ordinary late fall evening in the Muslim section of Glasgow and the extended Anwar family is going about its ordinary Ramadan affairs, when a couple of armed and masked men burst in, demanding a large amount of money from someone named ""Bob."" There's no Bob, only Muslim names, and one look at the house will tell anyone there's not a lot of money around. So the men scoop up Aamir, the elderly father, and take off. But not before one of the men has accidentally shot off the hand of sixteen-year-old Aleesha. (He says he's sorry.)A kidnapping interests Glasgow CID, of course, and it ought to be DS Alex Morrow's case because it's her turn, but it's given instead to DS David Bannerman, the fast-tracked fair-haired boy of the DCI in charge of homicide. So Alex, who grew up in the same neighborhood as the Anwars, is angry, especially since Bannerman, who is from a police family, is a not very bright cowardly twit. But it's also because she's terrific at detection but crap at dealing with people, especially within the department. And her marriage is coldly and silently falling apart, for very specific reasons that the reader slowly learns throughout the story (and which I won't reveal here), which also makes her very hard to work with. And she knows that, too.The two kidnappers, Eddy and Pat, are also mostly a pair of stumblebums, which Eddy, and they don't really know what they're doing, their only experience being as nightclub doormen. Eddy fantasized about being a professional hard man, while Pat mostly fantasizes about Aleesha and getting away from Eddy. In fact, the only reason they stay free as long as they do is because the police screw things up even more thoroughly than they do. The least screwed-up character, really, is Malki, Pat's wee junkie cousin, who drives the getaway car. But he's doomed.Alex, and even Bannerrman on occasion, eventually work out the details of the kidnapping and the motives behind it (which are also screwed up) and the old man, who has been having a bit of a breakdown while he waited to be killed, manages to save himself. It's a pretty good crime novel with no real heroes but great characters, and I'm pleased to see this is only the first in a series. I've read Mina's earliest work, her ""Garnethill"" trilogy, which was excellent in a decidedly gritty way. This one is quite different but Glasgow is still one of the leading characters. Although, the way she portrays the city in all her books, it's kind of a puzzle why anyone would want to remain there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O6RJV4NNS0R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00969PYQ6#wasThisHelpful","R2O6RJV4NNS0R5","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were, between 1444 and 1889, four separate creations of the dukedom of Buckingham, none of them connected to any of the others. The focus here is entirely on George Villiers, a favorite of James I and his chief minister, who was elevated to that title in 1623, and on his son, also named George, who inherited it on his father's assassination five years later. The second Duke was a notable advisor to the restored Charles II and died in 1687 of a chill contracted during a fox hunt (a sport he played a major part in founding in England).The author has a particular slant on the two Villiers, however, calling them the ""evil geniuses"" of the Stuart dynasty. He blames them for the destruction of the Stuart style of government, both before and after the Civil War, deriding them as selfish voluptuaries utterly devoid of morality. Father and son certainly were intriguers during their various stints as ambassadors to other European nations, and George Jr. was notable for his part in the Cabal Ministry, during which he engaged in a fist-fight and hair-pulling scuffle with the Marquess of Dorchester on the floor of the House of Lords. A colorful family, to be sure, but no more so than a number of others of the period, and the majority of the fault for the collapse of the Stuart monarchy (twice) can fairly be attributed to the four kings of that dynasty. While this is an entertaining dynastic history, it should not be regarded as a trustworthy source in research. (Buckingham Palace, by the way, the only use of the name of which most modern Brits are aware, was built for the first duke of the third creation and has no Villiers connection.)Coffin was a well-known popular historian (having been a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford) as well as a professor of literature and winner of a Pulitzer for poetry.

"As every student of French history knows, Louis XIV did a number on the aristocracy of his day, eventually making them totally reliant on his court at Versailles. A comte who stayed at home on his estates was theoretically free, but he was also indigent and had no power or authority whatever. Louis made the kingship the French font of all subsidiary power. The aristocratic class attempted a comeback after he died, and while they never were able to return to their previous heights, they were sufficiently successful as to make the Revolution inevitable a century later. The aristocracy turned out to be strong enough to prevent even gradual social and political reforms, as increasingly demanded by the French people, but not strong enough to survive the volcanic explosion that resulted. Ford calls this attempt to return to feudalism the ""dynamics of obstruction"" and he examines its workings in detail, relying mostly on the public records, the family papers, and the memoirs and correspondence of the ancien régime, a surprising amount of which has survived -- especially for the Robe family, which he takes as his principal example. The process of aristocratic retrenchment, he says, had pretty much accomplished all it was going to by the end of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748. For the next forty years, it was a matter of simply hanging on to what they had more and more tightly. But, of course, it wasn't enough.The author's style is clear and straightforward, but some background in the history of 18th century France is necessary for context.

"Osprey practically holds the patent on nicely illustrated nuts-and-bolts military history, and this 48-page work (their standard size) is well up to standard. The American colonies went into the Revolution with a well-established shipbuilding industry but they still had to scramble to try to take on the Royal Navy. At first, they had to depend heavily on armed merchantmen functioning as privateers, and some of the colonies themselves had small navies, mostly to control smuggling, but before long brigs and small frigates were coming off the way -- some of them already under construction on British naval contracts but now turned to colonial purposes. Other ships were purchased from France and Spain. I knew about the BONHOMME RICHARD, of course, a two-decker, and the sloop-of-war RANGER, but I was surprised to discover fourteen frigates -- though several of them were burned while still under construction to avoid their capture. Full details, technical and operational, are given for all of them, with succinct biographies of their captains. Armaments and necessary strategy are both dealt with thoroughly.

"I've been fascinated by history all my life and that's the direction my undergraduate degree went in. Unless you teach, however, it's not easy to earn a living in history, and I knew early on I would make a terrible professor, so while one graduate degree was also in history, the other was in library science, and I picked up a professional qualification as an archivist, as well. I spent my career in a very large urban library system and, adding to the mix a lifelong interest in genealogy and family research, I ended up involved for many years in various aspects of ""local history.""There's a tendency among academics, frankly, to sneer at local history because it usually doesn't deal with ""big"" events, and because many of its practitioners are ""amateurs."" No international leaders, no world wars, no large-scale ethnic migrations. But approached locally, you'll find a great deal of politics, as well as the effects of war and of generational migration, at least in the U.S. (My own ancestors went from Maryland and Virginia to California in only three generations and took an active part in several major wars along the way.) I've assisted other researchers in architectural history, and in discovering a few well-known Bad Guys in historical county court records, and in tracing the development of local ethnic communities, and in figuring out where pioneer residents are buried, and in transcribing hundreds of unpublished documents that cast light on how our predecessors lived and dealt with the world.And in doing talks to local groups, I always recommended the first two editions of Kyvig's book as the best how-to handbook available. This third edition is a complete update in terms of methodology and available sources as well as pointing out new social, political, and cultural concerns in local research. The chapters deal with storytelling, published and unpublished documents, oral history, photography and other visual sources, artifacts (from both the attic and the public park), landscape and buildings, and the whole problem of historic preservation in tension with commercial development. And the chapter on writing up one's results and leaving a record for the next generation is still excellent.

"Captain Jack Aubrey is widely considered the ""best"" Royal Navy hero of the Napoleonic wars these days, and he might well be (those books are amazing), but for modern readers over forty, Horatio Hornblower is where it all began. It certainly did for me, when I began reading my father's collection as an adventure-addicted adolescent back in the `50s. Forester didn't follow Hornblower's career straight through in his writings but jumped around as new plot ideas occurred to him, and filling in the spaces. His very last novel, left incomplete at his death in 1966, was set in 1804 and concerned the young Commander Hornblower being called back to London from His Majesty's Sloop HOTSPUR on Brest blockade duty. He had been recommended for promotion to post captain -- the goal of every officer, since, as long as you stayed alive and weren't cashiered for some great offense, longevity would see you eventually hoist your flag as an admiral.Hornblower has hitched a ride with a water hoy and is putting up with beating up and down the Channel, waiting for a favorable wind for Plymouth, when a message comes from the Channel Fleet: The HOTSPUR has already been lost due to bad handling by its new captain and, as the previous captain, he's needed to give evidence. After the court martial (automatic when a ship is lost, even when everyone knows it wasn't your fault), the hoy is crowded with the officers and warrants from the HOTSPUR, all trying anxiously to get home -- and then a French brig turns up. The little gaff-rigged hoy, of course, is no kind of warship and has no chance whatever . . . but the French also have no reason to expect it's carrying three dozen bloody-minded and vastly experienced British officers.The capture of the brig (was there any doubt?) also means the capture of its papers and dispatches, which Hornblower delivers to the Port Admiral when he finally gets to Plymouth, and then finds himself carrying the lot on to the Admiralty in London. And the papers are found to include a letter to the French admiral in the Caribbean signed by Bonaparte, who has only recently crowned himself Emperor Napoleon. Villaveuve's fleet is tucked away in the harbor at Ferrol, Spain, and Admirals Nelson and Calder need to pry him out of there and bring him to battle. (It's the prelude to the climactic fight at Trafalgar.) But how? Hornblower, usually diffident, has an idea involving forgery and secret agents.And that, unfortunately for fans, is where the story ends. One knows that Hornblower will be successful in his activities as a spy behind the lines, but one can only wish Forester had lived just a few months longer.Also included in this slender volume, just to fill it out somewhat, are two separately published stories, both worth the reading. ""Hornblower's Temptation"" features the newly promoted Lieutenant Hornblower, only recently released from imprisonment in Spain, as signals officer aboard the RENOWN, when an Irish deserter is brought in, a participant in the recent rebellion who had escaped to France. And now he's going to hang, but the court martial doesn't want him making speeches to the Irish members of the fleet, as is the traditional right of a condemned man. And that's Hornblower's job. Not a major story but worth reading.""The Last Encounter"" is a nice one, set in 1848, is about the aging Lord Hornblower, now retired but still Admiral of the Fleet, tucked away with Lady Barbara in his comfortable manor at Littlefield on a cold winter's night. Then there's a knock at the door. A traveler's coach has overturned on the icy roads and it's imperative he get to the coast so he can catch a ship to France. The visitor says his name is ""Napoleon Bonaparte,"" bringing a snort from Hornblower and the conclusion that the man must be mad, but he's a gentleman and he offers his assistance anyway. If you know your history, you've already realized that this young man will be Emperor Napoleon III very shortly. It's a neat little story and a nice one to end Our Hero's career with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R42MT8R370WB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316289159#wasThisHelpful","R42MT8R370WB8","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a year since Superintendent Peter Diamond's wife was murdered in a park in Bath, and he's finally beginning to come to terms with his loss, though the killer's trial and then the appeals aren't helping much. But this eighth book in the series actually begins with the strangling of a sunbather at a crowded beach down in Sussex, and that's not his patch at all. The homicide cop down there is DCI Henrietta (""Hen"") Mallin, a short, feisty, vigorous investigator who favors evil little black cigars. No one noticed the killing when it was happening and the woman's beach tote is missing, so it takes a while even to discover who she is. Turns out she's a psychologist, a criminal profiler, from Bath -- and that's where Diamond comes in. Always looking for a case to sink his teeth into, he attaches himself to Hen, even though protocol puts her in charge.Poking into the victim's background quickly leads to the discovery that she was assisting the police with a very sensitive case, the murder of a film producer with a crossbow, which hasn't even been released to the public yet. And *that* perp has left the cops the names of his next two intended victims, also very public celebrities. It's far from the usual serial killer methodology but Diamond has a way of getting up the collective nose of his superiors in pursuit of a suspect and the case develops slowly, while they also try to keep the next two targets hidden away and alive.It's a nice complex plot with numerous red herrings and the author handles it all adroitly. And when the resolution finally comes, you'll have no complaints that he wasn't playing fair. The clues are there if you pay attention. Oh, and the source of the title doesn't show up until the last few chapters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZCYYT90KWXMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HYHA94#wasThisHelpful","R2ZCYYT90KWXMK","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read a lot of graphic novels and it's been my experience that in the majority of cases, either the story is much better than the artwork or the art is much better than the writing. This is one of the latter cases, with some very original and sensitive pen work by Dragotta, but an incoherent plot and confused characters from Hickman. (I had the same problem with Hickman's _The Manhattan Projects,_ which made no sense to me at all.) Apparently, this is an alternate history sort of story with several very different nations sharing the North American continent. And (apparently) it's time for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to make an appearance, though the reasons for this aren't given. But one of them -- Death, in cowboy duds -- has gone off on his own in pursuit of . . . I'm not sure what. Followers of the Message, which appears to be a prophecy or something. Anyway, Death has a wife and kid -- I think. Throughout, there are lots of bodies and lots of lines that sound like a bad screenplay. And after a great many puzzling pages, you find out that this is only the first installment. Sorry, but I won't be pursuing it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU3FUX7U2XDHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607067706#wasThisHelpful","RU3FUX7U2XDHW","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh novel in the award-winning series featuring Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond of the Bath CID. The last couple of books have been a great improvement on the first couple and we've also come to know the supporting players pretty well -- especially Diamond's understanding, tolerant, and always supportive wife, Stephanie. She spends much of her time involved with good causes, has a million friends, and simply doesn't make enemies. So it's a shock to both the reader and to her husband when he's called out to check on a murder victim in a park and it turns out to be her -- two shots to the head, execution style.Of course, as the grieving spouse (and it takes Diamond a considerable time to even begin to come to grips with his completely altered life), the Superintendent is barred from involvement in the investigation, much less running it. Equally ""of course,"" he's not about to accept that restriction and starts a parallel investigation on his own, almost immediately turning up important clues that the official fingertip search missed. Then the body of another copper's wife turns up also with two shots in the head, and Diamond begins to wonder. He gets in touch with the other husband and they join forces to see what they can turn up. And time passes. Budgets are reduced. The hundred or so cops on the case are reduced to six, then to two. Eight months later, Diamond is still looking for something to give him a handle on the case.Around page sixty, I thought, ""Aha! I know who dunnit!"" But then the suspect I had in mind has an alibi. But then, later, he doesn't. But then. . . . Well, I'll say no more about that. There's a secondary plot involving a diamond heist and Kuwaiti royals, and it took awhile before the connection becomes clear, but that turns out to be an important part of a well-developed story. This is possibly the best in the series so far and you're not likely to guess the culprit before the last chapter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX54527R0XKFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569472912#wasThisHelpful","RX54527R0XKFG","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hill is, among other things a Janeite -- a devoted fan of the works of Jane Austen -- and the setting and characters of this immediate sequel to _Death Comes for the Fat Man_ are taken wholly from her last and unfinished work, _Sanditon_. Except for Detective Superintendent Dalziel, of course, who's supposed to be recuperating from his injuries at a local American-owned clinic, but who almost immediately hunts up the town pub. And the fact that Austen's novel was never completed (or abandoned) means the author can take the story wherever he likes.The plot involves the would-be tourist Mecca of ""Sandytown,"" on the Yorkshire coast, and architect Tom Parker, who's trying to develop the place in consortium with Lady Daphne Brereton, the local wealthy snob (though the title came only from her second marriage). She's not very well thought of by anyone not related to her (and not many who are), and she winds up charred in an iron basket used at her big invitational pig-roast. The bored Dalziel, naturally, leaps at the opportunity to get involved, even though he's not officially fit for duty, and even though his deputy, DCI Peter Pascoe, is perfectly capable of handling things (and has been sort of reveling in his independence lately).The characters are well done, especially Charlotte (""Charley"") Heywood, who's only visiting but who provides the reader with a good POV as she follows the murder(s) and sorts out the players, from Sir Ted the handsome but not overly bright baronet and his ice-queen sister to the head of the clinic and the Pollyanna-ish Parker, and especially the nine-year-old Minnie Parker, who loves a gory adventure and has talents in gathering intelligence unnoticed. (And there's a character carried over from an earlier book in the series which I haven't yet read.) The solution to the whole thing actually comes in multiple layers, so don't assume you've figured it out till you get to the very end. A very good story.I found thoroughly annoying, though, Hill's decision to cast the first third of the book in alternating chapters as emails from Charley to her older sister, a nurse in Africa. Though she's newly graduated from university with a psychology degree, Charley's style sounds more like my twelve-year-old granddaughter -- especially in the overuse of exclamations!!!! At the same time, she quotes long stretches of dialogue among the other characters verbatim from memory, which is simply not believable. (Good mystery writers have even their trained detectives merely summarize conversations.) And she apparently thinks dashes are preferable to commas (and ignores apostrophes and quote marks entirely), which the author seems to think represents trendy email style. (I believe he's confusing email with texting, even in 2008.) This changes the feel of Charley's narrative (a dash conventionally implies an abrupt change in subject), and it also screws up the formatting in the Kindle version. Dalziel, meanwhile, does all his talking to a digital recorder (named ""Mildred""), which means the other chapters are all in italics. When the cops get into the act, we get ""regular"" chapters in third person, but there are still quite a few emails and italicized recordings. This book would have been much improved for the reader's comfort by standardizing the formatting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTN1N2EINFB15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017SWT3K#wasThisHelpful","RTN1N2EINFB15","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read most of Sawyer's novels over the years and the one thing they all have in common is, they're just so . . . *Canadian*. Sometimes almost to the point of cliché, in his portrayal of both nice Canadians and untrustworthy Americans.The Americans here are mostly Frank Nobilio, the President's Science Advisor, who is present when an alien spaceship from the Alpha Centauri system lands in the Atlantic, and Cletus Calhoun, a popular astronomer with a PBS show in the mold of Carl Sagan. The crew of alien -- the Tosoks -- tours the world and then is ensconced in a dorm on the USC campus in Los Angeles, when Calhoun is found murdered, very bloodily. The local police arrest Hask, one of the crew, and the DA files charges of First Degree Murder. The rest of the book is mostly just a courtroom drama with aliens, with Hask defense attorney being played by James Earl Jones, playing Perry Mason. And the Tosok, who aren't even humanoid, seem to adapt very quickly to all the procedural niceties of American criminal justice. I shook my head most of the way through it, frankly. I won't reveal the ending, except to say that Flash Gordon would be proud.I have a real problem with the basic premise -- that a visiting alien in a ""first contact"" situation could possibly be arrested by the local police. Nope. Ain't gonna happen. As Frank notes at one point, the sheer threat of assassination (by a nutjob, a religious fundamentalist, a foreign agent provocateur, whatever) would be so much on the minds of the U.S. government -- or any other terrestrial power -- that the FBI would immediately take over. (If the book had been written after 2001, it would probably be Homeland Security.) For that matter, they wouldn't be relying on a squad of local cops to protect the building where the aliens were living. It would be a battalion of Special Forces of some kind. And to expect the ordinary processes of U.S. criminal law to prevail is simply nave. The president would immediately sign an Executive Order declaring alien affairs to be the province of the federal government, and probably of the UN. And to think the local DA would be allowed to press for the death penalty, potentially an act of war against a technologically superior species is simply ludicrous.Something else Sawyer ought to avoid in the interest of verisimilitude is any attempt to portray characters from the American South. His version of Clete Calhoun's speech patterns is cartoonish at best -- especially given that the man is a world-renown astronomer. And he apparently has no idea of the proper use of ""ya'll.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM747SU413IXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GSYXFO#wasThisHelpful","RM747SU413IXJ","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. Just . . . wow.Harry August, born New Year's Day, 1919, is a bastard, the result of the young lord of the manor raping a kitchen maid. She dies in a railway station giving birth to him and he's adopted by the gardener and his wife. His first life, before he knows there will be another, is entirely ordinary and he spends it assisting his father on the estate, with time out as an infantryman in World War II. And then he dies in his seventies -- and is immediately reborn, back at the beginning of 1919. And by the time he's six, he remembers it all. Perhaps two people out of every million births are like this naturally.In that second life, he believes he has gone insane -- common for the kalachakra, or an ouroboran, as they call themselves -- and commits suicide at age seven. In his third life, beginning to understand what he is and wanting to know why, he turns to religion, looking for the truth of the immortal soul, but to no useful conclusion. But he also discovers the existence of the Cronus Club, which has existed for some five thousand years, and whose purpose is to nurture the newly reborn -- and to see to it that history isn't tampered with. (It isn't easy to change only the thing you aim at, so ""complexity should be your excuse for inaction."") His fourth life sees him becoming a doctor, searching for answers in biology, but with equal lack of a satisfactory explanation.He also finds that he's unusual even for a kalachakra, being a ""mnemonic,"" who never forgets anything. His subjective two centuries notwithstanding, his life is still largely ruled by biological imperatives, and so Harry falls in love, but only the once. He marries Jenny in his fourth life and eventually confesses his unusual nature to her, but ends up in an asylum for his honesty. And it's a good thing, for all his later travels, that his increasingly vast and highly detailed memory retains the knowledge of where invasions and wars and natural disasters are scheduled to take place.And then, during a life in which he's a theoretical physicist at Oxford, he meets Vincent Rankis, a few years younger than himself. Vincent, also a mnemonic, has plans to change the world. It should only take five or six lives, starting over each time, but with all the knowledge of the previous attempt. To accomplish this goal, Vincent targets the do-gooders of the Cronus Club, erasing memories, arranging for the reborn to have never been born. And that threatens not only the world, it threatens the very existence of the kalachakra. (Their priorities of the essentially eternal are not the same as ours.) The word has come back to the past from the future (passed by ingenious methods) that the world is, in fact, ending -- and it's happening faster. And Harry is the only one in a position to stop it, no matter how many of his lives it takes.I don't know the author's background but she has a solid grasp of the 20th century, which Harry and Vincent experience again and again, in all its variations. (Harry is directly involved in World War II seven times.) She also understands some rather abstruse science, or else fakes it very well. Her development of her principal characters is careful and precise, especially considering that they live for nearly nine subjective centuries each. There are also some interesting philosophical questions here. As Pherson the torturing spy from Harry's fourth life says, ""You think this doesn't matter? You think you die and the world resets and that's it? Are you God, Dr. August? Are you the only living creature that matters?"" This is, in short, an amazing book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T9EDJHY8HFKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316399620#wasThisHelpful","R1T9EDJHY8HFKC","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author is an Oxford-trained specialist in medieval Spain, so this study of Rodrigo Diaz, the legendary (but entirely real)  hero figure of the early Reconquista, is a very focused study. He was the son of Sancho III, first Christian king of Aragon, but he was well out of the line of succession, so he made a very successful living as a professional soldier. He was a mercenary, fighting for Muslim rulers as well as Christian, but he eventually ended up the independent boss (which is essentially what ""cid"" means) of Valencia. He was also the archetypal feudal lord of the period, suspicious of royal authority and willing to go to war with anyone who threatened his power. Fletcher provides not only an excellent, smoothly written biography for the attentive reader (though he's careful to avoid extreme academicism) but a study of how feudal aristocracy worked in the Iberian peninsula -- which was quite different from its development in France, Germany, or England because of the struggle against the Moors. For the student who wants to pursue the subject, there's not only a very detailed bibliography but also an evaluative chapter on the sources available to researchers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RORRISP49ZMVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195069552#wasThisHelpful","RORRISP49ZMVU","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moore is one of the Big Names in graphic novels -- and deserves to be -- and this is one of his best works. It's not only a ""ballad,"" it's practically a saga. It's several thousand years in the future and Halo Jones is an eighteen-year-old who was born and has spent all her life on ""the Hoop,"" a huge floating habitat off Manhattan. It's also a ghetto for the economic underclass on welfare and the population is 70% female. Halo lives with two other women her age and an older one who has money (relatively speaking) and acts as den mother. We follow their adventures with popular music, and the local cults, and going shopping and getting out of the mall alive. And then things begin to fall apart and Halo just has to get out of there. She gets a job as a hostess on an interstellar liner, meets people, and has more adventures -- one of which will come back to haunt her later on. But then the job is gone and she's not going back to Earth, so she finds herself stumbling around on the margins of human civilization, sleeping rough and nearly starving to death. The only option is to enlist in the military and fight in the thoroughly imperialistic war against the human colonies that still have resources, and which Earth wants for itself. By the time she's thirty, Halo's life has changed forever and she's a completely different person. Not one you want to mess with, either. And she's lost all her friends -- again.Moore tells an involving story at considerably more narrative length than one is used to in graphic novels. Ian Gibson's art suits it well, too. The characterization is very well done and you can practically hear the throbbing background music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QV3DT5OO69ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=190673593X#wasThisHelpful","R1QV3DT5OO69ZF","A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the Lenox Winter Greetings Salad Bowl with Wooden Servers. This bowl is even more beautiful in person than it is in the pictures if that were possible because the photos look great also. It is listed as a salad bowl but could serve several different purposes. It is listed as dishwasher safe and microwave safe, although I don't plan on using it in the micro because I have Pyrex ware for that purpose. This is too beautiful to be burning food onto it.When I mentioned to my brother that this was a Lenox bowl he immediately mentioned to me how expensive they were. So I looked into it, and as you can see from the other option on this same page, the vegetable bowl is a lot more expensive but it is crafted of bone China and accented with 24K gold which is dishwasher safe but not microwave safe; not with gold on it. Not to shudder at this bowl though which is made from Porcelain which is an incredibly tough, and yet a delicate looking finish.I love eating salads out of wooden bowls. The problem is though that the time I am done making the salad in the wooden bowl there isn't any room to stir in the dressing. So having this makes for a larger prep stage, mix in the dressing by tossing, and then transfer into the wooden bowl for consumption first topping it off with Garbanzo beans, and a sprinkle of sunflower seeds, and any other garnish you want to be visible on top.Of course the design of this bowl with its 10"" diameter is large enough to make a salad for several people. The included beech wood servers for mixing and serving make a nice accompaniment and give the beige porcelain an even more attractive look.I know with the holiday colors and look green ivy and red berries makes it a holiday usage piece, I have a feeling that it will become my favorite year around bowl. Overall I can't really find fault with it.

"The picture on this is so clear that even the small text on a computer screen shows up as very readable. Oddly enough the small speaker that is built in and housed toward the back is more than adequate for a pleasurable movie experience. In the Bose “esque” style it is remarkable what such a small speaker will do. Of course this is not what you would expect from a full surround sound system with subwoofer, but nevertheless it is very usable. Sometimes big systems are too much, and you want to snuggle up close and get warm to the viewing experience without waking the neighbors.I have to say the picture quality on this 2040 is excellent. When I first turned on the projector I felt like okay 1080 HD has arrived. Actually 1080p is not broadcast by any of the carriers unless you pay extra for it. I Googled, ""Best movies to show off your Epson projector"" and the top two were Blu Ray ""Life of Pi, and ""Interstellar"" both of which were loaded with reviews from people who watched them lots, and lots of times. So it is worth it to have them. I have the Amazon Fire TV in the full model, as well as the Fire TV stick. The full model accepts a hard wired LAN Ethernet connection which guarantees the highest level of connection and reliability. Amazon Prime members, as well as those using Net Flix etc. are subject to the sender testing the line for speed capabilities and then sending a signal that the connection can handle. On top of that most all providers don't normally provide true 1080p signals due to the enormous bandwidth it requires. What Amazon does when purchasing the optional HD is to provide you with a download option so you can get the large amount of data into your machine thereby circumventing any limitations your connection may have. It can take quite a while if you have a slower connection, but for example a FIOS connection can take only a matter of minutes. The other alternative is to just purchase a Blu Ray DVD. I ordered the Life of Pi in 3D Blu-Ray and Interstellar in Blu Ray. I'm really excited about seeing this projector putting out a Blu-Ray movie.So here I am enjoying the clearer text, and higher resolution screen over the SVGA models both the EX and the VS value series. The biggest advantage of using projectors is not only are they uniquely portable, sort of like carrying an additional laptop along in size, but they are capable of displaying whatever size picture, within limitations that you want. It not only provides a huge viewing experience, but it also provides a very real looking image; one that you relax at looking at. If I had to describe it in a word it would be warm. It also is so large it is like having the person sitting in the room.I really got excited about the idea of having a projector on the ceiling, or on a table, and have a drop down screen, one that is controlled by a remote control. The 110” screen which is one of the top sellers goes for not very much money, and you can remotely have it drop down. It would eliminate the need for having either a big huge black screen in the room, or a large piece of furniture to conceal it. However I think these projectors make a very nice add-on to the regular TV’s rather than an absolute replacement for them. There are times you don’t want to sit in the large theater room, but rather want to snuggle up to a smaller screen.  Even the Epson VS value series, or their EX models make for a rewarding show time experience. This 2040 is a league above the VGA’s.With twin HDMI ports I was able to connect my computers HDMI port as well as insert an Amazon Fire TV stick. By clicking on the source button you can toggle between those sources. The connections on the back include both a VGA PC connection, the two HDMI ports I mentioned, as well as a USB. Finally there is also the three part composite connections of yellow video, and two audio in red and white that accepts the old RCA connectors. So you essentially have the bases covered. It does not have an old S-Video input.I just got this and the brightness level is very pleasing. It is as fully bright as you would like to have it. Setup is a breeze. I just took it out of the box, plugged in the power cord, attached the HDMI cable from my PC, inserted the Fire TV stick and turned it on. Everything was intuitive and easy to do. You can go into the menu and customize the settings to fine tune it to your preferences.I am new to 3D and this projector is a 3D and all you need to enjoy that are a set of 3D glasses, and a 3D movie. I just ordered the Samsung SSG-5150GB 3D Active Glasses which are RF (radio frequency) glasses that have two batteries sent with them; each battery provides 70 hours of viewing experience. Epson sells their own version of 3D glasses and they are excellent quality from the reviews. I wanted to get my feet wet with the Samsung’s reported by other posters to work well also. 3D has come a long way, and I can't wait to experience that bird flying toward you so realistically that someone’s wife ducked on the couch as it flew by. This whole movie theater, 3D huge viewing experience is very exciting; something I have been dreaming of for a long time. The picture is so alive that you can discern subtle qualities of the making of the film. For example we all know what depth of field is like which of the actors in a given scene is the one that the focus is concentrated on, and which is at a different depth, and may be a tiny bit out of depth creating a softer haze. After watching the projection screen when I go back to a regular LCD/LED TV I now am aware of these things so I look for them, but they are not as apparent.At full brightness you can hear the fan running but even the built in speaker drowns that out. It is a small sacrifice next to having the people sitting in the movie theater behind you sneezing and talking. Now you get to see the full movie experience in the convenience of your own home. So far I have been shining this on a wall that is not even white, but rather a medium pale blue and due to the high brightness you wouldn't even know it. I plan on buying the current most popular selling Homegear 120"" HD Motorized 16:9 Projector Screen W/ Remote Control which is the second most popular seller currently going for $120, and the number one seller is a manual pull down type for half the price. So this whole projection fever can be purchased for a nominal amount of money these days, and the quality of the picture is outstanding for this kind of money. So having a home theater experience is no longer the domain of the super wealthy. Exciting, very, very exciting. Invite your friends over for the ball game, or have a quiet date night with just the two of you, or enjoy a screen big enough the whole family can get into. .","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NAY2A57LZPVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014D7XHDC#wasThisHelpful","R2NAY2A57LZPVS","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two areas that could really use these; a woodworking shop, and a garage. The box this case came in measures 24 x 16 x 17 inches. The rolls themselves measure 8 x 8 inches. Measurements are all inches rounded. In comparison I just purchased a 12 pack of standard paper towels and that package measures 24 x 11 x 17"". So the 12 pack is the same measurement with one exception of the difference of 5"". So storage difference is nominal comparing a case of these to a regular store bought pack of 12 towels.These towels have a tough enough consistency to them to do the job without falling apart, yet are more easily tear-able in order to accommodate the widest range of holders. However they are tough enough to hold up to someone pulling one from the dispenser without it falling apart.There is a challenge finding the right dispenser. What is super important is that most of them are proprietary. So be sure and double check in inside diameter of the hole. If the paper and the dispenser are different, for example if the paper has an opening a 1.5"" like this Scott Hard Roll 01040 and the dispenser is set for 1.75"" like some of the popular ones that means this roll won't fit. I finally settled on the Sanitouch Hard Roll Paper Towel Dispenser (09990), Hands-Free Pull Dispensing, Smoke / Black by Kimberly-Clark Professional. I'm big on prevention of spreading germs during the cold and flu season and that model has the pull the towel feature and automatically cuts off at 12"". It does not however have an adjustable setting for how much towel dispenses. Also it does not require batteries.Studies were conducted and the result was that when you dispense less than 12 inches worth of towel, people commonly took more than one towel. So the preset model such as the 09990 is very desirable, and no D batteries to replace. You will notice that it is a challenge matching up dispensers and towels since the inner core size is often not posted. Maybe you will do better with that then I have.With a cost of $6.29 per roll which is the current cost of the 800 foot roll that means it only costs .0078 cents per foot, or rounded 8 tenths of one cent. When you are buying in bulk like this it comes in handy, however I don't expect people to place an industrial/commercial dispenser in their kitchen. As I mentioned this is great for the garage or workshop, and of course its most common use that of a public, or business rest room. Just be sure to have a large toilet paper dispenser in the stalls at the same time so people don't resort to flushing hand towels possibly causing a sewer back up problem.For me after purchasing the dispenser I am looking at it that I have a decade long supply of towels not taking up more space than a standard 12 pack or regular towels and at a good sized cost savings. The main advantage is always have a towel at the ready without having to constantly purchase a new supply. Great for commercial use, and an interesting alternative for use right at home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIZC8V0RRAD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00375LQJ4#wasThisHelpful","R2NIZC8V0RRAD8","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a sweetheart deal this is. Get one for your home too. You can use a 12 volt converter. Use it in your shop, or garage, shed or anyplace you want sound. I have an inexpensive solar charger that can connect to a 12 volt battery in my shed if I want to use it in there. This one is going in the garage and will draw current from my winter storage of a 12 volt battery for the boat. The amp tucks neatly away and the control panel is connected with a wire that has a 3 prong 3.5mm plug on it. At first I was concerned by looking at the picture just how I was going to manage mounting the included control panel. I was pleasantly surprised that the control panel only measures 1  inches by 3 ¾”. The amp itself only measures 7” by 3 ¾” by 1 ¾”. The fact that it is powered by 12 volts means you can use it in any type of vehicle including cars, campers, boats, RV’s etc. etc. etc.Included is a handlebar mount also. In order to install it to the handlebar mount you need to remove the control panel from the pre-installed bezel, making it even smaller, and then attach the handlebar mount with attaching screws. The handlebar mount is really a standard automotive pipe clamp secured to a stainless looking bracket specially designed to mount to the back of the control unit.The control unit has changed from the one you see in the pictures with the blue letters. If they update it to the new one they are using the letters are white. They both have a black background. The new one with white letters is better. The configuration makes sense. For one the lower left corner has the combo of a right arrow for play plus the pause button symbol on the same one. So push to play, push to pause. There is no such button on the blue one. I guess they originally felt like that control can be handled at the source of what you are using to play with. Then the center two positions are different as well. The upper one is a single arrow pointing straight up meaning increase the volume, and the one below it is an arrow pointing down, and that decreases the volume. The third button/panels on the right are the upper double right arrows with an upright line following are for next track / fast forward, and the one below it with the arrows in the opposite direction are previous track / fast rewind. Now it makes sense.There isn’t anything that seems flimsy in the way that it is built. I mean it is not cast iron of course, but the finish will last a long time and the buttons on the control panel feel substantial when you press them. The large paddles are a never miss configuration, and the click sound is not sloppy at all.This is a 4 channel amp with a MAX continuous output of 500 W when all channels are driven. The PEAK power rating is 125W per channel. The rating is based on 4 ohms. It is a class A/B amp with an astounding frequency response of 20-25 kHz. The RMS power output is 38 x 4. If you are looking for more power the Rockford Fosgate TM400X4AD has 400 Watts PEAK power output x 4 and is bridgeable to 200 x 2, the Boss MC900B is not bridgeable at all. Many comments have indicated that if you bridge this amp you will turn it into a paper weight. The Rockford Fosgate provides 4 times the power at 5 times the price. So this is a very nice unit for automotive, or boat applications. Myself personally I like to bring along a portable player in my boat so I don’t run the risk of wearing the battery down. Larger cruisers have dual batteries with an option to keep them connected, or not. That way you are sure to have one good one when it comes time to start up the motors.I know from my Dynaco amp days I learned that any time you short the positive and ground leads coming out of an amp you fry components inside. Fortunately this Boss amp has 3-way protection including thermal, overload, and speaker short protection. A friend of mine had an expensive Krell audiophile grade amp and all it took was one glance between the output wires and it needed repair.There are no published THD as in distortion ratings anywhere including in the owner’s manual, but this amp puts out an excellent quality signal: especially at this price point. I haven’t heard any bad remarks about Boss amp quality, and that is verified because the MC900B comes with a 3 year parts warranty, and a 3 year labor warranty. So Boss stands behind their product. I wish I could find something that I don’t like about it but I can’t. For its intended purpose it is a very nice unit. The real kicker is the Bluetooth function. You can walk in the room with your cell phone, hit the power on button and be automatically connected up to 30 feet away. All your favorite tunes, or your Pandora with your custom selections playing. Way cool stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0GAKD8C7B3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBI518Y#wasThisHelpful","R3W0GAKD8C7B3I","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the 5 and this 3 Tier. I must say that for only less than a 20% difference in price at the current pricing you are getting with the 5 tier a larger stand with heavy duty thick rope twine wrapping the upright posts which are an ideal scratching post. Both of these are assembled using 3/8"" threaded rods and bolt inserts. You could easily consider that overkill.This 3 Tier and why I wanted both is covered completely with a very soft furry material. It is so soft and comfortable that it's as much a cat nap machine as anything else. My cats have been tearing up my natural black walnut coffee table with bark sides. They love that bark. So that is why I wanted the 5 tier the most. You could get both of these and put one on different floors. I see that there is the rare review stating that this is not built strongly enough. I researched this and found the most common word to describe this stand is the word sturdy. This 3 tier tree stand is garnering 5 star reviews from over 70% of those reviewing it.I think part of the problem experienced by the few pertaining to assembly is that the directions are a simply illustration type. So detailed explanations about how to assemble are few. If you are not handy or mechanically inclined you may want to have someone assist you. Hey sometimes it can be rough enough assembling something with intricate thorough instructions let alone something with such scant directions.The fabric is made from a very soft and plush material that is waterproof and vacuums very easily. So the cat hair challenge doesn't present much of a problem. This company, Iris makes a lot of cat stands so this is not someone new to the industry cutting their eye teeth. These are seasoned designers and builders. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJ5FJ9R9ZGN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY2701I#wasThisHelpful","R1YJ5FJ9R9ZGN8","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The suggested use from the manufacturer is a once a week treatment for a total of 7 treatments over a period of six weeks. There are also 3 settings you can use in order to try it out. You have a low, medium, and high setting. This is called a permanent hair “reduction” system because although it is proven to remove 95% of hair using it as directed, it is not an all-out annihilation of hair follicles.Consider the alternatives. You may have some hair that starts out very fine at the tip. If you shave it, the ensuing hair growth looks like a thick stubble which is unsightly to say the least. You can pull it out with a tweezer but for the most part it will come back. And then there is hot waxing which can be messy and painful. Then there are depilatory creams which if used improperly such as leaving it on the skin too long can burn your skin. Another option is an epilator which is an electrical device used to remove hair by mechanically grasping multiple hairs simultaneously and pulling them out. Some people wax first and then use an epilator to remove regrowth. All of these options are hardly ideal, and most of them are painful. Laser removal if conducted at a doctor’s office is ideal because they can oversee the treatment in order to minimize risk, make adjustments, and manage side effects. Unfortunately it costs between $100 to 500 dollars per treatment and you will need 4 to 6 treatments or more. Even with laser removal the FDA approves of the procedure for permanent hair reduction not removal, so regrowth or stragglers are common. Electrolysis uses a tiny needle to deliver a shortwave radio frequency. The FDA considers that a permanent hair removal method but requires 4 to 6 or more treatments at approximately 100 dollars per session. Yes it is painful so a topical anesthesia is suggested. There is a risk of infection and scarring.So comparing this to the Precise touch which glides over your skin, adding just a touch of warmth, but due to its combination of light and radio waves can really fry the hair follicle at its source. With a 95% success rate that means only 1 hair out of 20 will survive. The ones that do grow back are very fine making them nearly invisible.  If you need to do supplemental treatments the device is there. It truly is painless. All you feel is a little warmth. If you are using the device for a while of course heat accumulates to it is best to pause after a certain amount of use, and then resume again.Some different hair removal systems work better with certain hair and skin types but the Precise touch works with a wide range of types in both hair color and skin. A word of caution. As is stated on the Amazon page under the directions photo it is not for men to use on their jaw, face, chin or neck etc. Using the Precise touch in areas like that can cause skin injury. It should also not be used by anyone under the age of 18. Please read the contraindications for other exceptions to its use which is available here on the Amazon page in the photo. You can click on it and use the zoom tool to hone in on the different sections. The advantage being that with three different settings, one low, medium, and high you can try it out at the low setting, and slowly work up to the high. Illuminage beauty is a joint venture between Unilever and Syneron Medical.It is suggested that you shave the area first before using the Precise touch. No need to burn hairs above the skin. I am not a hair removal expert, nor am I a physician or medical professional. Consult your physician for expert advice. I just thought that I would do a lot of leg work in order to conveniently provide helpful information. It is a woman’s product, especially not recommended for a man’s face. Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGCXIN7IL2AY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CHME9K#wasThisHelpful","RQGCXIN7IL2AY","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am quickly becoming a fan of Amazon Basics. This wall mount LCD monitor stand comes in a no-frills box at about a 30 or 40% savings over a comparable product with retail boxing. This is a well-built commercial grade appliance. I am in the planning stages, and have already bought plans for building a CNC machine which is an industrial grade machine with a 48” bed and requires a computer with a monitor in order to run it. So this will be a nice solution to suspending a monitor at different angles in order to optimize the viewing.These days a lot of complaints are found at sparse and iffy instruction manual for installation. That is exactly the opposite of what you will find here. Included is an instruction manual that is built every bit as well as the stand. At first you will be put off at how thick it is until you discover that it is an all in one in 7 different languages which include English, Francais, Deutsch, Italiano, Espanol, and two different Chinese dialects. These instructions are some of the best hand holding, complete and thorough including diagrams and complete worded instructions every step of the way.The beauty of having this LCD monitor arm is twofold. One is the fact that it extends out from the wall up to 25.7 inches, and then also will collapse to only 3.9 inches from the wall. So you can super extend your monitors reach, and neatly tuck it against the wall when you are not using it. You can mount this to a wall stud or a concrete wall. Notice I didn’t say cinderblock wall or even the motor in between cinderblocks. It must be into solid concrete, or directly into a wood stud.The mounting plate is 3/8” thick metal, and the arm is way thicker than that in different areas. It has some cast aluminum parts to it weighs only 7.71 lbs. GW. This is specifically the wall mount model. If you need one to attach to your desk top those are a different unit and are available as well. With this wall mount unit your monitor can swivel horizontally, or vertically for a complete 360 degree view. It also has a locking nut so you can fix it in a specific view and keep it that way. You can adjust the monitor viewing angle, height, tilt, and orientation such as portrait, or landscape.The matte black what appears to be a powder coated finish is very professional looking. To me the number one advantage to having this is how much it frees up your desk space. I have a dual monitor setup on my desk, and with its large base it occupies way more real estate than I would like it to. Usually desk top space winds up at a premium. This is something I would recommend if you are planning to stay in a certain location for an extended period of time because you need to drill holes in your wall in order to mount it. If by any chance your desk is going to move to another location, a desktop model would be more suitable. All in all, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28X4S57PIZYU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QZCT5W#wasThisHelpful","R28X4S57PIZYU1","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is sturdily built. I was a licensed state inspection mechanic. I know what quality construction is. This 5-tier cat tree is assembled not using 1/4"" bolts which would be more than enough, it is assembled using 3/8"" bolts which to some degree is overkill. I must admit that I was taken aback and hesitated to order it after reading a single review to the contrary. So then I read all of the other reviews, and went out on the web and researched even more reviews and the number one word that is used is sturdy.When the box first arrived I was surprised at how heavy it is. The shipping weight is on the label, and when it says 50 pounds they mean it. This 5 tier model is the one to get. The 3 tier is nice and if you are looking for an add-on that one is good also, but for the difference in price the 5 =tier gives you scratching poles with heavy duty rope that the cats love to get into. My cats for years had a hay day clawing at the natural bark on my highly finished coffee table. This really tightly wrapped, heavy duty rope will provide long term use. They naturally will be clawing at it because the whole nature of the unit is for climbing.The box measures 21.5 x 22 x 14 inches. The directions are abbreviated in terms of the way most directions are provided these days; there is a simply illustration showing you which piece goes where with a step by step, 1, 2, 3, diagram to follow. If you are not mechanically inclined in the least, as in mechanically challenged then have someone who is breeze right through the construction. Complete assembly can be accomplished in as little as 15 minutes. The cats are loving it, and I am amused because they can keep themselves busy, at least part of the time instead of walking on my keyboard. Nice unit. Well built. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E99EKYOCUHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY25OK2#wasThisHelpful","R25E99EKYOCUHM","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the box first arrived I was surprised at just how compact the unit was and it only weighs 11.6 pounds. Even though this is a professional grade commercial canister vac, the Hushtone HCC-08 is compact enough that you wouldn’t think twice about tossing it in your back seat. With the 9 Liter capacity it has plenty of storage for doing multiple floors of a good sized office building without even having to change a bag. So this is ideal for someone who is running a small part time cleaning business, or a cleaning professional alike. It also would be a good choice for a proprietor who wants to take care of their own cleaning needs. It doesn’t take up a lot of closet space and it light enough to park on a shelf. It is 9 Liters though, so its adequate storage space goes up instead of out.Due to its larger capacity, it is configured a lot like a shop vac, except the wheels are more sophisticated in that they are designed like a shopping cart with single direction fixed wheels in the back, and conveniently uni-directional swivel wheels in the front; so it will follow you anywhere. I like that the wheels are made from a softer grade of plastic, almost a rubbery type of plastic than the body is made out of. This eliminates having any streaks being created on hard floors.Next to a shop vac this this is super, super quiet. It has two speeds which enables the volume to be even quieter. I have heard other home style vacuums that are as quiet as this but this is way quieter than the typical shop vac. So if you were cleaning an office, or a store, there wouldn’t be a loud offensive vacuum going off during normal business hours. If you are cleaning after hours it is all the more reason to keep the volume down.It comes with stainless steel tubes and also includes a crevice tool, and a dusting brush for table tops, books, lighting fixtures and blinds. The 50 foot cord is bright orange matching the accents on the vac.Multi-purpose floor nozzle/sweeper. Flip the top side switch backwards and it does carpeted floors, flip it forward and it does hard floors. There are two foot operated switches the control on/off and which mode it is in. Turn it on with one switch, and then toggle between hush mode, and boost mode for heavily soiled areas.  There isn’t a huge difference in volume levels between the two modes, however both of them are rather quiet.The pre-motor foam filter is washable and reusable. The large cloth pre-motor filter is cleanable by simply using the dust brush. The dirt collection bag is replaceable and not washable. It is for dry use only. There is a large cord hook on the back of the unit. You simply wind up the cord typically by using your elbow and hand, or you could simply wrap it over your hand and then tie it off, or use a wire tie, and drape it over the cord hook. The large cord hook also acts like a convenient way to store the vac wand. This is not one of those double hook cord storage models. If it was you would have to bend over in order to wrap it. This way you wrap the cord standing up, and simply place it over the hook. If you do use this for home you could plug it into one outlet and probably do your whole house or apartment. No having to plug into various outlets as you go along.I have grown accustomed to my higher priced vacuum having a foot activated automatic cord return feature. They have short range thinner cords. But with a thick commercial grade cord that is designed to carry some voltage for 50 feet that type of system is impractical.With the Hoover logo emblazoned on the side with the word commercial under it, and then the words Hush Tone on the base leaves a professional impression. I wish I could find something wrong with it, but the nature of the job at hand requires manual cord wrapping. Other than that it is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CE5XYDDQBEJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWGVICS#wasThisHelpful","R3CE5XYDDQBEJ8","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel sorry for bands these days. What typically happens is that someone, or some few pop out their cell phones and record the band with a cheesy mic built into their cell, and even poorer lighting in the room. Then they take a video of the band and post it on You Tube with the name of the band in the title. So if someone wants to get a peek at someone’s band they are getting a view in the worst light possible. Oddly enough it is not the video that suffers due to the cell phone lens, because many cell phones take a 1080p movie, it is rather the sound, and lack of proper lighting that is the culprit.If you really wanted to do the band a favor, and be of good service, get this MXL MM-130 and carry it in your pocketbook, or a guy could even stick it in his pocket, and bring it along to the gig. It takes nothing to plug it into the headphone/mic input combo jack on your cell; the difference in sound is amazing. If you visit You Tube and do a search “MXL MM-130 Mobile Mic for iPhone” you will see a video that displays the incredible difference between an iPhone built in mic and this MXL mic.Trying to capture a voice back at the camera, a shotgun mic is typically used. This is not a shotgun mic so it needs to be used in closer proximity. It is however a condenser mic even though it looks like a stage dynamic mic. Dynamic mics are great at cutting out background noise, and are so insensitive that at times even standing in front of a PA speaker will not cause feedback. A singer usually sings directly into a condenser mic, sometimes with their lips touching it.A condenser mic on the other hand is so sensitive it not only will cause feedback if you are broadcasting what is being heard through a PA. In a studio setting it is so sensitive that even the air rushing out of a heating vent will be picked up. Studio mics that are condensers are typically phantom powered. This is not a phantom powered mic which is a good thing for this application since you don’t have a phantom power supply with you. Not only does it eliminate the need for a mixer that provides 48 volt power, it also tames it down some. MXL went a step farther and included a hi-lo gain switch, so you can custom tailor sensitivity to your needs. In addition to that it also is switchable between Omni-directional, and cardioid patterns. Omni directional is all around the mic/room, and cardioid is just what is being received in the top of the microphone. It is not being shot through a tunnel like a shotgun mic, but rather isolating the input somewhat as to what is directed at the top of the mic. So if you are aiming it at someone to speak you would hear more of their voice, and less of the room background noise. Sometimes background noise is a good thing. You may want to capture some of the excitement of where you are. Or in the case of capturing a band having some ambience is a good thing. Professionally capturing both sounds up close and a separate mic for out in the audience provides an interesting mix. With this MM-130 both options are there with the flick of a switch right on the mic.So this is really a condenser mic complete with a 3 pin jack. In the directions there is a warning. It says;Important note: This microphone will NOT work with standard audio mixers by using a standard XLR cable. There is a potential for damage to the MM-130 microphone and the mixer in this configuration.So this microphone as listed is for use with your cell phone or tablet. I have seen some pretty amazing videos made with an iPhone, and with Android based phones as well. Some phones such as my BLU even though the screen is not 1080P it still shoots 1080p video. So then it can be exported, or shared online. The listed applications for this mic are interviews, podcasts, videos, speeches, presentations, and performances.A few years ago I purchased the Tascam DR-60 which is a great entry level add-on for a DSLR with movie making capability. It has twin XLR inputs including phantom power. The newer one is out now which is the Tascam DR-60Dmkll. That exceeds the model that I have. That costs twice what this microphone does and does not include a mic. That one just opens up a lot of options for things like boom mics or a wider range of mics.This MM-130 fits a very interesting niche because it puts you way ahead of the pack that are still recording with the tiny little mic in their phone. If you wanted to get started doing podcasts you can even get a small pedestal stand to do interviews Jay Leno style. It comes with a microphone clip with the standard mic stand mount. So for stand up, or with a short desktop stand you are ready to go. Hey you have your cell phone with you everywhere. Having this mic with you is a very nice option to have. As I mentioned, nothing ticks me off more than to see a band on You Tube that someone recorded with their cell, with the crummy mic, and then they post it on You Tube with the name of the band in the title. So when the band members tell someone the name of their band, they go look it up, see the crummy video and don’t come back. Audio quality is first and foremost in video taking. Bad audio and they change the channel. Good audio they hang out and watch it. So for the niche this fits, it is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R68QJBQ9QT20B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBPOBW4#wasThisHelpful","R68QJBQ9QT20B","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Cobra JumPack is such an incredible device it is hard to believe it works. How can anything that is slightly thinner than a pack of cigarettes although longer have the capacity to jump start a vehicle. Oddly enough in order to recharge it you use a 1 amp USB connection; not even a 2.4. The directions say 1 amp. That is what you need to hook it up to in order to charge up the JumPack. On the other hand the Jumpack itself charges outboard devices such as phones or tablets at the 2.4 amp rate. That is what the owner’s manual says. On the other hand the writing on each of the outlets on the device says… round input “14 volt 1 amp” mini-usb input 9 volt 1.8 amp, and full sized USB out 9 volt 2.4 amp.If you stash this in your glove box and forget about it another incredible thing is that it retains 85 to 90 percent of its charge up to 8 months. So this truly is a charge it up and forget about it device. However for maximum performance the JumPack should be recharged at least once every 3 months.Additionally you can charge the Jumpack with the supplied 13.8v DC car charger with the cigarette lighter plug which is included, as well as the USB micro to standard USB cable.The directions warn us about using the JumPack in extreme temperatures. However the extreme limits measured in the Fahrenheit scale is 113+ degrees or under -14 degrees below zero which is -10 degrees Centigrade.  I think in a glove box you would be hard pressed to dip below -14 degrees below zero, at least in most all locations, but the upper limits of 113+ are attainable in a closed car especially if it a dark car with black interior for example on a hundred degree day during the summer. So with that information you can best judge how to store it.One of my pet peeves is running out of battery life on my tablets or cell phone. There are a lot of quick charge backup devices out there, but not many that has the capacity of the JumPack. I would feel comfortable going away for a weekend expecting to do a recharge several times.There are some caveats to jump starting a vehicle. First let me share with you and experience I had. I had an automotive shop for 20 years. One time I was hooking up a set of battery cables to a battery and a spark jumped out and the gases that were inside of the battery as is typical are explosive so it blew the top of the battery and fortunately even though some battery acid got on my face none of it went in my eyes. So the directions on the JumPack tell you to hook the cables up to the battery first, and after that is all done plug the other end of the cable they provide into the JumPack. No sparks get near the battery that way.The one caveat pertaining to usage is that the directions tell you to not crank to start a vehicle for more than 3 seconds at a time otherwise the fuse may blow in the JumPack. The fuse is in the jumper cables. There is a clear window box on the ground side in-line so you can clearly see if it is good or not. Another reason for the fuse to blow is if you short the jumper cables. If the fuse blows you cannot replace it but rather need to buy another set of the jumper cables that comes with the JumPack. These cables are short, not like typical automotive cables. There is no listing on Amazon that I can find for these cables, and I was unable to find a listing on the cobra web site either. I won’t guess what they cost but it shouldn’t be much.There is also a warning about trying to start a car with a dead, dead battery. I know from experience you can use regular jumper cables from a freight train battery and the car usually won’t start. You have to sometimes, when jumping between cars let the other car run for a while thereby charging the dead vehicle up to a certain point so a jump start will make the difference in starting it. This is not a limitation of the JumPack but rather an inherent situation in car batteries no matter what the situation.The advantage of this JumPack is its size. That makes it truly portable. I was in the shopping mall parking lot the other day and this woman took a much larger device out of her trunk, lifted the hood, hooked it up and was able to start the car. It was twenty times the size of this JumPack. So if you have a weak battery and some additional juice will make all of the difference, then this JumPack is for you. I want to say that when I had my first car and the battery got weak, I spent countless frustrating hours getting jump starts, trying to roll down hills to get it up to 20mph so the auto-trans would engage to pop start it. The lesson I learned from that is if your battery is getting weak, or even starts to show signs of weakness, get a new one. Don’t mess with frustrating battery scenarios. It’s not worth it. Did you know that a newer battery if it is weak will at least partially regenerate itself?Anyhow my take on this is that it is overkill in a good way as a device to charge your portable devices. Going out and finding that your cell phone or tablet, or laptop battery is running low if frustrating and this device is just what the doctor ordered. If your car battery is weak this will even jump start it as long as it isn’t totally dead. Think how cool it would be if someone is stranded with a dead battery and they ask you for a jump start, and you whip out the JumPack and off they go. It beats the heck out of chewing up your battery terminals, and running any risks on your vehicles sensitive electronics. It’s great for what it does, and even has a light that you can turn on with it. Portable is the key here. Super, super portable. You could slide it into your pants pocket. It would even sit in a shirt pocket but stick out the top a little.Great for what it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QORMIJERPQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01694XJ6M#wasThisHelpful","R21QORMIJERPQT","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It comes pre-installed with a standard AA Alkaline battery. That’s encouraging considering the battery lasts for ten months. So there is no super expensive battery to buy. Standard fare with a superb long life extraordinaire. The incredible thing is the universal ability to connect to most all of the big operating systems and devices out there. It even paired with my Amazon Fire 8.9 HDX. Pairing has never been simpler. I opened up the wireless settings button, turned on the mouse with the on switch and pressed the button on the bottom. When I went into the Fire HDX it instantly recognized it, so I tapped on it in the list and bingo; instantly recognized. I have grown so accustomed to touch screening the tablet this new tool is going to get some getting used to.I have been using a compact Microsoft mouse for use with my HP X2 2-1 10.1 inch portable. It is the same size as this Logitech. I love all things Logitech. I use their keyboards exclusively. This Logitech M535 is the perfect size to simply put in your pouch/cover/case that you rest your small portable in. The profile is much lower than a standard mouse, and it also is super light-weight, but that doesn’t transfer into any less critical in its accuracy. This works on just about any surface you can throw at it. It is comfortable enough to even be your primary desktop mouse. So if you have a sole laptop as your primary weapon of choice this M535 enables you to comfortably use it on the road or at your desk. The unusual thing using it in the Fire HDX is that the scroll wheel works fine but when you roll it up the page scrolls down, and vice-versa. It takes little effort to just use it the opposite way. I purposely tried it on my HDX because the operating system is based on Android but custom applied for Amazon. I figured if it worked there, it works everywhere. So I tapped on Help in the Fire and up came the Mayday option so I used a chat session and it all resolved. I was able to adjust the pointer speed, but oddly enough it also corrected the scroll wheel movement so it works properly in the right direction now.Logitech has a downloadable advanced gestures and customizations software for Windows and MAC. So you get a full suite of options that way, but the way it is working automatically with the adjusted settings in my Fire HDX I don’t need any more options.Believe it or not this greatly expands my uses of my Fire HDX. I have been using it exclusively as a carry around tablet and that’s it. Now it seems logical to keep it open on my desk and have it as an 8.9” super high def. entertainment screen set off to one side as I surf the web and conduct business in my PC. I have a small, very, very, small portable fold up keyboard that I also paired with the HDX since it has dual Blue Tooth connectivity. Now this Logitech mouse and the keyboard both work great at the same time. Now I can really park my HDX off to one side and have complete autonomy. However it is worth noting that touch screen devices are best used of course as a mix of mouse/keyboard/and touch commands. So I access Amazon Prime videos and Amazon Music conveniently without having to turn on a large TV and speakers while I am working. One click of the mouse and I am back to undisturbed work for the phone etc.Did I say that I love all things Logitech? This is a great example. It is going into the portable pouch/cover along with the slim fold out keyboard. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TEWHLTGPY821/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148NPIQK#wasThisHelpful","R2TEWHLTGPY821","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Eureka Mighty Mite on August 4th 2014 so I have had quite some time to use it. I just acquired the Bissell Hard Floor Expert Multi-Cyclonic Bagless Canister Vacuum, 1547 and wanted to share this with you. I love it. It’s my little fuelie dragster. That is what the shape reminds me of. What better design to instill a feeling of power and performance. I also love the color combination. Click on the bottom picture in the listing which is the close up shot and see it full screen. It looks every bit as good, and even better in person.How does this compare to the Eureka 370G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum, the one I had purchased earlier and is the number one seller here at Amazon? No comparison. This Bissel Hard Floor Expert Multi-Cyclonic Bagless Canister Vacuum, 1547 hereinafter referred to as the “BMC” has just that, a cyclonic dirt collector whereas the Eureka has on the other hand an ongoing bag replacement requirement. You can easily see when the BMC is filling up with its transparent removable canister, but the Eureka you have to guess; as in when it stops picking up dirt you have to disassemble the filter portion and give it a poke in order to see if it is full.The fact that you don’t need to replace filters although they are available, you can simply hand wash them and use them again, and again, and again. With the Eureka Mighty Mite you have to buy new bags, and with the cost of them being a dollar a bag, how many 9 packs do you have to buy before you wind up spending the same amount of money as purchasing the BMC in the first place, and there are sooooo many advantages to the BMC.Next item up for bid, the wand. On the Eureka you have this long, fixed plastic tube that does allow you to pull the sections apart and store them on the couch for those times when you need a longer reach. The BMC has this beautiful stainless steel telescoping wand/tube that has no such problems. It retracts and extends anywhere along its reach with the locking dots all along the shaft. So there is no having to take anything apart, and place sections around the room that you have to go and find when you want to extend the Eureka. This also is a huge advantage for storage. My one complaint about the Eureka is that it takes up a lot of closet space with the long fixed plastic tube plus the long flexible tube. This BMC with the push of the collar collapses the stainless steel tube into a length that is about half of the space of the Eureka.I also like the substantially larger diameter hose on the BMC and the way it is configured makes for a much more easily maneuverable device that is not always banging into walls and marring up your trim when going from room to room. The Eureka has a smaller diameter hose that is stiff and comes straight out the front so it has more of a mind of its own when tagging along.Now let’s talk about a really big feature with me and that is the filtration system. The Eureka has a joke of a small plastic post-filter that is designed to let everything through except maybe large chunks. My main complaint with that one is when my brother is vacuuming and the exhaust is blowing out the back it enters my room and has quite an odor to it. I go and close my door and turn on the air filtration unit to clean the air. The BMC has a very fine filter on it that is thick and looks like something someone would use with a hazmat suit to filter out serious allergens. It is white and instantly looks like something you would trust your lungs to. It is good to note that the ultra-fine stuff is what causes the problems because your lungs don’t have such an easy time getting it out.The wheels are configured the same but that is about where that ends. The BMC have softer wheels either made out of rubber, or more likely a rubbery plastics grade material that is guaranteed not to scratch itself across your nicely finished hardwood floors and tile. The Eureka wheels are hard black plastic.Unlike the breakdown of the different BMC models the check sheet on this listing page only has the one foot tool that comes with this BMC 1547 but in reality it has both right in the box. You have one that is made for rugs that is vacuum only, and a second one that is made for hard floors such as tile and hardwoods and that one contains a beater brush to pick up the stuff that may be minimally attached to the floor. The bristles are very fine, almost silk like so as to not scratch your polished/shiny floor surfaces. They interchange very simply. The Eureka has two heads as well; one they call the bare floor nozzle and the other that they call the deluxe floor brush is really an open rectangle at the bottom with a brush material around the circumference that does not act like a beater spinning head like the BMC has.As far as convenience the crevice tool and brush tool for blinds etc. stores right underneath the handle area for easy access. The Eureka has a storage area for the crevice tool that is a hollow insertion area on top of the motor itself requiring that you bend over to the floor every time you want to access it.Power and performance. The Eureka is listed as a 12 amp motor and there isn’t any listing I can find that states the size/amperage of the Bissell. Another line that Bissell has especially designed for pet hair lists them between 9 and 12 amps depending on model. The noise level of both units has the Eureka putting out about twice the noise level of the BMC. The BMC is so quiet that if someone was sleeping in the next room it would not awaken them. I have to relate the sound to a pleasing purr instead of noise. When you shut it off as it slows down it sounds like an extremely quiet 747 with its whistling sound as it de-accelerates.Now here is a super biggie for me; the auto rewind cord. This is where the two really are on a separate planet. The BMC has a cord that is spring wound to wind up IN the housing instead of wrapped around it. So at any time you can extend the cord to as much as you need, and when you are done, and this is huge you simply step on the large silver auto-retract knob and the BMC automatically sucks the cord up into its body. I have found from experience with the Eureka that has one of those two paddles on the bottom that you have to manually wind the cord up with it. Most often I find it with the cord wrapped around the body, or not wrapped at all strewn all over the closet. Did I mention that the BMC not only has a retractable wand but the cord storage is a lot better?Look do I hate the Eureka Mighty Mite? Not really, but it is a good example of you get what you pay for. There is no way they can make something as integrally well built with the features of the BMC for less than half of the price. So for the money it is a bargain, but like I mentioned in the long run you are going to eat up the difference having to replace the filters all of the time on the Eureka as well as having to replace the bags. So in the long run you are going to spend the same amount of money and have an inferior unit in the Eureka. All of the filters in the BMC can be hand washed in cold water with a mild detergent, and then thoroughly dried before returning them to the vacuum. I am sure after a while it would be a good idea to replace them, but that is a supposition on my part. I have the Hoover Wind Tunnel Bagless Upright and emptying out the dirt has to be the easiest job going. It is the same as this Bissell. All you do it push one button and the completely enclosed canister lifts right out. I go outside to my plastic trash can, release the lid on the bottom, give it a few light taps on the side of the can, snap the lid back on and I am ready to go. Comparing that to replacing bags at a cost and having to get them of the closet, install them after expanding them, and making sure the collar is properly inserted etc, not to mention the risk of breaking or even getting a little tear in the bag and then the entire inside of the vac is a mess; there is no comparison. I have both and I will take the bagless every time.Swiveling head on the BMC is also a mind blower in comparison to the Eureka. The BMC is created much like a gyroscope in that it swivels on two different axes. You are able to stand it up perfectly upright while still having the vacuum head square on the floor. The Eureka has no such flexibility only allowing a single knee operation. So how does this compute into its actual use? The BMC made it effortless to get into the tiny area alongside my bathroom sink where I park the trash can and almost always needs cleaning because of the near misses. The distance between the wall and vanity is only 9 inches, and with the installed towel rack taking up that space it is only 5 inches. I was able to drop it in and do one side of that area, and then simply drop it in again to do the other side. It got everything in there. I tried to access the same way with the Eureka but from straight down from the top it is not flexible enough to have the shoe sit squarely on the floor rendering it useless for such task. Overall the gyroscope like flexibility of the BMC both with its coplanar flexible dual plane intuitive ability makes it a breeze to use even when vacuuming the regular wide open floor. I am sure you have seen a commercial with a vacuum head swiveling and going in any direction you may want it. Well this one does exactly that. The Eureka does have a single flexible knee that has a limited range of movement. So for moving the head side by side you are more or less scraping it across the floor instead of gliding it in the direction of movement. You can see the spinning brush through the clear plastic upper area of the foot brush giving you convenient feedback if anything is stuck or jammed in the brush area. The brush does not spin until you make complete contact with the floor.The Mighty Mite may have the same size, or even a little more powerful motor than the BMC, I have no way of knowing since the BMC does not publicize the amp rating at this time, but I do know that when I am cleaning my hardwood floors or tile something that is an inch away from the floor tool is sucked into the unit before it even gets to it. I am sure some heavier, more solid items would need to have the floor tool run directly over it such as is the standard case with many vacuums.I think I may move the Eureka out to the garage for using it to clean the car so the smell from the poorly filtered air has a chance to escape instead of being blown into the inside air of my bedroom etc. Have I tried every vacuum out there? Of course not, but I do have the Miele Compact C2 Quartz Canister Vacuum in Lotus white that is over 2.6 times the price of this Bessell with all of the same exact features except it is not a bagless. That is why I jumped at the opportunity to have a go with this one.Understand this Bissell is a “hard” floor expert so if someone tries to bash it because it does not have a beater brush for carpeting understand why. This brush head depends on the vacuuming air pressure to make the brush head spin. On a non-resistant slick shiny floor it works great, but it would get snagged on plush carpet. So a separate vacuum cleaner designed for that purpose is advisable if you want to beat/brush the deep dirt out of carpeting. The carpet head on the BMC is a passive vacuum head only.It is common that people prefer to have an upright with such capabilities as well as a canister that can get into places and upright can’t even dream of accessing; like tight spaces, doing your blinds, getting the cobwebs up on the ceiling, although some uprights do have the add on tube vacuum option.Did I tell you that I am in love with this Bissel? You betcha. The Eureka Mighty Mite served its purpose, but my new pet is the Bissell Multi-cyclonic.

There is a pre-motor filter on the BMC that is like the one the Eureka has but after it cools the motor there is another super fine pleated filter that is mounted right inside one of the wheels hubcaps making it  huge and trapping all of the real fine stuff as well. In plain words this BMC blows the dust off the Eureka in terms of filtration. Who wants to spend all of that time dusting your place, only to have your vacuum replant a fine dust surface on your furniture?The wheels are configured the same but that is about where that ends.

"I’m a Pro Tools user and when I took the introductory courses for Pro Tools from a Guitar Center instructor who had a bachelor’s degree in studio engineering, and actively masters other people’s work all of the time he said, “I use Ableton Live when I am doing my creative tasks such as song writing and then I import that into Pro Tools to do all of my final polishing and tweaks.” Ever since then I have always wanted to get a copy of Ableton and am glad it is included as part of the package of this Novation Launchkey. It is the Lite version which limits you to only 8 tracks but that is way more than enough in order to get down your creative input Live 9 Lite is not time limited and you can save and mix down your work. It is designed to be a powerful performance tool for the stage. Hopefully I will get so familiar with it, and realize beyond a shadow of a doubt what my instructor said and get the full version. This is definitely a great way to get your feet wet. The big bonus is that with this Live Lite you also can upgrade to Live 9 Standard and Suite saving a hundred dollars. So that savings alone is half the price of the Novation Launch Key 49. You don’t have to using Ableton Live to run the Novation it is also compatible with other major DAW’s, and also control the music making apps in the iPad. I have an iPad Air but draining the battery with a USB powered keyboard can be challenging so I picked up a USB Hub that is compatible and has an A/C plug in adapter. The instructions from Novation state the same thing about laptops stating that since it is a USB powered keyboard it is suggested that you use either a laptop that is connected to an A/C outlet, or use an adapter to directly connect the NL49 directly to an outlet instead. So this is not really a totally portable keyboard but rather a powerful MIDI controller for in studio work, or on the road as a live performance machine using Ableton 9 Live Lite with a plugged in computer/laptop etc.I purchased a few years ago the M-Audio Oxygen 49 49-Key USB MIDI Keyboard Controller The Oxygen 49 MIDI controller offers out-of-the-box integration with Pro Tools software just like this Novation Launchkey offer integration with Ableton. So this perfectly complements what my needs are. The huge advantage of these kind of MIDI controllers is that you can get more easily into the creative mode when you are not scurrying across the room in order to use the mouse to stop, record, and play back tracks. There is a lot more in the way of controls than that, a lot, lot more.This new Novation comes with the keypads right on the top of the keyboard which double as a trigger for drum sounds for example or for use as a controller device.A quick word about MIDI. I was lost in the world of buying whole units containing keys or other MIDI triggers that had built into them sound engines, AD/DA converters, sound samples, computers, etc. etc. etc. and those things were at best only marginal in quality next to the three thousand dollar plus counterparts. Then I discovered something that was right in front of me all along, and that is buy MIDI controllers and use your high quality interface as your pre and AD/DA converter and then buy whole suites of super high quality samples. For example I purchased the Alesis DMX7 electronic drum set for a very reasonable amount of money, and then picked up Superior Drummer for the samples which include a 1960’s Roger’s and Slingerlands drum set recorded with Neumann U87 microphones and more. So with my single purchase of the drum set for around $500 I acquired something that sounds as good, as or better than the 5 thousand dollar Roland set; so I decided to do the same thing with my keyboards from now on. Yes this does require that you bring a computer with you, but that is a lot more convenient than lugging around a super heavy keyboard. However having an all in one keyboard workstation as your main keys has its advantages. These MIDI controllers are so light they almost scare you and make a great add on for an instant access symphony of sounds.Now specifically about this Novation. These keys have a semi-weighted feel about them. There is an even amount of resistance to them throughout the whole keys range of motion. Feeling the action of a keyboard is a very personal thing and certain preferences do abide. With Amazons no holes barred 30 day return policy all you are risking is the cost of return postage if you don't like it, and you get the armchair convenience of trying it out. That being said the overall action in my opinion is very good.I never measured the size of my keys before but someone mentioned that these are smaller than usual. That is not the case. The length of the keys are 5 ” long, the width of the keys are a tad under 7/8” actually 27/32” to be exact. The space between the black keys ranges from 5/8” to ¾”. I never really measured the distance between keys before but I got the same measurements on my Yamaha MM6, as well as my Oxygen 49 as well as my M-Audio 88 keystation. The length of the keys on my Yamaha MM6 are also 5 ½” long, but my M-Audio 88 keystation key length, at least what is accessible and does not tuck under the housing is 5 3/8” long and my M Audio Oxygen 49 is the same 5 3/8”. So unless someone has an extra-large keyboard that goes beyond these measurements any comments that the keys are too small is unfounded. I think the illusion is created that smaller keyboards have smaller keys even though they don’t. When I stand behind my full sized 88 key monster I get the feeling that the keys are huge when in actuality they are an eighth of an inch smaller in length, and the same size in width.The M-Audio Oxygen 49 newest generation IV has 8 velocity sensitive trigger pads and this Novation Launchkey 49 has 16 that are also assignable and usable for different purposes.Ableton Live 9 Lite in as little as 3 months ago which would be 7/15 actually two weeks before Windows 10 launch date, so those using the beta version of Windows 10 were having problems successfully opening the software. Glad to see that on the Ableton web site that Live 9 Lite is now fully compatible as of the date of this review. 10/15. They do however warn you that any plug ins you may be using, may or may not be compatible so they suggest that you do not upgrade to Win 10 faster than you need to for that reason. I know with for example Pro Tools each version is very Windows version specific. So my Pro Tools 9 works with my desktop tower running Windows 7 only.You download Ableton right from their site so you are sure to get the latest version. Included are 600 MB of loops and samples. The overall download is 707 MB’s. Mine loaded with Windows 10 without a glitch. I authorized it through the Ableton site and it loaded some samples onto some tracks so all I had to do was hit the play button to see it working, and playing in action. I hate it when a program arrives blank asking you to load some samples, etc. By maneuvering around in an already built session is the quickest way to learn something, and add on tracks etc.This package comes bundled with a lot of extra content that is nice to have. You do have to register to both the Novation site, as well as the Ableton site. Registering provides support and access to insider information so to speak. I have never met a DAW or other music related software that didn’t require some time to register and activate the software, and then configure. It’s not a 2 second job no matter which one you choose. I personally want all the included stuff that they provide. You may not wish to download the 1.4GB of Loopmasters_Excite content especially if you are running a DSL line, but with a Verizon FIOS 50/50 it only takes 3 minutes.This review is rather lengthy, and I appreciate you reading all of this. I hope it was helpful. I have to spend some time in Ableton using it in conjunction with this keyboard to provide that end of it, but everything seems to work well in my Windows 10 machine. I am excited about the expanded capabilities Ableton provides and it is just the right size in the 49 if you want to use it in your studio on top of your desk as a controller. It is also a nice add on to your rack in a live situation using it with a computer. It looks impressive as heck with the 8 sliders, and a 9th as a master in conjunction with the 16 velocity keypads. A great addition to your arsenal. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPQGYGZSPGWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVK2A3I#wasThisHelpful","R1JPQGYGZSPGWZ","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased Adobe Premiere Elements 12 a ways back, and also have Corel Video Studio Pro X8. I acquired Cyberlink Power Director 14 Ultimate because of its compatibility with Windows 10. As the description states, “World's Fastest Rendering -TrueVelocity 5 leverages hardware and software technologies to speed up video processing and outperform all others. TrueVelocity is optimized for modern CPU and GPGPU hardware platforms from Intel, AMD and NVIDIA to maximize memory allocation and usage.” So it is compatible with all three manufacturers Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA of display adapters.My Adobe Premiere Elements 12 is not compatible with Windows 10, at least not in every function, but fortunately Corel Video Studio Pro X8 has released a free update to 8.5 which is. This Cyberlink Power Director 14 is being released as a designed for Windows 10 piece of software from the get go.When I first got Corel X8 I was pleased that it had an easy-peasy video editor option that made it a candy walk to create a video right out of the box. This Cyberlink Director 14 has an equivalent easy editor. That probably has a lot to do with the instant results, and wall to wall 5 star reviews of those stating how easy it is to use out of the box. Others who delve into the more complex functions of video editing, and are frustrated that they cannot master it right away are those who are slamming the software with low star ratings. If you want a fully featured program that does incredible things, and enables you to do things that you simply can’t do with for example Windows Movie Maker then there is going to be a learning curve.The thing I love the most about CPD 14 is that you can edit this with 4 different camera angles. I have multiple high def. cameras, some more expensive than others, and I know how great it is to have different angles to capture the excitement of a scene. When a scene is captured using just one angle it creates boredom for the viewing audience. Having a multiple method option for synchronizing all 4 whether it be automatically through the audio track, or by markers that you can set and tweak using right and left arrows controlling individual frames etc. is an option that is worth the price of admission.Much is said about the lack of an owner’s manual and not without merit. But with the price of the manual to print, and then the large increase in shipping such a product compared to a simple disc in a light box it makes the lack thereof a smart move. Having a digital manual is just as convenient except for those who stubbornly hold onto having to have a book on the desk. To be honest I wish all of my books were scanned so my entire library would take up zero shelf space in the FireHDX. With the split screen in Windows 8 + you can divide a good sized monitor into the right half, and left half, and operate both programs at once without even having to bring them back up; they just stay there. Anyhow you shouldn’t have to change your computer in order to use some software but on the other hand all software these days doesn’t come with a written manual so get over it.A really cool tool is all of the videos you can find on You Tube where they take you through certain functions right on the screen. There is no better learning tool than to see it being done. A picture really does say a thousand words. Also Cyberlink has online help both in the way of information, as well as providing a forum that is filled with information from those who have been using the program, and are willing to help. So you can look something up quickly, or even make your own post about how to do something, and watch the CL community come to the rescue.Right now this is #9 in video editing software in the ASR’s - Amazon Sales Ranks. That’s a lofty spot because every other contributor in video editing software above it are all cheapy versions. So this is the number 1 video editor over $100; that is saying something. It even beats out Adobe Photoshop & Premiere Elements in the over one hundred dollar category. Right now it is actually priced the same.It comes with 2 discs containing more extra add-ons then you could ever use. They are offered to you individually when you load the program, or should I say after loading the program, they want you to do that first. So if you don’t want the wedding videographer suite of tools you don’t have to load them.No wonder it earned PC Magazine’s Editor’s Choice award beating out all others. In the words of PC magazine, “BOTTOM LINE- Power Director continues to outflank the competition, with top rendering speed, a massive set of video editing tools, the latest file-standard support, and a wealth of new features in its latest update.""Buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36NQ613F1ERK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01537HQE2#wasThisHelpful","R36NQ613F1ERK7","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been eyeballing the Nest thermostat for quite some time. This Lux Geo-WH Wi-Fi Thermostat provides all the automation plus the remote access whether in the house or from another location. There is a downloadable app for an Android or iOS phone or tablet. You can also control it intuitively right from the dial.Here comes the good part; installation is a breeze. You can visit the Lux-Geo website and they have multiple installation videos. After seeing one of those short videos depending if you have a heat pump with or without aux, or a conventional furnace with gas/oil/electric & air conditioning you will instantly be confident in just how easy this is to install. You want to be sure to shut off the main breaker servicing your heater so you don't short out a live line connect while disassembling the connections on your thermostat. That would take an easy install, and possibly turn it into a headache requiring you to purchase a new control panel for your furnace. Just be sure to shut off the breaker to your furnace. If you have a line tester just to verify you disconnected the proper breaker that would be good.Then it becomes as easy as drilling two holes in your wall, installing the screw/wall plugs and installing the thermostat. It comes with a really nice backing plate so if your thermostat was from days of old like mine is it covers up a world of sins without you have to spackle and paint your wall.By watching the online video for your type of furnace it is as easy as connect the dots. With a clear up close video they tell you to put for example the blue wire in terminal X, and the yellow wire in Terminal X etc. etc. etc. I purposely did not provide any of the real options because someone may read my review and look at it like the actual instructions. The online video provides exactly which wire goes where.If at any time during the installation you require any additional support you can call Lux-Geo at their 856 phone number. The easiest thing to do is visit the site, but it is good to know someone is standing by ready to help. You do not need to use the Wi-Fi app in order to control the thermostat, you can actually skip Wi-Fi altogether and simply use the scroll wheel on the unit.You set your comfort at home settings, and your away settings so when used in concert with the Geo-fencing via GPS through your phone or device it knows when you are away from home, or at home, and can set the thermostat to the appropriate settings. It is kind of like you are on your way home and it kicks on to the warm at home setting before you get there. You can also set up guests who can achieve the same thing.So for all intents and purposes it does what the Nest does and at a much better price. It looks good on the wall. The LCD screen is easy to read.

"The AmpProbe AMP-210 measures AC and the model 220 measures both AC and DC. The current number one seller in Oscilloscope Accessories is the Fluke 323 True-RMS Clamp Meter. Both AmpProbe and Fluke are owned by the same parent company Danaher Corporation. The price difference between two is only about a 10% difference. However the accuracy measurements on the 210 exceed the comparably priced Fluke.The Amp-210 comes with standard contact test leads. The alligator clip set comes with the 310, and 320 models. The AAA batteries are included and pre-installed. Enclosed in the box is also the user manual, and a carrying case. I have to say the LCD panel is easy to read when in standard mode at every angle. By pressing and holding the select button the panel is back lit. In the back lit mode it is well lit but the angle of use is limited to being below the unit or right on top of it which are the common positions of use. If you tilt the unit up and try reading the LCD from above the unit it is unreadable.Accuracy: the amp tip provides a measurement down to a tenth of an amp. The true RMS AC voltage range is 0 to 600 volts. The AC current accuracy ±1.0% + 5LSD (50 to 60 Hz) The AC current range is 0 to 600.0 A with an accuracy of ±1.8% + 5LSD (50 to 60 Hz) ±2.0% + 5LSD (100 to 400 Hz)The jaw opening is 1.18 inches. The 210 does have an auto-power off feature. It does not include a work light. It does provide the max/min/ and average feature. It is lightweight and well-built and should give you many years of good service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6PLJFAJA70U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYFGJU2#wasThisHelpful","RS6PLJFAJA70U","A14JBDSWKPKTZA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14JBDSWKPKTZA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The IOGEAR KVMP switch has been an excellent switch for me.  I previously purchased a KVM switch for a few dollars more that was smaller and not as feature rich.  I wasn't able to get it functioning properly, so I returned it and then purchased the IOGEAR KVMP switch from Amazon.When I first connected it, it wouldn't recognize my keyboard or mouse.  I called technical support and was quickly connected to a man who was a bit brusque at first, but became more friendly as we spoke.  Tip: Don't use a speakerphone when calling technical support.  When he heard my equipment and setup, he expressed confidence that we would get everything working fine.  He was right!One of the key things about this switch (and perhaps any switch) is that you need to have the drivers loaded on each computer for every device connected directly to the KVMP switch.  So, for example, in my case, I needed to connect the keyboard and mouse directly to each computer's USB port first, let the drivers load, THEN connect the keyboard and mouse to the IOGEAR KVMP.  At that point, the switch recognized the keyboard and mouse and everything worked well.While on the phone, the technical support representative gave me a quick tutorial on setting up hot keys to bounce between computers.  He set things up so I just press Ctrl-Ctrl-Enter and it flips me from one computer to the other.  I also use another hot key combination.  While on my work laptop, I can't stream music.  I can only do this from my home PC.  So he impressed me to study the user's manual, which I did.  I leaned very simple function keys combinations that enable me to tell the switch to port audio from my home PC to the speakers while I'm using my work laptop in the docking station.  It works great!  This a feature I absolutely love!I highly recommend this switch to others.  It may take a little work to get everything configured for your setup, but once it's setup properly, it works well.  IOGEAR's customer support is also a nice bonus!  The switch is feature rich with hot key possibilities.  Unlike other switches, the IOGEAR KVMP switch is very solidly built.  I found other switches at this price tend to be very plasticy and light, causing the switch to flop around under the weight of the connected cables.  Not this switch.  It is very solid and sits flat on my desk, even with a mountain of cables connected.  If you want to stack multiple IOGEAR switches, no problem.  The feet on one fit into recesses on the top of another.  Very nice feature.Highly recommended from one customer who is very happy with this device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNLTFN97ELSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002R5ABB4#wasThisHelpful","R2PNLTFN97ELSB","A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 10/19/15: This product has failed and has been thrown in the trash.  For the last month, my reception has slowly deteriorated.  Thinking it was the indoor HDTV antenna I was using, I decided to purchased and install an outside antenna with a preamp.  I wired this to my house cable wiring and it works great!  Except for the TV where the Mediasonic HW180STB is installed.  That TV receives signals terribly pixelated.  I then direct wired the line to the TV, bypassing the Mediasonic, then tuned the Samsung flat screen.  All my channels are back!  It's the Mediasonic tuner that's the problem.So I've reduced this review to four stars.  It's a good box, as long as it's running properly.------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWHaving been locked in the cable and satellite television market for years, I've been accustom to using a rented box to receive my television stations.  We recently ""cut the cord"" and ditched our cable TV, which freed up about $800 a year in television bills.  In the process, we purchased this box as a way to receive local over-the-air (OTA) content.  It's been since I was a child, in the 1970s, that I last pulled stations in using an antenna.  Boy, has this process changed, and for the better!  No more staticy, ghosty signals that constantly require adjusting the ""rabbit ears"" to pull the signal in well.After much research, I chose the Mediasonic HW180STB HomeWorx digital converter.  This little box grabs signals from your antenna, converts the analog signal to its digital constituent, then passes this processed signal to your television or home theater receiver for viewing.  The advantage of using this converter, for us, is it unlocks Dolby Digital 5.1 over an HDMI line to our home theater receiver.  Our television doesn't have an HDMI return channel feature to pass the audio from the television back to the receiver, so if we didn't have this box, we'd forever have to use the television's internal tuner and speaker, leaving our surround sound unused.After receiving the converter, I set up this little box in a matter of minutes.  It was really simple!  All I did was plug in the HDMI cable from our old cable box into the HDMI out on the back of the converter.  This cable runs to our home theater receiver, but it could also go directly to our television.  I then plugged the antenna in and plugged the convert into an AC outlet--done!  When this was complete, I powered it up.  After the box booted, I pressed the Menu button.  From there, it's very easy to locate the Antenna Tune function from the onscreen GUI.  A total OTA tune took only a few minutes, and this tuner found 28 channels in our modest, local market.The first thing I noticed was how rich and sharp the 1080i stations are.  Cable and satellite stations utilize a compression algorithm to reduce bandwidth.  The compression used is lossy and produces a ""softer"" image than OTA images.  Using this box, you get uncompressed OTA digital stations.  I found the OTA 1080i images to be really stunning!  They contain sharper detail than their cable/satellite counterparts.After you've completed a tune, you can press the extended programing guide button to see what's on each channel.  Unlike cable and satellite tuners, you don't get an overall guide showing everything on every channel.  Rather, you get the schedule for what's on the station you're currently watching.  This information is encoded into the digital OTA signal.  Using the tuner in my Samsung television, I wasn't able to view the channel programming guide.  That's a nice feature that the Mediasonic digital converter provides that is really handy.If you want to view cable stations, the Mediasonic HW180STB also supports tuning to your cable provider's cable line.  This tuning process takes quite a bit longer. I left the room and came back in five or ten minutes.  It also isn't as feature rich as your cable provider's cable box.  You won't have a fancy program guide, for example.  We cancelled our cable service, but I connected the cable line and performed a cable tune to see if I could grab anything off our cancelled service.  Sure enough, I was able to tune all our local stations and a few cable stations.  Unfortunately, the tuner also grabbed 167 scrambled stations, and the watchable channels it grabbed were mixed into these, making it very difficult to easily locate the channels I could watch.  There was also no programming guide for each local channel.  In addition to this, the local channel 1080i quality was inferior to the OTA content, so I wouldn't recommend viewing your local content this way.  Using an OTA antenna is really the way to go, if you can do it.The Mediasonic converter can act as a DVR.  Mediasonic refers to their DVR function as PVR.  The PVR feature records programs either by pressing record while viewing a program or scheduling a program to be recorded at a later time.  Unlike many DVRs, you cannot watch one channel while recording another.  Programs can be recorded to either a USB thumb drive (up to 64GB) or an external USB hard drive (up to 2TB).Experimenting with the PVR feature, I found using a USB thumb drive to be inconsistent.  I have several thumb drives of varying size.  Some worked smoothly while others caused pixilation and screen freezing.  I found two Verbatim thumb drives, each of the same size, were inconsistent.  One worked well while the other failed.  This failure could have been due to problems with read/write times to/from the drive chip, or it could be due to a problem that Mediasonic may correct in a later firmware update.  There's no way for me to tell.  I didn't test further to determine what was causing the inconsistency between each thumb drive.In place of the thumb drive, I purchased a Western Digital Passport 1TB external hard drive.  This worked perfectly.  Recordings were captured smoothly and effectively.  Playback was also excellent.Using a memory device, such as a thumb drive or external hard drive, programs can also be paused and played during general viewing.  This is helpful during those times you need to make a quick bathroom pit stop, grab a drink, or attend to something else.  Mediasonic calls this their Time Sync feature.  As with the PVR feature, pausing and playing a program only works well with properly supported devices.  It uses the memory device attached to the box to buffer content when viewing is paused.  If the storage device gives you problems when recording, you'll also have problems when pausing.For the money, this is a fine digital converter.  It supports a number of very helpful features, allows for HDMI connectivity (not found on all converter boxes), and supports both OTA antenna connectivity and cable/satellite connectivity.  Its use really excels for OTA use.If you're in need of a digital converter at a reasonable price, the Mediasonic HW180STB is a nice selection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QJ1S544L2JUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYETYX8#wasThisHelpful","R3QJ1S544L2JUU","A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, I purchased this more for me than my son--I'm 50!  My parents had this *exact* car when I was a kid, right down to the green paint and the faux wood paneling.  What we especially loved about this station wagon was the moon roof and the long, curved window above the back side window, all of which are faithfully reproduced on this car and are very, very cool!  Our car didn't have two dogs looking out the back window, which this car has.  Rather, we had a black poodle. :-)We also purchased the same Matchbox car as this, but in red.  That car has black dogs looking out the back window.My son and I share this car during playtime.  I'm particularly fond of this car though, and my son knows it as ""Daddy's favorite car!""

"Wow... This is an excellent game for the price.  My son is a MAD MAN with this game!  He's only 3, but he has it mastered.  After seeing how much he loves it, I just unlocked the entire thing and purchased it for him.  He was so excited to have additional trucks and vehicles to play with.  He was home sick one day and couldn't really do much of anything.  We set him on the couch and let him have a quiet afternoon.  He spend hours playing this and never got bored.We totally recommend this for any child or adult.  With children though, we recommend exercising moderation.  It's very easy for them to get addicted to games like this.  It's very well thought out and programmed.  If your little one loves vehicle-based games, download this one and take it for a spin.  I'm sure s/he will love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI43MXVRZY6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J4K6KI#wasThisHelpful","R3FI43MXVRZY6Z","A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a Christmas stocking stuffer gift for my son who was quite excited to receive it. What's nice about the Disney cars is, the quality is very good. The body is metal, not plastic. It's also a very accurate representation of the Disney car character. My son has a number of these cars in the series, and I won't hesitate to purchase others in the future.

"I’m a huge fan of the Pearl Izumi line. I recently purchased this thermal cycling tight to allow for cold weather riding. I use these over a base layer and have ridden in weather with wind chills below 32 degrees. Personally, I don’t recommend riding in that frigid of weather, but if you have to, I’m here to report that while my face and feet were freezing and in pain, my lower extremities were not. These thermal tights are really amazing.As is typical with Pearl Izumi, you get what you pay for. These tights are expensive, but the fit, construction, and performance are all excellent.I highly recommend to any and all riders, if you’re going to be riding in cooler weather, spend the money and purchase a quality pair of riding tights. You don’t need to look around any longer; these will do just fine!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIUNEV4D24PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00943PQ4Y#wasThisHelpful","RJIUNEV4D24PT","A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having a Samsung Galaxy S3 with an extended-life with a high-capacity battery makes finding a decent belt holster/pouch a real challenge.  This is especially true when shopping online, since you can’t test fit it to see if it will work.  With the massive battery I have attached to my S3, the phone is about a 1/2"" thick and .56 lbs. (yes, I weighed it on a digital scale).  I found this Rebano belt pouch, took a chance, and ordered it.When I received it, I put it on my belt, crossed my fingers, and then tried putting my S3 in it.  It fit perfectly!  The fit was a little snug, but very usable, and the fit loosened over time.  I was so happy to have found a pouch that works with this battery.  The last thing I wanted was to find it didn’t fit, then I’d have to contact Amazon to inquire about a return.I purposely didn’t write this review immediately for a reason: I wanted to wait to see how this pouch held up to daily use.  I’m happy to report that, after a year, it works as well as the day I received it.The pouch is constructed of leather or faux leather material (not sure which) with quality stitching all the way around.  None of my stitching has come undone and the pouch is still in fantastic shape.If you have an extended capacity battery and are looking for a case, you’ve found one!  If you have the stock battery, this case will still work very well.  Either way, this is a quality case at a nice price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252B9B1W5W6I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEE344G#wasThisHelpful","R252B9B1W5W6I5","A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As usual, Taylor of Old Bond Street (ToOBS) makes an exceptional shaving cream; the best I’ve ever used.  It’s so good, in fact, I no longer feel the need to explore and experiment with other shaving creams and soaps.  I’ve been doing that for over thirty years.  This is my third bowl of ToOBS, and each bowl is as good as the previous one.The lavender shaving cream is a bit different than some of the others.  The scent is clearly lavender, but very mild.  Too mild, in my opinion, but I recognize this is a subjective opinion.  It’s a wonderful scent while shaving, but after rinsing off and applying aftershave balm, it’s nonexistent.  I previously used the sandalwood scent, which, by contrast, was quite powerful.  The sandalwood scent would last all day, even after shaving balm was applied.  I’ve found different ToOBS shaving creams can have a different scent intensity.Regardless, this is a great shaving cream that I highly recommend.  Just be aware that the scent is not very intense.  This may be a feature to some customers.I’ve read other reviews of people complaining of their shaving cream being dried out when they received it.  ToOBS shaving cream is supposed to be quite soft and easy to swipe onto a brush with only a few whisks.  The lavender soap I received from Amazon is my first experience with the soap being dried out.  It’s not dry to the point of being a cake—it does have some softness to it—but I have to work my brush on the cream and whisk it around a number of times to get just a little onto the brush.  I don’t think it’s supposed to be this way.  This dryness might be contributing to its lack of scent intensity.  Perhaps other users can comment and share their experience, if they have a normal bowl of the lavender cream.I’m still a devoted ToOBS fan.  The dryness of this bowl doesn’t reduce my star rating for the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJJNGNOC47QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031OOHB0#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJJNGNOC47QF","A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HN2ZEPOV8JOG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow . . . This little guy is LITTLE!  I want to tear one apart just to find out where all that memory is being stored.I purchased this to stock a digital picture frame.  The other thumb drive I had stuck out past the side of the picture frame.  I needed a smaller one to make sure no one would see it.  The Silicon Power 8 GB drive worked perfectly.The material around the connector is a soft, grippy, rubber-like material that feels nice to the touch.  My only complaint is the protective top cannot be affixed to the attached chain, as shown in the picture.  This leaves the top susceptible to becoming lost.

"Very nice thumb drive pack at an excellent price.I purchased these to put in a digital electronic picture frame.  My only mistake was that I didn't take into account how long these are.  They're standard for a conventional thumb drive, but I didn't realize that they'd stick out the side of the picture frame.  This isn't a fault of the thumb drive, of course, but something I wanted to make people aware of, in case some of you use one for a picture frame.  The colors are nice, and the white protective covers are useful.Oh, and if you accidently put one through the wash, I'm hear to report that they'll probably still work.

"This thermometer was sent to me for my honest review. If you take a look at my other reviews, you'll see that receiving a product for review does not guarantee a positive review.I have to admit that I was skeptical when I saw this. I'm a former nurse, and this just wasn't around when I was working. However, on trying the unit, I was surprised to by just how easy and accurate it is. When I was aiming at my forehead without a mirror, I got some significant fluctuations. However, when I looked in the mirror and took my temperature, I could make sure my aim was a consistent distance from my temple and that there was no hair in the way. Maybe the reason that some folks are questioning accuracy is because it does matter that you're approximately the same distance from your skin each time, and it's really hard to do on your own face without looking in a mirror. When my aim and location are consistent, I don't get a variation of more than two-tenths of a degree. That's a very insignificant fluctuation for my needs and excellent for a thermometer in this price range.When you DO aim it at something like your hair, you'll get a ""LO"" reading. This is your indicator that something's gone wrong. The enclosed manual lists reasons for LO message: Hair or perspiration in the way, an air draft or dramatic change in ambient temperature, temperature readings too close to each other without giving the thermometer time to reboot, and distance of measuring too far. Easy.Another nice feature of this infrared thermometer is that it's non-contact. If you have the flu or some other communicable illness going around your house, not having to wash the thermometer between contacts is really convenient and hygienic. At the time of this review, there's the ebola scare going on around the world, and I'm noticing that non-contact thermometers are widely being used because they're great at reducing the risk of spreading disease.A really neat feature is that you can measure more than just your own body's temperature. The thermometer actually has three modes: Surface temperature, body, and room. My boyfriend is a retired mechanical engineer and likes to tinker with building things, including solar-powered creations, so this will come in handy for measuring surface temperature. As I write this, I'm in an office that I swear gets hotter than the rest of the house. Well, now I switch on ""room"" mode and do comparisons. Since we're in the process of doing some reconstruction on the house, it's helpful to have something that lets us know where we may need to add ceiling fans, etc.As far as the unit itself goes, it's got a great ergonomic design. It comes in a plastic storage case that includes two AAA batteries. I read the info booklet just to ensure I didn't miss anything, but you really don't need it because the design is very intuitive. There are four buttons on the front for: mode, Celsius/Fahrenheit, memory and a large button for scanning. The side has a button that turns the beeping sound off and on; it's nice to be able to silence the beep for times you want to measure someone's temperature while they're asleep.I highly recommend this product, especially if you are concerned about spreading illness and/or you are caring for a sick person whom you don't want to disturb every time you take a reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26I47VMBMYMYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGOQH8E#wasThisHelpful","R26I47VMBMYMYJ","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:02 Mins I was sent this glass teapot for review (as well as the tea in the video, which is not part of this purchase), and when it arrived (carefully packed, thank you!), I actually gasped at how beautiful it was when I opened it. Even though it looks lovely in the photos, the photos just don't do it justice.First of all, let me mention the beautiful beadwork on the sides and handle--stunning. The beads on the handle also help keep it from slipping in your hand as you pour the tea. Since it looks so delicate, I was surprised to read it's top rack dishwasher safe. I think I'll still hand wash it, though, because I like it too much to run the risk of having it bump against something in my dishwasher. Cleaning was really simple -- just swish with some soapy water. The infuser basket lifts out, of course, so that's easy to clean as well.When you see this in person, you may at first wonder how the tea escapes the infuser. However, if you look closely, you'll see there are very finely cut slits in the infuser basket that allow your tea flavors to escape as it steeps. Loose teas will likely escape those fine cuts, so I would recommend this for blooming tea. Tea Beyond makes a wonderful ""Fab Blooming Tea"" that I am currently using, and it's amazing to watch the bud unfold to this soft pink color that complements the butterfly atop the glass teapot.This would make a wonderful gift for yourself, for a friend, for Mother's Day or really any time. I've included a video with a time lapse showing the bud unfurling. It's so much prettier in person! Know that the teapot is the only item that comes with this purchase, but the tea can be purchased separately at Tea Beyond FLS-3SET-BLF2100 12-Pack Fab Flowering Blooms Tea.If this video review was helpful to you, please like it and let me know your thoughts!

" 1:00 MinsUPDATE December 2014:Unfortunately, the glue on the casing around the speakers is now starting to separate. This doesn't affect the sound, but it is something that shouldn't be occurring. I have the speakers sitting on a shelf, and it is rarely is moved, so this is some kind of problem with the adhesive used. I have downgraded my rating due to the adhesive issue mentioned with the casing as well as the brand name.***I was sent the Truffol DuraSound Speaker in exchange for my honest review. If you check out my reviews you'll see that being provided a product does not always result in a positive review.My initial impressions of the speaker is that it looks a lot more elegant than the round, ""spring-style"" Bluetooth speakers. I've had a problem with the spring-style ones vibrating and bouncing all over a table so much that they eventually fall off the table. This one, however, is solid, a nice weight without being heavy, and a style that doesn't lend itself to movement as it plays your tunes.Another thing I like is that the style is simple and elegant. Mine speakers are black; sitting on my other black electronics, the speaker looks okay out in the open whereas many times Bluetooth speakers have some wild colors that are great for travel but not so great for leaving out in the open.The texture of the speaker is sort of a flat matte feeling due to everything being encased in rubber. The only glossy, reflective things are the buttons on the top. These buttons allow you to move to previous or next track, adjust volume, or pause/stop playing. I use the pause occasionally, but the other two really don't get much use as I usually reach for my phone nearby to move to a different track.This paired so easily with my iPhone. I also really like that it uses a micro USB port. There's another spot for Line In. Because of the micro USB port there are no cords that have to be attached for this to play.You don't need to SEE this speaker to use it, and this might be helpful for those who are vision-impaired or just don't want to have to see buttons to use them. When you switch the power to ON, a female voice says, ""power on."" Once you've paired your device (you'll only need to do this once) when you turn the speaker on, it searches for the device you paired and then announces ""connected."" When you turn off the speaker, it announces ""power off.""Battery life is unmatched with every other Bluetooth device I've used. In fact, I don't even think about the battery running out on this when I'm using it. With others, a couple of hours into a pool party and the speaker would die. This one I just plug in every few days whenever I think of it. Battery life is ""up to* 8 hours. I've not tried to run it all the way down, but I've used it for hours on end without any issue of running out of battery.CONS:--The sound quality has left me a little disappointed. This just doesn't provide as loud and full sound, especially bass, that I was expecting from its size. For the price, it's decent sound and better than many in a cheaper price range, but still not what I'd expect from the appearance.--The Truffol logo was loose from the start. It was crooked, and when I tried to straighten it, it fell off. You can see it fall off in the video as well. I'd just leave the logo off, but it does leave an indentation where the logo is supposed to be, so I'll have to find a way to affix it again.This loses a star because of the cons above. However, don't be mistaken--of all of the Bluetooth speakers I've owned and reviewed, this is my favorite. It's used almost every day. The others are now in drawers or regifted. If you're an audiophile, a speaker in this price range isn't going to please you. If you just like to listen to music while you work or move about your home and want to get a fuller sound than you would just using a phone or tablet, this is a really good buy. It's worth paying the price difference compared to many smaller, cheaper speakers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IRULZFLVS2W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPUH6SI#wasThisHelpful","R1IRULZFLVS2W8","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent a sample of this to review, and this represents my honest opinion. You can check my other reviews and note that receiving a product for review does not always result in a positive review. I love this product and intend to buy it when my current bottle runs out.I have been using another brand's Vitamin C serum for some time now in an effort to help reduce brown spots and freckles on my face as well as help prevent wrinkles. If you're not familiar with the benefits of vitamin C, just know that it is a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent premature aging.The first thing I noticed about this serum is that, unlike others I've used, this one isn't oily or full of ""cones"" (silicone, dimethicone and the like). I'm in my 40s and still have hormonal acne and occasional cystic acne, even having a course of Accutane in my mid-30s, I am very careful about what products I use because my skin will break out. When I apply this serum, my skin just absorbs it without leaving an oily or slick feeling on my skin.The Viva Vitamin C Serum doesn't interfere with my makeup, either. With other silicone- and oil-heavy products, I had to limit application to only nighttime because of how it shortened makeup wear. That slimy feeling I had using other vitamin C serums is not an issue with this brand.I'm so used to companies putting unnecessary fragrances in their products, and this one has no added fragrances. There is a scent, but it's very mild, and I can't even distinguish it enough to describe it.As far as packaging goes, it's a dark (""amber"") bottle with an eyedropper. There's no product waste, and you can keep the product bacteria-free by not having contact with the tip of the eyedropper. The amber bottle helps prevent breakdown of the vitamin C. I also store it away from natural light in order to retain its efficacy. The bottle bears the stamp that it has a 12-month shelf life after it is opened.The ingredients just can't be beaten. First, there are ZERO parabens. As a breast cancer survivor who has read about possible negative health impact of using products with parabens, I avoid products containing parabens, particularly when they are things that remain on my skin for long periods of time. When I checked the list of ingredients, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no ""fluff"" or cheap fillers in the list. Here's the full ingredient list:Deionized aqua (water)organic aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe)sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin c)methylsulfonymethane (MSM)cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid)hamamelis virginia (witch hazel)kosher vegetable glycerincarbomerarginineorganic simmondsia chinesis (jojoba oil)tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e)phenoxyethanolethyl hexyl glycerinorganic centella asiatica (gotu kola extract)organic equisetum arvense (horsetail plant extract)organic pelagonium gravoleons (geranium extract)organic taracum officinaledandelion extractThe product is listed as 98% naturally derived / 72% organic. It bears the stamp that it is certified organic and not tested on animals.Directions given are to apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned skin. The directions state to allow time for the product to absorb before applying moisturizer. I've found that it absorbs very quickly (fewer than 30 seconds). As mentioned earlier, this serum doesn't leave a slick or oily film, so it doesn't interfere with makeup or make you feel slimy. When I use paper to blot the area of application, there is absolutely no trace of oil on the paper.Since the delivery route is an eyedropper, it's easy to use just a small amount. A little goes a long way, and one bottle lasts a very long time. I not only apply to my face, neck and decollete, but also the back of my hands where I have uneven skin due to sun damage.As stated in the headline, this is the best vitamin C serum I have ever used. I highly recommend it and will be replacing it when it runs out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DX2LK508YIPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLEK9DW#wasThisHelpful","R2DX2LK508YIPI","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this item for review in exchange for my honest review. You can look at my other reviews to see that receiving a product for free does not always result in a positive review.This is the third body fat scale I've owned. In the house there's a Tanita scale (with metal areas you step on) and a Fitbit Aria scale that syncs with my Fitbit Ultra and this new scale. I'll give you some pros and cons based on my experience with other scales.First, let's talk installation. I was really dreading the setup process because my Fitbit Aria scale was a headache to set up and continues to be a headache whenever I need to change the batteries. I'm happy to say that setup of this scale was a breeze. The scale came with clear instructions (in English, not Chinese, so apparently they fixed the problem the previous reviewer mentioned). There were different instructions based on whether your phone is iPhone or Android, and both sets of instructions looked easy. I was surprised when the scale paired to my phone without a hitch. I was waiting for some code or some error messages or some other headache, and it paired effortlessly. Furthermore, I was happy to find that the scale shipped with batteries since I didn't have enough AA batteries at home.I downloaded the iWellness app that is necessary to use with this scale, and overall, I find the app easy to understand (with a few exceptions mentioned in a moment). When you want to weigh yourself, it's as easy as opening the app and stepping on the scale. The scale then communicates your info to the app, and you're done.This is where I need to stop and mention my experience with the Fitbit Aria scale vs. the Easy@Home scale. First of all, unlike the Aria, the numbers on the Easy@Home scale are huge and easy to read. I also like that I can simply stand on the scale and don't need to wait for stupid messages like ""Step off..."" and ""Thinking..."". The Easy@Home is simply step on, step off. You're not left wondering whether your weighing session really ""took"" or not.Aesthetically, the Easy@Home scale is beautiful. It has the black glass as well as what looks like sterling silver finished accents. If you like to leave your scale out in the open like I do, it'll look great.Options: If you just want to weigh and don't care about the other details, like body fat percentage, you can step on the scale with socks on. I keep my scale near the bathroom so I get the most accurate reading sans clothing right after using the bathroom after I wake up. The app has options for male or female users as well as fine tuning readings based on whether you've input your activity level as ordinary, amateur or professional. The wording choices were a little confusing, but the image showed a progression that made me think that ""ordinary"" in this app is probably the equivalent of ""sedentary"" in other apps. Likewise, I wasn't sure what ""unit"" in the app meant until I tried to do a ""pull down"" on the entry field in the app and discovered that simply meant pounds, kilograms or stones.The app is extremely simple to use with the scale. What I was pleasantly surprised to see was that it offers SEVERAL readings that aren't included in many other scales like the Aria. The Easy@Home scale gave me a list of readings, including:Body WaterBody FatBoneBMIVisceral FatBMRMuscle MassIn the app, you can click on ""Info"" which will show a page with charts showing what the recommended readings are based on things like your gender and age. Unfortunately, some areas of the app look like they could have used an English-first-language editor. For example, the information under ""Visceral Fat"" in one area is ""Congratulation,Please Get on with a performance. A well-balanced diet and moderate exercise will keep you fit."" In the chart under the section BMI, the headings read: Thin BMI, Healthy BMI, Light Depot BMI, Serious Depot BMI."" I have absolutely no idea what ""depot"" was intended to mean here (overweight? high?), and I really don't want to spend my time guessing. These are easily fixed issues, and hopefully the developers will get a proofreader/editor to correct the English wording in a future update.The main screen of the app also calculates your weight compared with the previous weigh-in, which is a nice feature. In other apps, I find I have to do some clicking to get that information. I can click on my weight for the day, and that takes me to a screen where I can view my results as a graph or a list. The home screen also has a color-coded BMI scale, with overweight being red, fat being yellow, healthy as green, and ""thin"" as blue. I'm very visual and find it motivating to move my weight, body fat and other readings into a better zone.Regarding accuracy, because I have other scales, belong to a gym and am under frequent medical care after major surgery a few months ago, I'm confident that the readings on the scale are accurate because they are consistent with the readouts that I'm getting on other devices. This goes for both the body fat and the weight. I've never had the other readings (bone, etc.), so I don't have a way to verify those numbers are accurate.The app allows you to export your data as a text file. Unfortunately, currently there is no other option for exporting data as well as no syncing with the popular fitness-geared web sites. If you are only interested in tracking things via iWellness and not sharing that info with other sites, apps and gadgets, then look no further--this one is a winner. If, however, you want your readings to be automatically integrated with the other fitness-tracking apps and gadgets in your life, you're out of luck: You'll either have to manually enter them or write your own software program to transfer the data.Finally, this scale costs less than HALF of what similar scales are selling for on Amazon. If you're like me, a price difference like that can help me hang tight until some issues are fixed.Once the company enables the Easy@Home scale to share info with other programs and does an easy cleanup of the English in its app, this will be a 5-star combination of app and scale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31DP4J24PRG2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGQ0SV4#wasThisHelpful","R31DP4J24PRG2N","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this product in exchange for my honest review. If you will look at my other reviews, you will see that receiving a free product does not guarantee a positive review.I received the pink Tangle Teezer and was initially very impressed. First, it looks different than any other hair brush you'll find. I love the ergonomic shape of this brush, from the way it feels in my hand to the way the bristles are curved to the shape of my head. The finish is beautiful and glossy as pictured.If I had given a review after using it for a week or two, I would have rated it 5 stars because that was my initial impression. However, over time I have come to find that the way the tangles are ""teezed"" out of my hair is through breaking through them rather than detangling. There is more fallout in this brush than there is in any other brush or comb I use.The above experience led me to wonder what audience this product was created for. If your hair is long enough to tangle, then you would probably be looking for something to help get the tangles out. If it's long enough to tangle, then you likely are either wanting to keep it looking healthy at that length or even wanting to grow it longer. So that audience would consist of people like me.Any way that breaks hair or pulls it out of the scalp isn't one that is going to help my hair become longer, be healthier or look healthier. The best method that I've found (and also the one that most long-hair forums online seem to recommend) is a wide-tooth comb and patience: You start at the ends of your hair, and carefully work through a section with the goal of not ripping, stretching or otherwise damaging your hair. If you can do this process dry, that's best since hair is at its weakest when wet. Sometimes I'll add a detangler spray to the process if I need some extra help.I'm sorry to have to give this product a negative review, but I would not recommend this to anyone who has hair of a length that tangles, unless you have long hair and are planning to cut it in the not-too-distant future. If you have short hair and just want a great brush that gets through hair, then this one would be fine.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D1N8HR7AMGH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJ3QMFQ#wasThisHelpful","R1D1N8HR7AMGH4","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this thermometer to review in exchange for my honest opinion. If you take a look at my other reviews, you'll see that receiving products for testing does not always result in a positive review.This is my favorite instant read thermometer I've ever used. The one previous to it didn't fare very well when I left it sticking out of a roast in the oven. If you're familiar with Salvador Dali's work of art entitled ""Persistence of Time,"" then know that this was his work come to life. But I digress.Right away I noticed that this thermometer felt like it was a quality item. I have purchased other Measupro products, and I haven't been disappointed yet. The Measupro thermometer also has a nice large screen, making reading much easier than many other instant read thermometers on the market. The readout screen measures 1.75 inches wide. The rest of the face of the thermometer is the appearance of brushed stainless steel and features the following buttons:MAX/MINPOWERRESETCLEARCALC/FI'm in my mid-40s and finding I often can't read type that was once readable, so I was happy to find that the font is of a generous size that doesn't make me have to hunt down a pair of reading glasses in order to read things.The thermometer came with detailed instructions, which I happened to misplace. However, this provided a great opportunity to see how intuitive the Measupro thermometer is. This came in handy as recently as last night. I had left a tray of uncooked chicken breasts in the fridge long enough that I was feeling very iffy about making them a part of dinner. I decided I would just check the cooked temp on several of them and make sure the biggest pieces were at least 165 degrees. A press of the power button caused the unit to start measuring temperature. Interestingly, it measured the temperature of the room before I even poked it into the meat. At one point I bumped the Celsius button instead of the Fahrenheit button, and it was easy to figure out how to move back to Fahrenheit.The min/max feature I haven't yet needed to use, but I can see the value in wanting to see what the previous reading was. I have never needed to use the CAL (calibration) button, but it's nice to know it's as simple as pressing a button rather than having to wander through various counterintuitive steps.Other features: There is a loop cutout at the button end of the thermometer, and I can see that it would be handy if one wished to hang this around their neck while cooking or hanging it for storage. The loop also has a metal piece that would allow you to hook this over the edge of a pot to test the temperature of a liquid as it changes. I like that the probe end is sufficiently tapered that it won't leave obvious holes in the meat I am cooking. A plastic case that fits around the probe helps prevent damage to the thermometer and damage to hands that are poking around in kitchen drawers, trying to find the thermometer. The plastic cover also has a pen-style clip on it so you can affix it to a pocket.The thermometer is also much better made than my previous ones. I like that the color is very slightly off-white so it doesn't look starkly white, and the stainless steel colored face is attractive. The shape is also very ergonomic to hold. The probe is nice and long and doesn't make you have to get too close to the hot stuff in order to measure its temperature. I was very surprised to read it can be sent through the dishwasher, though I likely won't do so since it just takes a moment to hand wash the thermometer.The only thing that I can think that would improve this item is if the probe cover or the back of the thermometer had a guide as to safe cooking temperatures for various items.This is going to be a permanent staple item in my kitchen. It's given me peace of mind over those items that I used to try to eyeball -- you know, like when you wonder if the juices are truly clear or if you might have noticed they were a little pink? If you're cooking meats, you just can't afford to risk your health or the health of your guests. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16J2KCMYT28RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB8K85S#wasThisHelpful","R16J2KCMYT28RZ","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own two MeasuPro timers and love both of them. The first I purchased with my own money, and the CCT300 was later sent to me in exchange for my honest review. If you read my reviews, you will see that a free product does not always result in a positive review.We have a big house, so I tend to keep timers in different areas of the house. Sometimes I'll use the magnet on the back and attach the timer to the refrigerator, and I'm happy that the magnet is nice and strong, and the unit doesn't rock or fall off the fridge when I press buttons. I can also clip this timer to my clothing (typically, my waistband) as I'm moving about and doing laundry or other tasks.This timer has some unique features I've never run across in a digital timer. If you've ever wanted to time something without disturbing others, this timer is going to be perfect for you. It has a regular beep that is nice and loud, so you can hear it from another room. However--this is where it REALLY shines--it also has an option for the alarm to be a silent flashing red LED light or a vibrator. It does not do a combination of these, so you make your choice by moving a switch on the back. This is so great for things like business meetings, conference calls, phone calls with family, naps and so on. You can feel the timer vibrating in your pocket or just notice it flashing, and you can move on to other tasks without disturbing others.Immediately after the timer goes off, it starts counting UP. I like this feature a lot. A real-world example: I decided to meditate lying down the other day, and I was low on sleep; I decided that if I fell asleep, I must really need the sleep, so I put the timer on vibrate. A while later I awoke to see some 2 hours had passed: I knew exactly how long I had been napping.On the left side of the front of the timer, you'll see there are three options: You can view the timer as a clock, counting up or counting down. The next time you're following directions to beat that cake mix for two minutes, here's your timer.Another thing I really like about the timer is it feels much more solid and well made than other brands I've tried. I like that the color isn't a stark white, but more of a soft white. The gray buttons are solid, and the switches have a nice ""click"" feel as you adjust them.Other options on the front are MEMORY, HR, MIN, SEC, CLEAR, START/STOP.I am recovering from spinal surgery to my neck, and I find the memory feature extremely helpful. Here's what I do: I try to change positions/activities at least every 30 minutes. So I just put 15 minutes in as my standard, and when the timer goes off, I push the memory button which resets the timer to 15 minutes in one simple push. So if I'm sitting a the computer writing a review like this, I try to complete it within 15 minutes or take a break afterwards. If I reset it to go another 15 minutes, then I absolutely MUST get up and change positions after 30 minutes.This is a really excellent timer if you want a solid timer that doesn't disturb others (or make it obvious that you're timing things). It works very well to keep me on task as well as take necessary breaks to take care of my health. I wouldn't be without it in the kitchen, cleaning and decluttering. Somehow everything is much more doable if it's broken down into timed increments, and I highly recommend this timer, especially if you would benefit from the options to make the alarm a silent LED or a vibrating alarm rather than the standard beep.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KULHNVJX0DX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAFQ81A#wasThisHelpful","R3KULHNVJX0DX6","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this product to review, and I always give my honest opinion in reviews.First thing I want to mention is that I had to contact the company, and the owner responded quickly; customer service is excellent with this company.My boyfriend is a mechanical engineer and a former plumber, so installation was a breeze. I asked him if he thought someone without his background would have trouble installing it, and he said no. The installation and usage instructions are very thorough, using both full-color photos and written descriptions. We didn't have any trouble understanding the instructions, and, as mentioned, the customer service is wonderful should you need to contact them.Basically, how the device works is by allowing you to customize the amount of water per flush depending on your need (liquid vs. solid) and what type of toilet you have. We did some tweaking of the settings and found our perfect setting, and there have been no problems since. So how it works is if you have just liquid (okay, pee), you would need a smaller flush. So for liquids, you'd tap the top of the Tap-n-Flush, and a green light comes on. During the time the green light is on, you then flush the toilet by the traditional method. This results in a smaller amount of water being used. For solids (poo, chunky barf, etc.), you would just flush traditionally.PROS:--This unit has the potential to save you money, especially if you have many users. The more flushes, the more savings. Whether it would actually save you money will require you to do the math to figure in things like the cost of batteries, your water rates, and the number of people using the toilet.--It's simple to install and use.--It's kinder to the environment than traditional toilet use is.CONS:--It doesn't look great in the bathroom. It's right there on top of the toilet. We are finishing our bathroom right now, and everything looks nice except for the visible Tap-n-Flush. It would be better if there were a way to have it hidden--ideally an attachment to the handle itself or on the side of the toilet.I recommend this product if you have a high-usage bathroom and you do the math to see whether it will save you money. The instructions are clear, the customer service is helpful, and the product appears to be well made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KH8H1L9G4GDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRP2UOO#wasThisHelpful","R2KH8H1L9G4GDN","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They seem to get weak at the connection points on both ends, and I end up trying to tape or Sugru the things to keep them functioning. I have used this one for a while now, and it seems to be holding up just fine. I've taken the cord and tried bending both ends, and they feel like they're reinforced more than the other charging cords I've been using. So far, so good.

"I have used another peel (beta hydroxy) from Skin Laboratory, and I am so impressed with their products. I showed the other to my dermatologist, and she commented that it's just a weaker version of what she uses; she basically gave it her stamp of approval. So I was excited to try this one.As background, I'm in my mid-40s and have some weird brown patches. They occurred months after I went through chemotherapy at 39. Last summer I wasn't as fastidious as I should have been in reapplying SPF in the pool, so those patches sudden became much darker and very noticeable. So I started using this peel with hopes it would fade the brown patches. It worked very well and basically got them back to the pre-summer darkness level (not sure how else to explain it).This spring I've been really determined to eradicate those patches altogether without having to spend money for a doctor's office chemical peel. This is how I use the product: I start off by exfoliating my skin. I would not recommend this first if you haven't already tried the product. Exfoliating first will cause a more dramatic result (i.e., more burning). I then pour the peel liquid into a small glass bowl. I pour just enough so that I can add more if necessary but will not waste any of the product. I use a fan brush to apply it. I avoid the corners of my nose and mouth, because the skin there is too sensitive and will crack and peel terribly (I believe there's even a warning to avoid these areas). I do my whole face and then rinse after a few minutes. There is little to no frosting (if you're not sure what this is, do some googling about frosting with chemical peels). On occasion, I will go back after I've rinsed my entire face and reapply to just those stubborn areas.MORE is not better. I do not do this more often than the bottle recommends because skin needs time to heal and turn over. I follow the peel up with copious amounts of cool water. Then I do use a light moisturizer. I have problem skin (even went on a round of Accutane in my mid-30s for cystic acne) that is oily, especially in the T-zone, so I keep the moisturizer pretty light. I also use a tinted moisturizer for days after the peel since my skin is dry and has some minimal flaking/peeling. I also use a dark spot lightener from Paula's Choice; I do that once or twice a day.The difference with following this routine has been marked. My spots have faded to where they can be covered with a good full-coverage foundation. I expect they will be eradicated entirely if I keep to this routine. It IS the long route compared to a heavy duty peel you might get at a dermatologist's office, but it's oodles cheaper and doesn't result in downtime and missed days from work. I highly recommend this if you're patient and willing to do the rest -- regularly use products that will help fade brown spots, use a good exfoliant (chemical or manual), and use sun protection religiously.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JLJDGNWBS3EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GJND8O#wasThisHelpful","R2JLJDGNWBS3EK","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this charger for testing and review in exchange for my honest opinion. I tell it like it is, good or bad.The car charger I've been using has been big and interferes with my cup holder, so the first thing I noticed when plugging this charger in is how the small size is a real plus. Having two USB ports is really important for me as well as I use an iPhone and my boyfriend uses an Android phone. This charger enables us to have both phones plugged in and charging simultaneously.Another thing I like is that the connection is solid. What I mean is I've had previous car chargers that are flaky and required me to wiggle them to hear that the battery connection was working. This one consistently has a good connection and is reliable. It keeps two phones running on long trips where the GPS is constantly in use. I've noted no issues with overheating, either.

"I was sent this for review in exchange for my honest opinion.I've owned a few different mini speakers and have to say this one has great sound and features that you'll want in a portable speaker. The first thing I like is that you aren't dealing with batteries here; I can't emphasize just how important it is not to deal with batteries you have to add to a speaker. This speaker comes with a charger that's easy to plug into your USB port on your computer.As for form, it's quite attractive. I got the black and red design, and it was a good choice. For travel, you can close the speaker by pushing the top to the bottom and then twisting slightly. The end that plugs into your phone or other device is built right into the speaker and has a place for it to nest in the bottom when not in use. It's portable, which makes it great for using in the car. I like to use it in my car to boost the sound from my phone as well as amplify the sound when using GPS guidance.The sound from this small speaker is amazing. I have had it plugged into my phone and sitting on my table, playing music all week as I create art, and I haven't had to recharge yet. My boyfriend was sitting in an adjacent room and heard the sound and asked if that was the new speaker, and when I said yes, he promptly claimed it as his own. :) It's a nice, full sound. When I maxed out the sound volume on my phone, I was happy to discover that there's also a volume switch on the speaker itself, so you can adjust the volume there as well. To preserve the battery, there's an on/off switch on the speaker.The speaker comes with an instruction guide, charging cables and a soft pouch for storage. But I won't be using the pouch because we're using the speaker every day. This is one you can buy with confidence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LU0021X7RRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082E9K7U#wasThisHelpful","R6LU0021X7RRC","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was finding my necklaces knotted from my previous jewelry organizer, so I did some research and went and saw this in person at a brick and mortar store. It really is perfect. The top part telescopes quite a bit higher than you see in the photo, and you can turn it so the necklaces are staggered rather than hanging on top of each other. There's a ""key"" that you turn to tighten whatever position you choose for the top portion; I actually use that little key as yet another place to hang my bracelets. I fully extended the top portion, and the result is that even my longest necklaces hang nicely from the top. The bottom portion is great for rings or watches you wear every day. The whole thing feels sturdy and has a nice brushed effect to the metal. I couldn't be more pleased! Take a look at the picture I took above with my necklaces hanging on it.

"I bought this book on May 30 before hearing that the 5-year anniversary of Pat's being let go was coming up in June. It turned out to be great timing because there was a ""Let Go Day"" event in June with celebration about the anniversary, educational interviews about others who Let Go, giveaways and more.So who is Pat Flynn? Basically, if you're not familiar with Pat Flynn, search the internet for Smart Passive Income. In a nutshell, Pat was let go from his job as an architect five years ago when the big economic downturn occurred. In his search for ways to make income, he monetized a web site he had built for his own study purposes for the LEED exam, wrote an ebook and did a few other things and is now making more in a month than most of us make in a year.But his path hasn't been easy or without days he wasn't tempted to give up. In his book he shares how he let go of some of the constructs he had -- that old idea that working for someone else is the path to success nowadays. One of the things I like about Pat is his transparency, and he shares his methods in the book.A fun thing is at the end of many of the chapters there is video (that you can click on and go see) to give some video background on the subject of the chapter. It just creates a very well-rounded experience. I also loved the quotations and drawings at the front of each chapter of the book.So I highly recommend this book for anybody who's been laid off or anybody who is wanting to build a passive income stream as either security or as your primary income. It's inspirational, educational and real.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32RUUS1JVERLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFAGZBG#wasThisHelpful","R32RUUS1JVERLW","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have bought liquid peels (Skin Laboratory on Amazon) before, and the directions recommended using a piece of gauze for application. Not having any gauze on hand, I tried to use one of those cosmetic sponges, only to have a lot of the product end up in the sponge. This is the same issue with cotton balls. Frankly, most peels are pricey, and you don't want to be wasting any product, so a fan brush is a huge help.What I wasn't pleased with was the fact that this brush arrived with some bristles that were longer than others. I had to get out my scissors and do some trimming. Once that was done, however, the brush worked great, and I've been very happy with it. What I do is take a small condiment bowl (like they use on cooking shows for herbs!) and pour a small amount of the product in there. Using the fan brush allows me to work quickly and without wasting any of the product. Having used this one now I would not be without it or another fan brush for applying liquid skin peels. They save money over time as you're not wasting product on the delivery method as you are with cotton balls and sponges.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAI0Q8RLU03W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NMF63W#wasThisHelpful","RQAI0Q8RLU03W","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This attached to our stainless steel dishwasher easily and looks good. I don't like the aesthetics of the two different font types and/or weights as well as the squiggle and underline, but they were probably trying to make it easier to quickly see the difference; having had a different one previously, I find those things unnecessary. I am not really fond of the way the spinner rotates -- it stops at certain points. Not all of these rotating magnets do this, and I prefer the ones that don't have a stopping point so you can just turn them either direction. I also think the design would be better if there were a different style of edge on it, such as a tapered edge. This little magnet is cheap, however, and it does the job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3H9U00D0D84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FRVV4W#wasThisHelpful","RT3H9U00D0D84","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rather than forking out money that I don't have right now for a camcorder, I am making do by running a webcam connected to this. I've actually hooked up another 16-foot repeater cable by a different brand and have noticed no issues whatsoever. To make the cord a bit easier to handle, I purchased a cord keeper at the hardware store for a couple of bucks. I'm very pleased with my setup right now and glad that there appears to be no decrease in video quality or speed from using the BlueRigger repeater cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3HKCVEYJ4G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LJKEXS#wasThisHelpful","R1D3HKCVEYJ4G3","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying I use about a 2-inch thick piece of self-cut memory foam for a pillow. It's been impossible to make a dent (as the instructions say) and lie with my ear on the speaker without lots of discomfort. I took the advice of other reviewers and removed the cover, only to then find that my mate could hear the audio and found it annoying. I tried the speaker under the pillow as well, but that was a little awkward for want of trying to find where to position my ear so I could actually hear the sound. What I've found works best is to cut out a circle in my foam pillow and let this little speaker sit inside that circle with its cover on. The circle can be under the pillow or on top of the pillow. Actually, I made several so I can sleep on either my right or left side (with my face off the edge of the pillow) and just have to move the speaker to its new ""hole"" if I flip over. I've also found that using a very thin silk charmeuse pillowcase allows the speaker to slide into the hole in the pillow from the outside without my having to slip it inside the pillowcase. There are many options, and I'm convinced that most people can find a way to make this work for them -- they just might have to get a bit creative.As far as the technical specs go, the sound is excellent for both audiobooks and relaxing music and environment music (frogs croaking, birds chirping, waterfalls flowing...). I like the volume in the cord, but as another reviewer mentioned, it is quite far. You can probably find a way to hack this to your liking as well: I just sleep with my hand loosely cupped around the volume part.So in a nutshell, while I'd like to see some improvements made in the comfort of this product and the volume control placement, it's really quite good and meets the need at a reasonable price. I think most people will be happy. If you're worried about the cord fray issue that some have reported, you can always use a product like Sugru (search Amazon) or good old electrical tape to reinforce it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQ4X5HF3ZIJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092TX8Y0#wasThisHelpful","R1PQ4X5HF3ZIJB","A2UBUCOTX1YZH9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBUCOTX1YZH9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have my Moleskines color coded by topic, and purple is the color of highlighter that's hardest for me to find. I previously used a Sharpie Accent highlighter and wasn't happy with the way it was looking faded and pale on the page compared with the other colors. I ordered this pack online and was very pleased to find the color is nice and bold and most definitely purple rather than a shade that is too close to pink. The pen casing is transparent so you can see how much ink supply is left, and there's also a loop that you could use to attach your highlighter to something if you wanted.

And he's teaching her his bad habits.Troubles abound when terrorists (both foreign and homegrown) decide to use the Plant as a tool to kill thousands and the only ones fighting these terrorists are Cameron and Grace.This actually was a scary book, full of ""what ifs"" that sound all too plausible in this story.

ROGUE LAWYER was a less than so-so read.It really felt like a bunch of short stories that the author tied together by using one lawyer to try all the cases noted - which could have worked but ended up feeling just thrown together.Sebastian Rudd is a defense attorney, not liked by the DA's office, by the police, usually by his clients, and definitely not by his ex-wife. He doesn't have a permanent office since someone firebombed his last one so he does business out of a fortified van, driven by a man who is combination chauffeur/bodyguard/consultant and is called Partner - who he rarely talks to.The book looks at a few of Rudd's current cases, usually alternating chapters, with choppy writing and very one-dimensional characters.I was disappointed in the book and was especially disappointed in the ending, which was abrupt and left some of the plotlines dangling.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157C36K4VYGJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539436#wasThisHelpful","R157C36K4VYGJ2","A2H44WVZS59KKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H44WVZS59KKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an interesting idea. First, it's a tire gauge with a digital readout. Pressing the gauge button changes the reading from psi, bar, kpa, or kg/cm.It's battery operated with two AAA batteries (not included). It does have a CR2032 battery included to run the tire gauge. The AAA batteries are for the light.I checked the reading against a professional mechanical gauge and the readings were the same for the tire gauge.There is a light that can be turned on but it isn't very bright. It also has a hammer end with a sharp point that could be used to break a window in case of emergency. It's pretty lightweight so a person would have to hit a car window pretty hard to break it. In the handle there is a switch that extends a really sharp blade in case you need to cut a seatbelt. There is a rubber plug that has to be removed so the blade doesn't come out accidentally.This would be a good tool to keep in the glove box of your car.NOTE:  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TJMYH5R0GFZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0172UR51M#wasThisHelpful","R2TJMYH5R0GFZC","A2H44WVZS59KKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H44WVZS59KKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a great addition to outdoor parties, especially pool parties and any outdoor activity where broken glass could be a problem (namely all of them).These silicone ""glasses"" hold more than I originally thought they would - 12 ounces. And they can be used for all kinds of liquids, not just wine, so they are good for all ages.They are sturdier (not as squishable) as I figured they might be. They do squish - don't get me wrong. So you aren't going to want to give these to younger children to use - or sloppy drunks. But if you hold them at the bottom of the glass, they hold their shape without a problem.I like that they can be thrown in the dishwasher for clean-up and are reusable.When I'm traveling I like to have a glass of water by my bed and I can throw one of these in my suitcase and have it available at the hotel.NOTE:  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ILKHYIN0ENW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158U8CRY#wasThisHelpful","R9ILKHYIN0ENW","A2H44WVZS59KKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H44WVZS59KKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well made lightweight neck wallet that is great for holding your passport, credit cards, cash or other valuables when traveling.It has an adjustable neck strap (I measured as best I could and it measures 50""-51"" at its longest). You can wear around your neck under your clothing or crosswise across your body like a shoulder bag. If you wear it crosswise, you can't see the straps from the front and it's much less noticeable under your clothing. And the strap is long enough to wear it like this, at least for most people.The wallet also has two belt loops on the backside of the wallet, one beige and one black, so it can also be worn this way. The wallet has a soft mesh pouch on the back that you can stuff the neck strap into if you are wearing this on your belt. After placing it on your belt you can then rotate it and slide it into your pants to cover it up.The wallet is made very well with strong straight seams. The zippers are strong YKK well made zippers. It is made of strong rip-resistant nylon except for the soft mesh pouch on the back. The strap is 5/16"" wide knit material, sewn on one end and running through a metal ring on the other end (rather than a plastic ring).The RFID blocking is for the long vertical compartment that runs down one side of the wallet. It is plenty big enough to hold your passport plus credit cards and ID such as driver's license.The front compartments are big enough for your phone, cash or other valuables.This is a well made, useful neck wallet - perfect for frequent travelers.NOTE:  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TT1JNZBXAPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S2QXMS#wasThisHelpful","R12TT1JNZBXAPZ","A2H44WVZS59KKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H44WVZS59KKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was quite a departure from author Gerritsen's normal fare. This standalone story tells the tale of a lost waltz ""The Incendio"" - The Fire.The tale is told in two voices - that of Julia Ansdell in modern days who discovered the waltz in an old book of Gypsy music in an antique shop in Venice, Italy; and in the voice of Jewish Lorenzo Todesco, the violin virtuoso during the death camp days of World War II who wrote the waltz.I was intrigued by both Julia and Lorenzo's stories. The author did a super job of intertwining their stories and letting the reader feel the horror during both times depicted in the book.""Beware the ignorant, Lorenzo. They're the most dangerous enemy of all, because they are everywhere.""NOTE:  I received this book from Ballantine Books through Net Galley in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16N8HDSQPJHIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UEL0I4I#wasThisHelpful","R16N8HDSQPJHIL","A2H44WVZS59KKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H44WVZS59KKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tony Vincenzo is a television executive in NYC. He's just moved to New York and his wife and son, left behind in Los Angeles, are supposed to follow him after the school year ends.On June 7, a massive electromagnetic pulse hits Earth and suddenly everyone's way of life goes back in time a couple hundred years - no electricity, no running water, no phone service, most cars, planes and other vehicles don't work plus much more and it will be months and maybe years before things get back to normal.Vincent has to get back to L.A. and the only way to get there is to walk. So he starts off cross-country and finds that most people are willing to kill to stay alive including himself.This is a super post-apocalyptic story, the first book in a series. I liked the detail that author Knight went into in the story, telling about Vincenzo's travels - from New York across New Jersey to Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.Along the way he has run-ins with gangs, a husband with a pregnant wife, two small children that need his help, and a serial killer.I'm not sure when the next book in the series is due out but I hope it's soon.One small negative: the author seemed rather obsessed with everyone's bowel habits in the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34A8VO6X7ZL7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ESK1KY#wasThisHelpful","R34A8VO6X7ZL7H","A2H44WVZS59KKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H44WVZS59KKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great wig - for Halloween or cosplay or any role-playing you might do. The color is a very attractive deep red. It is 14"" long so it is past shoulder length.The wig comes with a separate mesh wig cap which really helps if your own hair is long. The wig cap keeps my hair up and out of the way, under the wig while I'm wearing it.The wig also comes with a wide-toothed comb to comb out the wig when it's mussed.For the price, this deal can't be beat.

"There's been an explosion in central Asia, releasing a virus that turns people into zombies (vitality challenged is the PC term).Then werewolves have been discovered in the Everglades.And you know those vampires - they've been hiding in plain sight for centuries all over the world.Dr. Vincent Conrad has convinced seven different countries, including the U.S., to house these monsters in giant theme parks called Monsterland.Wyatt Baldwin (no relation to Alex) and his best friends get invited to the grand opening of the U.S. park in Copper Valley, California and then the blood and guts hit the fan.This was a quick monster tale released just in time for Halloween. Even though it has teenagers in it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to younger teens.

"This is a small 12V mini air compressor that can be plugged into a cigarette lighter or auxiliary port in a car or truck. The compressor itself works okay. This would be good for bicycles, balls, or to keep in your trunk in case you had a low tire.  But it wouldn't be suitable to use for car tires regularly or for anything large.The cord is 7 1/2 feet long and not long enough to reach the back tires on my Toyota pickup. The air gauge is a good idea but the one on this one is defective. I connected it to a tire that had 32 psi and the gauge showed 80 psi.

"The space station Outer Earth is a ring, divided into six sectors, 18 miles around and sitting 300 miles above Earth. The last million humans are what's left from Earth, evacuated in 2234, and have been living on the station for over a century.Riley Hale is a tracer - a courier on the space station, getting packages to their destination while dodging gangs, and taking items in barter that will help her group of tracers, the Devil Dancers.This is one fast moving story, full of action and intrigue. I know there will be gasps of disbelief from some but it reminds me in many ways of Hugh Howey's Silo series.South African author Boffard has created believable characters - some very likeable and some dastardly. And some that you change your opinion of partway through the story.Boffard has also done a fine job in world building. I was able to visualize the Outer Earth easily although I'm claustrophobic and don't think I'd do well stuck in space.This is the first book in a series. ZERO-G is the second book and is due out in January 2016 and the third book, IMPACT, is due out in July 2016.If you like space thrillers, post-apocalyptic science fiction or even just straight-up action tales, try TRACER.

"Bella Bradley, famous TV cooking star, and Amy Lane, Maths teacher, used to be best friends back in school days. They were each envious of the other's life but both loved cooking with Amy's mother. They had a falling out and many years have passed.Then Amy's husband of 20 years leaves her for a younger woman, their twins aren't going to be home for Christmas, and Amy sees something on Bella's cooking show that gets her seeing red. And Amy finally gets in touch with Bella again - with results that neither expected.This was a fun but oftentimes serious look at marriage, friendship, television production, the haves and the have nots. It takes place in England but the messages imparted are universal.I especially enjoyed Amy's character just because I felt closer to her. Bella grew up in a wealthy family and is still very rich as a TV star and was harder for me to identify with.The side characters were a fun bunch and it was interesting to see details about a cooking show being produced.NOTE:  I received this book from Bookouture through Net Galley in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25PIFALIS2JUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FNZFBK#wasThisHelpful","R25PIFALIS2JUY","A2H44WVZS59KKT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H44WVZS59KKT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was not expecting anything fancy with this tablet. Upon receiving I was completely SHOCKED. I feel in LOVE with this tablet. Setting up this tablet was very easy, you could start playing on this immediately. It was honestly PERFECT for me. This tablet was very well made, durable. This tablet charged very fast, which was a great plus. This tablet is ran by windows, so you can easily add many different applications from the play store. The case that is included with this tablet is one to make this tablet into a laptop. I was highly impressed. I do wish this stayed a little better connected, for instance if I am laying down, it does not stay to well on its own. This is operated by Windows 10, which I happen to LOVE. I was impressed with how big the screen was, being it was a 10.1"". I was not expecting it to be that big honestly. Another thing I am impressed about was the storage, it has 2GB of RAM and 32GB of Nand Flash that is extendable to 128GB with a micro SD card. I was so impressed with everything about this tablet. I don;t think I could love this more than I do!• Sample Provided for Review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CULYZRC17LWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R1R4ZU#wasThisHelpful","R2CULYZRC17LWX","A2TW9Z67Z0T4N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TW9Z67Z0T4N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This dress is very well made, with NO loose threads and high quality material. I was ecstatic and very impressed with how amazing this dress turned out to be. This dress fit me seriously PERFECTLY. The length is exactly what I needed, the size was just the right amount of snug. The material was so light weight, you could not feel yourself wearing this dress. When I received this dress it was smooth and straight. I immediately fell in love with this slim evening maxi dress and its stunny quality! This dress is so beautiful, I received multiple compliments while wearing as well as questions on where to buy!!This dress is great for many occasions. It is dressy to wear any fancy occasion, or just to wear to something that you need to dress up but is not as fancy. This is a perfect choice for any special occasion in my eyes. With the dress looking modern, elegant, and luxurious it is a great dress to add to your collection of attire for important events! I felt amazing and beautiful in this dress as I know you would too!I have hand washed this and let hang dry. After doing so there was no fading, and no loose threads. The dress looked brand new after washing this way. I was very impressed.I was shocked to see that this was a PERFECT fitted dress for my body. Also, this dress was very true to picture, The color was exactly what I was expecting.Over all, I was highly impressed with this dress. I recommend to any one and every one.*I received a sample for reviewing purposes, However all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZKOPWVVNFM4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016ZHCGUS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZKOPWVVNFM4R","A2TW9Z67Z0T4N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TW9Z67Z0T4N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love how this case it, It fits my iPad perfectly. It is nice and snug. It is not to bulky or to thin. I feel like my iPad is safe and protected when using this case. I feel that if i dropped my iPad, i would not have much damage. I love the color, very unique I find. I love how this case slides in and out of my bag easily, the case does not get caught in my bag from being overly bulky. I highly recommend this case.

"I really wanted to like this game because Alawar develops some fantastic point and click adventures, however, this one is a let down. The story is good, you meet a ""prince"" on the internet and travel to his castle where you find out he has imprisoned women in paintings. It could have been a very interesting game, but it quickly became boring and I lost interest early on.The adventuring is bare minimum, with only a few things to do in each area. There is a lot of back and forth, mostly to drag out the game length. The graphics are very average. There are hidden object searches, which are the basic old school type, and mini games, which are very easy. There are no voice-overs, only written text on the screen. The game includes a diary and fast travel map, accessible from the diary by pressing the compass at the top of the page. There are 2 difficulty settings, but the game is easily played on either one.There are 7 chapters, but they go by quickly and I finished the game in one afternoon. There is no bonus content. For $1.99, the game is fairly priced, but it just didn't appeal to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EDRBYS65PLED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0185JV14G#wasThisHelpful","R3EDRBYS65PLED","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an enjoyable point and click murder mystery, although it is not as good as the second ""Final Cut"". This time you are sent an ominous package by a serial killer who calls himself ""The Director"", and you must follow his instructions before more people die. Once again, you play in the ""real world"" and the ""projected world"". Some of the story is a little slow, but overall it kept my interest.The game has all the usual bells and whistles. There is a journal, fast travel map, hint button, and footsteps which show you all available directions of travel from the current location. The journal and map are on a separate screen and accessible only from the MENU button. I wish they were on the same screen as the game, and didn't like having to exit the game to access these features. There are hidden object searches and mini games, both well done. In this collector's edition, you must find 49 slates, which are hidden throughout the game, and 16 morphing objects, which are only found in the hidden object searches. The music is great, the graphics are detailed and clear, and the voiceovers are very well done.I had no problems picking up or using the inventory items, and all scene transitions are smooth without any loading screens. You can adjust the difficulty level - casual, expert, or insane. I had no technical issues playing on Kindle HDX 8.9. There are seven chapters and a bonus chapter, so the game is long and involved. There is also some bonus content which was interesting. I got the game on sale for $2.99 (will go up to $4.99), and do feel I got my money's worth. I recommend this game, as it is worthwhile, especially if you're a fan of the ""Final Cut"" series (Death on the Silver Screen & Encore).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TUKC5EPVKEG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017YB694I#wasThisHelpful","R2TUKC5EPVKEG4","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent point and click adventure, although it is not as good as the first one (Off The Record: Linden Shades). You play again as a detective, this time you are sent to Italy to investigate the thief ""La Volpe"", but things may not be as seem. The story is good, but not one that you will remember once you finish the game.The adventuring is standard, and you don't hold on to inventory items very long, as many are used in the same scene where you found them.There are a variety of hidden object searches, mini games, and you must collect 52 foxes, 15 travel guides, 12 letters, and 17 morphing objects, all scattered throughout the game. It seems they threw in a lot of collectibles to make up for a short and so-so game. There is a journal with your objectives, but it isn't on the main screen - you access it from the MENU button. There is a full written strategy guide if you need help beyond the hint button, but overall, the game is on the easy side. You can adjust the difficulty settings (casual, expert or insane). The graphics and music are good, and the voice-overs are believable (except no one has an Italian accent?).I had no technical issues playing on kindle HDX 8.9. There are 4 chapters, a bonus chapter, and some bonus content, but the game is on the short side.

"This is a well-made game with a great story by a new developer (Orchid Games). You play as an archeologist who must stop an ancient curse and the evil that it might bring on the town of Avalon. It is equal parts mystery, Celtic/Druid folklore and evil happenings. The story kept my interest throughout.The game includes all the usual elements we have come to expect: hidden object searches, mini games, a fast travel map, hint button and journal. You also collect 70 mistletoe twigs, which are scattered throughout the game. The adventuring is fairly intuitive, but simple, as there aren't as many close up scenes to explore as I'd like. I had no technical issues playing on kindle HDX 8.9. Each scene transitioned smoothly without any loading screens. I was able to pick up and use all inventory items as intended. The graphics are spectacular, with a high level of detail, and the music is perfect.This is a fairly long game with 7 chapters, but no bonus content or chapter.

"This is a fairly good game, although the story is overly complicated and convoluted. You must return to 1677 in order to prevent a terrible betrayal which happened in the Order of the Griffins in their top tier, the Secret Five. There is a lot of information and back story, and some of the adventuring is just mindless chores, so the story ends up losing steam as you run around looking for a piece of rope or a crank handle. However, I did enjoy playing, and overall the story is quite good and held my interest throughout. This is the second game in ""The Secret Order"" series, but the only one available for android (the others are distributed by Big Fish and available for Ipad).There are standard hidden object searches (or you can play mahjong instead), and mini games, which are fairly easy. The game includes a very detailed journal, which has a lot of text and tells the complete story. There is also an interactive map, but it doesn't work that well, and only shows one major location at a time and the available areas within that location only. Because of this flaw in the map, there is a lot of back and forth if you don't know exactly where to go; and even if you do know where to go, you can't use the map as a short cut to fast travel to a different level. The graphics, voice-overs, and music are all good, but nothing outstanding.I had no technical issues playing on kindle HDX 8.9. I do appreciate that this game does not have a lot of invasive permissions, which most point and click adventures seem to be loaded with. You can play the first chapter and part of the second chapter for free, then it is $3.49 to unlock the full game, which is on sale right now and will go up to $4.99. This is not a very long game and only has 6 chapters with no bonus content.

"This is a fantastic game! The first ""League of Light"" is one of my favorite games, so I had high hopes for this one, and it did not disappoint. The story is interesting and very well done. You play as a detective who travels to Blake's Mountain to investigate missing children.  The adventuring is fun for a change, and doesn't feel like mindless chores. Each scene has much to do, and there may be 3 or 4 close up areas to explore. At times, you will have to find parts of items and put them together in your inventory before you can use them.The game has all the bells and whistles. There are hidden object searches (some which require interaction, and the standard type), clever mini games, a fast travel map, a journal for clues, a full strategy guide, and you get a small scarecrow as a helper. The scarecrow helper is the only part of the game I didn't like, as it really seems out of place for this type of game and detracts from the story. You must also collect 25 owls and 7 figurines, which are scattered throughout the game. The game settings are fully customizable, so you can get as much or as little help as you want. The graphics are spectacular, with a high level of detail. The voice-overs, music, sound FX and cut scenes are all very well done.There are 5 chapters in the game, which go by quickly, but there is a bonus game and an extra bonus game. This game is made by MariaGlorum, and if you've had problems or tap response issues with their other apps (Mystery of the Ancients series & League of Light Dark Omens) you will most likely have issues with this one, as I don't think their games run as well on older devices.  I had no tap response issues, glitches, or technical problems playing on kindle HDX 8.9.

"I play a lot of point and click games and usually know within a few minutes if I'm going to like a game. Within a few minutes of playing this one I knew it was not my cup of tea. Something about the game did not click, but I had high hopes since the other ""Myths"" game (Chinese healer) was very well done. The theme is super natural/Native American meets mystical healer/ghost spirits. Although it is a different type of story, I just didn't connect, and didn't find it interesting.The game has all the usual components we have come to expect: a journal, fast travel map, hint button, hidden object searches (or you can play a bubble shoot game instead), and mini games. There are a couple of other features which require you to find parts of an amulet and you also use special binoculars to see far away items. In this ""collector's edition"", you find 35 sun runes which are scattered throughout the game. The graphics are average, the voice-overs are well done, and the background music was okay to start, but became irritating noise, and I had to mute it.This is a long game with 8 chapters, a bonus chapter, and bonus content. Right now the game is on sale for $2.99. I didn't have any technical problems playing on Kindle HDX 8.9, but there are some questionable permissions that could cause issues on your device. As I have said before, a lot of work goes into making these games, so I am hesitant to give less than 4 stars, and not every game will appeal to every player.

"This is a fantastic point and click adventure, and the sequel to ""Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek"". You don't have to play the first one to enjoy this game, as it does stand on its own, and the sequel does not disappoint. The gameplay is similar to the first Enigmatis in that you collect evidence to solve a mystery, and are given ""objectives"" throughout the game to guide your investigation. There is a journal with notes and all your objectives, a map, a hint button, and sparkles overs areas of interest.The game flows intuitively and moves at a good pace. The graphics are detailed and crisp, the voice-overs and cut scenes are well acted, and the music and ambient sounds are perfect. I had absolutely no trouble or glitches playing on kindle fire HDX 8.9. Be aware that this is a large game and took up 1.07 GB, but it downloaded without incident and installed fine. I had no problems collecting or using inventory items, no delay with the tap response, and no loading screens between scenes.The hidden object searches are a bit different - you find items by silhouette or part and then follow steps to ultimately find one object, which goes in your inventory. This is a very long game, including a bonus chapter and an extra 10 page section in which you can read about redwood trees (actually pretty interesting). You also collect ""illusive"" objects (which are the same as morphing objects) and ""ethereal"" butterflies throughout the game. There's a lot to do in this game, it's an intriguing mystery which should hold your interest, but is definitely an adult story as there are murders and dead bodies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BOSL5S2A628B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016UNE8XA#wasThisHelpful","R1BOSL5S2A628B","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very impressed with this game, as it is a thoughtful, well-made point and click adventure. The story revolves around a supposed suicide of a famous actress and you play a detective who goes to investigate. Each scene is well executed, the story moves at a good pace and kept my interest throughout. There are some interesting features in the game, such as an evidence board, which you add to as you find new pieces of evidence and meet new characters/suspects. This is separate than your inventory items, which might need an extra step in order for you to use them, such as finding a flare gun but then needing the flares, or finding a locked box and needing a key.There are the typical hidden object searches (or you can play a bubble shoot game instead), and mini games, both are nicely done and not too frequent. The game also includes an interactive map that will fast travel you, a full strategy guide, and hint button. There are also little magnifying glasses over areas of interest, as well as travel arrows (to access these, push the blue button to the left of the inventory banner). There are no loading screens, and each scene transitions smoothly without delay. The graphics are spectacularly detailed, and the voiceovers are very well done. You also find 44 stars, which are hidden throughout the game, and 12 morphing objects, which are only found in the hidden object searches. I had no technical issues playing on Kindle HDX 8.9, although EIPIX games are notoriously glitchy, so beware you may have some issues as you go along - best thing to do is clear the cache in the running application of the game, force close it and start again. I unlocked the full version right away and it is definitely worth the $2.99 (on sale now). This is a long game which includes seven chapters, a bonus chapter and bonus content.

"This is a wonderful fairytale type adventure game with all the bells and whistles. If you liked the first ""Grim Legends"", you will like this one too. In this game, you play as a healer sent to help the queen of the Eagle Kingdom and her infant son. The story is original and kept my interest. The game is very entertaining, with many cut scenes, dialogue and character interaction. I really enjoyed going to this other world each time I played.The graphics are spectacularly detailed and colorful. The sound, FX, music and voice-overs are all very authentic. The game includes a map which indicates your current location, tells you where actions are available, and will fast travel to any location. There is a quick charging hint button and a notebook which lists all your objectives. There are mini games and hidden object searches, but not overly done. You find the hidden objects by list and also by ""parts"" - the screen zooms in the HO searches. You also find 31 ""healer's signs"" which are hidden throughout the game. I had no glitches or technical issues playing on kindle HDX 8.9 (FYI - this game is not compatible with kindle first generation).The game is a decent length with 8 chapters and a bonus adventure. However, the free trial is VERY short, about 10 minutes of play time. I wanted to continue with the unlock and was able to purchase the full game on sale for $3.49.

"If you're a fan of escape games, you will enjoy this one. The gameplay is straight forward with no obscure or unconventional solutions needed, although some of the puzzles were tricky. There are 15 levels and you must play them in order. Each level is a different, unrelated room. To clear a level, you must escape the room by finding a way to open the door.  You search each room and pick up important items which go into the banner on the right side of the screen. At times you will have to combine items before you can use them in the scene. There are also the usual number codes and various puzzles to solve, so pay attention to any numbers or patterns you see.Other reviews have made mention of random tapping. EVERY escape/point & click game has random tapping to some degree. That is how you ""search"" the scenes and discover active areas. If you knew exactly where to click, they'd be no point in playing the game.The graphics are simple and easy to see. There is generic ""elevator"" type music in the background, which you can mute.

"This is an impressive, well made, ""true"" (meaning no hidden objects) point and click game. It is by the same developers who created ""The Lost Ship"", which is also a worthwhile game. In this story you travel to Blackthorn castle in search of an artifact. The gameplay is standard point and click - you search each location and pick up useful items which go into your inventory (a satchel on the bottom left of the screen). If you come across an important puzzle clue or code, a camera opens from the satchel and takes a picture of the clue. This is a great feature, and saves you from having to remember or write things down.There is a map which consists of small screenshots of every location. However, locations appear on the map only after you have visited them. Each location is numbered and there are quite a few, but many of them dead end. The map is not interactive, and will not transport you. Be warned - there is a lot of back and forth in this game, and you never get to use an item in the same scene where you picked it up. If you don't have the patience to keep going back and forth, or you have difficulty remembering locations, this game will be frustrating. There are hints available by clicking the notebook in your satchel - this will bring up a written clue with the location number. I liked this hint system because it doesn't give you the answer, just points you in the right direction. If you are still stuck, there is a full walkthrough available online.The graphics are very clear, the music and sound FX are just right, and I had no issues or glitches playing on kindle HDX 8.9. The game is a challenge, but relaxing to play and you can go at your own pace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FBXUF0KIODBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TASD14U#wasThisHelpful","R1FBXUF0KIODBV","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a different sort of mystery game than I am used to playing. I will say that I found some parts difficult to follow and maneuver as there are no hints. The story is interesting and involves a string of murders which you are investigating. Each murder takes you to a different location and as you search the room you find inventory items which you pick up. These are used later when needed. This part of the game is standard point and click, however, there is another part of the game which is unique, although frustrating (for me anyway). This involves playing a fictional PC game called ""The Source and the Darkness"" in each murder location.There is no way to skip playing the ""game within the game"" (GWIG) part. I appreciate something different, but had problems with the controls, as playing on a tablet is different than playing with a joystick or mouse. There is also a lot of dialogue in the GWIG, and some of the tasks were difficult to figure out. The rest of the game is basically solving puzzles or entering clues, many of which you find in the GWIG. There is a map, and it is the only way to travel from one location to another, as none of the locations connect. The graphics, music and sound FX are all very well done. I had no technical issues or glitches playing on kindle HDX 8.9.Once you get the hang of it, this is a worthwhile game. But be prepared, it is challenging, and you must pay attention to the clues. Thankfully, there is a full walkthrough available online, which I made good use of. If you like having clues readily available, or you don't have much patience, this may not be the game for you. But, if you are looking for something different and don't want a game that plays itself, I highly recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPH62WDGM2OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PV34AM0#wasThisHelpful","R3UPH62WDGM2OB","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This developer, EIPIX, seems to be the only one making point and click games for android. I was very happy with their last few games (Final Cut: Encore, and Myths of the World: Chinese Healer), and this one is decent, but not as good.Firstly, I had no problems, glitches, or technical issues playing on kindle HDX 8.9. and was able to download and install the game in about 10 minutes. I unlocked the full game after the free part ended and the purchase went through just fine. Now on to the story: You are on an airbus (zeppelin) which is downed by red spirit wisp-type demons (yes demons again!) and you crash on a strange and ancient jungle island. Then a blue spirit wisp, who is supposedly good, promises to help you if you find her human form. However, you discover things are not as they seem. It sounds better in type than it actually is, there is not much character interaction, and the adventuring was a bit tedious. Also, the story moves very slowly.The game includes a map (it does NOT fast travel you), a hint button, and a notebook with your ""journal"" and ""objectives"". There are mini games and hidden object searches, some have the final object found by answering a riddle, which was different, but not difficult. The graphics are good, but not as detailed as other games, and the music is very good. You also find 40 golden blimps, 14 butterflies and 12 owls, which are hidden throughout the game. One note: when you use inventory items DO NOT drag them, instead, tap the item, then tap where you want it to go. If you are in a hidden object search or some of the mini games, then you DO drag the object to combine with another object when needed. Also, when you travel from scene to scene, you must double-tap the arrow to move.The free part ends quickly, and it is $1.99 (probably $2.99 by now) to continue. The game is not as long as others, with 6 chapters and a bonus part. You also get the strategy guide and other bonus content with the unlock. I lost interest in the game fairly quickly, it just didn't keep my attention, but that could be me. I know a lot of effort goes into creating these games, so in all fairness, I recommend trying the free part and seeing if it's your kind of game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R269FJ5M5BJZXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6XTNAA#wasThisHelpful","R269FJ5M5BJZXK","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly easy escape game, and enjoyable to play. The goal is to escape each room by finding an access card, which will open the door to the next room. You find the access card by searching the room for important objects, hints, and clues. You pick up the objects by tapping on them, which places them into the inventory banner on the right side of the screen. As you explore, you will use these inventory objects to help escape. (For example, use a corkscrew to open a bottle).  Sometimes you will have to combine inventory items before you can use them in the scene. Pay attention to codes, patterns and numbers - you may want to write some down, or just remember them. Escaping each room took anywhere from a minute to a few minutes, but there is no timer so you can go at your own pace.There are 15 levels and you must play them in order. Some levels have more than one room that you must search. There is very pleasant, meditative background music and good sound FX, both of which you can mute. The graphics are minimalistic, but sharp and easy to see. I have played all the escape games by this developer, and this one is probably their easiest. However, if you need help, there is a walkthrough available for each level that you can easily access at any time. I would recommend this one to all, especially first time escape players, it's simple, but there is some degree of thought and logic required. More experienced players may not find this enough of a challenge. You will know after the first few levels if this is your kind of game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BIX9TIE093O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LC93GCC#wasThisHelpful","R2BIX9TIE093O2","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic ""true"" (meaning no hidden objects) point and click game. It is by the same developers who made ""Alice Trapped In Wonderland"", which is also a wonderful game, and the gameplay is similar. In this story, you travel to an island in search of the Fountain of Youth. The game is loosely separated into 5 parts, which correspond to 5 different areas of the island. Be warned that there are many locations, and you search and return to each one several times over as you explore the island. There is a degree of concentration needed to remember all the locations/scenes and what actions can be taken in each one. As you go along, you pick up items, solve puzzles, and read journal entries.There is a full written hint system which you can access at any time, and a notebook which keeps track of all the important symbols and clues. There is also a map with small screenshots of every scene, but they only appear after you have visited that particular area. The map is not interactive, and will not transport you. The graphics are very detailed, and the music is perfect. All inventory items are labeled, and stored in a chest on the bottom left of the screen, which you tap to open. I had no trouble accessing or placing the inventory items, and no glitches playing on kindle fire HDX 8.9. However, at times my inventory banner would not scroll to the left. To fix, I just closed the chest and reopened.Although there are some challenging parts, which require logic and thought, the game is relaxing to play and you can go at your own pace. Unlike some that you can complete in an hour or two, this game is quite long and will give you many, many hours of play. I highly recommend this for all point and click fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MRXH5QQ311GO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXSNJ0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1MRXH5QQ311GO","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this game, this is one you will not be disappointed with. I liked the first Web of Deceit, but the game had so many technical problems and glitches, I was never able to finish it. Thankfully, I had no glitches or problems with this game playing on kindle fire HDX 8.9. I was not kicked out of the game, nor did it crash, stall, freeze or act up. (If playing on a different device, you may have some problems). I did get a message when opening the game about local and global progress not matching, I have no idea what it meant, but I pushed the ""use global"" button and never had any trouble.The story is a continuation of the first installment, with lots of intrigue and a mysterious woman who is more than likely very evil. The game has a nice pace to it and really held my interest, I played until the wee hours of the morning..The graphics are spectacularly crisp and detailed, some of the best I've seen. There seem to be a lot of cut scenes, but they are short and not too distracting. There are hidden object searches (I know some of you really dislike them), but not too many and they are done with a slight level of difficulty. You have to complete another step or two to find some objects. I did not find the game very difficult, but there are hints if you get stuck, an interactive map, a journal, arrows to show available directions of travel, magnifying glasses over areas of interest and hands over items that can be picked up (in casual mode). I was able to pick up and use all inventory items with no lag time or tap response issues. Also, none of my inventory items went missing. I did not care for most of the mini games; I found them more confusing than fun.The game has a lengthy bonus chapter which continues the story. I recommend this one for all, so far it's one of my favorites for the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YIIUGUPBTFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLV8KEM#wasThisHelpful","R5YIIUGUPBTFR","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firstly, I had a few minor glitches playing on kindle fire HDX 8.9. I purchased the full game from the free version. The game downloaded just fine (took about 10 minutes with wifi), and I was able to play without incident - at first. Then, the third time I opened the game I got a black screen. I shut off the kindle, restarted, and the game was fine after that. Also while playing I noticed some actions and tap responses were a bit slower than I liked - especially when investigating a close up scene or placing an inventory item. At times, the game almost stalled (more like a sputter), but never did completely, and I was able to play OK without any other severe problems. Having said that - WOW - this is a good game! It reminds me of the older Alawar games. The story has many twists and turns (missing people, giant octopus, curses, mystery to be solved) and the game execution is very well done - it held my interest throughout. The graphics are spectacular, and each scene has a high level of detail. The music and ambient sound was just right.The gameplay is basic point and click where you find and pick up useful items, put them in your inventory and use them accordingly when needed. Nothing was too difficult to figure out, but if you need help there is a hint button, a journal, and a strategy guide. You can choose from 3 difficulty levels. There is a map, and another map, and yet another map in the journal. There are hidden object searches and mini puzzles, which were interesting and I took the time to figure them out. You also find 39 hidden turtles throughout the game.This game is really fun to play with a lot to do, and it is a good length with 6 chapters and a bonus chapter. However, the download is very large at 1.1 GB, so be aware and make sure you have the space. I also think it runs better on newer devices and/or ones with plenty of free space. I definitely recommend this one, and hopefully you can work around the glitches, it is a very worthwhile game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILU9C9VHM8ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJ2EDX6#wasThisHelpful","R3ILU9C9VHM8ZT","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gem of a game! I play many point and click games, but this one is both unique and thoughtful, and really in a category all its own (although it did remind me of ""Shapik the Quest""). In this story, you guide Josef the robot to save his girlfriend from the Blackcap Brotherhood. The gameplay is standard point and click: you pick up useful objects as you explore each scene and use them at the appropriate time. Unlike other games, the objects do not go into an inventory banner, instead, the robot eats them. There is a sense of humor throughout the game.The graphics are stunning with hand drawn artwork, and really set the mood for this steampunk adventure. The music is great. I found the game to be a challenge, and really had to think in order to move forward and solve the puzzles. There are no easy actions here (like find a key and open a chest), you must consider the whole scene and what the robot can do - for example, his body can extend up or squish down. At times, I could clearly see what needed to happen, but simply couldn't figure out how to get it done. The game offers help, but even that was difficult to figure out, and I overlooked the whole help guide the first hour I played.  Alternatively, there are many walkthroughs available online.I recommend this adventure for those who have the patience to figure things out and want to take their time. I was actually very frustrated when I first played it, and sent it to the cloud. However, on my second (or third) attempt, the game clicked, and I found it captivating. This is not a game to rush through, or one you play when you're looking to waste a few minutes. It requires attention and some degree of concentration. I recommend this one, as it is very worthwhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCVSU24HZOYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUBNZ1M#wasThisHelpful","R1SCVSU24HZOYD","A1TT305V4I6PSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TT305V4I6PSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have several colors of these lights now in my front yard and I must admit that this color is my favorite.I placed the solar panel in direct sun for a day to let it charge up.  Then I strung it around my rosemary shrub and turned it on.  The thin double-wire copper is hardly noticeable during the day, but at dusk these lights come on and light up the shrub.  The lights are small and do not emit heat.The first six feet of this wire is coated in clear silicone and contains no lights.  This allows the string to be placed up off the ground.  Each light is two inches apart from the other lights.  There is an on/off button and a mode button, allowing the lights to flash, blink, fade, strobe or just stay on.  They shine all night long.

"OXA makes quality canvas bags and this one is no exception.  There is plenty of room here in a small space, and pockets are well-organized to give even small objects their own area.  A small 7"" or 8"" tablet fits well in any of the pocketsAll six generic zippers glide well, which is the first thing I test.  There is no hesitance or stoppage anywhere.  All external zippers have gliders attached to them, making these easier to grab when in a hurry.  There are three pockets in this bag, with the center pocket the biggest. Here is where bulkier objects no more than three inches thick would fit nicely. Inside the center pocket is also a mesh pocket, ideal for loose change or other small objects.  Across from the mesh pocket is a smaller, zippered pocket.The front pocket has eight credit card-sized slots and one slot for a thick pen.  All these slots are ideal for business travelers who have a habit of picking up business cards.  A checkbook can also fit inside the upper slot.  This pocket is covered by a thick canvas flap that is held in place by velcro with another 7"" pocket available for quick access.The pocket in the rear closest to the body is the smallest pocket.  It measures 8"" diagonally.There are two slots on the sides of this bag, one on each side.  The slots are deep enough for a small smart phone, keys or other small electronic device.This is a well-made bag.  All the seams are tight.  A lot of important things can be carried in this thing.  The enclosed shoulder strap is long enough to be worn across the shoulders for added security, but the bag can also be carried by the hand strap on top.  Overall, this is a very useful and diverse bag that will fit all kinds of needs, and best for someone who does not want to carry a bulky bag, but wants a bag that organizes the smaller things into easily-accessible smaller pockets.

"This is the story of a school that a Hazara man founded to educate his village's children, located outside the city limits of Kabul.  Teacher Aziz taught his students that they must think independently and critically, and question authority.  He is a well-respected man by both students and adults.  His students have been accepted to universities across Europe. What author Jeffrey Stern does here is portray him, several of his students, and describes how his school fared when the Taliban took over his country, and then as the school had to prepare to make it again on its own once the Americans leave.Stern's narrative is very personal and it gets the reader feeling compassionate about all the players in this story.  Even the Americans are depicted as wanting to help, but are held back by military bureaucracy.  Even the Russians under their occupation allow for education for all Afghans, including girls, and several students portrayed tell Stern that their literacy began when the Soviets were in charge, but once they left the suffering under a leaderless government began.The chapters are chronological, from the school's beginning to the end of American occupation.  Will the school survive?  Will Teacher Aziz survive?  Will the girls and women who learn under Teacher Aziz survive? Stern always writes with the student's point of view in mind, so memory may be incorrect or the trauma more embellished than it really was.  There is joy and sadness in this story, but in the end what remains is human determination.  An educated mind does not easily give up, or forget, once the window of opportunity is opened.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNGP5PXNVVM29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250049938#wasThisHelpful","RNGP5PXNVVM29","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little night light is a soothing addition to any room.

"This is a very nice commuter bag for anyone who doesn't like carrying the kitchen sink to outings, or anyone who doesn't want or need bulky bags.  It has one main compartment and two smaller ones.  It's big enough to carry all essentials.  It can carry a 10"" tablet, but a 11"" Chromebook is already too big.  The largest compartment has room for a tablet, a book, a water bottle and perhaps some snacks.  There is a smaller department for a cell phone and other small gadgets. Another zippered 5x7 internal compartment also has room for more sensitive documents.There are two smaller compartments on the front, both which have zippered closings.  The lower compartment has room for a packed sandwich or other edibles.  The top compartment has room for perhaps sunglasses.The one lightly-padded adjustable shoulder strap can be snapped over the left or right shoulder.  The material overall is a faded grey canvas that is very sturdy.  The one flaw in my sample is the zipper on the lower outside pocket.  It's not as smooth as the other zippers, even after oiling it.

"This is a fascinating story but it's not presented very well.  There is mention early on that there's already a movie in the works starring Will Smith and the first chapter is a courtroom scene with Dr Bennet Omalu having to tesitfy against his former mentor and supervisor Dr Wecht.  So what went wrong?  Movies tend to start out with an opening climax and then show the audience how it came to be.That style may work in movies, but it's harder in literature.  Jeanne Marie Laskas uses first person and third-person narrative to interchangeably tell the story.  The italics are the doctor's words, the rest is her back story.  It can get confusing.  She goes back to Bennet's traumatizing childhood in Nigeria during its Civil War.  Omalu is an Igbo, a Christian tribe from the southern part of the country that was the target of the Muslim Hausa tribe from the north.  He was a smart but lazy boy, but with luck and family ties was able to attend medical school and then study further in the United States, where he was subjected to racism from the start.  Knowing what the end story is, it's hard to focus on this part that seems to ramble on too much.The build-up to the courtroom drama is steady but predictable once the reader learns about Omalu's task to conduct an autopsy on the brain of a former Pittsburgh Steeler.  He had always worked under Dr Wecht, himself a poor kid from eastern Europe,seldom signed his name to his studies, and now he was in the forefront. Laskas is very fair at showing strengths and weaknesses by all the main characters.  The NFL's legal team doesn't even get involved until almost half-way into the story and the pace picks up, and this is where the beginning backdrop of Omalu becomes important.  All the good that Omalu had done as a forensics expert under Dr Wecht now becomes scrutinized, including Omalu's bouts of depression and other character flaws.  In the end this story is about a Nigerian doctor and his work fighting against the NFL.  I can see why this was quickly chosen as a movie; the Good Boy done Wrong mantra is popular here.3+This is not a long book, but even then the first part is all background.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11F0OFQPX69AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812987578#wasThisHelpful","R11F0OFQPX69AG","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This case is for the 2015 Kindle Fire 7"" only.  The case fits this tablet well.  Pop the tablet into the upper and lower sleeve and this will not budge.

"This light has several very good selling points:  it's lightweight, at only 3.2 ounces (once three AAA batteries are installed, which do not come with this purchase) , it has a very comfortable head strap that adjusts to most head sizes and the price makes this very affordable for those who only need headlamps occasionally.The light is quite bright when tested outdoors, and the beam does spread out more than it does indoors.  Pull the scope out for a more narrow beam (better for close-up jobs).  One can adjust the angle easily from the headset and it will ""click"" when it's in position.  There's a straight beam, a 30' beam, and a 5' beam.  As for the light, there's a dim, bright and blinking mode that is adjustable from the one top button.  You cycle through all lights by pressing on that button.  The scope is about two inches long and about 2.25 inches when extended.Getting to the battery compartment is a bit tricky, though.  You need to press down on both side buttons to open it.  The three AAA batteries, which are not included in this price, fit snugly inside.This is a very nice light for indoor and outdoor use.

"I have now tried three different Eukanuba recipes this week and this one's the best.  This one actually has healthy ingredients in it and no corn, which gives many dogs the squirts.  I have learned after sampling the Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy and Weight Maintenance recipes, that the quality of Eukanuba's kibble is as diverse as there are dog breeds on this planet.  I've learned to pay attention to ingredients.  The ingredients for this recipe are listed here on Amazon.  Interestingly, the recipes for the Large Breed Puppy and Weight Maintenance, both which contain corn meal as #1 and #2 ingredients respectively, are NOT listed on the company's Amazon pages.

"What lovely lights!  I have an older set of these kinds of thin, double-wire copper lights but they do not come with a remote.  For first-time users, be gentle when unraveling these, as the copper wire can easily become entangled in itself.  The remote and the white adapter (which connects the two black ends to allow the remote to work) are inside the plastic coil.  A CR2025 battery is already included for the remote.  Just remove the plastic safety tape and the set is ready to go. These lights are very lightweight, which is a big plus when putting up lights anywhere.The remote has a range of about 30 feet, which is what most bluetooth ranges are.  The red button in the upper left is the on/off switch, and the blue button in the lower left is the mode switch.  The lights have six different settings. You can change the settings of the light from solid, to  flash, blink, wave, fade and strobe.  I prefer my lights to not blink or flash.The lights themselves are a little bigger than tear drop and are four inches apart from one another.  They emit a soft yellow light. The copper wire is very bendable and these lights can be wrapped around most anything for a festive effect.  These lights are designed for indoor use, due to the electric plug on one end, although the lights themselves are waterproof.The only instructions that come with these lights are found  on the cardboard that comes inside the plastic.I received a free sample in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27RUHX1BSJ7WP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VW5MSG#wasThisHelpful","R27RUHX1BSJ7WP","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very attractive aerator/chiller.  I had the rod in the freezer for over a day. I personally do not like cold wine, but wine that's slightly chilled is OK.The first thing I noticed is that the rod takes up volume in the bottle.  I had to pour some wine out (don't worry, it didn't get wasted!) before the rod would fit nicely in the bottle, with it screwed on to the pourer.  Both pourer and rod stay in place; there is no wobbling.  But perhaps because I used this on a 1.5 liter bottle of wine, I must say there was no big difference between the wine's temperature before and after the rod was inserted.  For having been in the freezer overnight, I was surprised at how not-so-chilled this wine was after 30 minutes.Some people may be annoyed that some of the wine has to be poured out before this rod is inserted, however, for large parties this is a nice thing to have for perhaps a .75-liter bottle that doesn't need as much time to get chilled.

"The one thing about this formula that I like is the faint cucumber aroma.  Applying this is a bit different than some of the other XEN-TANs I have tried.  With this one, it's best to use it BEFORE taking a shower and let the lotion absorb for 45 minutes to a few hours before washing it off.  Also it's best to use a mitt or wear vinyl gloves before applying.  The tan that comes from this format is a natural-looking tan.  The longer you let it absorb, the darker the results.

The design is the standard corkscrew in the middle design, which folds into itself twice for easy transport.

Directions on how to use this are on a small card that's inside the box.I like the foil cutter on one end.The only thing that's a little imperfect is the sealant on the wood.

This tablet can be placed upright with the stand in the back of the case, for easier viewing and typing. The case holds the tablet inside securely with elastic corner grips.One must first sign in using one's preferred email address before setting up the date, time, year and connect to one's Google account.But there are other things that make this tablet cumbersome.  The touchscreen isn't very responsive.  The tablet tends to freeze. Not all apps work with this tablet.  Everything is slow to download, if it downloads at all. Netflix doesn't work with this tablet and many other cites like CNN don't work.  My German telenovella comes in garbled.  The few short videos I have watched tend to freeze. All the games that are featured in the iRulu folder warn you that they are not safe and can steal private information from your SD card and accounts.  (The games appear to be bootlegged versions of the copyright versions.)Video and audio quality are decent for a tablet in this price range.  There is a headphone port. The camera takes decent photos. One can disconnect the keyboard and remove the tablet from the case and  a touch-keyboard will pop up on the tablet.  However, other than the USB cord that comes with this, there is no AC adaptor for this device.(I thought I was missing one, contacted the company, and was told there is no AC adaptor with this tablet.)  This means that the included USB cord that comes with this tablet is the only means to charge this tablet, and there is only one macroUSB port, and that's the one for the keyboard.  This tablet does work while charging.  It also has a front and rear camera (3MP, 2MP) but the rear camera is covered by the case and obviously only works when one takes the tablet out of its cover.The Google apps seem to work well.  I can ask Google questions, I can use the GPS and view movies via Google.  .This isn't a bad tablet, but one must be aware of its limitations.I received a free sample in exchange for a review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBSDVMOS47WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SPNFM2#wasThisHelpful","R2PBSDVMOS47WZ","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eukanuba is marketing this as a high-end diet food for dogs by giving it some exotic name, but its first ingredient is corn meal?  And yet in the product write-up the company claims  ""EUKANUBA Adult Weight Control Dog Food is designed to give adult dogs the key nutrition they need without the extra calories. Our weight management formula, with real chicken as the first ingredient...""  This statement is deceptive and needs to be removed!Chicken by-product meal is the second ingredient, ""a natural source of chondroitin-sulfate and glucosamine"" for joints, but this food is not healthy. Corn is not easily digested by dogs or by humans and is often the #1 source of stomach sensitivities and allergies.  The sugars in corn also are blamed for dental disease in cats and dogs who are fed mostly corn-based food.  I might as well feed my dogs Cheetos.Sadly, my dogs seem to like it.  Even dogs like eating junk food.  But had I known that the first ingredient is corn meal, no way Jose would I have chosen to try this out on my own dogs.The kibble is the size of a US nickel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EYVJLFUS2ZVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ML7YO#wasThisHelpful","R2EYVJLFUS2ZVK","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my.  My dogs really went after these.  All the meat jerky treats by True Chews are a big hit with my pack.  My dogs are all at least 50 pounds, from 52 to 94 pounds, and can eat up to four a day.  That means this bag won't last long at all.  In fact, I forgot to place this bag high enough on the shelf and my lanky GSD was able to pull the bag down.  All five dogs feasted on all the treats and I woke up to a torn-up bag in the hallway.These only have a faint smell of duck to human noses and aren't sticky or leave an icky feeling on your hands.  They can be torn apart by bending them in half.  I will definitely buy more of these treats, but next time I'm leaving the bag in my truck so that I can use the treats as snacks when I go out hiking with my pack. I don't think hanging this bag in a bearproof canister (like the one required when backpacking California wilderness) and hanging it from our 10-foot ceiling is enough to keep my dogs away from these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWK2K0BI6PVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLXO6A2#wasThisHelpful","R2KWK2K0BI6PVB","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If this guide had more photographs, I'd probably give this five stars.  This guide is written by native Brooklynites and illustrated by one.  It has a personal taste, and is very thorough in its many landmarks, be they parks, hotels, restaurants, bars.  Brooklyn has 30 neighborhoods, and 19 are featured here.I was last in Brooklyn in the mid 1990s.  I walked across the Brooklyn bridge, I walked along the riverwalk facing Manhattan, I even did the 50-mile bike route that starts in Manhattan and, with connecting routes, circumnavigates around Brooklyn before crossing back into Manhattan.  While there are some bike routes mentioned, there isn't much focus on outdoorsy things besides the Coney Island boardwalk, river views, a few small parks and rooftop gardens. Brooklyn is a labyrinth of neighborhoods and all have their unique landmarks which the authors want to stress, so take a walk through the streets and grab some grub and brew afterwards.  This guide is aimed for people like me who do just that.  Locals (mostly business people) are briefly interviewed about their hood or their business to add that local flair.Photos are needed to show the architecture, the colors, the ethnic diversity that is Brooklyn. Brooklyn truly is beautiful but one doesn't get a sense of that from this book. But, all aside, this guide is a nice start and there are some unique facts mentioned throughout this book (ever heard of the Brooklyn wild monk parrots?), but despite all the knowledge in this guide, without enticing photographs of the landmarks, this is nothing more than a barhopper's brew guide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUA56F1EKXA2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101878231#wasThisHelpful","RUA56F1EKXA2J","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think of these as dog biscuits with Glucosamine-Chondroitin in them.  The primary ingredient is wheat flour, which one of my GSDs will not touch.  The biscuits are two inches long and about a half-inch wide and crumble into smaller pieces when broken apart, so best to give these whole to Fido.  They smell of baked dough flavored with chicken.  The bag is resealable, which is always a plus, and can fit in a pouch when out training a dog.

"My sample is a pretty blue with black highlights, a color combination that goes well with anyone.Initially I thought these were rather small, but each pack does hold quite a bit, and make traveling easier.  The largest pack can holdtwo pairs of heavy pants, or a heavy jacket.  Imagine if your luggage is ripped open, or breaks apart and all your clothes spill out.  At least with these, your clothes are separated into smaller bits and press into smaller cubes.  They do add some weight to the total luggage, so if you have a 50-pound weight limit like American Airlines tends to enforce on its passengers and you are close to that limit, it's best to use a lighter carrying device.The smallest pack is indeed very small, but can be used for socks and undies.  The laundry bag is best for dirty/soiled clothes that doesn't need to be compressed, but can also be used for boots or shoes.The included silk eye mask was a surprise.

"We always have a lot of batteries in our closet because we have a lot of flashlights and other electronics that use various batteries.  This helps organize various sized batteries for quick use, but I did find the AAA slots too large. It has room for ten AAA batteries, but there is enough room to squeeze almost an 11th battery. Since most AAA batteries are sold in packs of four, having room for 12 batteries would have been ideal.  Subsequently, the AAA batteries don't fit as they should.  The 26 x AA battery slots are a little bit snugger, but still allow some wiggling. The slots for C and D cell batteries also don't feel very snug. I did not bother mounting this due to the weight of a full rack and instead have this organizer flat on a shelf.The battery tester is a nice addition.

"This single pilllowcase comes wrapped in thin plastic, folded and in a charcoal grey box, and is perfect for gifting.  It naturally has folds in it from this.  It's soft on both sides and fits a queen-sized pillow well.  The stitching is good.  The zipper closes tightly and leaves no room for material to get caught while in the washing phase.  This material is very soft against the skin, which is silk's #1 asset. The tag says 100% silk and includes washing instructions.It's a very pretty case.  White is still my favorite color for sheets and pillows. Pay heed to the washing instructions!I received a free sample in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIB0MUJHOI2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XU1SH0#wasThisHelpful","RUIB0MUJHOI2M","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fast read because Steve Sheinkin makes this topic so interesting.  The narrative begins with the events in the Gulf on Tonkin and the now-known non-attack by enemy torpedo boats.  Soon events escalated to full war against the North Vietnamese. I was in middle school when the trial happened, but I didn't keep up with the details.  The name back then wasn't a household name.  Sheinkin takes Daniel Ellsberg's actions from start to finish, creating a man who was at first very patriotic to becoming anti0war toward the end.There are many black and white photographs that give Ellsberg a face and personality.  Smart and educated and a veteran himself, Ellsberg has made a name for himself.  The vocabulary is perhaps at a high school level, but this is a fast and comprehensive read for older readers and highly recommended for military history buffs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Q5R9YFJX40M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596439521#wasThisHelpful","R26Q5R9YFJX40M","A11OTLEDSW8ZXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11OTLEDSW8ZXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like that these have no filler and no toxic crap in them. There are other supplements that are as clean but few. But I feel absolutely no different taking them than when I took all the other vitamins I have taken for some  fifty or sixty years. I have no more energy and nothing is different. I've even heard them say that the thing grows hair and nails. Well, they get out of claiming that by saying ""some people have said that but we are not claiming it"" but hey, it's not true. There is nothing in there but the basic amount of vitamins needed by the average person.The price is very reasonable and customer service is good. So simply on the basis of the absence of toxic stuff in the pill I like them and I buy them. But, they are not anything exceptional beyond the lack of toxic material. But, that's really all they need to be because no vitamin is going to make you feel different or give you more energy short of a B 12 shot. There are those who ""claim"" they do. But that's in their head. They want it to, so it does. The placebo effect.A good multi-vitamin worth buying but not going to turn you into an athlete or make your hair thicker or your nails stronger. Get Knox gelatin for that. The owner of the company is a good pitchman and knows how to sell. He's out to make money and that's a good thing. But you are out to improve your health. These are simply vitamins. They're good vitamins.

"It's cheap. You get what you pay for. Poor instructions. There are two side for different types of batteries. You have to get the battery in just right and sometimes that's easy, sometimes not. I use this for the batter for a Droid X2. If your battery is totally dead (and that happens a lot with these phones) it will take close to 24 hours to charge your battery. At least it does mine. That's ok as long as you plan for it and as long as it doesn't cramp your style. It works for me but I'm sure it won't work for some.

"A great blender, Oster 14 speed works when others fail. My old one died on me. I bought this one to replace it for the main reason I have several nice glass jars and sets of blades and they're only good with the Oster. And they're too expensive to just let set. But, in a pinch, I went to a local store and bought another brand. It was more or less ok but it did not blend all my fruit. For example, the prunes stayed unblended. So, when I got this one, everything blends great again and I can use all my jars and other Oster accessories.Now this is not a Vitamix or top drawer blender with a ton of power.

"Disclaimer: I was supplied a free Fit-Meter pedometer for the purposes of an honest, unbiased review. The opinions expressed are my own and the receipt of a free product does not cause me to alter my experience or opinion of that product. I am not affiliated with Fit-Meter nor have they paid me any money or ask me to write a favorable review if I felt the product did not merit it.The first thing that impressed me was the warranty. It's pretty powerful and the company stands behind this pedometer. Be sure and register your device when you get it. That way if something goes wrong, you're covered with this great warranty.Setup was quite simple. Best to read the instructions. You first have to put in the battery and that's easy. You need a coin to take the battery cover off. Then simply insert it with the positive side down and put the lid back.Follow the setup instructions. You'll need to know your stride. You can find the average stride for someone your height and sex online. That will give you a decent average. Or you can do it one of a number of other ways. I already knew what mine was. Keep in mind that your stride does not have to be exact. Just close. I often wish these pedometers would just ask for your height and sex as Fitbit does to get this number. But either way is fine.I was up and running in about five minutes.I am so taken with being able to see my average speed! You know, the speed you walk is critical to your fitness --- more so than the actual number of steps you take. If you walk slowly and do 10,000 steps, you are not doing as well as the person who walks with speed and just gets in 5000 steps. So this pedometer is superior right off the bat giving you that vital information. Even the expensive Fitbit One does not do that. Nor do many other pedometers.If you are walking around the house or workplace doing your normal chores your pace will be about two miles per hour. While doing an easy walk around your neighborhood where you are able to keep up a conversation with a friend you will probably be doing around three miles per hour. A good average walking pace for a woman is three miles per hour or one mile every twenty minutes. For a man the average speed is three and a half miles per hour. This pace is adequate for healthy living. Walking at this pace for thirty minutes five or six days per week will reduce the risk of heart disease, type two diabetes and reduce anxiety and stress.If you are walking for fitness and exercise you will need to increase your walking speed to a brisk pace, between three and a half and four miles per hour. Time yourself on your normal daily walk and then try to walk this same length one minute faster next time. Increase your speed very gradually until you are walking at a speed which is 60 – 80% of your maximum heart rate. Walking at this pace you build up cardiovascular endurance and build muscle mass which helps you to walk faster more comfortably.I also love the split feature. I had to email support to figure out how to use it. You simply hit ""set"" three times and select 1,2 or 3. Best to start with one. Then do whatever it is you want to do. I do a 10 minute HIT run in place mostly. When finished, you can see your stats just for that activity. I really love this feature. And, you can easily erase this data without a reset of any sort.One thing I like about the Fit-Meter is that there is a very good manual online that you can always go to if necessary. It gives clear, step-by-step instructions. The instructions are much better written and presented than most pedometer companies provide. Just go to the Fit-meter website to get to the manual. Of course, a manual comes with it too.I did notice that for me at least, it does not count steps with it around my neck. In my pocket, it does. I prefer to wear mine in a pocket so that's no problem for me. But, you may want to purchase a decent small lanyard for the pedometer as the one that comes with it is not the kind that will work as an extra security clip.Also, I found the clip a bit hard to put on correctly and very hard to take off. I like to use the clip at times but I like to slide it off and slip it in the pocket. With this unit, I can't do that. The clip does seem to be sturdy and secure, however.Another unusual thing that can be good or bad. You can't reset the current data. You have to reset all the data, which erases any previous data you have. Now that may not be important to you. But I would like to be able to delete or reset just the current data at times. On the other hand, it is good that you can't hit a reset button accidentally and lose all your hard earned steps and data.Accuracy is, of course, of prime importance in any pedometer. Without that, it is worthless. At first, this pedometer seemed to over count my steps. But as I used it more and counted using the splits so I could erase the data, I discovered it was amazingly accurate. Certainly as accurate as my Fitbit. I just recently reviewed an Ozeri pedometer - a highly rated one. I found it very inaccurate. So, I didn't expect any better from this one. I was pleasantly surprised. This one is very motivating to me  because it is accurate and because I can monitor my speed and I have the ability to use splits for various activities.In short, I love this little pedometer. You don't get any junk steps. It's not 100% accurate. For example, I walked 12 steps in a test and the pedometer gave me seventeen. I turned around and walked the same 12 steps and it gave me thirteen. But there is no perfect pedometer. The Fitbit, for example, gives junk steps.There is a very noticeable difference in how the Fitbit and the Fit-Meter give steps. For example, in my morning trek to the kitchen to make coffee and return to bed, I log about 60 steps with the Fitbit. I log fewer with the Fit-Meter because I make brief stops here and there. In other words, I don't get a consistent ten steps in all the time. The interesting thing is, however, that it comes out pretty much equal to the expensive Fitbit in step count at the end of the day.But I have tested and reviewed many, many pedometers and I have to say this is probably the most fun to use and the most accurate I've used thus far. It has a few minor issues.For example:There is a little annoyance if you wear the clip. When you put the pedometer on or take it off using the clip, you will hit one or more of the little buttons. Now, you can't reset the unit so that's not a problem like with some pedometers. But I'd much rather be able to deal with the clip without touching any of the function keys. I don't think it has any effect on anything. I'd just rather touch an area where there are no function keys. But, as I said, you won't reset the unit because you can't. So unless that wears out the function keys given enough time, no harm is done.The pedometer is made of some sort of matte material. It is not plastic but a rubber-like material. So no worry about fingerprints or breaking. I don't know how time will deal with it under normal conditions but I think this is a pretty sturdy pedometer and even if dropped on cement I doubt it would crack.I am slightly concerned about how the little buttons or keys might hold up going forward. Time will tell. Also, in dim lighting it's somewhat hard if not impossible to read the display. I'd like larger and brighter numbers and even an LED light.I'd like to add that I got prompt help from customer support via email. That really is very important and many companies simply have very poor support. As expensive as the Fitbit is, their customer support is close to the worst of any company I've done business with. To me, customer service matters.I have read most of the reviews about this product. Let me address a couple of them. One person said they had 700 steps recorded before they got out of bed or right after they got up. Impossible. Can't happen. Not with this pedometer. They may have been looking at the total steps but not the current day's steps. It is just not possible for that to happen with that pedometer. Many pedometers, including the Fitbit, DO give junk steps. But even they do not give off that many.Another review said it was hard to set up. It's not. Anything can be confusing. But if you follow the instructions, pay attention, you'll have it set up in minutes.Someone else said they don't last. I have no reply to that. I have not had mine that long. I hope they're wrong.Yet another review said the plastic clip does not hold. I find the clip to be strong and holds very well. I know different people have different experiences with anything. And there are times people mistakenly review a product with another product in mind.The few negatives I've mentioned above about this pedometer are minor annoyances. At least to me. I've reviewed close to 100 pedometers over the last three years and so far I find this one to be the best of breed. And yes, I think it's better than the Fitbit.Highly recommended.Susanna K HutchesonFitness & Health Researcher/Reviewer","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6O950BLZ07RG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFBQTUK#wasThisHelpful","R6O950BLZ07RG","ADVLRJS633OTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADVLRJS633OTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used the Fitbit for a couple years. I chose to get rid of it when it got the bluetooth and was hooked up to wifi all the time. I do not think it is healthy to have your body used as an antenna. I know the science is out on that but that's what I chose for me. After reading the reviews, I opted to buy this pedometer.By way of disclaimer, I've only used it for about four days. But I have tested it under numerous conditions and with different strides.The manual is tiny. I mean tiny. And it is poorly written. Instructions awful. But, on the good side, customer support is superior and quick. Very helpful. Nice folks.Here's why I don't really like this pedometer. It is not accurate. It says if you take less than ten steps it will count those steps when you take more. So, if you take nine steps, it won't count them. But when you walk twenty, you should have twenty nine. Doesn't happen like that at all. In fact, you may end out with zero. Or you might end out with twenty or eighteeen.It does not count stairs as advertised. What they mean, but do not say, is that the pedometer seems to understand how to count your steps when you take the stairs. That's fine. But they should say that.It has no LED light. That is very inconvenient at night or under dim lighting conditions. Or, if your eyesight isn't great as is the case with many older people.It has to be worn just so in order to work. And you can never be sure when it actually is counting steps. It is not dependable. It goes along doing pretty good and then it just seems to stop counting.Now I guess that failing to count the 11 steps to my bathroom is not a big deal or really too important. I'm sure that walk has no effect on my health or fitness and is not truly exercise. But I rather expect the 60 to 70 steps to the kitchen for coffee and back to bed should count. Usually I get about 30 steps recorded. Sometimes I get none.A pedometer has one simple task - to count steps. That's all I ask of one. This one simply does not give that to me. I have adjusted the stride and tried many settings. I know what my stride is as I have owned and reviewed close to 100 pedometers. Of course, one's stride is not the same with every single step or, for that matter, his or her entire lifetime. But, it's easy to find your average.It seems that most people are very happy with their Ozeri. At least those who have left reviews here. I'm not. It is nice looking. It seems to be built sturdy enough and it quite easy to use. It has some good features. It is inexpensive. The customer support is above average. Far better than Omron and all the others.But here's the bottom line: It is not dependable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BIMICABPCI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DLVKES#wasThisHelpful","R8BIMICABPCI5","ADVLRJS633OTD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADVLRJS633OTD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the author, the gut bacteria or lack of it, is the cause of inflammation. Inflammation is the cause or a cause or many major illnesses, including dementia, Alzhermers and diabetes.

I found this a very interesting look inside lives of the people who protect the president and those close to him and also the truth about the people they protect. It does not give you faith in your leaders.

That would include the younger Bush and Obama. What a great way for him to hang on to his wife and get family protection all his life.

"I've only used this one time for some fairly small shrubs and not on anything thick. But they're easy to use and they have little rubber things on them to keep the handle from hitting your fingers or hands. I think for clearing a lot of shrub fast or trimming light shrubs they are excellent. Seem to be well made. They were a pain just to get off the card that holds them together when you get it delivered to you. I don't know why they put a hole in one of the blades but it does nothing for the weeding or cutting.At any rate, so far I'm happy with them for what they are. I have other tools for heavier things like large limbs and thick shrubs. But I needed this to clear some clutter shrubs that seem to accumulate yearly and I think it will serve me well.

"A Deadly Wandering takes a close, critical look at what our technology does to us? It offers some disturbing yet valuable answers and information we all need.While I found the book extremely interesting and quite well-written, I felt the author attempted, with some success I suppose, to make the cause of this Utah tragedy a character worthy of sympathy. He is not so worthy.Reggie Shaw came from a reasonably well off family. He has a brother who is an attorney who offered his advice. His mother and entire family told him to lie or, more to the point, not tell the truth or anything for that matter. They did this rather than make him take responsibility for the deaths he caused.The book deals with how his texting while driving caused the deaths of two fine men and by extension brought pain and misery to the lives of their families. He showed extreme irresponsibility. And, more to the point, many people do this every day. They are time bombs ticking, waiting to kill and injure other people.This books brings all this home to the reader. Texting while driving is as dangerous, perhaps more dangerous, than drinking or drugging while driving. At the least it is on a par.This is a book everyone should read but above all, those who text and drive should read it.Highly recommended.-Susanna K.

"I have had problems with whey protein but isolate usually works well for me. Getting one that tastes good, however, isn't easy. Nor is getting one that mixes thick, like a malted. So, I was surprised when this one did both - tastes incredible and mixes thick and creamy, even when you don't add a banana or anything else.I like that it's clean, with very few ingredients and it's all natural. And, it doesn't bother my stomach - regardless of what time of day I drink it.This is an excellent choice if you're looking for a good protein isolate.

It contains color-coded stability, strength, and power training exercises, programs, and assessments. The book has lots of great color photos of the many exercises, complete with instructions.The core is the center of power. With a strong core, an athlete can perform with great strength and endurance and the average Joe can function better in his or her everyday activities well into old age. One can't stress enough the importance of a powerful core and to that end, you will be greatly helped by this book.Admittedly the book is aimed at the athlete and their trainers. But anyone can learn from it. I especially enjoyed the part on power, strength and speed and was overwhelmed and delighted at the many exercises available to produce a dynamic core. I found lots of new exercises to add to my arsenal and so will you.Here's what you'll find in the book:ContentsIntroduction: Unleashing Your Core PotentialPART I Core BenefitsChapter 1.

"Nina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise, is a low carber and you know going in that she will only be kind to the ""science"" backing that lifestyle and find holes in the ""science"" backing other diets. Even the popular Mediterranean Diet is shown to be somewhat of a fraud. This especially interested me as I thought it healthy. I had no idea of the enormous amount of money making this diet popular and the lack of science behind it.Most of the material in this book has been published by Taubes and Bailor and many other low carb pushers. It leaves the reader not really knowing how to eat, what oils to use when and it's the basis of confusion.While the author discusses cholesterol, she doesn't know if it's a medical problem or not. Does anyone? But she tends to go along with the line that it has been made too much of and is not a real threat to health. She gives lots of studies but fails to even mention the recent study showing the relationship between high cholesterol and alzheimer's disease. In fact, I don't know of any of these authors who have mentioned that. Nor have I read the study enough to punch holes in it myself. But, if true, it's a reason for legitimate concern.I've read about Ancel Keys ad nauseam and, of course, this is more or less where this book starts. Then it reads like a Taubes book. She has done a good deal of research. She's spoken with the people who are still living who participated in the low fat studies and the other diet studies.I think she perhaps gives a good supplement to the Taubes writings and she offers the low carb community more information if not ammunition. Of course, the low carb diet is not at all new. It was tried with a good deal of success decades ago. But there was no governmental interest, no big food or big pharma interest and no money to do studies to any large extent.One can't help but wonder if the low carb diet is just another low fat diet, South Beach Diet, Atkins and on and on with no real evidence that it will work or that it won't even do us harm. The low fat craze has injured several generations of people who followed it unwittingly and trusting those in positions of power.As the author says, the American public has been used in a very big, very dangerous experiment. We don't want to be used in another one.- Susanna K.

"The author is a brilliant writer and story teller. This book is mostly autobiography along with some diet and exercise advice. The diet? Don't eat sugar or grains. However, there is absolutely no science, no studies, to back a thing he says. I personally abhor these books that want you to eliminate an entire food group. But, we can overlook that. We could overlook it if he expanded on what constitutes sugar, what turns into sugar and what he believes can be eaten in moderation and how he can prove it. But, that doesn't happen.The exercise part? Join a gym and lift free weights. Well, that lets out a whole lot of proven, excellent exercise methods like bodyweght exercises that many of us love and enjoy and that - well - seems to work for us. And it lets out folks like me who have a home gym or workout at home.The book is a cute look into the fitness industry which, like all businesses, are out to get your money. Not that that's a surprise or should be a surprise. But, he offers tips to save you some money too.His life story? It's interesting. His battle with cancer is inspiring. But few of us can take chemo in a doctor's home and recover in the doctor's home. We don't get that sort of care. So his outcome had a far better chance going in. Having said that, cancer is a tough opponent and I honor anyone who can beat it in whatever manner available to them.All in all, I found the book entertaining and fun reading. I found one of his little writing habits annoying. You know how some things are cute when you first read them? He will introduce a character and say, ""I'll call her _____. Well, because that's her name."" Ok. Once, it's cute. He says it all the time. He also says it in his newsletters and it's no longer cute nor effective.I found a few good take-aways. But it is simplistic and the view of one person with no science to back it and no alternatives offered. Dogmatic. Young people would be drawn to it as it's simple, easy to read and doesn't cause you to think much. But I'm not young and I expect more from what I read. I also am a researcher and demand the science and even the science can change in ten years. You know, eat margarine. No, eat butter.The book is worth reading if you want to be entertained and, to some extent, inspired to get up and move and to eat better. Just don't take everything you read in it as gospel. It's only one man's view.- Susanna K.

"I accidentally discovered Master Kam Chuen Lam when I found an old VHS of his Stand and be Fit. I was captured by his enthusiasm and knowledge and his terrific personality that comes across easily. I liked the way he did the video on location in China and above all, I liked the way the simple exercises made me feel. I liked the energy they gave me and the strength I felt.And so, when I discovered he had a new book and it was on a topic I have a good deal of interest in, anxiety, I wanted badly to read it and apply it to my daily life.In the past I would try to avoid thinking about things that made me anxious or troubled. But Master Lam teaches a very different approach. He writes:""In the ancient tradition of qigong, which is a way of working with all forms of energy, trying to avoid our actual experience is not considered healthy. Whatever we are experiencing is part of the total energetic field, both around us and in us. The more we are open to it, the more power we can draw from it.""And so, I started to allow the feelings to do their worst. I found, as a result, they would diminish as I stood like a tree and did the other simple energy producing exercises he teaches in the book. The Qigong exercises are a form of Zhan Zhuang which means ""standing like a tree"" and is roughly pronounced ""Jan Juang"", or, in southern China, ""Jam Jong"". This is the method he teaches in his video ""Stand Still and Be Fit"" (1995) and the one that is helping me so much. It's now on You Tube if you'd like to view it. And it's a form he teaches in this book. In the current book, however, many of the exercises are done sitting rather than standing.This new work is in a workbook format so that you can follow the exercises illustrated in the book and record your own progress over time. It is very interactive and unique to your needs.With this book, you will learn to relate yourself and your anxiety in a manner very different from the familiar western perspective. You will also learn to recognize your inner resistance to those moments of anxiety and other overwhelming emotions.Master Kam Chuen Lam has been a traditional Chinese healer for over forty years. He is also an internationally respected authority in the Chinese health systems of qigong and tai chi. He has produced over ten titles on these subjects and they have been sold across the world in over 17 languages.In these wonderful, empowering exercises you'll learn to turn feelings of anxiety into resilience and inner strength. The workbook also contains illustrations to help you easily do the exercises. Anyone can do them. They require no equipment and are simple to learn and put into action immediately. The author has  incredibly effective communications skills and writes in an easy flowing style that makes reading a pleasure. And it makes learning very easy and even fun.There are many forms of qigong. This method was taught to Master Lam by his Master, Professor Yu. Master Lam says in the book, ""The fundamental practice of wi ji is to align yourself, normally in a standing position, so that your body is centered, well-balanced, and upright -- and to remain in that position, without moving, while you progressively relax all your muscle groups, until the flow of energy within you and around you gives you what might be called a complete energy bath."" He then goes on to show you how to practice wu ji. Wuji (pinyin) or Wu Chi (Wade-Giles) is an important component of Taoist cosmology. It is the Chinese word used to point to the unmanifest aspect of Tao, or Tao-in-stillness. It is this stillness that allows the nervous system to calm down and for you to regain your peace of mind and empowerment.""Standing still in wu ji helps calm your nervous system. This process of relaxation is vital to your health and well-being. If your nervous system is agitated, the flow of energy throughout your body is seriously impeded. As you stand in wu ji, follow the following inner relaxation sequence."" He then describes the method for you. He adds:""Inner relaxation is the secret of all health and well-being. As you practice the postures and movements in this book, your inner work is to relax -- whether you are standing still or moving. You can then carry this inner relaxation with you throughout your day, whatever you are doing.""But, there is more in the book than exercises. The book is a complete guide to overcoming fear and anxiety and you'll discover how to use your senses to help you become calm and centered and deal with your fears and anxieties. You'll learn to use your sense of smell, vision and hearing. You'll also learn how to take tea in a way that will have a calming effect. You'll read:""So what should you do if you want to use the power of taste in an intelligent way and not succumb to the unhealthy eating habits of the modern world? There is an ancient tradition - famous in China, but also enjoyed throughout the rest of the world - that I highly recommend: drinking tea. Drinking a cup of tea is a way of engaging all our senses in a sophisticated way. There's the shimmering surface of the tea in the cup, the aroma that arises from the steaming tea, the delightful sound of the tea being poured from the pot into the cup, the warmth of the cup in your hands, and the taste of the tea itself. Every culture has its own version of a tea ceremony. Whether it is in a Middle Eastern market, a stately home in Europe, a Japanese teahouse, an Indian garden, or a Western restaurant, tea works its magic.""There's so much more in the book than I'd expected. It even gives you a daily schedule that will help you win the battle over fear and anxiety. It's truly a book of healing. It is also, however, a book of empowerment whether you suffer from anxiety or not. And do not be misled by the use of the word Qigong. Qigong simply means Life Energy Cultivation. It has its roots in Chinese medicine and while there are forms of martial arts Qigong, this is not that sort of Qigong. These are gentle exercises that result in calming, rooting, peace and inner happiness. They give you release from your fears and anxieties. They are proven to work. They've worked for thousands of years and some say it was passed on in secret transmission in China.While the exercises are calming and healing, there's more to them. Contrary to the most common notion of cardiovascular exercise necessitating vigorous movement, it is said that zhan zhuang confers significant physical conditioning. Postures used vary among martial arts and styles, with many schools using postures according to their own traditional forms (though the basic structure and principles of zhan zhuang practice largely do not vary). The type used in this book are healing and give energy.Do these exercises work? They do for me. The Tao Te Ching, penned by the beloved Laozi, says, ""By standing alone and unchanging, you will find that everything comes to you and the energy of the cosmos will never be exhausted.""The Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi tells us that the sages of old were ""still and unmoved . . . Their breathing came deep and silent."" Their ""minds were free from all disturbance . . . forgetting everything."" They were ""open to everything and forgot all fear of death.""Highly recommended.-- Susanna K.

"Edward Klein writes a great story. His writing, his reporting, is impeccable. His sources seem to be very credible. Of course, we all remember conversations slightly different than they were and in each person who does the telling the story seems to grow like a tornado in Kansas. But the original intent seldom changes. And facts are checked.This book is a page-turner. I seldom pay much attention to the stories of politicians because they're all so shallow and egotistical and such experienced psychological lairs. But this book is not written ""by"" a politician but by a skilled and, hopefully, objective reporter. One of the first things we're taught in journalism school is to be objective. Unfortunately, however, people don't seem to be learning that anymore. I think Klein still maintains that vital journalistic skill.Everything in the book has already been leaked or reviewed here. I won't repeat all that. All I'll say is that it's an eye-opener. I'd heard some of the stories before and suspected many more. With politicians, you're not dealing with normal people. Power is the coin of the realm to them --- the only currency they know or care about.I personally do not like the Clintons nor do I like the Obamas. Nor for that matter do I like many on the other side of the isle. I dislike politicians equally and without bias or regard to party or anything else. Frankly, I liked the Clintons and the Obamas even less after reading this delightful book.The egos of the two Clintons and the two Obamas are unbelievable. They all four feel entitled. That, I think, is at the center of this book. The feeling of utter entitlement coupled with childish fears and insecurities that make them close to pathological people ill fit to lead. And yet the American public vote for these people. They adore Bill Clinton as if he were a god. In return, Clinton uses the public's adoration for his advantage. He uses everyone and everything. But then, all pols do. It's just that Bill Clinton is superior at it. Both families want dynasties. It's all about them. Not the American people.Edward Klein has given us an eloquent study on two powerful families and their inordinate need to get and keep total power long term.-- Susanna K.

"I like this watch on many levels. For one, the price is great and Timex makes great watches that last forever. I also like the band. A man or woman can easily adjust it. The only thing I don't like - or one of a couple things - is that I don't see how the band can be replaced if it breaks - and that can happen with these bands.The watch is easy to read with a nice big face - yet not too big. And it's easy to set and adjust. It has three alarms, which is enough for most folks. Of course, it keeps good time and I guess that's something a watch needs to do.The only other thing I don't like is that you can't store workouts or laps on the Chronograph. I had that function on my Datalink and liked it. Of course, when you stop the chrono, it will start on the next lap. So you do have a record. I just liked the storage function.Naturally, the other functions are great.TimerOccasion has some preset things like birthday, appointment, bill due, etc. It's limited but a nice thing to have and allows you to keep from using your alarm for a one-time occasion.I use the timer for a number of things but I use it to time my radio commercials for one. It's a great countdown timer.All things taken into consideration, I think the watch is just great. I'd give it five stars but for the features I mention above that I find quite useful.

"I really enjoyed this little book. I already apply many of the exercises in it throughout my day and find them most effective. But, I learned some new places to exercise (in the bathroom, for example.)People tend to stress going to the gym and doing formal workouts. That's fine. But in reality, you can still be sedentary even if you workout three or more times a week in a planned program. It's daily activity that matters. That's what determines if you're active or sedentary.To that end, this book has a good deal of value. Of course, a lot has been written on ways to get us out of the chair and moving and standing more.

And it rates herbal supplements. I didn't totally agree with all of her ratings but we're not going to agree in full with any writer. At least, I hope not. And, it tells you the type of entrees to eat and the type to avoid.

"I don't really like to read the life story of someone half my age who has yet to be old enough to tell a big, significant story from which I can learn something. But, this is a decent book. If the writer could learn one thing from this old writer it would be to not use unnecessary big words or made-up words. Good writers use short, common words and don't try to impress with their vocabulary,or use of the thesaurus. Thus this sentence was uncalled for: ""He talked loudly, methamphetaminicly, and Ryan just sat there and politely tolerated his manic sales pitch."" Gawd! Are we to know what that word means? It's not even in the dictionary. Minimalism applies to writing in a very real way.The author says he wants to ""add value"" to people's lives. ""Habitually, before every tweet, every status update, every essay I write, I ask myself, Am I Adding Value?"" To that he adds, ""Adding Value surely doesn't sound as sexy as Going Viral, but it's the only way to gain long-term buy-in, and it's one of the few ways to build trust.""I think he and his partner certainly do add value to people's lives by discussing and advocating minimalism. Janis Joplin sang in Me and Bobbie McGee, ""Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose."" To me, that's the truth in an elegant nutshell.Milburn starts with his terrible childhood. I thought the book was about minimalism but it's truly an autobiography. We go with him and his partner through their adventures with their few possessions up to the present. We can, I'm sure, expect more books. Kind of like a roadshow.He does talk about how his mother had an overwhelming amount of junk when she died. This happens all too often. It happened when my mother died. It's common. People have way too much stuff. As a minimalist myself, I know how freeing it is to get rid of all but what you love and need. I used to be totally overwhelmed with all my stuff. I had clothes with price tags still on them! That's incredibly stupid and even wrong and surely unhealthy.So the message these two guys are spreading is of real value. It's significant and can give people a whole new life that is better and richer. But I want to read the message and not the messenger. I want to read about minimalism and not the minimalists. Certainly we, the readers, want to know and understand why the writer came to minimalism. But I couldn't care less about their sexual encounters or trips to bars or the fact that the only sex the author had was with his ""hand."" This I don't need to know and have no interest at all in.The author overworks his hand at his newly learned pros. He tries too hard to write creatively and cleverly and seems to be in practice for fiction writing. F Scott Fitzgerald he is not.

"I just love this necklace. It's extremely well made. You can feel the heft and the quality. It's a smart design that doesn't bring attention to itself but makes you look fashionable and classy. It's sent in a handsome presentation case and everything about it is quality. I was surprised at the quality for such a reasonable price.It looks red in the photo but it's a golden color.

"I bought this because my old one got wet in the heating element. There are so many reasons I love this cooker. First, it's very affordable. Then it's perfect for me because I want a cooker to fix just enough for me to have one or two meals. This is perfect for that. I also love the fact the crock comes out and cleans up so nicely without worrying about the heating element. And the cooker is so light and has a small footprint. It stores easily.I honestly can't think of a thing I dislike about it. I love the way it will keep things warm and has low and high settings as well.

"Dumbbell training is just what the name implies. You'll find a multitude of exercises for the entire body, complete with photos and step by step instructions on executing the exercises perfectly and safely. And, if you want it all laid out for you, you'll even get a workout schedule.You'll learn how to workout for power if that's your goal. Or strength if you're more concerned about that. And you'll learn how to workout with dumbbells in a way that's sport-specific.Here are the contents:IntroductionPart I Training With DumbbellsChapter 1 Benefits of Training With DumbbellsChapter 2 Designing a ProgramChapter 3 Incorporating Dumbbells Into an Existing ProgramPart II ExercisesChapter 4 Upper BodyChapter 5 Lower BodyChapter 6 CoreChapter 7 Total BodyPart III ProgrammingChapter 8 Training for Increased Muscle SizeChapter 9 Training for Increased PowerChapter 10 Training for Power SportsChapter 11 Training for Speed SportsChapter 12 Training for Agility and Balance SportsReferencesAbout the AuthorThe simple instructions are numbered for your convenience. Then the author gives some common errors that many people make in doing each exercise. And there are one or more photos of each exercise being executed.I think this is perhaps the best book on working out with dumbbells I've read. I'd prefer it if the book was spiral bound so it laid down flat when you're learning an exercise or doing a workout. I'd also like to see an index.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

"There is a lot to like and appreciate about Fitness Weight Training. The first thing I noticed was that you have many options as to the equipment you can use. Such equipment as strength bands and fitness balls are included. I use these almost exclusively and most books ignore them. And the book includes alternative exercises as well.The workouts can be done in the gym, on the road or at home.One of the best things about the book is that it's designed to meet the needs of those who are seeking one of three things in their weight training:Muscle toningBody shapingStrengthThen the book helps you determine your current fitness and exactly which program you should follow. And it then lays out a program designed just for you, including the intensity that is right for you.The photos and instructions are excellent and the book is laid out well. Unlike many fitness books, there is an index that allows you to quickly look up a special workout or exercise or information you need. What's more, each workout includes a warmup and cool down and shows you exactly what to do and for how long.One of the hardest parts of fitness and strength training is determining what exercises to do for what part of your body. And how long each exercise should take and how long a break should be. This book totally eliminates that problem. You'll know up front how long a workout will take. It's really very complete and will be of value to anyone of any fitness level.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

"I've always found boxing a great sport. And, even just shadow boxing is a great workout. But, there's more to it than just swinging your arms. In fact, as the author says, you hit with your entire body - not just your arms. So, if you slug someone or something with your whole body, you're hitting with every ounce you weigh. I should say every ounce of muscle.The book has lots of bodyweight exercises to use prior to the workout. I like all of them but I don't like his instructions on doing the triceps dip. He has you going way too low. That's going to injure your shoulder. I also wasn't crazy about his section on eating. Some of the things he suggested were not all that healthy. But a personal trainer is not a nutritionist. So what I really wanted - and got - was how to use boxing to improve my fitness.I like the fact there is a DVD that accompanies the book. And the book has great pictures that will show you how to jab, how to stand and instructions on the footwork. Footwork, by the way, is a very important part of boxing. And the arm you use, an upper cut or under cut should be executed with the right foot in the right position. Remember, you're using your entire body. Your arms and your body are one unit in boxing - perhaps more so than in any other sport.Here are the contents of the book:IntroductionExercise FinderRound 1 EquipmentRound 2 Knowing Your OpponentRound 3 Tipping the Scales in Your FavourRound 4 Warm-UpsRound 5 Form and FootworkRound 6 The Punch PrecisionRound 7 Total-Body TrainingRound 8 FlexibilityRound 9 CardioRound 10 Weight LossRound 11 Toning and ShapingRound 12 Strength and PowerRound 13 Going the Extra RoundThis book is geared to both men and women and to those who are just starting out to learn boxing or have been at it awhile. I love the technique of using a mirror to learn with. It's a perfect way to spar when no one else is available.If you're looking for a change of pace and a fun way to blow away some sloppy fat and get in great shape, I can't think of a better book for you.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

"Surprise is always the one element that almost always assures victory. When you know the pressure points on the human body and what they do and how to control them to your advantage, you can disable an opponent with very little force.

Or, how fast or how strong.In this book you'll discover how to instantly lower blood pressure to the point a person blacks out. You'll discover how to lower the heartbeat or make it faster.Then you'll be shown the many holds that can be used against you and what you should do when you find yourself in one of them.

"I received an advance copy of the book in order to write this review. I'll tell you going in the book advocates a paleo diet and the banishment of grains, oats and other things.As someone who pretty much follows the Mediterranean Diet, this doesn't appeal to me. But, having said that, I found the book a goldmine of valuable information, most of which I know for a fact is based on science and does indeed work. That is why five stars.This book is actually the second edition of the popular Smarter Science of Slim.According to a statement in the front of the book, The Calorie Myth was ""Previously published in a different form as The Smarter Science of Slim by Aavia Publishing in 2012.""A reprinted or republished book is one which has been previously published in a different form (e.g. a paperback which was previously published in hardcover) and sometimes by a different publisher.THE CALORIE MYTH is the simplification and application of more than 1,300 academic studies. The supporting scientific literature and scientific documentation is included to back up what Bailor writes.While the book has some typos and a few editing errors, the writing is excellent and the ideas and information well presented.I have a copy of the the first book and some of the content is identical. Having said that, the new book is more professional and the material better laid out than in the 2012 version and if you did not read SSoS, you will benefit from reading the new edition. In addition, if you did read the previous book, you'll benefit from the new edition.In this book, Bailor provides a five-week plan to burn fat and shed pounds ""quickly"" and a lifestyle program to improve your health.One of the fascinating things you'll learn in The Calorie Myth is how to reset your set point. Of course, that was covered in the previous book too.""Our set-point determines our long-term weight. If our weight is elevated, it's because our set-point is elevated thanks to what I call a hormonal clog,"" writes the author.He continues by giving an example of an elevated set-point being like a ""clogged sink."" ""When our hormones change, our set-point changes. This is why we gain weight as we age.""Bailor is against counting calories as are a good many experts in the health and fitness industry. It has proven to be a failure. I personally quit counting calories years ago and it's paid off.He writes, ""Basing your diet on calorie count is like taking a medication that treats the symptoms of an illness, but doesn't cure the underlying cause.We can monitor our bodies all we want by tracking calories in versus calories out, but if we're not eating foods that fuel our biological processes and help to regulate our hormones, we're not curing our bodies.""He adds, ""You can count calories all day and will not set yourself up for long-term fat loss if you are eating low-quality calories that trigger excess body-fat storing hormones such as insulin.""Numerous experts and health and fitness authors express their opinions in an effort to reinforce the studies quoted in the book. For example,""For the vast majority of people, being overweight is not caused by how much they eat but what they eat. The idea that people get heavy because they consume a high volume of food is a myth. Eating large amounts of the right food is your key to success."" -- Dr. Joel Fuhrman, MDBailor suggests folks discard their scales. ""As long as we focus on short-term weight loss, our efforts will not work out long term. We need to keep this critical perspective in mind because common things that do help us lose weight short term do not help us stay healthy and slim long term.The single most important step you can take to enable this mental shift is to get rid of tools that encourage starvation -- e.g., your scale -- and to set goals that will focus you on the long term. I know walking away from the scale is incredibly difficult. But until we free ourselves from worrying about our weight, we will risk relapsing back into our old approaches that we know do not work for the long term. Focus on getting healthier, not lighter. Your body will take care of the rest.""I know for a fact this is true. I also know most people will have trouble with it because we're taught totally differently all our lives. Of course, even the tape measure doesn't always tell the truth because many people get a bit bloated from time to time and their waist may show a number that is not fat at all. I personally prefer to go by the calipers.The exercise section is excellent. I have done the short, intense and sometimes eccentric exercises for several years and the benefits are awesome. More and more professional athletes and just everyday people are discovering that long workouts are pretty useless and very boring. And, often, the rest of the day is spent being sedentary unless you spend very little time in your chair.""While lifting weights helps boys feel like men, safely and slowly lowering weights enables us to use up to 40 percent more resistance. That enables more muscle fibers to be worked and more clog-clearing hormones to be triggered. That means more results in less time,"" he writes.There is a recipe section in the update. However, one of their sweeteners of choice is xylitol. I avoid this sweetener myself. To quote an article on The Mayo Clinic website, "" . . . be cautious with sugar alcohols -- including mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol. Sugar alcohols can increase your blood sugar level. And for some people, sugar alcohols may cause diarrhea.""If these are concerns you have, you might want to consider coconut palm sugar or some other sweetener. Stevia, although a processed food, is good as and also used in some of the recipes.I personally think we have to take the good out of what we read and discard the rest. There are those who will love this lifestyle in total and want to adopt it. Others may opt for a different eating style and perhaps exercise style.But everyone will find tremendous value in this book. It should be read carefully and fully absorbed. There's a lot of material here and, just as studies must be read carefully, so must this book. Skimming it is not the way to read it.Highly recommended.- Susanna K.

"The shoulder is a somewhat weak joint. It is prone to numerous injuries. Trouble is, once you get an injury, it takes forever to get your mobility back and the pain is agonizing. But, with the help of this book, you can perhaps cut that time and decrease the pain. There is an abundance of exercises in the book. Admittedly, a good portion of them are mostly for keeping the shoulders strong and healthy.The book is designed to help you build strength, improve flexibility, speed up recovery and prevent injury. Those are indeed lofty goals and thus a lot of exercises.The instructions are good. Lots of pictures to help you work through exercises you want. I find it's best to select the problem you want to address and then find just a few exercises to work on at a time.Most of the exercises can be done without equipment. Others call for a band.

"Can physical activity actually help a person mentally? Can physical activity improve an older person's cognitive abilities and perhaps even reverse cognitive loss? More and more studies are proving that to be the case. And, in this book you'll discover what health conditions can be improved or reversed and exactly which activities seem to do the best job at it.Alzheimer's disease and dementia are on the rise and according to studies I read, there may be numerous reasons for that. Not all of them exercise related. But exercise is one thing a person can do to protect themselves from these awful eventualities. But, there's more. The book covers depression, schizophrenia and addictive behaviors and the connection between mental illness and ill health.The book provides an evidence-based review of the connections between physical activity, mental health, and well-being, presenting research illustrating how the use of physical activity can reduce the impact of potentially debilitating mental health conditions. I think this is critical information for students, researchers and practitioners.I was especially interested in the section of Type 2 diabetes, physical activity and mental health. There seems to be an epidemic of this awful disease. Moreover, even prediabetes can be a precursor to dementia --- just having blood glucose over 92 in some cases. And it is a proved fact that exercise can actually reverse prediabetes. If a deadly disease can be prevented rather than treated, isn't that the smart thing to do?With contributions from internationally renowned experts, Physical Activity and Mental Health presents research illustrating how the use of physical activity can enhance well-being and reduce the impact of potentially debilitating mental health conditions.ContentsPrefacePart I: Introduction to Physical Activity and Mental HealthChapter 1.

"This book is far and away the most trusted resource for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching, an effective and easy-to-use method that involves stretching the muscle, contracting it isometrically against resistance, and then stretching it again to increase range of motion. Featuring a full-color interior, streamlined organization, and a new online video package, the fourth edition brings PNF stretching beyond the treatment room with the inclusion of techniques for the gym, workout room, and home.Having had treatment with this type of stretching and doing it myself, I know how very effective it is. I had tremendous hip and lower back pain and this was the only form of treatment that effectively gave me relief.The fourth edition offers a visual demonstration of PNF stretching techniques with more than 320 photos and illustrations. It includes these updates:  A full-color interior provides readers with clear images of the techniques discussed  Graphic elements on selected photos highlight the muscles being stretched as well as the isometric effort for the stretcher and the partner  Reorganization streamlines the content into two parts, first focusing on the basics and then covering stretches  Expanded content demonstrates how to incorporate stretches, including strengthening routines, into nontherapy workouts to optimize functional training  An appendix showcases anatomical planes of motion, anatomical terms, and types of joints  Online high-definition video presents both treatment room techniques and simplified PNF stretches for nontherapy settingsContentsOnline Video ContentsPrefaceAcknowledgmentsPart I.

"The Flood Girls is set in a small town in Montana, where not much has changed and the local tavern is still the meeting place for an eclectic group of quirky characters.  Rachel has returned home after nine years in order to “be of service, to right her name” to her estranged mother and a judgmental town.  Years ago, Rachel left in disgrace, after a checkered past, which included much sex and alcohol. Forgiveness does not come easily, however, Rachel's mother, Laverna, asks her to take over the place of a departing player, on the losing softball team she manages.  Rachel also strikes up an unlikely relationship with Jake, a creative 12 year old boy, who loves to sew, read woman's fashion magazines and hates his mother's lazy and boorish boyfriend.Multiple story lines make up the parts of the whole, featuring an array of characters who march to their own drummer.  Each character is dealing with their own challenges and sorrows. This debut novelist also tackled some pressing topics.  For me, personally, some parts were a little over the top as the book lost some of the plausibility by the end of the story.  I imagine it would be tailor made for fans of John Irving.  Very different and inventive, just not my writing style.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGL4E68UQDO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476797382#wasThisHelpful","RHGL4E68UQDO8","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have cats or dogs, you need this handy little flashlight.  Luckily my current two dogs are well trained and has not had an ""accident"" since we adopted them 3 years ago.  I can't say the same for my past puppies, as one of them was naughty on our rugs.  This would have been perfect.  I have followed one of my dogs out to the lawn at night to check out the Zookki.  I works great on urine, shining brightly in the grass.If I regularly stayed in hotels for business travel, this inexpensive little light would be the first thing I would pack.  Even when I go on my vacations, I always have that creepy feeling about the blankets and sheets on the beds.  This would tell if I'm paranoid or there really is a problem.I was offered the Zookki LED Blacklight flashlight in exchange for an honest review.

"The Song of Hartgrove Hall is a beautifully written book that has a mixture of family dynamics, music and a realistic love triangle.  The core of the story, however, is also about Hartgrove Hall, a once grand house in the English countryside, that has become dilapidated due to the war and mismanagement  of money.  The youngest of the three Fox-Talbot brothers, Harry, who is nicknamed Fox, uses his memories of the past 70 years in order to tell his engrossing story of his passion for collecting old songs, composing music and for his older brother's wife, Edie.  I loved The House of Tyneford, a previous book by this author, however, I felt this novel was far superior.The book alternates between the past and the present, using lingering flashbacks to 1946, the end of the war and their country estate. The three Fox brothers are elated to finally have Hartgrove Hall back after the war and  “a parade of British regiments followed by the Americans”.  Their father, the General, has little interest in running the properties when their estate manager retires.  The three brother together make a pact  to choose the life of farming, in order to keep the estate from being destroyed and the lands sold.  For Harry Fox, his passion for music and Edie, who is his kindred spirit and  called “The Little Nightingale” for her beautiful voice, this is a pact he is eventually unable to keep.In the year 2000, Harry Fox is reeling from the death of his beloved wife Edie after many blissful years of marriage.  Harry has achieved many of his aspirations and “a jolly decent footnote in British musical history”.  Life, however, no longer has any meaning without his wife and Fox finds that his days are both tedious and endless now that he no longer hears the music in his head, “for the first time in my life, silence taunted me” It is his discovery that his four year old, demanding  grandson, is a piano prodigy, that slowly breathes importance into his daily existence.This author knows how to draw the readers into the world of old English gentry with accomplished character development,  evocative settings and a plot full of passion and betrayal. The novel provides  interesting accounts of Fox's song collecting and the eclectic characters who provides the songs.  Highly recommended for those who appreciate Kate Morton,  music in its many forms , a convincing love story,  and a redemptive tale about how families survive and endure and what it tales to heal after loss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CJQ2XWIHED2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0147517591#wasThisHelpful","R31CJQ2XWIHED2","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a need to enhance my wireless connection performance in my living room.  I have tried other wi-fi extenders with mediocre success.  This Motoraux Wireless-N Range Extender was fairly easy to set-up as a ""repeater"".  Most users will choose the repeater mode of the four modes offered. They are Router, AP, Repeater and WISP.  The included instructions are in plain English and well written for someone familiar with networking or computers.I have some experience with computers and network language, so for me, it was fairly easy to connect this to my wireless network.  If you find computer ""stuff"" difficult, this will be Greek to you, so you will probably need help from someone.As far as performance goes, I normally get over 50 mbps on download wirelessly when close to my router.  When I am in the living room, I would get about 25 mbps wirelessly.  When I connected through the Motoraux extender in the living room, I actually was getting only 20 mbps which was less than I was getting wirelessly from my main router.  So, for my purposes, the Motoraux did not increase my performance in my living room, however other people will have different needs than I have and this extender might work just fine.  I also,am not 100% positive that I am using it correctly, and it did setup up properly. I will update this review if I find that I set it up incorrectly. Like i said before, I haven't had any extenders that offered exceptional reception and this is no different.This Motoraux range extender is offered at a reasonable price.  I was offered this product for an honest review and I think the Motoraux extender offers good value for the functionality offered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3234R58ZBCFR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HDPVY4#wasThisHelpful","R3234R58ZBCFR7","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this thermal water.  As others have said, it is very refreshing.  I'm not sure if it is the very fine mist or the ingredients, but it seems to cool your face and add a softness to your skin.  I normally spray it on my face in the morning, let it sit for a minute, gently pat it off, then apply my makeup.I wasn't familiar with exactly what ""thermal spring water"" was, so I did an online search and found that thermal water comes from deep underground, is rich in minerals, is very pure, free of bacteria and pollutants.  Thermal water has anti-inflammatory properties which could aid in skin conditions like psoriasis or eczema.  It has been used for thousands of years to relieve arthritis and joint pain.The only ingredient on the bottle listed is ""water"".  The label states that the average concentration of minerals per liter are as follows:Bicarbonate 396 mgCalcium  140 mgSilicates  30 mgSelenium  60 mgZinc  20 micro gramsCopper  5 micro gramsResidu sec a 180 degrees C  440 micro gramsThis La Roche-Posay Thermal spring water is reasonably priced for such a refreshing addition to my facial regimen.

"I drink decaf green tea every morning with breakfast for it's antioxidant benefits. When I was offered this supplement for an honest review, I was excited to try it.  Firstly, the capsule is not too big, about medium sized (see pic).  As a benefit, there is also Vitamin C at 60mg.  I had no problem with digestion after taking the supplement.

"Warning: If you are going to buy this or any Jawbone Tracker go to the Jawbone website and check whether your smartphone is compatible before purchasing.  There are a limited number of devices which can pair with this UP2.  Fortunately, my daughter has a Samsung S5, but my older IPhone 4 could not pair. I did get my Acer A4-810FHD tablet to pair as it has Bluetooth 4.0.  I called Jawbone support and apparently they can only work with Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, which cuts out many older phones and tablets.Once I downloaded the app for the Samsung S5, the paring was fast and simple. You have to charge the band before use and that took about 2 hours on my laptop 3.0 USB.  The proprietary charge cable is only about 3"" long and stiff, and doesn't plug into the UP2, but is connected with magnets.  Pretty cool tech.  While charging 3 small LED's light on the band intermittently. When only one stays lit, you know the band is fuilly charged.  I love the thickness and lightweight of the UP2, as it is very comfortable on your wrist. The band is adjustable for different size writs by simply adjusting the clasp.The software is pretty straightforward and simple with a friendly user interface.  After entering your stats and submitting an email address and password, then verifying the email, you are ready to go count your steps and monitor your sleep.  Goals are easily set, as are alerts.Jawbone, at one time, made the best single ear bluetooth headsets, and the quality was second to none.  I expect no less from this fitness band.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TBO3SSUJTTAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIFFW#wasThisHelpful","R1TBO3SSUJTTAH","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never heard of Gua Sha massage so I did a brief Internet search and discovered it to be an ancient Chinese skin scraping treatment.  The traditional treatment can cause bruising, but of course, I will use this as a massage tool.  My husband has been into Chinese medicine, massage and exercise (Tai Chi and Chi Gung) for many years and has always been interested in meridians, reflexology and accupressure. He's always poking or massaging me, my daughter or himself.  The feet have many reflexology points relating to every part of your body and this Leosense Jade Massage Tool is perfect for getting into those sore points or for broad strokes just about anywhere on your body.  It improves circulation anywhere you use it, which is very healthy and if done regularly can improve your health.This Jade tool is the perfect size in your hand.  It reminds me of a stone ""feely"" from my youth. It is perfectly smooth and the different grooves and corners fit anywhere you need it, and you can adjust the perfect pressure for your own preference.  This would make a perfect gift for anyone but most importantly yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJOK97RTXE83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQFRI80#wasThisHelpful","R3RJOK97RTXE83","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After living through Hurricane Sandy without power for two weeks, I take my flashlights very seriously.  This Soonfire CREE Flashlight is built to last. It is industrial grade, tactical quality flashlight, made of black anodized aluminum.  It has only one Cree LED bulb and comes with a single 18650 lithium ion battery with a 2600 mah rating.  Amazon sells replacement batteries if needed and they are very reasonably priced.  A charger built specifically for this battery is included and plugs into a regular wall 110v outlet. It took a few hours for the initial charge.  There is a 8"" lanyard included which attaches to the body for easy hanging or for safety wrapped around your wrist.  The body has a sturdy belt or pocket clip. There is an on/off button at the end of the battery cap.  There is another button on the body with which you can activate the strobe, lower the light intensity, or turn off the light. The flashlight feels very solid in your hand and is the perfect size, easily fitting in a pocket.  The light itself has a bright spot in the center which occupies the center of the light and is about 1/10 of the beam.At night, I easily lit up my trees in my backyard at a distance of about 50 feet.  After doing a search on Amazon for CREE tactical flashlights, this Soonfire offers very good value for the price and the quality offered.  Flashlights are one item you never have enough of.

"I have never eaten a mulberry, in fact I have never seen one or been offered one until now.  These Immortalitea Sun Dried Mulberries are a product of Turkey, as they only grow in that region of the world.  They are an ancient fruit with many health benefits. They are a small fruit, about twice the size of a raisin or dried cranberry. These are unsweetened as the only ingredient on the package is organic mulberries. They are somewhat sweet, not tart with no discernible aftertaste.  I have tried them on oatmeal, oat cereal, and in yogurt.  They enhance the taste of all and certainly add to the health benefit.  I am also adding them to my homemade ""trail mix"" which is a stable in our household.  The 10oz bag offers good value at this price point for an organic, non-GMO, no gluten, extremely healthy fruit.  An interesting fact is that mulberry trees are the only trees which host silk worms.After some research online, here are some findings:  They compose of health promoting phyto-nutrient compounds like polyphenol pigment antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins that are essential for  optimum health.  The berries contain resveratrol, the antioxidant found in grapes that aids in heart and blood vessel health  Mulberries are a good source of potassium, iron, manganese and magnesium.  They are rich in B vitamins, including niacin, B6, vitamin K, and folic acid.  High in vitamin C, also known as a very potent antioxidant.All in all, they are a superfruit, delicious, reasonably priced and will be a permanent addition to our diet.

"The Good Goodbye is reminiscent of another novel with a similar premise, Afterwards by Rosumund Lupton.  This author's comparisons to Jody Picoult are also apropos, without the many metaphors.  This is certainly one of those novels that you are unable to put down until you know how things will turn out for the three central characters.  It is in equal parts a family drama, a coming of age-story, a mystery and a psychological thriller.  While there is a lot to grapple with and initially the plot can be confusing, all the parts come meticulously together, as the mystery surrounding these families' tragedies unravel slowly and suspensefully.Natalie has a loving family and has realized a dream when she opened a restaurant six years ago with her brother-in-law Vince. At the beginning of the novel, Vince, has made a very poor investment, which has put both families in financial peril and compromised their once tight knit relationships.  The impact of Vince's actions has far reaching repercussions, as it trickles down into the lives of their 18 year old daughters, Rory and Arden.  Arden, is Natalie and Theo's daughter, she aspires to be an artist and is reticent and sensitive. She lives in the shadow of her more outgoing cousin.  Rory, Vince and Gabrielle's  daughter is popular and outwardly confident with both sexes.  The two cousins look alike and have been inseparable growing up, almost like sisters.  They share a complex relationship, however, for the first time in their relationship, welcome a change. Rory is looking forward to attending Harvard and Arden an art school 3,000 miles away on the west coast.  For different reasons, both cousins are upset, when due to these financial problems, their plans are waylaid and  they have to attend a community college, as roommates.  Six weeks into their freshman year, they both remain in critical condition in intensive care, after a fire in their dorm room has also left a mutual male friend dead.  Soon after the police start asking the hard questions, arousing suspicions, and leaving both sets of  parents wondering how well they really knew their children. The novel is told in alternating chapters, shifting from the past to the present, from Natalie, Arden and Rory's perspective, as secret upon secret is slowly revealed and we learn what really happened and who is responsible.A psychologically nuanced and heartbreaking novel that immerses you into the lives of these characters and holds you captive until the final page.  Yes, there is also a perfunctory twist, which felt believable and a resolution that made sense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B0PRPSQNOZ7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553390589#wasThisHelpful","R1B0PRPSQNOZ7B","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also used to take Krill Oil but I found out that the active component in Krill Oil is Astraxanthin and it is missing in Fish Oil.

"I have very dry, cracked heals and have tried Urea based heal creams which work very well, but are very strong chemically.  This Dead Sea Foot Cream is mild in comparison but does an excellent job in healing cracked skin on your feet.  I am a big fan of Tea Tree oil, as I add it to my wash for it's disinfecting properties.  I also love the smell of Tea Tree oil, but I don't smell it in this cream.  Actually, I would prefer if it did smell a bit more like the oil, but the smell is very pleasant anyway.  The cream does not have a strong floral smell, but a rather pleasant, clean odor.  The cream is not greasy and rubs into the cream very well, not leaving any film or residue.  I bet this cream would also work on your hands when the winter brings those severe painful cuticle cuts.  The 5.1 oz. tube should last a good while as very little is needed for each application. I find products from Israel to be of exceptional quality and this Dead Sea Foot Cream is no exception.

"As far as I'm concerned French lavender is the only lavender.  Having been lucky enough to see the gorgeous fields of lavender while driving through France in my youth, this Sabai Wellness Pure Undiluted lavender oil transports me back with it's beautiful aroma.  The smell is very gentle, refined, not at all cosmetic smelling.  If you already don't have a aroma diffuser, I suggest you get one, but it is equally luxurious when a few drops are placed in simmering water on the stove.If you haven't smelled lavender, the aroma is soft, gentle, not too flowery and tends to relax you.  I have allergies which include some flowers, but the lavender does not bring on any allergic reaction. As you only need a few drops , the 15ml bottle should last a long time.

"The challenges of  writing historical fiction are probably daunting, especially how to imagine a person who really lived and capture the essence to a bygone era.  Adriana  Trigiani is able to transport the reader to the 1930 golden age of Hollywood and the star making studio system, which made and then controlled the lives of some of Hollywood greatest actors and actress.This is the story of film star Loretta Young, her family and the two great loves of her life, Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable.  Both of these men were married and came with their own set of baggage.  While the book was centered around  Loretta and her career, loves and loss, she is not the only star, as we are also drawn into the world of her secretary Alda.  Alda is originally a novice, at the home of unmarried pregnant women at the Convent of St. Elizabeth.  When the convent is no longer deemed to be Alda's future vocation, she  is sent by her superiors to be a secretary to Miss Young.  Alda is immediately welcomed into the colorful and supportive Young family of predominately women, while she learns her trade. Alda also eventually finds herself at the center of her own romantic awakening. The two woman quickly bond and their friendship and continued loyalty to each other was for me the best part of the book.Adriana Trigiani certainly did her research as she weaves together a cinematic cache of film royalty.  The problem is that these famous men and women do not always come alive on the pages.  I found myself asking would Spencer Tracy really act and talk this way? The events and situations in which the characters were placed should have surprised me, however, felt artificial and redundant.  It was difficult to really invest in any of these supposedly larger then life movie icons, as they could have been anyone.  4 stars for the depiction of the time and place, 2 stars for characterizations rounded up to a 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HHIUVDK56EDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062319191#wasThisHelpful","R2HHIUVDK56EDN","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband has very tired, flat feet with an occasional bout of plantar fascitis, so when offered the TheraFlow Dual foot wooden massage roller for review, I jumped at the opportunity.First, let me say the company, TheraFlow, communicates with the buyer exceptionally well. I received a thank you email, and a followup email on the use of the roller.  I buy and test many products from Amazon, but TheraFlow is a step above routine.Now to the roller, second hand from my husband, although I did give it a try and really enjoyed it.  The roller is made out of wood and the assembly, finish, functionality are perfect.  The instructions say that it takes awhile to get used to the feeling, as it tickles when first used, but after several uses, that sensation diminishes and any amount of pressure you wish can be applied.  The four rollers with small bumps feel very relaxing and therapeutic.  The fifth roller with the larger knobs can be used to get those specific spots you want to work on.  By the way, TheraFlow's website offers a two page PDF of all the foot's reflexology pressure points and their associated body structures, like shoulders, heart, liver, sinuses, etc.If you have any foot ailments, this is great addition to make your feet feel better and make your whole system feel better.  Since, I am a firm believer in Acupressure, Acupuncture, meridians, Eastern medicine, reflexology, Chi, etc. , I know, without any doubt, this foot massage is helping my well being.  Although, I received this TheraFlow foot massager in exchange for an honest review, I will definitely be buying a few for gifts as I'm certain anyone will appreciate the health benefits and the quality of the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVN6NQ765C1UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMJIYNG#wasThisHelpful","RVN6NQ765C1UY","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had a few of these multi spray hose nozzles in metal and plastic.  This Amir nozzle is of very good quality and functions exceptionally well. The 8 patterns are pretty standard, but I mostly use the shower and the jet.  The shower is perfect for watering plants as it's a gentle stream but delivers a lot of water.  The jet stream is very strong, not quite a power washer, but it really gets the job done.  The jet spray can reach about 25 feet, so it's perfect for the plants my hose can't reach or for cleaning spots that are too high to reach.What makes this much better than any other multi-spray nozzles is that you can adjust the volume of any of the 8 sprays with the knob on the top of the nozzle, from full force to a dribble.  The package comes with 2 additional rubber gaskets should you lose the one already inserted into the nozzle.I was offered a sample of the Amir Nozzle for an honest review and I feel although more expensive than cheaper models at the local Wallymart, this nozzle offers good value for the price.

"I was skeptical at first to try this ""necklace"" type bluetooth headset. I thought perhaps it would be uncomfortable around my neck, but I was wrong. In fact, they are very comfortable both around my neck and in my ears. The earbuds are rather small and fit very well, and there are two additional rubber sets should you lose or would like to try a different size.After charging for about 1/2 hour with the standard USB to micro-USB cable provided (no wall plug), the paring with my laptop and phone for testing went smoothly and were recognized immediately. The sound was very clear with good treble and mid range, but commonly with earbuds in this price range the bass is limited, but the sound experience was much more than acceptable.The earbuds are magnetic and store at the end of the ""necklace"". The magnet is not very strong, so the earbuds frequently detach, but due to the design they don't go far. Wearing the headset hiking yielded a pleasant experience as they are very light and you hardly feel the headset on your neck or in your ears. Phone calls were answered easily and both the reception and transmission of voice was clear. The placement of the buttons on the ""necklace"" are very easy to use, in fact, much easier than the wired type bluetooth headsets I have tested.I was offered a sample for an honest review and I feel these Soundpeats Wireless Bluetooth Headphones are good value for the price.

"Many, many years ago one of my closest friends had prostate cancer. After his operation he went to a specialist who was in expert in prostate cancer and the recovery.  He put my friend on massive (20,000) units of D-3 daily to get his D-3 level up to a minimum of 50.  This was new science at the time, in fact, it was the first time I even heard of Vitamin D-3.  Since that time, I have been taking about 4000 to 5000 units per day and my D-3 level has gone from the high teens to over 50.  I have used several brands of D-3 and PCNL D-3 is the only one I have used which offers 5,000 units in one pill.  That makes my supplement routine simpler, just one capsule per day.

"Phyto 5 pigmentation cream is an excellent product. I have also used  Phyto Peel and have been pleased with the results from both products.  The ingredients are from organic farming and the product is certified organic.  Phyto-Bio ceutical products are made in Switzerland.  Phyto 5 pigmentation cream has the antioxidant Eldelweiss, which of course I know from the movie The Sound of Music. Edelweiss is derived from Edelweiss flowers grown at high altitudes in the Swiss alps. The edelweiss plant contains phytochemicals such a chlorogenic acid (present in coffee) and luteolin which is reported to demonstrate antioxidant activity twice as much as you get from Vitamin C.You apply this light weight and fresh smelling cream to affected areas twice a day after cleaning your face. I started using only once at night on two sunspots on both my cheek and neck with valid results, in a short amount of time. The sunspot on my neck was the size of a pinkie nail and it has lightened considerably. I do not feel that my skin is either red or irritated after using.  I will wait until the fall to use over my entire face as I assume you need to be careful with this product if you are going to be in the sun, even using sunscreen. Keep in mind that Phyto 5 pigmentation cream is not inexpensive, however, you are purchasing a superior product that delivers and will probably not need to be purchased again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTFTLXV5BD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB864Y0#wasThisHelpful","R1FTFTLXV5BD0","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even without this similarity, Movie Star by Lizzie Pepper is a realistic and well written book about the pitfalls behind the fairy tale marriages we read about.  The characters are well developed and sympathetic. I think it drives home the point that even with all the fame, prestige and money you will ever need, it is often not enough to make us happy. This book has everything you need for a  perfect beach read  that will divert you with its enjoyable plot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZDCNUS4ROT13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016411#wasThisHelpful","RZDCNUS4ROT13","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been numerous excellent technical reviews about this Bose QuietComfort 20 headphones, so I won't go there.  What I will talk about is the quality of the equipment and the quality of the sound.  Bose is probably the foremost innovative sound engineering company out there and it was started in the US by an MIT professor. These QuietComfort headphones are no exception to the Bose line. They are very comfortable and secure in your ear with the highest quality. I assume, proprietary silicon ear stabilizers and plugs. They are lightweight, even feeling weightless in your ear because of that stability, feeling like they were custom fit.  Although these are meant for Apple products, of which I only have an IPhone, they can be used on any equipment with a 3.5mm plug.  I tested them on a Kindle, an Acer tablet, my Dell desktop, and a portable AM/FM radio.  All performed flawlessly with the fullest, clearest, bass, mid range, and treble sounds I've ever experienced with a headset or earphones.  Simply incredible sound, particularly the bass.  They produce a sound which rivals speakers which have bass speakers. The noise cancelling feature worked well, by just flipping the switch on the control module.These are very expensive for earphones, but in this case, they are worth every penny. If you are an audiophile with some extra bucks, I would highly recommend these Bose earphones.  For those with a more plebeian ear, perhaps a less expensive set might suffice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXBZC8VM4T3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9KV0HU#wasThisHelpful","R2NXBZC8VM4T3N","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those getting a bit older and having difficulty seeing see small print, this magnifier is a Godsend.  Not only is the magnifier large and clear, but it has 2 LED lights to brighten your reading, crafting, or any close work you may need.  The flexible neck and the stand are very secure and steady, yet you can easily adjust the glass to finely focus on your task.  In addition, there is a quarter sized super-magnifier when you really need extra magnification.Routinely, I have issues trying to read instructions, part numbers on appliances or electronic equipment and the older I get the smaller the print seems to be, so this magnifier is perfect for all those little tasks.

"I have taken longer to write this review than any other book since I have become a Vine Member.  What a complex book to read, what a complex book to review.I happen to have gone to college in New York city during the years of 1975-1979 when a good portion of the book takes place.  This author has been able to evoke the time and  place so well that I felt as though I was 18 and living in NYC again.  .  There is no doubt that this debut author took a huge risk and made mistakes along the way.  City on Fire is a complex, sweeping novel full of carefully researched detail.  The characters that the story revolves around are eclectic, realistic and for the most part engaging. It is unfortunately overlong and it is over plotted.  At 550 pages this may have been the masterpiece that critics are hailing, at 913 pages there was much too much padding and tangled histories of the characters to dredge through.  At times some of the chapters felt forced, as though the author was grappling for themes and content that were not  necessary.  I believe that this author was unable to part with a single story line or word, and that he poured his heart and soul into these pages, so someone at Knopf should have tried harder during the editing process. A shooting in Central Park on New Year's Eve becomes the mystery that all the individuals' stories revolve around and which are eventually linked together by.  We share this journey with a wide array of characters of all ages, from all walks of life, who are in love with the city. While deserving of  a 5 star review for creativity, beautiful writing and compelling characters, the unnecessarily long and inconsequential tangents unfortunately make it a 3 star read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R246Q7QEGUTSEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353774#wasThisHelpful","R246Q7QEGUTSEQ","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well crafted Pleather bag with modern, yet classic styling.  I would consider this to be a large bag, which would hold a lot of daily gear from makeup to a Kindle.  It has a dull black finish which is mottled to resemble a tight patterned leather and the metal appears as a antiqued nickel finish.  There are two side pockets perfect for keys or your phone, large enough for even a new Samsung 6.  The interior is cloth lined with a small zippered compartment. There are no dividers, so it is just a large, cavernous open bag.  There is no zipper closure, but a single magnetic buckle to keep the top closed.  The bottom is flat and much wider than the top of the bag. As others have mentioned, the strap is a bit short to comfortably wear on your shoulder, as it would be tight under your armpit, unless you are a very petite woman.I was provided a sample for an honest review.  Except for the limitations I expressed, this is a nice looking, quality bag.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROYE8Z47163HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFY52WU#wasThisHelpful","ROYE8Z47163HK","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been an avid fan of Elizabeth George and the (Lynley series) from the beginning.  Playing for the Ashes and Deception on his Mind are in my humble opinion two of the finest psychological mysteries I have ever read.  Many others in the long running series were almost as good. Unfortunately, in the past few years the caliber of writing has declined.  George's last two books were a struggle to get through and if not for Amazon Vine I may not have purchased  A Banquet of Consequences.  Happily, I can give an enthusiastic two thumbs up for her latest.A Banquet of Consequences is flawless, as Elizabeth George has gone back to her roots and written a complex, and nuanced character driven book that is both plausible and heartfelt.  This time around, George takes her time developing her characters.  There is the psychological undercurrent of a highly dysfunctional family, however, nothing is over-the-top and there is a plethora of clues and intelligent plotting.The story alternates between London and Dorset and begins 39 months before a murder, then 2 months before, 6 weeks before and finally in the here and now.  William Goldacre, is trying to win back the affections of his girlfriend Lily Foster after another one of his emotional breakdowns has waylaid their 10 month relationship.  This will not happen, as William in despair commits suicide by jumping from a cliff. William has an older brother Charlie, who is a psychologist and is devastated by his brother’s death.  His inability to help his brother has caused a fissure within his own marriage to his wife India and they are now estranged.  The brother’s mother, Caroline, has a strong and domineering personality and does not play well with others, causing strife wherever she goes.  Caroline has secured a position as an assistant for a well-respected feminist lecturer/writer, Clare.  Caroline is jealous of the relationship Clare has with her friend and editor, Rory.  Caroline's second husband is having an affair with one of his employees.  As the story unfolds all of their dark secrets and motivations come to light after Clare is found poisoned.  One of Elizabeth George’s greatest strengths is her spot-on observation of people and their psychological states.  All the pieces come together and the ending made perfect sense with the story staying taut and surprising.Detective Inspector Thomas Lynely is on the case in London.  Lynely appeared to be going through the motions after the murder of his beloved wife Helen and perhaps his inertia and erratic behavior will remain a thing from the past.  His partner, the incomparable Barbara Havers is trying to strike a compromise with her true self and the role that Detective Superintendent Isabelle Arderly is insisting she play.  While Havers has always had flashes of brilliance as a homicide detective, her inability to follow the rules has her in jeopardy of being transferred to Berwick-upon-Tweed if she steps out of line again.  Thomas Lynley once again pleads Havers’ case to their superior and she is partnered with Detective Sergeant Nkata Winston to handle the Dorset investigation.  The dynamics between Lynley and Havers has always been only of the stronger aspects of the series and their banter includes some delightful moments of needed levity.  Lynley is courting Daidre the veterinarian and their relationship is reminiscent of his earlier relationship with his departed wife Helen.  Daidre is not ready to make a full commitment to the aristocratic Thomas Lynley.Like the best of Elizabeth George, these character are fated by their past mistakes, temperament and character flaws.  All is forgiven, A Banquet of Consequences is a keeper","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4VS49QOY4S7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954333#wasThisHelpful","R2T4VS49QOY4S7","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Up until about 3 years ago, oils like Tamanu, Tea Tree, Oregano were hardly used and little known.  Well, things have changed and you see them all over and I've had  the opportunity to try all of them on my skin or my families'.This Tamanu oil is 100% organic, which is something I look for and appreciate. It comes in a dark amber bottle with a pump.  The oil itself is somewhat thick with the color and consistency of Olive Oil.  It has an earthy smell, which is rather pleasant and not strong at all like Oregano Oil.It goes on your skin smoothly and is absorbed readily.  It can be washed off easily with soap and water or shampoo.My husband has had psoriasis for years which comes and goes.  He has been using the Tamanu Oil for about 4 weeks now once a day.  It has cleared up his psoriasis, but I must say his psoriasis is a mild case.  Sometimes it just goes away on its own, sometimes he uses a cortisone cream.  The Tamanu Oil worked, but since this is not a scientific study, it's hard to proclaim it's effectiveness, but more an incidental conclusion.The next time his psoriasis flares up, he will definitely try this oil again.The 1 oz bottle should last a very long time even with daily use, as very little is needed as the oil covers a lot of skin area. It doesn't feel ""heavy"" on your skin and makes your skin feel very smooth.  If like my husband, you have psoriasis, I would highly recommend giving this Organic Tamanu Oil a try.  I received a sample for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SFEFIGQN954G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBI8A6C#wasThisHelpful","R1SFEFIGQN954G","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always loved reading sprawling family sagas, with a touch of historical detail, written by Susan Howatch and Penny Vincenzi. The Rocheforts is a worthy addition to add to this list.  The setting is France and the time frame the late 1800's to the 1930's.  The ambitious but never redundant story focuses on the lives and loves of two families the Rocheforts and the Rouvieres.  The Rocheforts are a wealthy manufacturing family and the Rouvieres prosperous farmers.  Marriage and business as usual will unite the two families, however, there is plenty of ensuing drama to tear them apart.  The  Rocheforts will most certainly appeal to readers who enjoy family sagas which takes place in an atmospheric setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUM7K6Y66NP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504000773#wasThisHelpful","R3LUM7K6Y66NP1","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:48 MinsI've been using my Echo for about 2 months now and it has become a ""can't live without"" piece of technology.  The first thing I do in the morning is ask Alexa ""what's the weather today?"", followed by ""what's the weather for the week?""  Time for breakfast and the Echo serenades me with one of playlists, previously setup with my Echo app on my Kindle. Before leaving for work, I ask ""how is the traffic?""  When I finally sit down after a day at work and turn on the TV, I'm constantly asking Echo questions about TV shows, actors, movies, etc like Alexa, ""Who won the Oscar for best picture this year?"" The applications for Echo are endless and I love that Amazon continuously updates the software directly through the always connected wi-fi.  Each time a new function is added, I get an email from Amazon explaining the new application, like when they added being able to re-order items from your past Amazon orders, just by telling Alexa the item.  Amazing technology!The Echo was very simple to setup by using the Echo app for Android on my Kindle and on my Acer tablet.  When on Amazon's Prime Music pages, you can setup playlists of your favorite artists or use the already assembled playlists, like 50 Great Classic Rock Songs or Country Hits.  Then when you wish just tell Echo to play them.Echo itself has a stunning design with a black, matte finish.  It takes up very little space with a 3"" diameter and about 9"" tall.  There is a power connection on the bottom with the supplied power adapter with cord.  On the top is a microphone mute button and a ""action"" button which allows you to ask for something without saying Alexa.  The blue LED ring around the top where the microphones are located brightens when it finds the direction of your voice (very robot like and a bit startling at first)The speakers are located on the sides behind the grill which goes completely around the circumference.  The volume can be adjust by telling Alexa a number from 1 to 10 or just saying louder or softer.  The sound is really clear and can be very loud, easily filling a room.  The only thing I can relate the sound quality to,  is a Bose speaker.  Alexa's voice is very pleasant with no discernible accent.  She can't answer all questions you ask, but she can answer a very good percentage of them, if you know how to ask.  Anything found in Wikipedia, which covers a lot of information, is within Echo's capabilities.Anybody who I show my Echo to, wants one. I think Amazon has a real winner with this technology.  Kindle revolutionized how we read books, Echo does the same for interacting with a computer.  I am certain that Amazon will continue Echo's evolution and I truly can't wait to see what's next.  In my experience, Echo is the closest I have come to interacting with a robot. Simply amazing. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0FN74A9SGMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R3O0FN74A9SGMP","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was lucky enough to be offered this ZhiZhu Bluetooth Visor speakerphone for an honest review.  I recently bought a Honda CRV which has bluetooth for phone calls and realized that his was a technology which makes driving so much safer and talking in your car so convenient.  My husband drives a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which does not have bluetooth installed, so I thought this Visor Speakerphone would be great, and it certainly is.The unit itself is simple to operate and install. It is only 5"" long and less than 2"" wide and about 1/2"" thick finished in a black matte with a glossy black center oval which contains the multifunction button.  There is also a mini-USB charging post on the rear as well as large sized volume controls, an on/off switch and a language button.  Pairing took only a few seconds with my two phones recognizing the unit immediately.A car charger with detachable USB to mini-USB cable included and an easy to understand instruction booklet.  There is a metal clip which you place on your visor and a magnetic disc on the rear of the speakerphone.  The magnet attaches to the clip very securely, but can be removed easily for storage or charging.  You can leave the charger plugged in but I prefer to not have the charger wire hanging in my car, so I remove it to charge it.When you receive a  phone call, there is a voice announcement and a touch of the multifunction button answers.  The sound on both ends is very clear and well loud enough even in the car.  You can adjust the volume to your comfort level.  To dial, you open you phone, press a speed dial number or dial and the unit announces ""phone 1 dialing"".If you have an older car, like mine, without bluetooth, this is a wonderful safety item to utilize.  Aside from the safety and no-ticket aspect, it is so much more convenient than speaking while holding your cellphone.  This would make a great gift.  I have used several ZhiZhu electronic products and they offer excellent value and are quality made.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93WFGD7JZ04M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8W9LYA#wasThisHelpful","R93WFGD7JZ04M","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tria Beauty Age-Defying Laser is expensive. Or is it? I have relatives and friends who regularly get treatments including lasers, Botox, and collagen treatments from their Dermatologist at a cost of a minimum of $600 per visit.  So maybe this laser is not so expensive.The laser has three settings. The first setting is for training so you can get used to the sensation the laser creates on your skin.  The second two higher settings are to be increased with time.  I tested it with level one on my clean forearm first.  While you are slowly drawing it across your skin, the laser lights up.  When removed from your skin, the light goes off.  There is a definite tingling sensation which when stopped feels a bit like your skin is burning and the sensation lasts a minute or two. Since it wasn’t too uncomfortable, I started with the training level one on my forehead, chin, cheeks and the side of my eyes (not too close).  It takes some practice to smoothly draw the laser over your skin.  Make sure you clean your face before using the laser and completely dry before use.I have only been using it for about a week and have not really seen any improvement and although after the treatment, my face does still feel a bit burned, but the sensation does go away.  My skin does redden slightly but returns to normal after about 5-10 minutes.There is a detailed instruction booklet, which I would suggest reading in its entirety before use.  It is fairly simple to understand and use of the laser is also pretty simple.The equipment itself seems very well designed and manufactured with style and elegance including the packaging.  If you spend a lot of money at the Dermatologist, this laser may be worth the investment, but I am certain the results will vary based on your skin condition and your sensitivity to the laser.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUHQRARDRFC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5WVNGW#wasThisHelpful","R3RUHQRARDRFC3","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like any addiction, Evelyn Beegan is completely seduced by her desperate bid to become part of the New York upper class scene. Like any addict, she needs to hit rock bottom, literally and figuratively, before she can attempt to rise again. I was unable to put this book down, even though it is not hard to guess where this social climber and her story is heading. The author’s skill is evident even when Evelyn's poor, poor choices become pathological, we still sympathize with her.Initially, Evelyn seemed not to care that she was on the fringes of the old money that her social climbing mother longed for and her prep school friends had. The year is 2006, when Evelyn moves to New York, reconnects with some of these friends from her prestigious prep school and accepts a job at an elite website called People Like Us. Evelyn is hired to “get the right sort of people to seed the site”. Initially, things go smoothly for Evelyn. Old friends Charlotte, Preston and Nick have access to the right parties and social events and take Evelyn with them to their Adirondacks compounds and stately mansions. Evelyn is only too happy to sleep in a smaller bedroom or clean up after parties in order to figuratively pay her way and sign up new members for the site. When Evelyn meets and eventually befriends heiress Camilla Rutherford, “the clear center of young New York”, she becomes obsessed with the trust fund millionaire and her way of life. What Evelyn won't do to sustain her climb to the top is what makes this book so compulsively readable. Evelyn will lie, cheat and discard old friends to keep her new ones. She will run up enormous fees on her charge cards to look the part and eventually begins to act the part. Like any addict, Evelyn rationalizes her behavior and every success she achieves validates her efforts.From start to finish I was as absorbed as Evelyn.

"I love my dogs very much and I watch what I feed them for snacks and food.  They currently eat a top quality dry food from Wellness mixed with either chicken or beef daily.  I also buy at Costco their chicken tenders, which are made in the USA with chicken from the USA and are natural also. .  In fact, I think they are from Tyson, the largest chicken company in the US.  Those tenders are $20.00 for 3 pounds as compared to these Prairie Dog Smokehouse Jerky treats which cost $22.00 with shipping for only 15 oz.  To compare these are $1.46 per ounce versus the Costco brand for $.42 per ounce or less than 1/3 the price.Yes, I realize these are special, all natural from the US, but with two 50 lb dogs, they are very costly even if I limit them to one piece per day. My husband loves beef jerky and is hesitant to spend the $20.00-$30.00 per lb, so I find it difficult to justify the cost of this chicken jerky for my pups.Of course, my dogs love these all natural treats and if you have small dogs and you want to indulge your pups, try them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26IC0ILSP5UJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSSLAP6#wasThisHelpful","R26IC0ILSP5UJ5","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Skyin Soy Peppermint Candle would make a great gift or a gift for yourself.  The non-toxic tin container has flowers and birds colored with soft green and pink tones on a pale yellow background.  The candle is 6oz and measures 3.5"" tall and 2.5"" diameter.  The candle is 100% soy wax, not an animal byproduct or petroleum based wax.  The peppermint scent is not overpowering but rather soothing and pleasant, perfect for a bedroom or bathroom.According to my short web research, the peppermint scent is cooling, mood elevating and can increase mental acuity and alertness.  Peppermint offers stress relief and the odor can help reduce the effects of colds and muscular aches.The Skyin soy candle offers 30 hours of burn time, which is about the same as a Yankee candle of the same size.  It is priced comparable to Yankee candles, yet I believe offers the extra benefit of natural soy and very nice packaging and is available with free shipping with Prime.These candles would make excellent stocking stuffers at the holdiays and I'm certain would be well received.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XLPVDADP16H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VM64H96#wasThisHelpful","R32XLPVDADP16H","A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF1KIQ7TMPPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is  a fun game, if you have the patience for this kind of thing. There is a lengthy set of rules, the interpretation of which will undoubtedly cause arguments between people who take it seriously. It’s well done, well-constructed, but just not my kind of thing any more. Too many other things to do. My grandson took only a few seconds to decide tha his online video games were more interesting. I think a lot of people looking for highly social games will enjoy this for a  while, at least.

"This is a book for Excel beginners, thought can also serve as a refresher for those who have experience with Excel but don’t use it often. Excel is very powerful and very complex. It is easy to forget some of the things you can accomplish with Excel. This is most certainly not a definitive reference on Excel 2016. I found nothing on using VBA to program Excel and only two pages on Pivot tables, one of Excel’s most powerful and complex features.

"Microsoft Excel is incredibly powerful. I have been using it since its first incarnation. It was mind-blowing then and it is mind-blowing now. I am constantly finding new ways I can use Excel and I don’t think I’ve really scratched the surface. Since I don’t routinely deal with vast quantities of quantitative information, I don’t have much of a problem with visualizing it for myself and others. But if I have to learn how to build Excel dashboards in a hurry – that is, learn ways to make Excel data more accessible to lay usera – this is a book I would turn to. It’s a series of step-by-step lessons on how to use Excel’s capabilities to display data. Written ini simple language and amply illustrated, it walks the reader through dashboard philosophy and design principles to formulas, controls charts and other visualization tools to advanced modeling concepts and the use of PowerPivot and Power Query. The last two are not for amateurs, but are extremely powerful tools. This is an excellent reference and tutorial on using dashboards within excel.

"I have never been and never will be an optimist. That doesn’t mean I am perpetually gloomy: I just don’t believe that happy endings are inevitable. As a child born during WWII, a Hobbesian attitude that the normal state of humankind was “continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” except for those with the good fortune to be born in Western democracies. The Jacobs brothers, Bert and John, are definitely optimists and they propagate their philosophy in this book. In fact, they do a pretty good job of it. They write of ten “Superpowers” which, they claim, if implemented, will hlp guide you to a happy life. Not a trouble-free life, but a happy one.

"The knowledgeable reader will find “1946” something of a feast. Author Victor Sebestyen has done an admirable, indeed excellent, job of reciting the history of year pivotal to contemporary history. It was in 1946 that the always tenuous wartime alliance of the United States, the British Empire and the Soviet Union entered an accelerated unraveling, that “people’s movements” initially probed their power, that old empires, like the French, refused to recognize their death and so much more. Throughout there is a slight hint of Sebestyn’s own biases, but it is relatively  minor and not disturbing. For many Americans, particularly those educated in the past few decades during the decline of American public education, much of what Sebestyn says will be news and, perhaps, unbelievable. Cannibalism in Poland? Yes. Rare, but it happened and was ignored in the American media – after all, all of Europe was going hungry. (In the 1930s millions of Ukrainians were deliberately starved to death, but America’s mass media were silent, mostly due to the efforts of The New York Times and its reporter Walter Duranty, but that is a different story.) The world was in a mess in 1946 after more than a decade of conflict and tens of millions dead, including millions deliberately murdered by the Germans and Japanese. Many thought the world was about to slide into a New Dark Age. That it did not was due to the vision and goodness (though often selfishly motivated) of a few good people, many of them Americans. With winter coming, this is an excellent history to read and reread, especially for those to whom all of this will be news. Well done, Mr. Sebestyn, well done.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYLS44PPILFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101870427#wasThisHelpful","RCYLS44PPILFE","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve taken a number of online college courses and quite liked most of them. One curse in particular on a programming language is taught by a literally renowned professor. His teaching technique doesn’t really seem any different than what you would encounter in a classroom. The gentleman knows his subject well and is totally at ease in front of a camera. The last time I took the course, my understanding is that it had more than 400,000 registrants. Obviously not all online teachers are effective. This is an admittedly academic attempt to analyze the elements – “best practices” – that lead to effective online teaching. It’s kind of like reading an instruction manual on how to fish. You can read it over and over, but you still may never catch a fish. I really found it kind of boring and felt like they were beating a dead horse.

"Michael Fullan is a prolific author and a professor emeritus of education at the University of Toronto. I am not a fan of public education or public educators. It seems like there is a new fad every year and despite the expenditure of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars annually, the children seem to be less educated with each passing year. “Freedom To Change” is, at its heart, a self-help book intended to help school principals principally (pun irresistible) discover true freedom. Public education in Canada appears to be the same as it is in the United States: an endless turf battle between competing bureaucracies where actually educating  the student ranks dead last in priorities. Amusingly, Fullan honors the Ontario [Canada] Principal’s Council by reprinting its mission statement. It has five points, such as “represent its membership”, “promote the professional interests of its members”, “support and protect its members”, but only a brief reference to students. In other words, it focuses on the so-called educators, not their students. Anyway, Fallon has attempted to repackage Erich Fromm’s classic “Escape From Freedom” with contributions from other others, such as Jeff Kluger who invented the term “simplexity” to describe the process of “finding workable solutions to problems when situations appear too complex”. In other words, break down a project or a problem into  its smallest parts and start accomplishing them one by one. Nothing revolutionary her. But Fullan is an interesting writer and presents his thesis in entertaining and interesting ways making this a reasonably interesting book, even if its actual goal is comforting school administrators who feel put upon by other bureaucrats further up the food chain.Jerry","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D2RN7KEPFKA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119024366#wasThisHelpful","R1D2RN7KEPFKA2","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has the style of something written for people with limited reading skills. Perhaps it is intended for high school students. The simplistic writing style becomes somewhat wearing. But that doesn’t detract from the purpose of the book which is to impart the basic – very basic –knowledge needed to use SketchUp as a tool for creating designs for 3D printing and rudimentary CNC machining. As she explains “our use of SketchUp’s tools and functions will be to those relevant to 3D projects”. I’m no expert with SketchUp, but I can tell you that Ms. Cline is true to her word and barely scratches the surface of what SketchUp is capable of. Again, that is a benefit since presenting SketchUp all at once can be frightening to the new user. She spends a bit over 80 pages illustrating how to use SketchUp – and the book is profusely illustrated, though the illustrations would be better if they were higher quality – and then spends 42 pages on the expensive SketchUp Pro features. The remaining 80 or so pages of the book are devoted to 3D print prep, 3D printing and CNC fabrication. Overall, this is a pretty decent introduction to the basics of three pretty complex disciplines: SketchUp, 3D printing and CNC routing. Even though I felt like I was reading something intended for folks with limited reading comprehension ability, I still found the book informative, again on a very basic level.Jerry","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BDENDRILYD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071842411#wasThisHelpful","R7BDENDRILYD1","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Microsoft Access (and Apple’s FileMaker Pro) are two programs I always buy one or more third-party references for. Usually more than one. The reason for this is simple: these are enormously powerful programs and are understandably complex and difficult to master. I’ve been using Access since its Day One and I don’t consider myself a “master” and never will. I don’t use it every day, so when I do I need a convenient, deep resource. And the Access Bible is generally one of the best. Yes, you can find every bit of information between its covers on the web. But think of the time you’ll save by being able to look it up in a pretty well done table of contents or index. Before purchasing this book, use the “Look Inside” feature on Amazon. Closely review the Table Of Contents and Index. Then carefully read the parts of the first two chapters that are included. If you have trouble understanding them, you want a different book, one specifically targeted at newcomers to Access. Access 2016 Bible is clearly written and profusely illustrated, though many of the illustrations are difficult to understand. One day the publishers will wake up and understand that illustrations need to be legible. But with more than a thousand pages to deal with, they face a problem. It would be nice if the publishers optimized the layout for electronic versions. This book is heavy.

"The first edition of this book helped me learn Minecraft well enough to keep up with my grandson . . . for a little while, at least. He moved through his Minecraft phase and on to online First Person Shooters all too fast. So now Minecraft in Creative mode is where I spend my time and that, incidentally, is my only criticism of this otherwise excellent guide: it is focused primarily on Survival mode, which I don’t find to be fun. But kids love the kill-or-be-killed aspect of Survival mode and kids are who this book is written for. Fortunately nearly all the information is applicable to all Minecraft modes. (By the way, you can set the mayhem to low in Survival mode, but I just don’t care for the competitive aspect. I’d rather spend all my time creating new worlds.) The Third Edition is about 40 pages longer than the First Edition and covers the progressive additions and changes to the Minecraft program itself. The key question: can you learn Minecraft well from this single book? Yes. Part of that is due to the brilliant design of Minecraft. But this is a well-written, amply illustrated, step-by-step guide to Minecraft and it does the job well. Read the text, study the illustrations, keep Minecraft running on your computer and you’ll learn how to play the game. You can also supplement this with online tips and recipes at the author’s website. In addition, if more is needed, there are tons of tutorials on the web.` Overall, while I don’t think the “Ultimate” label in the title is entirely justified, this is certainly among the best of the Minecraft playing guides.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G2C33SWD1CG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789755726#wasThisHelpful","R1G2C33SWD1CG6","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Livescribe. I’ve used a Livescribe Pulse 2GB, on and off, for several years. The technology of the Livescribe 3 Smartpen is simply fantastic. A tiny infrared camera of sorts in the tip reads a pattern of microdots to track your motions. This is transcribed into an image of what you write, draw, doodle, whatever. With the Livescribe 3, the Smartpen connects via Bluetooth with your Android or iOS device. My testing was done with an Android LG Gpad V-510. Installation of the two required applications from the Google Play store was without problem. One application, Livescribe + is what you see and manage your work in. Livescribe Link manages your connection with the Smartpen. Livescibe provides only a brief introductory instruction manual. Too brief. I couldn’t get the device to pair, so I used Livescribe’s online chat support facility. I had a rep in no time, but it was clear that the rep was working from a script and while not unhelpful, wasn’t overly so. I any event, I discovered that I had to use the Livescribe Link application first to imitate the connection, then I could use the Livescribe+ app. I think Livescribe should consider making their guide somewhat more explicit. Once paired, the process was flawless. I write in the supplied special Moleskin book and watch as my jottings, whatever they may be, appear on the screen of my connected device. If the subject matter is text, I can attempt to have the Livescribe software convert it from essentially drawing to text. My normal handwriting is abysmal and, as with its ancestor, the Livescribe 3 did not cope well. When I exercised some care, the results of the conversion were outstandingly good. You can also record audio on the device you are connected to while you are making your notes. Accessing the “pencast” (the audio recording is a bit tricky the first time around) allows you to listen to the audio with the notes in front of you on the page. The idea is that while you are recording, if you jot down a note, you will be able to touch the note on your page and the audio will play. It does work, but I think I need to experiment more in using this: the control seems imprecise, but that could also just be me not knowing how do it right. My biggest concern for most people is with the quality of audio recording on their devices. Most of the iOS and Android devices I’ve used have not been outstanding performers in terms of recording audio. I use an inexpensive Olympus stereo microphone on my phone and tablets and it makes a world of difference. If you are going this route, I strongly urge you to do some research on external microphones. I haven’t had the opportujnity to try this Livescribe in a meeting or lecture setting. It will be interesting when I do. The pen itself is satisfying bulky. The barrel feels good in my hand. You turn the pen on and off by rotating a ring which also retracts or extends the writing tip.. The microUSB port for charging is on the non-writing end of the pen. A cap can be used which allows the Smartpen to be used as a capacitive stylus, albeit a very husky stylus. I am afraid the stylus cap may be prone to falling off: Livescribe sells replacements in packs of three. So do I like it? Indeed I do. The Livescribe 3 is a phenomenal piece of technology and performs as its manufacturer promises. I used my original Livescribe heavily for concept development and note taking. But that task has now been largely relegated to my smartphone and tablets. I am also uncertain about separating the audio recording from the Livescribe pen itself as it was on the previous models. I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the Livescribe technology: it’s great stuff. I know that for the next several weeks, I’ll be using it heavily, but I am not so certain in the long term for myself. For lawyers, doctors, many others in different fields, though, I think the Livescribe is a valuable tool.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R378ZQ5KXA05QJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A9Z1JK#wasThisHelpful","R378ZQ5KXA05QJ","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Adobe Premiere Elements is the scaled-down sibling of Adobe Premiere, one of the best featured and most difficult to learn video editing programs available. Premiere Elements, for those brand new to video editing, still has a learning curve, but nothing like its big relative. It is also smack dab in the middle of  a very competitive market, up against contenders like Cyberlink PowerDirector. There is a beginner’s mode in Adobe Premiere Elements that can be learned quickly, but there are also free programs like Windows MovieMaker that offer virtually identical functionality at that  level. Once you move beyond the baby steps, you will have to learn what Premiere Elements can do – a lot – and how to make the program do those things. Rather than detail all of what Adobe Premier Elements can do, I’ll refer you to the Amazon web page, the Adobe website and the downloadable manual and the numerous websites explaining how to do this, that and lots more in Premiere Elements. This is a very powerful program, but you’ll find any who will argue that it is not the best entry level video editor. My suggestion is that if you have the time and inclination, at least check out Cyberlink PowerDirector, Magix Video Editor and Corel VideoStudio Pro before making a decision. Adobe PhotoShop Elements 14 leaves out some major features found in Adobe Photoshop, but quite honestly, Photoshop Elements is mere than enough to meet the needs of most hobbyist photographers. Again, rather than repeat the very long list of this program’s features, I’d suggest you check out the Amazon web page, the Adobe web page and the many third-party sites ha provide coverage of this product. Be forewarned, there are a lot of them. When it comes to less sophisticated photo editing programs, there are only two I recommend: Adobe Photoshop Elements and some versions of Corel PaintShop Pro, the latter of which by the way, has improved tremendously over the last two or three releases. I would strongly urge you to consider both carefully. For the money, this is a very attractive pairing. Both Premiere Elements ad Photoshop Elements are at the top of their respective classes, though not without shortcomings. As you might anticipate with programs like this, one size does not fit all.

"This is a solid solution for the iOS device user seeking a relatively  inexpensive, easy to use and flexible external device.  The major feature here is an Apple Lightning connector on one end and a USB 3.0 on the other end. Both connectors are on a slide so only one is visible at any time.  Lexar offers a free iOS app intended to make file transfers and syncing quick and easy.  You can use the M20i to hold music and movies for playback on your iOS device o transfer files to and from your iOS device.  With the USB 3.0 connector, you can connect the M20i to your Mac or Windows computer.  I didn’t even bother measuring read and write speeds on this flash drive. Since I am not using it for live recording of photos or video, the write speed is fairly meaningless. Read speeds are also immaterial, in my opinion, because you are not going to be transferring vast amounts of data here.  My only objection is on the size: it covers two USB ports on my Windows machine. I have to use it with a short USB cable, otherwise I lose access to a USB port.  Since Apple doesn’t offer a microSD slot, you’ve had to rely on wireless transfers or hook your iOS device to a computer. The M20i gives you a way to write to and reads from external storage.

"This is an utterly fascinating book. It looks at the nature of work primarily in the United States in the 21st Century. Its premises – that most people will be working independently and even outside of traditional workspaces – will disturb many people. This is not a quick read. I found it challenging because I and have been the “detached worker of the future” for almost three decades and didn’t know I was the wave of the future. I just thought I was self-employed, a freelancer. In fact, according to the authors, the workforce at large will soon be composed of independent workers bound to those who pay them by a variety of mechanisms, including contracts, work-for-hire arrangements and so on. The concept of “employee” will dramatically change, if not disappear altogether. Business enterprises will be composed of an ever-shifting sea of people hired for specific purposes for varying durations under differing terms. While written primary for Human Resource managers, this book is worth reading for employees with specialist skills and managers for the future the authors speak of here may very well be their future.

"These headphones have both a USB connector and a 3.5mm plug. Use the USB connector when you want the 7.1 virtual surround sound. With the 3.5mm plug, it’s plain old stereo which happens to be pretty good. Lenovo also provides their own software that has equalization and other personalization features. I haven’t tested it yet.  Though simulated, the surround sound isn’t bad. In the simple games I have or play, you can differentiate direction to a certain degree. The acid test will be when my grandson visits: he is an avid First Person Shooter player and will give me the expert perspective on these headphones.  The all-plastic construction does not feel particularly sturdy, but that is a comment I could make about my Turtle Beach headphones that I have been using (and abusing) for about three years now. The fit on my old and grey head is on the tight side, but that may (hopefully) change over time. The deeply padded headband should help in long sessions.  I like the full over-the-ear cups and they do help block out ambient sound.  The microphone is detachable, a feature I am not particularly fond of since I have found that leads ultimately to misplaced microphones or worse. Audio quality from the mic in my limkited testing ia okay, but not spectacular. It does somewhat reduce extraneous noise. But in a gaming headset, I guess okay audio is indeed okay,  The headset cups fold in at 90 degrees, which makes these slightly easier to carry in a bag .  I don’t have enough experience with sound surround headsets to compare this one with any others, but this one does sound pretty good.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NIUT8DYISSKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01133CPMI#wasThisHelpful","R1NIUT8DYISSKR","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It will take a while until I’ve used this mouse extensively to render a conclusive opinion, but so far, I like what I’ve experienced. I’ve been using a Logitech MX for a few years and I like it. I should point out that my primary usage is for graphics, not gaming. Key for me is size. I have relatively large hands and I like the mouse to pretty much fill my hand. This one does. It’s a bit more than 5 inches long, more than 3 inches wide and just over 1.5 inches high. It is, indeed, a handful. It has switches galore: 9 programmable buttons, most of which I will never use because I can’t remember from one time to the next what functions I’ve assigned to them. (You download a Windows only app to program the buttons.) There are weights that you can add to tune the mouse to your preference. On the Logitech, it took me only a couple of rounds to do this. The real key for me, aside from feel, is DPI. There are four DPI settings. It will take me a while before I can tell how this is going to do as a graphics mouse over the long haul. I should probably have graduated to a tablet ages ago, but for most of the kind of graphics work I do, a highly controllable mouse works fine. Now I have to see how controllable this mouse is. Ergonomically I am uncomfortable with the sharply sloping contour of the mouse. It is a dramatic change from the shape of the Logitech. Most likely, I just have to become accustomed to it. So far, so good. It will be a bit before I can reach a determination, ut we’re off to a pretty good start.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23N9KXVK0S8JG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LDTNLY#wasThisHelpful","R23N9KXVK0S8JG","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For almost all, aging brings a variety of maladies including hearing impairment. That makes for  a lot of “Huhs’, “what did they say?”, “make it louder,  please”. And that’s for the spoken word. Music is another story altogether. That’s part of the reason I was so eager to get these speakers hooked up, which took only minutes. They’re roughly 9x 15 inches and 10 inches deep.  The weight, after so many years of low-cost and frankly lower quality speakers was a surprise, about 15 pounds each. Lacking speaker stands – an absolute must in my opinion, particularly if you have neighbors downstairs – I placed these on the floor, connected them with bare metal stripped wires= ends and let it rip. Wow! I have a pair of pretty good vertical speakers that I purchased many, many years ago and have always considered pretty good. The B6 is a whole different world. To my decrepit ears, the bass was great – maybe even fantastic – and the highs (what I can hear of them) were brilliant. Orff’s “Carmina Burana” had a sparkle and resonance  that I hadn’t heard well in years. Obviously, it’s love at first decibel. If they make a center speaker specifically for pairing with these, I’m getting it.

"I’ve had a long time love/hate with Pinnacle. I started using it when it was an independent company and gave up on it when it was acquired by Avid, who (in my opinion) practically destroyed the application and provided simply awful customer support. Like many others, I abandoned Pinnacle. It was bought by Corel and I didn’t have high hopes for it. Much to my surprise, Corel after years of flailing is making a concerted effort to rejuvenate their acquired product lines. PaintShop Pro which was on a downhill path is really a great program in its present iteration. I skipped sever iterations of Pinnacle Studio, but when offered the opportunity to evaluate Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate, I figured why not. Overall I think Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is vastly improved since my past outing with the product. But I will be sticking with Cyberlink Director. The feature list is on the Amazon web page, but I suggest you also look at the Pinnacle Systems website as well. Pinnacle does not offer a trial download of Pinnacle Studio 19, but the manual is available. If you’re a Cyberlink Director or Adobe Premiere Elements user considering a switch, I recommend downloading and perusing the manual before purchase. Ultimately it comes down to a user’s preferences. This is probably not a program for absolute beginners, but like Cyberlink Director and Adobe Premiere Elements, it is a good place to continue after using Windows MovieMaker. It installs easily, interfaces are a bit cluttered – which can be said of all its competitors as well – and has some features like 4K that few people will use right now. The New Blue Effects package is nice. In toto, Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is a nice serviceable video editing suite. With all the choices in the market, though, I would advise careful consideration.Jerry","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROAKV8HQ7WS6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XDQEHQ#wasThisHelpful","ROAKV8HQ7WS6W","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandson is getting older. He’s probably on the very outside edge of the age group that this model appeals to – unless you’re an old scale modeler like me. To my regret, the scale modeling bug hasn’t taken root in my grandson and probably never will. But he still enjoys the occasional model when he visits and this one will be fun, though I think he will allow zero participation from me, aside from being permitted to watch him. I haven’t put it together, though I have closely examined the parts and try-fit them. The parts are beautiful. They are detailed and painted. They fit better than any snap-together model I’ve ever built and I have built practically all of them with kid. The one detail I really don’t like is that the rear landing gear don’t retract. My other misgiving is about the size: it’s small. But I suspect that is to keep the cost down and make it more amenable to the younger kids this model is really aimed at. In terms of ease-of-build, I’m relying on other reviews and eagerly anticipating my grandson’s next visit. Overall, this is a very cool odel and the sounds are an added bonus.

"I enjoy test prep books for a variety of reasons. Some (not this one) are excellent references. All of them allow you to test the extent of your own knowledge. And some, like this one, provide insight into the state of public education in this country. The knowledge content of this test prep guide is abominable and frightening. It is disgustingly politically correct and reflects certain intellectual biases and a certain political persuasion. The authors and editors, of course, aren’t in the business of correcting errors in te content: their goal is to prepare young people to be tested on what the public education establishment is foisting upon them. This task, they fulfill well with succinct reviews of what passes for world history, example questions and answers and practice examples. Given its purpose, the guide is successful’ What is to be mourned, however, is the death of objectivity and honesty in the teaching of world history in American schools. Rather, it appears, children are being fed propaganda, not history.Jerry","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD05AZOSHGJQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625231423#wasThisHelpful","RD05AZOSHGJQN","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back when Windows was young, almost every new release required a book like this. But Windows has long been the most used Operating System on the planet and the changes from one eversion to another are more evolutionary than revolutionary. Windows 10 Bible apparently is the descendant of versions that have gone before. If you are inexperienced with Windows, the book could be useful It is well written, covers all the basics of using and managing Windows and has lots of examples and illustrations. But it is incomplete. For example, Cortana, Microsoft’s response to Apple Siri and Google Now receives only a brief mention. Office Online is covered in some detail, but there are no instructiosn for application like Outlook. I found no mention whatsoever of Bing and Microsoft Edge, the replacement for Internet Explorer is covered in scant detail. On the plus side,  generally neglected subjects like managing the desktop and advanced searching techniques are covered in some detail. Overall, if you’re an experienced Windows user, there’s nothing in this book tah you can’t quickly find on the web – and many subjects pertaining to Windows 10 in particular and Microsoft’s application universe aren’t covered at all.

"This is, essentially, a self-help book, intended to assist its reads in discovering their true-self and helping them understand, hone and deploy their capacity for leadership. The underlying premise is that everyone has the “right stuff” buried somewhere within them – they just have to find it, feed it and deploy it. The vehicle is interviews with successful people. Lots of them. This is a classic technique, originally honed in the modern era by Napoleon Hill. And it is effective. “To thine own self be true” was Shakespeare’s advice and it is both true and hard to achieve. Getting a group to buy into your faith and vision is even harder. Much harder. Not everyone who follows Bill George’s distilled advice will become an effective and productive leader. That’s human nature: not everyone is equally endowed.

"This book is particularly valuable if the S6 is your first Samsung Galaxy smartphone. If you’ve used any of the Galaxy models since the S3, there are lots of tidbits here, but nothing revolutionary or that you can’t learn on your own if you want to invest the time. In general, this is a very detailed, very well illustrated instruction manual covering most – not all – aspects of ordinary usage of the Galaxy S6. You won’t find any “hacks” here, no instructions on rooting your phone or making it turn somersaults. Nor, to its detriment, will you find much in the way of instructions on apps competing with Samsung’s own offerings and its TouchWiz interface. I consider this to be an unfortunate omission.

"I’ve been using Olympus (and Sony) digital recorders for a long time. The prices keep coming down and the audio output quality keeps going up. The WS-852 and its more expensive sibling WS-853 are little wonders of technology. Both are certified to the 6 star level of compatibility with Dragon Naturally Speaking, the vest voice to text program currently available in the consumer market. (Fpr best results, use the recorder with a compatible headset.) The feature set on these recorders has always intrigued me. The only  feature I constantly use on older models is the scene selection, where you can choose between solo dictation, small meetings, conference room, auditorium and so on. Now, according to Olympus, you can choose an “Intelligent Auto Mode” which will set the microphone sensitivity automatically or choose one of the seven “scenes”. Olympus has also introduced a “simple” display mode, which presents only those functions that are frequently used. This is a good idea that certainly reduces the confusion factor for first-time users – and old pros as well. I suspect it is a result of the competition Olympus faces from smart phones, but whatever the reason it’s a good idea. A new addition is a flip-up stand, intended to reduce vibration when using the microphone on as tablet. One very unwelcome change is moving the external microphone and headphone jacks to the side of the unit. This is extremely bothersome to me since I almost always have an external microphone plugged into the unit. Most often it is the Olympus ME51S Stereo Microphone which I find extremely effective for recording small meetings. Possibly the new built-in Olympus stereo microphone will do as well, but I am a bit skeptical. The unit will accept a 32GB microSD card that will give you umpteen million hours of storage. The  4GB will suffice for most  people: just use the built-in USB connector to transfer your recordings to your computer. Finally, bear in mind that this is intended to be a voice recorder: the frequency range is quite limited and music doesn’t come off too well. Also new is a filter that lops off the lowest and highest frequencies in a recording. It can be useful in getting rid of ambient noise. Overall, for those who appreciate the versatility of a dedicated digital voice recorder, you won’t go wrong with the WS-852.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHHPPJK3FWRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014658DS0#wasThisHelpful","R1DHHPPJK3FWRS","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One reason why I enjoy study guides like this is that they permit me to test my knowledge by seeing how much of the test subjects I know. A second reason is because I am a critic of American public education. I think it is ineffective and highly politicized. My local school boards are always launching new and always expensive programs to help the so-called disadvantaged. And while the school boards never say anything about it, standardized test scores in the districts are falling. Finally, guides like this give me insight into what public schools are teaching – and in this regard AP U.S. History is nothing less than frightening. However, this review is about whether this book is an effective study guide for those preparing to take this test. And the answer to that is an unequivocal yes. This provides a straight-forward methodology to preparing for and taking the A. P. U.S. History exam. The practice tests cover Document-Based, Short-Answer and Long-Essay questions. There is also a five-page section on stress management before and during the etst which some may find helpful. In short, this is a solid test preparation guide, just as most Kaplan study aids are. They do a good job. My argument, which I will not engage in here, is what public schools are teaching as “American history”.

"First of all, Turtle Beach does not manufacture headsets that will please audiophiles. No way. If you are looking for the most accurate rendition of music or such. But for online chat, Skype, even dictation with a program like Dragon Naturally Speaking, Turtle Beach headsets are perfectly suited for the job. They’re tough. I have a Turtle Beach Ear Force ZLa that I’ve used for several years. The headband still fits snugly. The foam ear cushions haven’t started shredding. The boom microphone stays were you put it. And the performance continues to be excellent. The Recon 50 offers  some modest and some significant refinements. The boom microphone is removable, which is a mixed blessing: removable components can be misplaced. The over the ear cups are very comfortable and an improvement over the ZLa, where the earphones are merely cushioned. The headband is adjustable and, most importantly, comfortably for long periods of wear, which in my case is typically two or three hours. I know avid games can go for far longer, but if my experience is a guide, these are comfortable. The 40mm  “ Neodymium speakers” promise to “deliver great stereo sound with crisp highs and thundering lows”. The highs sound fine to me, but the lows are short of thundering, but still fine by me.. I don’t use the inline controls, but they’re there for those who do. Audio quality is excellent. I’ve recorded test messages on Skype, Ustream and Audacity. Best of all, my speech using this headset is recognized with high accuracy by Dragon.

"I first ran across PNY years ago in a big-box store. I needed RAM and it was less expensive than the better known brands. PNY has gained significant market share and is now a major player. And their products are solid performers. RAM is a product that must meet or exceed industry-wide specifications. The quality of the materials and assembly are the keys. I’ve never had a PNY RAM module go bad. In choosing RAM, you have to find out what type fits your laptop. There are many places where you can do this, including Amazon. Be careful about voltage. The standard is 1.5v, though some laptops require a lower-voltage RAM module. Next, if you’re new to this, check your laptop manual to find out how to install the RAM. Typically it’s a task requiring only a few minutes, but some manufacturers make it very difficult. That’s it. These modules from PNY are well-made and, as noted, I’ve never had one go bad.

"I love this. Years ago, there was a system known as X-10 that was going to bring remote control to every household,. X10 is still around, though it never really caught on. But it and its competitors were too early for the internet and in most cases have never tried to become internet capable. Now the internet of things is upon us. Home thermostats and every other appliance can be monitored and controlled via the internet. I wanted this item because I have a small fan which is perfectly suited for use in the bedroom, but it has no remote. Well, it didn’t have a remote. Now, with the TRENDnet THA-101 (I love those exotic product names) I can get close to remote control by turning the power on and off, no matter where I might be as long as I am connected to the internet with an iOS or Android device. The THA-101 also can act as a WiFi repeater, bringing a strong WiFi signal into areas of you home with no or weak WiFi signal stren. Depending on your knowledge and willingness to follow directions, the THA-101 can be simple to install or a nightmare. There are three paths to installation. The first is WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), which if it works, is as simple as it gets. The second is through a Web browser. And the third uses an iOS or Android app. I cannot over-emphasize how important it is that you follow the instructions laid out in the Quick Installation or, preferably, the User’s Guide. Do that and you will most likely have a trouble free, painless installation. His is not a super-sophisticated device or system. Once you set it up properly, you can switch the power to a device on or off. You can set up a schedule to turn devices on and off, for example, to give the appearance that your house is occupied when you are off traveling the world. The THA-101 will work with 802.11 G and N routers. It also acts as a 802.11 N range extender, which can cause problems in some systems. When you are troubleshooting something other than the extender function, turn it off. Overall, this is a simple device with limited functionality. Be patient, carefully follow the directions and you too can turn off a lamp, fan or other small electrical appliance from anywhere in the world.

"I am a long-time Adonit user, which isn’t really that long since the company is pretty young. I swear by their Jot Pro stylus. Except for a horrendous and continuous problem with the tips falling off, they are, in my opinion, the greatest phone and tablet styluses ever made. I also have several Adonit products that work only with iOS which have left me less enthusiastic, but still a fan. Now my fan loyalty has just shot up a notch or two with the Adonit Jot Dash. First, it’s a product I can use with my Android phones and tablets. Second, the fine is almost as precise as the disc on the tip of the Jot Pro. You have to practice a bit with any stylus, some like this one requiring more effort than others. Ii don’t like the fact that is a powered device and, even less, I don’t like the proprietary charger which is just one more thing to remember to use and, if you travel, pack. I do like the integrated clip: the first Adonit devices came without a clip and I guess the wailing was loud,, because they introduced a cap with a clip. Subsequent products have incorporated clips. Like every Adonit device I’ve used, it is beautifully designed and perfectly balanced in my hand. It is effortless to hold, position and use. I don’t draw on phones and tablets. I have no ambition to create great art (nor do I have the talent to do so). I print: cursive is not my8 strong suit. So the final analysis: does the Adonit Dash work? Yes. Is it perfect? No. I use it for convenience: I am much more productive with the Swiftkey and Google onscreen keyboards.

"My face has been graced with a beard and mustache for the past forty-five or so years. Back in the day, no barber, as they were called in those long ago days, ever touched my long and ever-growing hair. A banker once remarked to me that he never thought he’d be dealing with one of the Smith Brothers, one of two really hairy guys whose drawings graced the boxes of their eponymous cough drops, which just yesterday bit the dust again. So why I am interested iin trimmers? My beard and mustache, the glory and bane of my existence. Like must bearded men, I have a collection of cutting implements which haven’t made the grade. I want a beard that looks silky smooth – but don’t want to be bothered with time-consuming maintenance. An impossible challenge, of course, but the Panasonic ER-GB80-S (I love those awe-inspiring product names!) helps me get closer to my goal. First of all, this feels good to hold. It is beefy, brawny, masculine in the old school. And the size helps in terms of being able to control it, something I have never been able to do well with smaller trimmers, including my beloved tiny Panasonic beard trimmer. It has 39 settings for length, plus specialized combs, that provide infinite control, a must for detailing and shaping fussy areas. It is remarkably gentle along the beard line under my chin, an attribute I greatly appreciate. I don’t like rechargeable batteries because they require me to remember to charge them, but there’s no way you will power this motor on AAA cells for very long, if at all. If I were a daily user, I’d question the idea of extended trips with this trimmer and the possible need to pack the charger as well. It cleans easily with a chute to funnel water into, through and out of the blades. Neat idea! Best of all, I love the slide up trimmer. It is absolutely great for trimming my often unruly moustache and detailing the edges of my beard. This feature alone makes eh ER-GB80-S worth its premium price tag. I can’t speak to its use as a hair and body hair trimmer, but for my beard and mustache, I love this.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R349WKIIZXDX9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO54PAI#wasThisHelpful","R349WKIIZXDX9E","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been very happy with my Asus gaming laptop that I use primarily for image, video and audio editing. That is, until I ran CrystalMark on my internal 7200RPM hard drive and the Western Digital My Book. CrystalMark measures my C drive at a respectable (at least I thought it was) 107.2 MB/s READ speed and 100.4 MB/s WRITE. The My Book running over a USB 3.0 interface scored 4119 MB/s READ and 354.2 MB/s WRITE in RAID 1 configuration. I am awed. In fact, I think I want to go out and dance in the streets. Editing stills and video is going to be a lot faster. I tested moves and copies with a folder containing 275,000 items aggregating 319 GB back and forth. About 90 minutes for each run. This is local, not network storage (though you can designate it as a network drive in Windows, it will not be a NAS). It’s a small, fairly light box that you can fit on your desltop. It is deathly silent. It runs cool. In fact, I kept checking for air flow and heat. Nada. Creepy. There are two Thunderbolt and one USB 3.0 Ports on the back. On the front there are two power only USB 3.0 ports that you can use to charge phones, tablets and such. Nice, helpful touch. The drives are easily replaceable. RAID is handled internally, so no additional load is place on your computer’s CPU. All in all, a little bit pricey, but absolutely worth it.

"Three decades back or so, I started doing legal research. Since the books containing case digests (legal opinions) were very expensive, I had to to trek to the law library, an hour or more each way, during the hours it was open. I had to then use digests of digests to find cases supporting and opposing my point. It was a burdensome task. Today, 24/7, I have access to one of the largest law libraries in the world. I can search for relevant case law, treatises and articles in seconds. And the cost per month is substantially less than it would have been were I obtaining this information in book form and subscribing to update services. Legal publishing did not die, but it no longer is what it was. Other industries weren’t so fortunate. At one time, little print shops existed in the thousands. Today nearly all of them are gone, vaporized in author Robert Tercek’s lexicon. Now anyone can operate the equivalent of a print shot – that is, if they ever need to print anything on paper. Right now in most major cities, the traditional taxi cab industry is being vaporized by Uber,  Lyft and other ride sharing services. Tercek has written a history and a chronicle of the future as software assumes a dominant role in society. For many of us, who have come of age in the Information technology industry, much of this is common knowledge. For most in the population at large, however, much of the content of his book will come as a shock, even a threat. As Tercek puts it “[t]he future of companies is lean and leaner”. Technology will “vaporize” ever more companies and even industries. Many will be transformed, buy many others will be essentially destroyed. It is simultaneously a grim future and a brilliant future. For the individual, it depends on how they adapt. Tis is a marvelous book, especially for those who haven’t caught on that technology is changing the world in more weays than they ever imagined possible. It is general, as any book of this kind must be, but it is specific enough to retain the reader’s interest. It is a book for everyone. For parents who want to help guide their children; for young adults n the workforce who want to exploit the opportunities around them and for anyone who just wants to know what’s going on. In fact, I am tempted to say that anyone who doesn’t read this runs the risk of being “vaporized” themselves, their experience and skills rendered meaningless as software and robots replace them.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HBFRGKSWQH60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1928055044#wasThisHelpful","R1HBFRGKSWQH60","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before opening this book, my knowledge of Scrum and Agile Project Management was pretty much limited to knowing the words and little more. Neither Scrum nor Agile Project Management are necessarily simple. “At its barest, scrum is an empirical exposure model, which means knowledge is gained from real-life experience, and decisions are made based on that experience.” Got that? Don’t worry if you don’t. for the author spends the next 361 pages explaining in considerable detail what Scrum is and how the methodology can be applied to various business and personal roles. Scrum is an approach to getting things done, including “Dating and Family Life”” and “Life Goals”, which came as quite a surprise to me. I would strongly urge the newcomer to Scrum to read “Agile Project Management For Dummies”, by the same author, first. Having struggled with “Scrum For Dummies”, I can see that I need the underpinning first in understanding Agile. This is not a criticism of “Scrum For Dummies” or Mark C. Layton, the author of both books. Rather it is my recognition that Scrum is not an easy concept to grasp in significant depth straight out the gate. There is a great deal of depth in “Scrum For Dummies”, far more than I would have expected in a “Dummies” book. Sometimes it takes on sort of a mystical tone: “Scrum is a focusing tool. One of the biggest reasons that scrum is so successful is that it edits out the noise of trying to do everything all at once.Instead of doing all projects poorly, scrum focuses to do one project at a time, with a higher level of quality than if thrashing around.” Since I am often guilty of the former, I want to consistently do the latter. Adopting Scrum can definitely help, but  you have to first comprehend what Scrum is. This book does that, but I think famialiarizing yourself with Agile will be helpful. At least that’s what I’m going to do.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JEE6XBDT4EK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111890575X#wasThisHelpful","R1JEE6XBDT4EK0","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I occasionally am invited to be a guest lecturer, but I don’t teach any classes and haven’t been in a classroom as a student in decades. But I am concerned with what I perceive as the not-very-slow death of discussion in the public square. From where I stand, people don’t engage in discussion these days. On television, in social media, in public meetings, you don’t hear or see discussion any more, you see or hear rants, diatribes, shouting, hating, Civilized discussion, including the exchange of opposing views seems to be largely a dead issue. In the classroom environment, to my surprise, the problem is silence – students have to be coaxed into productive participation in discussions, except for the always present few who never stop talking and are uninterested in letting others have their say. While the writing style is bit tedious, the author does an excellent job of discussing the obstacles to creating a productive classroom (or group) discussion environment. Methodologies to promote positive group discussions are offered, but this is no compendium of tips and tracks to facilitate discussion. The author is clearly engaged with the idea of discussion as a teaching tool. I think the book has somewhat wider applicability and includes people like myself who present to professionals. When I speak to audiences, I try hard to encourage discussion. I did gain a better understanding of the mechanics of facilitating discussion from this book.Jerry","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C7E3VVZCJINZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118571355#wasThisHelpful","R2C7E3VVZCJINZ","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Winter is approaching Chicago. It’s chilly and gray today and not the best day for testing a circular polarizing filter outdoors. So no sky shots, no waterfalls or flowing rivers, although had I been adventurous, I suspect Lake Michigan would have provided some pretty good wave action and water motion. Anyway, I tested this very fine polarizer using a Nikon D5200 on reflections. Reflections on glass, on metal, plastic surfaces, LCD screens, anything around with reflections. This filter is definitely a reelection killer. If I muster up the ambition this year to photograph Christmas windows at the stores, this polarizer will definitely be on my lens. I need to do some research on how to determine the effective f-stop loss. B+W says 1 – 1.5 stops: it looks like more, but that is the point of B+W’s claim – that this polarizer passes more light than run-of-the-mill polarizers.

"The very first thing that impressed me about this trimmer is its hand-filling size. Compared to the diminutive trimmer (also Panasonic) that I’ve used for several years, this is a literal brute. It is big, it fills my hand, it is fairly heavy – all qualities that help make this a precision grooming tool. The second is power. My existing trimmer is powered by a couple of AA batteries. The GB60 has a powerful motor powered by rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. In terms of working on my beard, it’s like moving from a scythe to a John Deere. Shame on me, but I sometimes put off trimming my beard and as beards do, it quickly gets long and scraggly. Cutting it down to length with this trimmer is like taking a hot knife to butter. In fact, you have to be very careful not to get too aggressive. Snap on the beard trimming comb attachment and adjust it for your preferred length of 1/32 to 13/32 inch. Trimming the edges and shaping the beard is almost a joy with this. But again, don’t be too aggressive. I don’t trim my hair, so I can’t comment on using the GB60 for that purpose. Panasonic suggests you clean the trimmer after every use, an inherently tedious process. A water inlet is provided to assist iin this process, but it doesn’t make it less tedious. A cleaning brush is also provided along with a small container of oil. Happily, Panasonic provides clear instructions on how to perform these processes. An AC adapter is provided for charging the trimmer’s internal batteries. It takes about an hour to charge the battery, which will keep it running for about 50 minutes. Finally, a faux fabric carrying case is included. Overall, a brawny trimmer that fits large hands and has more than enough power to deal with any beard.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW5JBVU381B4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3A1X0S#wasThisHelpful","RW5JBVU381B4F","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Judith Flanders is an excellent researcher, a competent historian and an adequate writer. If you come to this book expecting an exciting time, you’ll probably be disappointed – it is a slow trudge through the 350 or so pages of this book. On the other hand, if you are interested in learning how we in Western society came to understand “home” as you and I probably do, this is a fascinating book. Flanders traces the minutiae of what makes a home through the eyes of householders, tax collectors, merchants, artists and others. For example, at one time, often more than half a family’s wealth might be invested in beds, bedding and clothing. Curtains on windows didn’t become popular until the 18th century, In the Low Countries, far more homes than you might expect were adorned with original paintings. The development of each of our contemporary rooms – kitchen, bedroom, living room and so on – is traced in some detail. Bedrooms, for example, were once the main rooms of a home. If you love historical detail, this is an enthralling book. For example, the development of the Argand lamp in 1780 was a revolutionary change in oil lighting which, in turn, helped to end the reign of lighting with candles. Overall, an engaging history of how what we today call home developed over the past five centuries – and a powerful reminder that we have lives that are incredibly richer than those of even three generations past.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R240WBFAJO1TWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067359#wasThisHelpful","R240WBFAJO1TWI","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been using a Plantronics Voyager Pro Bluetooth headset for about 2.5 years. I’ve tried other Bluetooth headsets during that time, but none equaled or surpassed the Voyager Pro.  Until now.  The big feature drawing me in is real compatibility with Google Now. I am a big, big fan of voice-controlled computing and this device is a big step toward that, in my opinion.  Google Now works pretty well with this phone, which is good because the headset lacks physical buttons and most commands are intended to be given by voice. (Siri and Cortana compatibility is claimed, but I haven’t tried either.) It will be a bit before I have fully tested the Google Now limits of this headset. Google Now has a surprisingly large set of voice commands that most people aren’t familiar with.  Instead of buttons to press, there’s a tap area that I am not particularly happy with. There aren’t a lot of tap commands, such as tapping twice to answer or hang up a call, I’d rather have voice equivalents for all of them or buttons. But that’s just my preference.  Voice quality is okay. I don’t have high expectations in this area. I listen to a lot of audiobooks and have no difficulty understanding them with this headset and the few people I called didn’t complain about my voice quality.  Battery life is not very good. Three hours talk time in the headset – and another seven accessible via the charger. The charger is a little cradle you’re supposed to carry around with you. When the headset is in the charger, it recharges the headset battery! I had a case like this for the Plantronics and stopped using it because it proved to be inconvenient. The headset cannot be charged except when it is in the charging cradle. I’d rather have a microUSB port in the headset. Again, a personal preference.  Four Ear Gels are supplied – and you’d better find the one that fits you best because it will play a role in the fit of the headset. You just put the headset in your ear (right ear only) and hope for the best. There are no loops, wings or other auxiliary devices to keep the headset in place. So far, so good, but I have been careful not to jog it in any way.  Overall, I reasonably impressed with Eclipse.

"I’m an aging male who doesn’t have much hair left, much less long hair. However, that doesn’t stop me from observing a young woman with long hair using this product.  This is a beautifully designed product, as it should be considering its price. Construction is reasonably substantial and with normal care, it should last, though I can’t speak to the hidden heating and electrical components inside the wand.  That a heat resistant glove and pad are included should provide all the warning you need that there is significant danger of burning yourself if you are careless.  Use is straight forward. There are five heat settings. Use the one appropriate setting for your hair as described in the very brief instruction manual.  Part your hair into sections and then wrap a strip of hair fairly tightly around the barrel for a few seconds and release.  The result is a lock of wonderfully curled hair. The effect of the tapered barrel is very evident in the finished curl.  The unit has an automatic shut off and small feet you can rest it on, hopefully on the included heat-resistant pad.  All that is to the good.  The unit is expandable with attachments – expensive attachments.  I don’t know the market well enough to determine if this product is intended for heavy-duty salon use or by affluent consumers, if not both.  On the whole, as it comes out of the box, it makes fluffy, pretty curls and probably will be suited for most people.

"This is the newest version of the well-known and highly regarded SanDisk Extreme microSDHC card line. SanDisk claims it is suitable for 4K recording. While I have a couple of cameras that record 4K,  I have no screen that resolves 4K, so I don’t shoot a lot of 4K. I did try this out for burst shooting on a GoPro Hero 4 Silver and the writes are clearly faster. The same is true of video.

"Prior to sighting this book, I had never heard of Steve Tobak. Having attempted to read “Real Followers Don’t Follow”, I doubt that I will ever hear of Steve Tobak again in any substantive way. Tobak is involved with something called Invisor Consulting and he says of himself “[t]hat’s probably why he’s been interviewed, quoted, and referenced by pretty much every major business media outlet at one time or another”. Well, so what? Get yourself a publicist or be an aggressive self-promoter and within a year you can probably make a similar claim. Anyway, in this book, Tobak claims to “show readers what it takes to become successful entrepreneurs and exceptional business leaders in today’s highly competitive world”. Immodest to the core, Tobak declares “[e]ntrepreneurialism is broken and I’m going to fix it”. In my estimation, his 20 page introduction establishes that this book is about Steve Tobak, what he does and what he thinks. And, frankly, there’s not much there. One assertion after another, usually unsourced, doesn’t make for convincing reading. For example, Tobak writes: “I once read that two-thirds of the Dow Industrial Average was formed during recession or in the Great Depression. I’ve no doubt that’s true”. Uhmm, some people have heard if you step on a crack in the sidewalk, it will rain – and they believe that’s true. This is, I think, a really weird book. It’s all about him with bon mots like “ On nice days I work outdoors. If I’ve got a tight deadline, I’ll have a second cappuccino to provide a boost. If I’m working at night, I have a glass of wine or two”. And “I’ve gotten on a plane, flown to a dinner meeting with an important customer, and flown right back that night”. Who cares? Everything he says has been said – often more effectively – by someone else. Some of his advice is puzzling. For example: “[w]hen a company is in trouble, that’s when the boss needs to get hands-on wherever the trouble lies”. I don’t pretend to be nearly as experienced as Tobak claims to be, but in my experience – particularly in smaller companies of the kind Tobak is addressing, it is the boss who is responsible for the problems.

"If you’ve ever lived in the Upper Midwest, most notably in Minnesota, or listened to Garrison Keillor’s Prairie Home Companion show, you know that potluck meals are a way of life. As Keillor put it: “We used to have a potluck culture in Minnesota—the sharing of food as a way of life, you do your best for me, I do my best for you. “ This beautiful – yes, I said beautiful – Stanley Vaccum Crock would be the hit of any potluck. It really is a wonderful piece of design. A stainless steel bottom and polycarbonate top and edge lip. For very brawny clips secure the top to the pot – properly snapped shut, that top will stay attached and your championship chili will not be sloshing about the back seat. On the inside of the lid is a clever little hook to hang the lid from the side of the pot – smart thinking. Stanley says hot food will stay warn for up to 12 hours and cold food for up to 16. I have every reason to believe it. Stanley invented the vacuum thermos in 1913. The pot walls are a double wall vacuum. The pot has a 3 quart capacity. You can fill it with food, such as chili, soup, stew or such, or use it as a container for packs of food – hamburgers for grilling, smaller portions in containers and so on. In some cases, this will easily replace larger Igloo style containers – and do a better job of it. My ice-loving incredibly significant other immediately laid claim to this to hold her iced tea and other beverages on our road trips. The wide top makes serving simple and also allows it to be easily used for storage of packaged items. Obviously as you can tell from the pictures, this is a cinch to clean.

"This book is written in a breezy, entertaining style, reminiscent of the tourist promotion movies of the 1940s and 50s. Everything is light and bouncy. “Rocket” seems like a promotional piece, though the name of the employer of the book’s four authors, Boston Consulting group, is barely mentioned. The treatment of the 16 entrepreneurs “interviewed” is an exercise in hagiography. The lessons the 16 have to impart, according to the doyens of Boston Consulting Group, are what you would expect to find in any book about creating a successful business. Most of the “ideas” presented are suitable only for established large scale businesses, who just happen to be the kind of business Boston Consulting Group would like to serve. There’s more than a touch of “magical special sauce” claims by the authors. You must, for example, create your “demand-space map”. You know, the kind of thing that worked wonders for Frito-Lay. Just imagine what it can do for your little bead store or office supply emporium. Nothing to it, really: Just “describe the 30 most important technical, functional, and emotional factors. Broadly discuss  the findings in your organization. Use the demand-space map as the starting point for all development activities.” There are a number of large and small factual errors in the book that, to my eyes, indicate a surprising lack of knowledge on the part of the authors and their editors. For example, “[Ronald] Reagan’s chief fund-raiser asked the Four Seasons [a corporation] for a donation. Instead of a contribution, Four Seasons graciously offered the former governor a complimentary suite whenever he was staying in Washington”. I am deliberately ignoring the issue of a political campaign seeking a contribution from a corporation, but the fact is that the offer of service – the offer of a hotel suite – would be a contribution-in-kind. The authors present it as if it were an alternative to a contribution, when in fact it is indeed a contribution. Small potatoes to be sure, but a surprising error on the part of the authors. In another place, the authors describe how Amazon, with its “powerful data-storage capability” “became a rival to IBM in cloud computing”.  In fact, Amazon and its primary cloud service competitors Microsoft and Google were in the market before IBM and may have larger revenues from these services. But “Rocket” shouldn’t be considered as a serious history of any business. The interviews are, in fact, interestin and you will learn something qabout the businesses of the interviewees.

"First, exercise caution in reading the advertising for this series of cards.

"I have a Dell Venue 8. It is a fully capable Windows computer in a very small package with an 8 inch screen. It is fast enough for ordinary purposes such as email, browsing, general productivity (word processing, etc.) and, surprisingly, light duty video switching and editing. I also have an Asus Windows tablet with a 10 inch screen and an attached keyboard that holds a 500GB hard drive. As I get older I want to carry less. CPUs have become smaller and more powerful. Prices for Ultrabooks and Sub-Compact form factors are plummeting. Still, these lightweight machines aren’t well suited for productivity off the shelf. They’re powerful enough in terms of CPU and sorage, but you really need something close to a full sized keyboard and mouse and perhaps more storage than the device natively has. The Trendnet Universal USB 3.0 Docking Station is relatively small (but not as small as I dream of) unit that massively expands your Input/Output (I/O) capabilities. The device provides two USB 3.0 ports, 4 USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit CAT5 cable socket,  HDMI and DVI/VGA connectors that allow you to output to two separate HD monitors and separate audio and microphone jacks. (Physically, by the way, there’s a DVI port on the device and a DVI-to-VGA adapter included. Phenomenal. Everything works. You can now have a powerful system with a keyboard you can type on, a Terabyte or two of storage and more in a set-up weighing less than three pounds that will fit in your messenger bag or backpack. There are some design and packaging points I am not totally overjoyed with. The unit is larger than I would like. By the same token, I don’t know if all these functions could be put into a smaller package. The ergonomics, however, are great: plenty of room around each port making it easy to attach and detach peripherals. The AC adapter is a too large, in my opinion, wall wart that plugs directly into a socket. In some motels, you’ll go nuts with this. I think it should have been an inline adapter with an AC cord. I would suggest carrying an extension cord, if you already do this. They don’t include a carrying bag. And the big one: all those USB ports and none can be used go charge a device.

"Given the perverse logic of eugenicists and other proponents of logical Darwinism, the anti-capitalist political strains roiling through Europe from the 1850s onward and the open animosity of both Catholic and Protestant denominations toward the Jews, is it any wonder that the Europe of the 1930s was more than willing to accept the Jew hatred of a long line of European nationalists, culminating with Hitler? To the Jew-haters of the day, it wasn’t a psychological, philosophical or religious issue: it was biological. The Jews were a virus, parasites, and had to be destroyed. German leadership quickly learned “in 1941, that almost every every German who was ordered to shoot a civilian, Jewish or otherwise, would obey that order – even though asking to be spared from such duties brought no consequences beyond peer pressure”. Several million Germans and other Europeans engaged in such murders, with only a few prosecuted, much less punished, for their crimes. Timothy Snyder has written a fascinating Holocaust history, focusing on how the destruction of the concept of the state liberated Germans and Europeans to commit murder on a scale never before seen. Snyder’s thesis is fascinating – and, he argues, industrialized mass murder can happen again. Many will reject Snyder’s theories and perhaps not unreasonably so. Much of his hypothese rests on assertions that cannot be proven, such as some of Hitler’s private thoughts and speculation on Hitler’s theories. On the other hand, no one else has  convincingly explained why so many Germans and other Europeans were so willing to murder so many millisons.Jerry","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXK0HQXNVZY5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101903457#wasThisHelpful","RXK0HQXNVZY5C","A680RUE1FDO8B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A680RUE1FDO8B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first heard some of Viktor Kosenko's music with the release of the first CD in this series, his  Études in the Form of Old Dances. I reviewed it and append it at the end of this note because it gives some biographical information about the all-but-unknown Kosenko.This disc contains three sonatas, two of them in one movement. The disc only lasts about 50 minutes, short for a CD;  this is concentrated late Romantic music, the only piano sonatas Kosenko wrote, that will in fact make you wish for more . One takes what one can get here. Natalya Shkoda is a fine pianist whose abilities were evident in the earlier release, and she does not disappoint. For those who like Rachmaninoff, Medtner and that ilk, this music will be down your alley.Here's my earlier review of the Études disc; much of what I say about my reaction to it holds for the present disc:Occasionally one hears unfamiliar music and immediately falls in love with it. That has been my experience with these eleven piano pieces by a Ukrainian composer I'd never even heard of before, Viktor Stepanovych Kosenko (1896-1938). If it weren't for the adventuresome spirit of Toccata Classics' guiding light, Martin Anderson, I certainly never would have come across this music which has been in my player almost constantly since I got this CD a week or so ago. This has so often been the case for me with Toccata Classics releases that I've recently joined their 'Toccata Discovery Club'. One can explore and hear mp3 excerpts of all the tracks on the label's CDs at [...] The label specializes in worthy music not otherwise available on disc.Kosenko was himself a virtuoso pianist who began composing early in life. His 'Eleven Etudes in the Form of Old Dances, Op. 19', written in the late 1920s, is a collection of pieces using the dance forms familiar to us from the baroque -- gavotte, allemande, minuet, courante, sarabande, bourrée etc. They flow so nicely that one could think that they are predictable, but indeed none of them is; there are surprises, lovely ones, in every one of the études. Although they sound technically only moderately advanced, on closer listening one hears that they are not; they truly are studies that would pay the ambitious pianist's attention. They are unfailingly melodious, often with what we are told are Ukrainian folk-like melodies, sometimes making use of modal scales. The harmonic language is, for the most part, familiar from such composers as Tchaikovsky or early Scriabin, but occasionally one runs into jazz-inflected or impressionist harmonies, or Bach/Busoni baroqueries. Somehow this all fits together and sounds inevitable and 'right'.There is not space here to describe all eleven études. Some highlights: No. 1, a gavotte, is perky, sassy, and has a particularly gorgeous set of melodies. No. 6, a bourrée in A major, is virtually a two-part invention with parallel or contrary motion in both hands, and with a folk-tinged middle section in the corresponding minor key. No. 10, a passacaglia, is the longest étude, lasting over eighteen minutes. It consists of an eight-bar ground bass followed by thirty-eight variations and a coda. This étude sounds both Bachian and Tchaikovskian. It features a dizzying array of technical challenges including trills, octaves, dynamic contrasts, challenging pedaling and variations in touch and rhythm. An impressive work. The set concludes with hyperlegato presto gigue in sonata form, a virtual perpetuum mobile.Natalya Shkoda, the marvelous pianist on this disc, is herself a Ukrainian currently living in Texas. She makes a convincing advocate for this wonderful music. We are told this is 'Volume 1' of Kosenko's piano music and I for one am eager to hear more.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14J3WC1YQBD1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099D6YRC#wasThisHelpful","R14J3WC1YQBD1C","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rossini's Petite Messe Solennelle was a late work -- he called it 'the last mortal sin of my old age' -- and is a quirky thing. Scored originally for two pianos and harmonium -- this recording seems to use one piano and harmonium, however -- it was premièred in a private home and has had a strange trajectory ever since. Unlike the roughly contemporaneous 'Stabat Mater', which is scored for full orchestra, full chorus and operatic soloists and is sometimes called 'Rossini's last opera', this is a delicate piece that requires a chorus of only twelve singers of whom four double as soloists.This performance recorded in Tallinn, Estonia, simply won't do. The soloists are, in a word, weak, and although the massed twelve voices can make a pretty sound, they don't really measure up to earlier recordings. Frankly they sound like amateurs much of the time. The tenor soloist in the 'Quoniam' is painful to hear. And so on.There is a budget price twofer that couples the Messe with the Stabat Mater and features the likes of Ruggero  Raimondi (who, however, was not in his best voice) in the Messe, and Pavarotti in the Stabat Mater's 'Cujus animam' that must be heard to be believed, it's so good.Skip this one.Scott Morrison","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJBGUG2CG1EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDCPBJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1RJBGUG2CG1EC","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"John Barbirolli included Haydn symphonies in many of his concerts throughout his long career. The very first one he ever recorded -- in 1949 with the Hallé orchestra, which he led for more than twenty-five years -- was Haydn's Symphony No. 83, called 'The Hen' for the clucking sounds in the first movement's second subject. The present recording was made in 1969 in a live concert of the SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden, one of the really good radio symphonies in the Germany of the time. Strangely he uses the first movement exposition repeat in the finale but not in the first movement; perhaps this was the practice at the time. I actually wanted to hear that first movement repeat because of Barbirolli's delicious shaping of the music. Although Barbirolli is known primarily as a 'romantic' conductor, there is little indication of that in his classically proportioned Haydn. True, he uses a larger orchestra than we hear these days in concert, but the playing of the SWR is delicate yet spirited.The Hallé had given the very first English performance of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique in 1879 and when Barbirolli conducted it with them the first time, in 1933, older members of the orchestra remembered the approach of Sir Charles Hallé, the conductor of the first and subsequent performances. Hallé had been friends with Berlioz in Paris. Over the years Barbirolli conducted the Symphonie many times and often programmed it on celebratory occasions as when the Hallé moved into their new Free Trade Hall in Manchester in 1951. He had recorded it twice before this live performance was recorded, also in 1968. To say that this is an emotionally intense performance is more than just. Even in the slow (and in other hands sometimes boring) third movement, Scène aux champs, we are wrung out. The Marche au supplice actually comes almost as a relief until we then realize that this is the March to the Guillotine with its attendant horror . The finale, 'Songe d'une nuit du Sabbat', builds to an almost unbearably febrile temperature. This is a great reading of this great symphony.Recorded sound is quite good. I was not really aware of its age, now 40-odd years. Those bells in the fifth movement of the Symphonie are startling in their lifelike sound.This is not just a recording for Barbirolli fans. It's for everyone who loves this music.Recommended.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKGCRGAG150T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5NXR3U#wasThisHelpful","R1NKGCRGAG150T","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had mixed feelings about this recording before I listened to it. On the one hand, I love the music -- and as a pianist have played two of the three pieces on the CD -- and on the other I was a little unsettled at the notion of these pieces being played by a wind quintet. I ordinarily like transcriptions and arrangements, often finding things in a piece when it is presented in different instrumental garb. But particularly with the String Quartet the differences in tone quality are striking, even alarming. And then there is slight confusion with the name of the ensemble; one of my favorite recordings of the Ravel String Quartet is by the Orlando String Quartet, but this one is by the Orlando Wind Quintet.Indeed the String Quartet is the piece that is hardest to accept initially. But after a couple of hearings it grew on me. True, there is nothing like a string quartet playing softly diaphanous passages, but amazingly the Orlando Quintet manages to achieve something similar in appropriate spots. And one gasps at the virtuosity in spots, as in the helter-skelter final movement where these Dutch wind players astonish. The arrangements of the String Quartet and of the Mother Goose Suite that follows are by Mark Popkin, a noted bassoonist and arranger (and physicist!) who was based in North Carolina and who, alas, died not long after these arrangements were made.The Mother Goose Suite (Ma mère l'oye) exists in two forms made by Ravel, the original for piano four-hands and the subsequent arrangement for orchestra. Since winds play a dominant part in the orchestral sound-world of the Suite, it is not such a far cry for the entire thing to be played by winds and indeed one can sometimes forget, when listening to it, that one is not hearing the original. As in the String Quartet, the Orlando Quintet play like the masters they are. In fact, I'm impressed enough that I want to name these five Dutch musicians, who are all orchestral players and teachers in various parts of the Netherlands: Marieke Schneemann (flute), Pauline Oostenrijk (oboe), Lars Wouters van den Oudenweijer (clarinet), Bram van Sambeek (bassoon), and Ron Schaaper (horn).The final piece is a joyous performance of the three-movement Sonatine, originally for solo piano. This arrangement was made in 1989 by another American arranger, now-86-year-old Wayne Peterson, a distinguished composer long at the San Francisco State University and recipient of the 1982 Pulitzer Prize in music for his orchestral work 'The Face of the Night, The Heart of the Dark'. Completely sympathetic to the qualities of the wind quintet sound, the arrangement is brilliant, and brilliantly played.The booklet notes include charming paragraphs written by each of the musicians. Unfortunately, other than their names there is nothing about the arrangers, hence my comments in this review.As I sometimes say, I like this CD enough that I have put it on my iPod, one of my highest accolades.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0PGUB5ORD19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9K3Y04#wasThisHelpful","R3M0PGUB5ORD19","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"'Herr Feska ist ganz Herr und Meister über das, was er auszusprechen unternimmt.' ('Herr Fesca is entirely lord and master of what he undertakes to express') -- Carl Maria von WeberFriedrich Ernst Fesca (1789-1826) was a German composer and violinist who was enormously popular in his day. His quartets come after those of Haydn and Mozart (and to which they owe a debt) and before the later quartets of Beethoven (and before those quartets overcame their early non-acceptance by the quartet-loving public). So for a period of perhaps thirty years Fesca's quartets were among the most-played in Germany and Austria. But after Beethoven's late quartets and those of Schubert, Mendelssohn and Schumann became fixtures of the repertoire, those of Fesca lapsed into obscurity. And there they have remained. I had never heard any of them before, either in concert or on recording. This disc, the first of two planned by the Diogenes Quartet and the cpo label, is a revelation. These are marvelously constructed quartets that have immediately memorable themes and a generally serious import. This is not to say that there aren't humorous or witty moments, but overall these are works of convincing sincerity. Fesca wrote most of his quartets when he was quite young; he didn't live beyond age 37 when he died of what was probably tuberculosis. The first twelve of sixteen total were published in 1815 when he was 26, but there is speculation that he wrote the earliest of them while still in his teens.On this disc we hear Quartets Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13 & 15, plus a single movement 'Potpourri' which elaborates on a rondo theme found in the First Quartet. The quality of the writing is consistently expert and memorable throughout. There is clever manipulation of themes and, something not found in his Haydn/Mozart models, frequent modulations which remind one of Schubert at times. Although there are not the daring and sudden contrasts of later Beethoven there are a few spots where one gasps at Fesca's harmonic surprises.The Diogenes Quartet, whose Schubert quartet recording I reviewed earlier this year Schubert: Complete String Quartets, Vol. 1, are a Munich-based group whose reputation is growing at home and abroad. I have also reviewed their recording of string quintets by Cherubini and Onslow Cherubini/Onslow: String Quintets.Recommended.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FVWETRAMJ90R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB1EDR0#wasThisHelpful","R1FVWETRAMJ90R","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though I have played tons of four-hand music going all the way back to my earliest piano lessons, I had only ever played (or even heard) one of the three sonatas on this disc, Mozart's Grande Sonate in F Major, K. 497. It is an undeniable masterpiece and has been recorded any number of times before, most prominently by Ingrid Haebler and Ludwig Hoffmann Piano Duets / Mozart Edition 16 from 1971. This recording is easily the equal of that one and additionally is in impeccable modern sound. Although I had never heard of the Piano Duo Danhel-Kolb, they are a wonderful duo with absolute virtuosity and sensitive musicianship.The big surprise here, though, is what is on the remainder of the disc: four hand sonatas by Johann Baptist Cramer and by George Onslow.Cramer (1771-1858) was fifteen years younger than Mozart and outlived him by almost seventy years. His style is rather like Mozart's or early Beethoven. The Sonata in G Major dates from 1815 and has never been recorded before, which is a real shame; it is a true masterpiece. The first movement is a sprightly romp with sparkling fireworks that involve brilliant runs by the right hands of both players. The second movement is a theme and variations that juxtaposes variations in wildly differing styles and then concludes, oddly but effectively, with a chorale followed by two further variations and an extended coda. The finale, a rondo, is every bit as fun-filled as the first movement and Danhel-Kolb infuse it with their own joy at getting to play it. I cannot imagine why this work has never been recorded before but I'm certainly grateful for this performance. I think I've now listened to it about half a dozen times and it has gone on my iPod, too.George Onslow (1784-1853) was a Frenchman in spite of his name; his father was an Englishman living in France. His Second Sonata for Piano Duo was published in 1823 and sounds a good deal like middle-period Beethoven with a goodly amount of Sturm und Drang. (One could actually say the same about the Mozart sonata; it is one of the more dramatic of Mozart's piano works.) It is clearly advanced for its era in that there is a cyclic use of thematic material, similar to that in Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy written a year earlier. There is darkness and angst aplenty leavened with periods of lightheartedness and tender lyricism. The sonata is in four movements; the third movement Largo is actually a slow introduction the the Allegro finale. And in that movement there is Haydnesque humor along with heightened drama and dark foreboding that nevertheless ends with an exhilarating stretto.I could not ask any more of these performances. They are simply masterful.

"I agree with the previous review that Vincenzo Maltempo is a pianist with all the goods necessary for this marvelous, quirky, insanely difficult music. But since the onset of the Alkan renaissance forty-five years ago with recordings by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, there have followed incendiary CDs by Marc-André Hamelin and Jack Gibbons which set the bar so high that it is almost humanly impossible to equal or top them. And although Maltempo is a fine pianist, he misses the mark -- pace Ethan James McCollum -- precisely where ardor and understanding are most needed: in the mysteriously appealing Trois Morceaux. His playing in these odd pieces is dull. That said, his performance of Festin d'Ésope and the Sonatine is excellent, if still a little short of Hamelin's. As for the Ouverture (the eleventh of the minor key études), he again makes it dull when compared with Hamelin or Gibbons.Scott Morrison","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKUAB4ZP5N0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJLIMNY#wasThisHelpful","R2NKUAB4ZP5N0R","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lukas Geniusas is a 23-year-old Muscovite of Lithuanian background who has medaled in a number of international piano competitions including the Gina Bachauer in Salt Lake City (2nd place, 2003, at the age of 13). His father is pianist Petras Geniusas and his uncle is conductor Julius Geniusas. Apparently his musical genes (and a great deal of hard work) stand him in good stead because this recording of the Opp. 10 and 25 études by Chopin are really quite good. Clearly he has the fingers to negotiate the often very daunting intricacies of these works, but he also makes satisfying music of them as well, something that is not always done by young pianist firebrands. For instance, he plays the languidly lovely Op. 10, No. 3 in E Major stunningly. His playing is somewhere between the extremely polished approach of Murray Perahia Chopin: Etudes, Op. 10 & Op. 25 and the glittering first recording of of the Études by Augustin Anievas Augustin Anievas, Piano, Chopin: The 24 Etudes, Opp. 10 & 25. (Anievas has also recently re-recorded them at age 75 but I have not heard that version; it has garnered very good reviews.) The recording Maurizio Pollini made in his twenties is transcendent and impeccable but the sound is now dated Etudes.Given the recommendations I can say that Geniusas doesn't quite match the performances of his older colleagues but I'm glad I have it. It has given me several hours of intense pleasure.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37EKQDR79EM2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFSLL5Y#wasThisHelpful","R37EKQDR79EM2J","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To those who don't know of her, Janina Fialkowska is a 60ish Canadian pianist who was born and educated primarily in Montréal. She also studied in Paris with Yvonne Lefébure and in New York with Sasha Gorodnitski. In 1974 she won the Arthur Rubinstein competition in Israel. She has had a busy career but has not had the kind of enormous international acclaim that her musicianship deserves. I typically obtain just about everything she records and have heard her in recital a number of times. Her playing reminds me of that of Wilhelm Kempff in that it is unfailingly elegant, songful, often quieter than some more bombastic players (although she is perfectly capable of dramatic playing as well), and consistently apt. Her style is perfectly suited to these two Schubert piano sonatas which are among the most lyrical he wrote. (Not surprisingly she has also done a fair amount of collaborative work with singers of lieder.)These two sonatas -- No. 13 in A Major, D.664; and No. 18 in G Major, D.894 -- are among Schubert's loveliest and most popular. The fairly brief (18 minutes) No. 13 is unusually in three movements. It was written in the same year, 1819, as the composer's Trout Quintet and shares some of its happy pastoral quality. It was written when Schubert was in the Austrian countryside and one can imagine that the tranquility of that scenery influenced his writing. Fialkowska captures the peaceful atmosphere of the work as well as any pianist I've ever heard.No. 18 came nine years later and is in the usual four movements. Its first movement is nearly as long as the entire No. 13 but its mood is of a piece with the earlier sonata in that it never raises its voice, has long lyrical lines and conveys a sense of peace and contentment. The Andante begins in much the same mood but the second theme is stormy. The movement ends as it began. The Minuetto is in B minor and has an extraordinarily rapt Trio section that reminds one of Schubert's E flat piano trio. The finale is a Rondo in whose nave joy one hears echoes of 'Das Wandern' from Die Schöne Müllerin. Again, Fialkowska captures the loveliness, naïveté, joyfulness and songfulness of this marvelous sonata as well as I've ever heard it.This one is a winner.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D76VKM0XG2NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPRIYNO#wasThisHelpful","R1D76VKM0XG2NA","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charles Rosen recorded this Goldbergs in 1967 (issued in 1969) -- with the legendary producer Thomas Z. Shepard at the controls -- and it was a best-seller in its day, then on LP. I owned it and loved it but when we all converted to CDs I didn't seek out a CD reissue. I see that it was actually reissued on SONY Classical in 1992 Bach: Goldberg Variations BWV 988 / Charles Rosen but I never heard it in that version. Newton Classics seems to be reissuing worthwhile recordings these days and I have in fact never heard a bad performance from them.Charles Rosen (1927-2012) is not as well-known these days as he was several decades ago. And even then he was probably better known for his musicological writings, primary of which was his amazingly helpful 'The Classical Style' (1971) still a model of its type. But he was always sterling pianist and his performances and recordings always worth hearing.Rosen never performed the Goldberg Variations in recital and is quoted in George Hall's excellent liner notes as having said that it 'was meant for home study and could not be played as Bach would have intended except in solitude'. This is as may be, but it is also possible that Rosen realized that this monster of a piece is difficult to pull off in live performance, especially for a pianist even the least little bit nervous, as Rosen could be. And it says something that this recording was made over a period of a week, not in one or two or three 'takes'. This is no criticism because the variations, meant for a two-keyboard harpsichord, are a veritable bitch to play without the pianist's fingers tripping over each other. And of course each variation is complete in itself, thus made for this piecemeal recording process. In the end, though, this recording is one for the ages and has something to say that others do not. Rosen laid out the architecture of this amazingly cogent set of variations over a ground bass -- a giant chaconne, if you prefer -- with grace and sharply etched lines. There is no taffy-pulling or romantic mooning in this recording. Rosen plays it 'straight' but also makes poetry of its structure. All the lines are crystal clear without the idiosyncratic staccato playing one hears from Gould and his imitators. Recorded sound is exemplary.This recording is definitely one for lovers of the Goldbergs and also for those coming to them anew.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEKHMGMS5EQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMN5IMW#wasThisHelpful","R2UEKHMGMS5EQW","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm of that generation that was hit between the eyes by the 1955 Glenn Gould recording of the Goldbergs and I've been collecting recordings ever since. Last time I counted I had more than twenty-five. As well, I've played it on the piano for my own edification and amusement. For a number of years I've owned a CD of the two-piano elaboration of the Goldbergs by Josef Rheinberger, revised by Max Reger, played by the French team of Stephan Paulello and Gérard Marie Fallour, and recently pulled it out to give it a listen, for comparison with this recording.A word about the elaboration of the hallowed Goldbergs. Unlike Robin Holloway's complete rewriting of the Variations, Gilded Goldbergs Gilded Goldbergs, this version sticks pretty much to Bach's original except that there are many additions of countermelodies, doubled octaves, displaced octaves and the like. One never feels, though, that Bach is being desecrated, but rather that this version is a loving enlargement of the original, and always done with charm and lightness. One of the odd things about it is that Rheinberger/Reger calls for no ornaments; this is likely due to the Bach performance practices of the late 19th/early 20th century. Appoggiaturas are played before the beat, which sounds quaint to modern ears, and there are so many missing ornaments that the Aria almost sounds like a new melody. The duo pianists Luis Magalhães and Nina Schumann, a married couple who met when studying with Vladimir Viardo at North Texas State University, have concertized all over the world and currently teach at a university in Stellenbosch, South Africa. They play and breathe as one. Compared to the version by Paulello and Fallour, their playing has more brilliance and fire. I have not heard any other recordings of the Rheinberger/Reger and thus cannot compared this one with those.If you know the Goldbergs and perhaps own several recordings, this one is for you. I would not advise that it be the first Goldbergs recording one owns but it adds to one's enjoyment of the original if you already know it.Enthusiastically recommended for the target audience.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76F0H834OSPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDWCPWW#wasThisHelpful","R76F0H834OSPW","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second of a two-volume set of all of Dvorák's chamber works. This volume contains seven CDs, most of them in excellent performances. And it contains works you are not likely to have heard before, e.g., arrangements of several Slavonic Dances for either violin and piano, or cello and piano. The musicians on both Volume I and II are all Czech, and that makes some difference, I think, in how the music is played. Having grown up in a Czech-speaking community in America where my first exposure to Bohemian music was with Czech-speaking musicians, I can confidently state that the musicians here 'speak the language', and I take issue with the review of Volume I that was given a one star rating. There are, however, some quibbles with the present box, largely in the first two CDs which contains all of Dvorák's piano trios (including the familiar 'Dumky' Trio); namely, there are some minor intonation problems, primarily with the violinist. But otherwise those trio performances are good and particularly good is the piano playing of Ivan Klánský, an underappreciated Czech pianist.When we get to the violin-and-piano works, we are in wonderful territory, and particularly so when the great Czech violinist Josef Suk (himself the grandson of composer Josef Suk who was Dvorák's pupil and son-in-law) plays in various of the pieces. These, along with some cello-and-piano works, take up CDs 3 & 4. Particularly delightful is Suk and Josef Hála's performance of the Mazurek in E Minor, Op. 49. We also hear Suk and Hála playing Dvorák's rarely-heard Violin Sonata and the late Sonatina for Violin and Piano, Op. 100. Also outstanding on CD 4 is 'Silent Woods' played by cellist Michal Kanka and pianist Jaromir Klepác; Silent Woods is usually heard in its original piano four-hand version (part of 'From the Bohemian Forest'); later, on CD 7 we hear the four-hand version. In truth, I think I prefer the cello-piano version.CD5 contains works for various combinations of instruments but alway including strings. I've always been charmed by the 'Bagatelles' for two violins, cello and (unusually) harmonium. They have such a homey feeling and yet are both melodic and stirring. The 'Terzetto' for two violins and viola gets played in recital occasionally and I remember a barn-burning performance by, I recall, Itzhak Perlman, Anne Akiko Meyer, violins, and Pinchas Zukerman, viola,  I heard years ago at the Aspen Music Festival. I fell in love with it then and eventually bought a version with members of the now-disbanded Lindsay Quartet. The Terzetto's sibling, written only a year later in 1875, is the 'Miniatures' for two violins and viola, a suite of four romantic, melodic pieces. Suk is also heard in all the works mentioned so far on CD5. The CD is rounded out with smaller works including the Serenade that features flute, violin, viola and triangle (!).CDs 6 & 7 contain music for piano four-hands played by the redoubtable Czech duo,  married couple Igor Ardasev and Renata Ardasevová. CD 6 contains both sets of Slavonic Dances. These are the works that are often compared to Brahms's Hungarian Dances, but they are completely Bohemian and brim with the dance rhythms and melodic contours of Bohemian folk music. (Some of the first music I ever played in public was a couple of these dances that I played (badly) with my teacher when I was perhaps nine years old.) CD 7 contains the previously mentioned 'From the Bohemian Forest' and it concludes with 'Legends'. These are pièces caractéristiques that are Bohemian to their core. I think these performances are the equal of the better known recordings by Silka-Thora Matthies and Christian Köhn 4 Hand Piano Music 1.I would recommend this box-set to anyone who loves Dvorák and who wants to become familiar with more of his rarer pieces. I was particularly taken by the four-hand and the violin-piano performances, but all of the rest are worth consideration even for the occasional intonation problem on CD1 and, almost certainly only on my set, a slight tracking glitch on CD2.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R745OTJAEB8AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQF1WSU#wasThisHelpful","R745OTJAEB8AX","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To the degree that French composer André Caplet (1878-1925) is remembered today it is as an orchestrator of some of Debussy's works (Le Martyre de Saint Sébastien, among others) and the constructor of piano reductions of French orchestral music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But he was a talented composer in his own right although not much of his music is heard these days outside France. This disc comprises several of his chamber works for wind instruments and every one of them is worth hearing in these excellent performances by the Ensemble Initium, a Parisian wind group founded at the Paris Conservatoire in 2005. They are joined in some of the works by pianist Laurent Wagschal and the string quartet Quatuor Ardeo.The first set of pieces is the unusual 'Suite Persane', three movements based supposedly on Persian music. In fact they don't sound much like Persian music at all although they do use modal scales and harmonies and definitely do have a 'foreign' or 'oriental' sound. The three movements also have titles -- Sharki, Mihawend, and Iskia samaisi -- that are fake Persian words. Sharki begins with flutes and clarinets (joined later by the bassoons) playing a striking long unharmonized melody that is immediately recognizable as 'oriental'. It is subjected to a loose kind of counterpoint in a vaguely developmental section before a short recapitulation. Mihawend has a longing, somehow nostalgic sounding melody played by flute reharmonized several times followed by a section that sounds more like music-hall Paris than Teheran. It concludes with a return of the opening section. The longest movement, Iskia Samaisi, is strongly modal and begins with dramatic flute and clarinet skittering before devolving into a dance-like section. Then comes a fanfare in a whole-tone scale that leads to a dirge-like section before a development section which in turn leads to the first theme with the fanfare melody as counterpoint. The coda is an uplifting ending to this strangely hypnotic suite of pieces.'Two Pieces' for flute and piano was written for the French master flutist, Georges Barrère, who was probably the most celebrated flutist of his day. Barrère and Caplet were close and collaborated with each other a number of times. This is the earliest (1897) of the pieces on the CD and sounds slightly generic when compared to the later pieces by Caplet. Nonetheless the two pieces -- Réverie and Petite valse -- are quintessentially impressionistic works. One hears echoes of 'Afternoon of a Faun', for instance.'Legend', a 13-minute piece originally written for saxophone and orchestra, exists in a version for a nonet consisting of soprano saxophone, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and string quintet and that is the version heard here. It is mostly dreamy, Debussyan. The saxophone is treated as a solo instrument -- reflecting its commission in 1904 by a rich American woman who had taken up the saxophone. There is a lively second section featuring syncopation (proto-ragtime, just then becoming popular in Europe) which then returns to a closing section reminiscent but not a repeat of the opening measures. The piece ends pianissimo, tentative, tender, melancholy.The longest work here, by far, is the 22-minute four-movement 'Quintet' for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and piano which was commissioned by Barrère and premièred in 1898. The first movement, Allegro, opens with an immediately memorable first theme that recurs as this is a fairly classical sonata-allegro. Unusually there is a secion for solo piano (handled brilliantly by Wagschal). The Adagio opens with a bell-like motif in the piano before reaching the main theme which is, in the words of the booklet's excellent note-writer Jacques Tchamkerton, 'simple and painful'. The two themes are then combined contrapuntally in a two part canon. The Scherzo is based on a lively dotted-rhythm theme that has the piano and flute chasing each other. The second section features rippling piano arpeggios and then is followed by a conclusion in which the piano and flute chase each other in reverse order from that of the opening. The finale, Allegro con fuoco, is bithematic, opening with scintillating piano chords under a unison flute and clarinet declaration. The second section features a charming French-sounding melody then interrupted by furious repetitions of the opening rhythms. There is a development section, brief but intriguing, and the work then concludes, after a short elegiac section, with a return of the original rhythms but with considerably altered thematic elements. A bracing conclusion to a masterful work.The music here is probably new to most people reading this review but it is definitely worth hearing and as I said above, particularly by wind players and lovers of French music from the Impressionist period.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZ94APIQWKP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOV4FQ4#wasThisHelpful","R3FZ94APIQWKP7","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of us have heard various of the popular wind pieces by Anton Reicha (1770-1836), a contemporary and friend of Beethovne, but you've never heard any of his string quartets unless you've played in one yourself or have had friends who did. That's because these wonderful works have never been recorded before. This is an example of how set in stone our notion of the classical canon is. Yet, from reviewing thousands of CDs over the past fifteen years, I've learned that there are many masterpieces that simply never get heard. It is to the credit of the Kreutzer Quartet and Toccata Classics that we are beginning to hear Reicha's quartets. This disc is marked 'Volume One'. Since Reicha wrote about forty quartets, we have much to look forward to. This CD contains the first two of Reicha's eight 'Viennese quartets', written between 1802 and 1805. Although modeled to some extent on Beethoven's familiar Op. 18 quartets, they veer off into undreamed of directions, at times sounding like late Beethoven twenty years before there was any late Beethoven. One can only imagine how listeners in the first decade of the 19th century must have scratched their heads at this music. They were, however, published by the redoubtable Breitkopf und Härtel, thankfully, and have come down to us more or less unheard till now.Reicha was a Bohemian born in Prague; the name was originally Rejcha. His father died when he was a baby and he went from relative to relative, eventually arriving at the home of his uncle Josef Reicha, himself a composer and cellist who wound up in the orchestra in Bonn where young Anton was a schoolmate of Beethoven. He lived for a time in Hamburg and then in Paris, before going to Vienna, and during those pre-Viennese years he wrote about fifteen string quartets, none of them found to have been published. From 1808 he lived in Paris again, a fixture as a composer, musicologist and teacher. During his Paris years his music became more and more conservative just as Beethoven's was got more daring. He was known primarily after his death as the author of a couple of books, Traité de mélodie and Traité de haute composition musicale.The two quartets on this disc are astounding in their daring. Although Op. 48, No. 1 opens in a Mozartean mode, with limpid melodies and harmonies, there follow some remarkable passages, as in the two-voice polyphony that has first violin and viola playing one line an octave apart while the second violin and cello play the other line an octave apart. This creates a sense of spaciousness I don't recall ever hearing before in a quartet. There is a mosaic of melodies in this movement whose relationships become more complex and absolutely delicious over the course of the movement. The second movement, Adagio, opens serenely but devolves into a storm of passion toward the end of which the calmness of the opening passage discreetly tiptoes back in. There is more tiptoeing in the skittery Minuet that leads directly into the concluding presto Finale that whirls away all care.The second quartet, Op. 48, NO. 2, in G Major is compared by the brilliant note-writer, Ron Drummond, to the G Major Quartet of Beethoven's Op. 18 only to indicate that it ranges further harmonically and has more complex thematic interconnections. Of the modern première of the quartet (in 2006 by the Coull String Quartet in Cambridge UK) Drummond wrote 'Reicha's G major quartet is elegant and witty, full of such exuberantly effortless invention that it sounds simultaneously familiar and brand new, familiar because melodically tuneful, new because frequently surprising'. Drummond says he at first found the slow movement (II, a set of variations) 'boring' when he first read through it with an informal group six years earlier, but in the Coull performance he found it stately and immensely varied in timbre, texture and accompaniment. The following Minuet is a joyful thing, full of pranks and capering bordering on the bizarre at times. Nothing Haydn or Mozart wrote comes close to the lovable weirdness of this movement. The Finale brings us back to earth with a pastoral lyricism, an almost naïve simplicity that rounds out this magnificent quartet.The Kreutzer Quartet is made up of violinists Peter Sheppard Skaerved and Mihailo Trandafilovski, violist Morgan Goff, and cellist Neil Heyde. Skaerved, known to me previously from his marvelous recording of George Rochberg's titanic 'Caprice Variations' Caprice Variations, Violin Sonata George Rochberg writes, in addition to Drummond's scholarly notes, a long 'The Reicha Quartets From Where We Sit' in which he speaks of the almost unheard of opportunity to work on a masterpiece more than two hundred years old that has no extant performance tradition.These performances of these undoubted masterpieces have made my week so much richer and fuller than they otherwise might have been. Thank you Kreutzers, Drummond and most of all Anton Reicha.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15AY3M79X6HPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLFYWCO#wasThisHelpful","R15AY3M79X6HPV","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are those who avoid the music of Taneyev because they've been told by the experts that he is an academic composer who can't write an attractive melody and who uses too much fustian counterpoint. That's all wrong, of course. There is plenty of gorgeous music in Taneyev's canon and these two quartets give credence to that assertion.The big surprise here is that the early Taneyev quartet, numbered No. 7 because it was not published in his lifetime and thus is numbered to follow his previously published six quartets, is the most immediately attractive of the two on this disc. He wrote it when he was 24 and studying in Paris. In a letter to his mentor Tchaikovsky he said he had been studying the quartets of Mozart and Beethoven and was following some of their compositional precepts. And indeed the quartet sounds in spots like late Beethoven but just when one settles into that assumption along comes a quintessentially Russian tune that reminds us that this is a Western-leaning Russian composer who lives in both worlds. The opening movement of this Seventh Quartet is a monster -- thirteen minutes -- that uses such classical devices as complex counterpoint, including a four-voice canon, as well as occurrence of thematic inversion but which is songful and formally satisfying. Harmonically it is more advanced than Beethoven but not as chromatic as Wagner. The movement is followed by the heart of the quartet, an Adagio cantabile that is lyrical and deeply felt. There is considerable chordal writing as well as the expected polyphony. The Scherzo has a slow introduction before launching into a rhythmically vigorous main section in triple time, a tarantella. From then on the slow and fast sections alternate and it ends on a serene note. The Finale, Allegro molto, is marked by good humor and sly use of canonic gestures.The Fifth Quartet in A Major, Op. 13, was written in 1903, twenty-three years after the Seventh. Taneyev's style had matured into even greater mastery but this particular quartet intentionally partakes of Haydnesque lightness both in its geniality and brevity, lasting only 24 minutes as compared to the 38 minutes of the Seventh. The first movement, Allegro con spirito, is highly syncopated and has terse dramatic interjections alternating with dancelike sections. The Adagio espressivo is an angst-ridden cri du coeur followed by the Allegro molto third movement with whimsical syncopations that wipe away any melancholy. This short movement leads into the finale, Presto, which continues the upbeat, playful mood often pitting pithy motifs from the viola and cello against flowing lines in the two violins. The whole thing concludes with exuberant high spirits.The Carpe Diem Quartet is a young group founded in the mid-2000s and has already had several personnel changes. But they sound to be a mature, musically secure group who are apt promoters of this repertoire that is not so well-known in the West. For some reason the recording by this Ohio-based quartet was made in a studio in Boise, Idaho. The sonics are excellent.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OP26BLV2UH3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2K1ZQS#wasThisHelpful","R2OP26BLV2UH3O","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD contains two transcriptions for solo piano of works originally written for other instruments: the Violin Sonata in A Major, transcribed by Alfred Cortot, and the Prelude, Fugue and Variation, Op. 18, for organ, transcribed for piano by Harold Bauer. It also contains what is probably Franck's most important work written for solo piano, the Prelude, Chorale and Fugue.First the transcriptions:The notes claim that Alfred Cortot's transcription of Franck's Violin Sonata is presented here in its first recording, but this is not so; it was recorded previously by Alexander Paley on the Marco Polo label Piano Transcriptions. Indeed, the Paley CD contains all the music on this CD, plus the Pastorale, Op. 19. But I must say that the performances recorded here are the equal of those by Paley.That said, I find that I prefer the Violin and Piano version of the Violin Sonata. I miss the contrast of the two instruments, particularly in that marvelous canonic last movement. One can admire Cortot's arrangement for its cleverness but still wish to hear the original.On the other hand I really love the piano version of the organ original of the Prelude, Fugue and Variation. This is, to me, one of Franck's greatest, most lyrical works and it does not suffer from being played on the potentially percussive piano; Codispoti makes sure that the thing sings throughout.The Prelude, Chorale and Fugue is monumental, one of Franck's greatest works, and it has been recorded with great mastery and musicianship by pianists such as Murray Perahia, Yevgeny Kissin, Aldo Ciccolini, Sviatoslav Richter, Ashley Wass, Shura Cherkassky and Julius Katchen. My favorite of all these is Perahia, with Katchen a close second. But Codispoti's performance is very nearly as good as those of these other great pianists. I had never heard of Codispoti but his unfailingly beautiful tone and sensitively modulated dynamics and legato stand him in good stead.So, although there are other recordings as good or a little better than these, this is a worthwhile entry from the enterprising Piano Classics label. One quibble: the notes by Francesco Antonioni and the bio of pianist Codispoti are PRINTED ALL IN CAPITALS, making it is very difficult to read them.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R344RCN1ZMK2VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BR0A9KI#wasThisHelpful","R344RCN1ZMK2VC","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems odd, and fortuitous, that this set of three CDs from the Brilliant label -- that marvelous reissuer of worthwhile recordings at marvelously low prices -- is the label's second set of the complete chamber music of Edvard Grieg (1843-1907). The first, released in 2004, featured members of the Raphael Quartet and others Complete Chamber Music and has been positively reviewed here at Amazon, where it is still available. With the exception of the cello sonata, recorded in 1980, the performances were recorded in the 1990s. The performances on this set are by members of the Moscow Trio (Alexander Bonduriansky, piano; Vladimir Ivanov, violin; and Mikhail Utkin, cello), as well as by Alexander Vinnitsky, violin; Vladimir Ovchinnikov, piano; Alexander Rudin, cello; Vladimir Skanavi, piano; and by a string quartet made up of Alexander Tchernov and Irina Popova, violins; Igor Boguslavsky, viola; and Alexander Rudin, cello. The present recordings were made at the Moscow Conservatory in 1991. So these two sets are roughly contemporaneous and feature mostly Russian or Slavic performers. I wonder if this is because Grieg's often neglected chamber works continued to have a life in the concerts of Russian and the former Soviet Union that they don't in the West.CD1: The Violin Sonata No. 1 in F, Op. 8 (1865) is a very early effort by Grieg and is mostly pastoral with some Norwegian folklike elements. The Second Violin Sonata in G, Op. 13 (1867) is considerably more dramatic, even somber, than the First. Its second movement is notable for the delicacy and richness of its ornamentation. Its finale is a springdans, a Norwegian leaping dance for men; its rhythms are invigorating. The CD concludes with the single movement, Andante con moto, for piano trio (1878) that was probably slated to be part of a complete piano trio that was never finished.CD2: Violin Sonata No. 3 in C Minor, Op. 45 (1886-87) features much of what we come to think of as Grieg's lyrical gift. Its form is very much akin to that of sonatas by Beethoven or Brahms; its architecture is easily grasped. Its second movement has a particularly lovely long-limbed cantilena that is played by piano alone for 40-odd measures and then joined by the violin for another 40-odd measures. After a brief intermezzo, the movement ends with the violin playing the melody and the piano accompanying with triplet figures. The finale features two unrelated themes that are never really developed but alternated in various guises. The Cello Sonata in A Minor, Op. 36 (1883) was probably written for Grieg's cellist brother John. It opens with a restless piano accompanying a dramatic yet lyrical cello part. The andante second movement borrows a theme from Grieg's incidental music for 'Sigurd Jorsalfar' written ten years earlier. The sonata ends with a heroic finale with much marcato and insistent rhythms.CD3: String Quartet No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 27 (1877-78) is Grieg's only completed string quartet. He wrote a colleague that it 'is not meant for the general public. It aims for breadth, for vehemence, and above all a powerful sound torn from the instruments for which it is designed'. He goes on to say that he had a great deal of trouble with the quartet, struggling over bringing its form into shape. He comments that he had difficulty staying away from his 'weakness for popular styles'. That said, this is a powerful work and yet has oddities. For instance, there are long passages that don't use all four instruments. The second movement departs from the use of counterpoint commonly used in string quartets; rather it is largely homophonic. It is surpassingly beautiful and played wonderfully here. The third movement largely features a concertante part for the first violin. After a slow introduction, the finale is a saltarello (similar in rhythm to the finale of Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony). The set concludes with two movements from Grieg's uncompleted Second String Quartet. It was subsequently completed by his friend, Julius Röntgen, but we are given only the two movmeents that Grieg had virtually finished. The first movement uses Hardanger fiddle figurations -- the Hardanger fiddle is a Norwegian folk instrument with a tuning that is completely different from the usual violin tuning -- and the second movement is another lively 2/4 springdans.I have not heard the 2004 Brilliant set, so I cannot compare the performances. I will note that the earlier set uses Röntgen's four-movement completion of the Second String Quartet. But I am mostly satisfied with this set. I will have to get the other set and make a comparison one of these days. For now, I'm content to listen to this set repeatedly.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXTFRREDPY8KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BX2JMYY#wasThisHelpful","RXTFRREDPY8KX","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, let me say that I have a perhaps overly enthusiastic response to piano transcriptions of orchestral music; blame it on my past as a pianist who loved playing orchestral arrangements at my own piano. Tchaikovsky asked for friends and colleagues of his to make these transcriptions and without exception they are wonderful.The musicians who made these transcriptions were Paul Pabst, Alexander Siloti, Percy Grainger and Nikolai Kashkin. All four of had close connections with each other and with Tchaikovsky. Pabst (1854-1897) was a favorite of Tchaikovsky, who described him as a 'divinely blessed pianist'. Pabst's brother Louis, also a pianist and composer, emigrated to Australia where he was an early mentor of the brilliant Aussie pianist/composer Percy Grainger (1882-1961). Alexander Siloti (1963-1945) was a first cousin of Rachmaninov (and his teacher) and had studied harmony at the Moscow Conservatory under Tchaikovsky. The least-known of the transcribers is Nikolai Kashkin (1839-1920); he was on the faculty of the Moscow Conservatory alongside Tchaikovsky.The four transcriptions or arrangements:1. Concert Paraphrase on 'The Sleeping Beauty', by Paul Pabst. This seven-minute piece collects various of the themes from the evening-long 'Sleeping Beauty' ballet. Unlike the following transcription which limits itself to the ballet's Third Act, Pabst's work uses themes from the whole thing. It is a work of surpassing virtuosity and is played as if child's play by Anthony Goldstone, one of England's finest pianists. It is of note that Pabst also made paraphrases of the operas 'Eugene Onegin', 'Mazeppa' and 'The Queen of Spades'. It seems likely that Goldstone, who has already recorded other transcriptions of Tchaikovsky's orchestral music Vol. 1-Tchaikovsky: Rare Transcriptions & Paraphra, will get around to these one day. One hopes so. 7:142. 'The Sleeping Beauty' - Act III, by Alexander Siloti. This is the whole act -- 23 sections -- arranged for piano. It is hard to imagine that this arrangement, though, is the one that ballet companies would use for rehearsals as it, too, is virtuosic and would take an exceptional rehearsal pianist. Again, Goldstone stars. I particularly liked the third variation of the Pas de quatre, the one in 5/8 time followed by the delicious fourth variation. Of course anyone who has ever heard or seen 'The Sleeping Beauty' will know many of these sections. 48:553. Paraphrase on the Waltz of the Flowers from 'The Nutcracker', by Percy Grainger. Grainger really goes to town here, adding all sorts of harmonic twists and filigree. One can admire Grainger's creativity , and yet one comes away with even more admiration for Tchaikovsky's own creation. This is undoubtedly the most difficult of the pieces recorded here. Goldstone does it proud. 7:274. Act I Pas de trois from 'Swan Lake', by Nikolai Kashkin. This scene occurs early in the ballet and has one man and two woman dancing together and separately at a birthday party (just before the appearance of the swans). It is in six sections; my favorite is section two which has a haunting melody imitated one bar later one octave lower. The Pas de trois has a lively finish that makes a wonderful finish for this wonderful disc.Many of you know the orchestral originals but if you have any curiosity about these transcriptions or paraphrases you couldn't do better than getting this disc by Anthony Goldstone. He is not as well known in the US as he should be but he has made a number of terrific recordings which are available here at Amazon.com, e.g. Inspiration: Homage to Maria Curcio (Maria Curcio was Goldtone's teacher), Russian Piano Music Volume 5. He has also recorded extensively with his duo-piano partner and wife Caroline Clemmow, e.g. Schubert: The Unauthorised Piano DuetsRecommended.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M80PRQ228WYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5S2DOK#wasThisHelpful","R2M80PRQ228WYH","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I owned these recordings back in the 1970s but can no longer play those LPs (although I still have them) because I don't have a turntable any longer. So when I saw that this set was coming out in a 2CD set on the adventurous Newton Classics label -- they release really good recordings from the past; I've never gotten a bad one -- I knew I would have to have it.This is the Juilliard Quartet as it was composed for so many years: Robert Mann and Earl Carlyss, violins; Samuel Rhodes, viola; and Joel Krosnick, cello. It was/is the best version of the Juilliards ever. Some would say that when Claus Adam was the cellist it was better, but I've always loved Krosnick's tone better. At any rate, this group own these last quartets of Mozart. The style is perfect, there is a sense of spontaneity even though one knows that the Quartet rehearsed them meticulously. One always had that feeling with the Juilliards, no matter what they played.These performances, comprising Quartets No. 20-23, are contained on two CDs with a total time of about 105 minutes. Recorded in 1974, they were models of recorded sound and that sound has not been meddled with in this re-issue. I even like the cover image, a painting of sunset at Lake George (near where I live).If you're in the market for the last four quartets by Mozart, this is your best choice in my opinion.

"'Ibéria' by Isaac Albéniz is at the pinnacle of virtuosic Spanish piano music. It has attracted the talents of many intrepid pianists and has been recorded a number of times. The classic recordings were, and still are, the two by Alicia de Larrocha (from 1960 and 1972), which are available in a number of different iterations: Albeniz: Iberia or Albéniz: Iberia / Granados: Goyescas. This is music that de Larrocha owns. But there have also been marvelous readings by some others: Marc-André Hamelin Albeniz: Iberia / Vega / Yvonne en Visite / Navarra, the first two books (there are four) by Daniel Barenboim Albéniz: Iberia Book 1 &2 - Espana / Barenboim, and on the budget Naxos label by Guillermo Gonzalez Albeniz: Iberia Books 1-4 / Suite Espanolas 1 & 2. That said, this two-disc set by Paul Verona has some virtues but overall it's kind of dull; he tends to linger, presumably to savor the poetry of the music, but he doesn't convey the long lines of the music. There is also some smudging in the faster passages (as in Fte-Dieu à Seville, in the first book).Stick with de Larrocha or Hamelin or, if money is an issue, with Gonzalez. Avoid one I didn't mention, that by Rosa Torres-Pardo; it's rather like Verona's: dull.Scott Morrison","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YC3XEYGATJBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ5IQ3Q#wasThisHelpful","R1YC3XEYGATJBS","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[This review was written for the 2013 reissue on Newton Classics of this recording originally on Sony.]This CD was originally issued in 1998. It was recorded by Yefim Bronfman in the legendary acoustics of the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall in Troy, New York, a site used for many extraordinary recordings. Its sonics are exemplary.'The Seasons' by Tchaikovsky was written for amateur pianists. It appeared month by month in a Russian periodical. It is likely that, although the music IS Tchaikovsky after all, the composer didn't take it terribly seriously. Indeed the legend is that an assistant had to remind him each month to toss another installment. The works are pleasant and in some cases quite beautiful -- for instance, the luscious piece for June, 'Barcarolle', which sometimes figures as an encore in piano recitals. The music is played with finesse and a gentle touch by Bronfman. He resists any temptation to make these pieces more virtuosic than they actually are. However,my own favorite recording of 'The Seasons' by by Lydia Artimiw but alas it is no longer easily available.Balakirev's 'Islamey', however, is a virtuosic barn-burner; it used to be said that it is one of the hardest pieces for any pianist to play. That is actually hardly the case but it does take a virtuoso like Bronfman to play it well even though these days it seems every young pianist plays it. I've heard it played gorgeously, as here, but sometimes with a trudging dutifulness, making it difficult to hear. This 'Oriental Fantasy' takes a little less than nine minutes to play. And it has been recorded beautifully by other pianists. Strangely, my favorite version of 'Islamey' is a recording made in 1926 (!) by the young Claudio Arrau, available on one of his 'Great Pianists of the 20th Century' volumes. Another unlikely recommendation comes from that quintessential Brahms pianist, Julius Katchen, who played the bejeezus out of 'Islamey' on HIS Great Pianists volume 1.A drawback of this recording is its short timing, only ca. 50 minutes.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T6735OJ8P92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000D9Y0#wasThisHelpful","R25T6735OJ8P92","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The music on this disc is quintessential late Romantic chamber music, all of it springing from the influence of Brahms. For me at least, this is comfort music, like fresh hot rolls or, better, fresh Sacher torte. Yum.The Dohnányi Piano Quintet No. 1 (amazingly, his Opus 1!) is such a confection that is topped off by one of the most infectious movements in all of Romantic chamber music, the finale which is a rondo and fugue in 5/8 time. I defy anyone hearing this to go away without it playing in your head. It is one of my very favorite movements from that era. I imagine I've played it from this disc at least ten times. It's that good. There are other marvelous recordings of the Quintet by such groups as the Takacs Quartet with András Schiff Dohnanyi : Piano Quintet No. 1 in C minor/Sextet in C major, the Schubert Ensemble of London Dohnanyi: Piano Quintets, and the Vanbrugh Quartet with Martin Roscoe Dohnányi: The 2 Piano Quintets: No. 1 in C minor, Op. 1 / No. 2 in E flat minor, Op.26 / Suite in old Style, Op. 24 and several others. This one is right near the top.The Dvorák Second Piano Quartet, Op. 87, has also been recorded many times. One of my favorites (actually above this one) is that by the now disbanded Domus with pianist Susan Tomes Dvorák: Piano Quartets Nos. 1 & 2, Opp. 23, 87, and includes the less-familiar First Piano Quartet as well. But the absolute top of the list is the one by the Emerson Quartet and Menahem Pressler Dvorak: Piano Quintet in A Major, Op. 81; Piano Quartet in E Flat Major, Op. 87 which also includes Dvorák's Piano Quintet. Such lovely music. It's given an excellent reading here but not quite of the same quality as that of the Dohnányi.The short Élégie by Josef Suk rounds out the disc. It is wonderful, serene, nostalgic. This is not a performance that tips the balance in favor of this disc if only because it is so short, but every chamber music lover should own at least one performance of it.The Ensemble Raro, with violinist Andrej Bielow, play wonderfully. It is of note that a member of the talented Sitkovetsky family, violinist Alexander Sitkovetsky, is in the group. He is the nephew of Dmitry Sitkovetsky and the grand-nephew of legendary violinist Julian Sitkovetsky and pianist Bella Davidovich.

"The Schuncke family is second only to the Bachs in producing generations of remarkable musicians. Over four generations they produced 23 professional musicians, most of them horn players and a number of them composers. Members of the family were, in the mid-nineteenth century, called 'the greatest horn virtuosos of their time'. This disc presents music composed by three of the Schunkes. I first became aware of the family from hearing a CD containing music of yet another Schunke, Louis SCHUNCKE:WORKS FOR PIANO. All the pieces on the present disc are given their first recordings.First is the Concertante for Violin, Cello and Orchestra by third-generation Hugo Schunke (1823-1909). It is an early Romantic work whose forebear is clearly the violin/cello sinfonia concertante by Mozart but it sounds rather more like Mendelssohn or Spohr. The first movement is a rather loose sonata-allegro based on two complementary themes that are given thorough development. The second movement is an ABA Adagio with Bellini-esque melodies. It concludes with extensive cadenzas for both soloists before a rather perfunctory closing tutti paragraph. The finale (Allegro agitato) is entitled Rondo polacca; strangely, given this title, one section is titled 'Bolero'. There are, however, mazurka-like rhythms in the outer sections. Violinist Yasushi Ideue and cellist David Pia are able soloists.Next comes the Horn Concerto by second-generation Johann Christoph Schunke (1791-1856, Hugo's uncle). Johann Christoph was himself a horn virtuoso and wrote the concerto for himself. It is one of the first concertos written for the newly developed valved chromatic horn. The first movement is a truncated sonata-allegro with virtually no development section but with bravura themes for the soloist. The second movement is a serene piece with a long arching cantilena for horn solo. It ends on a dominant seventh chord which leads directly into a joyously playful, even humorous, finale. Hornist Robert Langbein, principal horn in the Staatskappelle Dresden, is strikingly assured; it is hard to imagine this music being better played.Finally we have the Symphony in B Major for Large Orchestra by third-generation Herrmann Schuncke (1825-1898). Little is known about him because pertinent records were lost in the Dresden fire-bombing in World War II. The symphony's first movement follows classic form: slow introduction leading to a sonata-allegro. The melodic content sounds to be derived from folkmusic. There is some rather awkward use of counterpoint. The Andante second movement sounds for all the world like something by Haydn, no criticism surely but perhaps bit anachronistic since it was written in 1850. The Minuet is a genial thing with bumptious accented chords, melodic leaps and chains of trills. The Rondo finale makes use melody over droning open fifths in the bass and reminds one of similar passages in Beethoven's 7th Symphony. The second subject continues the Beethovenian reminiscence which is then subjected to contrapuntal treatment.None of these pieces of great music, but they are enjoyable for their own sake and certainly make us familiar with the work of a remarkable family of musicians. The performances by the Baden-Baden Philharmonic under Pavel Baleff are excellent.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XGH0NVCAZTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHQH6YI#wasThisHelpful","R26XGH0NVCAZTA","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a reissue of a recital that, as far as I know, has never been on CD before. It was originally issued on LP in 1975, when Emanuel Ax was a new figure on the international stage. The year before he was the grand prize winner in the very first Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition in Tel Aviv. When it was issued Ax's recording was given high praise with good reason. Although Ax was only 25 when he recorded it, his playing has all the hallmarks of a seasoned master.As you can see the CD contains the magnificent B Minor Sonata No. 3 by Chopin, followed by five Schubert transcriptions by Liszt and then Liszt's own Gnomenreigen and his Paganini Etude, based on that ubiquitous Paganini theme so beloved by numerous composers.The Chopin Sonata is given a fiery reading but with all its lyricism intact. This is a reading that ranks up there with those by Rubinstein, Ann Schein, Cherkassky, Lipatti, Cortot and others. There is tasteful and effective use of rubato, varied dynamics, phrasings dictated by the internal logic of the music itself. This is a great performance.The Schubert transcriptions are lovable in their simplicity and songfulness. Liszt did not trick them out with unnecessary fireworks but, rather, treats them as the melodic gems they are. Ax does them proud. His legato is like butter. (Perhaps too evocative a simile, forgive me.) Finally we have two of the virtuosic blockbusters from Liszt's pen, played with joyous abandon.This one is a keeper.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NT7WGFJWNPBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJCPF4S#wasThisHelpful","R1NT7WGFJWNPBJ","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some record-buyers who complain that record labels keep reissuing old recordings with new covers, leading some to buy the same performances twice. I've complained about that myself a few times, although Amazon makes it easier to figure out which new releases are actually reissues, at least partly because Amazon carries old releases for a long time and one can suss out which of the new are old wine in new bottles. That being said, I will point out that this marvelous disc of Emanuel Ax playing the four Chopin Ballades and the Second Piano Sonata 'Funeral March', Op. 35 has been issued a number of times before. They were originally recorded in 1985 at Walthamstow Assembly Hall, London, issued initially by, I believe, RCA in 1986, no longer available but one can find it on eBay if one wishes. The Ballades were reshuffled onto a disc that also included Scherzos and some Mazurkas 4 Ballades / Scherzos / Mazurkas. And then four years ago the contents of this CD were reissued on RCA Red Seal Chopin: 4 Ballades  / Piano Sonata No. 2 / Funeral March (where, strangely, a couple of Amazon resellers are currently offering it for $0.01!). This issue is on Newton Classics, a small Dutch company that re-releases often outstanding recordings from the past, and they typically remaster them, too, although this one does not claim to be remastered.The bottom line is that these performances are among the best I've ever heard, and I've been collecting Chopin recordings for about sixty years. I was a little surprised, frankly, and this is my first time to own these particular performances, because I was not pleased with an early Ax recording of the two Chopin piano concertos and decided, wrongly, that Ax was not a great Chopin player and so had not bought any subsequent Ax/Chopin discs. I am SO glad I got this one, then, because my erroneous opinion flew right out the window. Ax's performances are full of fire, poetry, feeling and risky choices that feel right once you hear them. His way with all of the pieces is magnetic, alluring, charming, deeply felt. There is not a weak moment on this entire 62 minute disc.Others have felt the same way, and I would refer you to others' reviews at the other product sites whose links I provided above. You will not be disappointed if you choose to add this one to your collection.If I could give this more than five stars I would.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12683SUXMQ4H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2RAPMM#wasThisHelpful","R12683SUXMQ4H5","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alessandro Deljavan first popped up on my musical radar screen when he competed in the most recent Van Cliburn International Piano Competition where he wowed me and many others. He was a semi-finalist but did not place. I suspect that was partly because of his idiosyncratic wild-man platform behavior: he sings subvocally and has a variety of behavioral tics that some find distracting. He is, however, a marvelous musician as well as pianist. For instance, his performance with the Brentano String Quartet of the Dvorák Piano Quintet in the chamber music portion of the Cliburn was simply first-rate.On this disc, devoted to some of the ferociously difficult piano music of Charles-Valentin Alkan, I hear no vocalizing, and of course one cannot see his quirky behavior at the keyboard. What I do hear is, plain and simple, great playing of these immediately attractive works. Further, the disc contains the first performance on CD of the Deux petites pièces, Op. 60, two lieder-inspired works that are delicious, and deliciously played.The biggest works here are the 'Grande études pour les deux mains séparées et réunies' ('Grand Études for both hands separated and reunited'), Op. 76. They consist of a long Fantasie for left hand alone, a longer Introduction, Variations and Finale for right hand alone, and then a Concert Study for both hands together. Each of these works is a marvel. The two works for a single hand beggar belief that they could be handled by a single hand, but beyond that they are tuneful, artfully clever, thematically varied, and constantly surprising. The last movement is for the two hands playing in unison two octaves apart in unceasing sixteenth notes and faster than the wind. It reminds one of the 'wind whistling over a graveyard' of the last movement of Chopin's Second Sonata, 'Funeral March', Op. 35. Except it is even faster than Chopin's movement. Deljavan plays these études as well as I've ever heard them.The other big work on the disc is the more familiar 'Sonatine, Op. 61', whose four movements are all more or less fast; the second movement, Allegramente, is perhaps more Andante but it moves along, too. The Scherzo goes like the wind, although it has a minuet-like middle section. If anything Deljavan plays the Scherzo more leggiero and prestissimo than even Marc-André Hamelin. The finale combines two dissimilar themes, one furiously insistent, the other like a nocturne, a movement both clever and engaging.I've been a devotee of Alkan's piano music for nigh on forty years, going back to pianists like Ronald Smith, e.g., Alkan: Piano Works and Raymond Lewenthal Piano Music of Alkan, through Marc-André Hamelin, e.g., Alkan: Grande sonate 'Les quatre ges', Sonatine, Le festin d'Esope, and Jack Gibbons Alkan: 12 Etudes Op. 39 and others, and Deljavan's playing belongs on the shelf with the best of them.Strongly recommended.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUA4LUUCY5T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ3TTVG#wasThisHelpful","R3NUA4LUUCY5T4","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jean Françaix (1912-1997; pronounced frahN-SECKS, not frahN-SAY as one sometimes hears) was the prankster of 20th-century French music. Although he wrote some serious works (e.g., 'The Apocalypse of St. John') he is best known for his light-hearted, even funny works. I've rarely heard a work of his without at the very least chuckling and sometimes laughing out loud. The Clarinet Concerto is, in spots, laugh-out-loud funny. Françaix treats the clarinet as a jokester and puts it through some of the strangest and most appealing didos. It consists of four movements -- fast, fast, slow, fast. One of the most striking moments is in the final Alegrissimo movement where the clarinet soloist urges his instrument higher and higher in spiraling filigree until he reaches the highest reaches of the instrument whereupon the piccolo takes over and goes even higher for several measures before it comes down and the clarinet takes over again seamlessly. The first time I heard that I thought I was mishearing it, but replayed it to find it was indeed as I'd heard it. And each time I hear it I chuckle and think how clever (and effective) it is. One reads that when he was a youngster Françaix would often become bored at concerts and that he, already making attempts to compose music, vowed never to bore his audience. And I think he succeeds. His music is melodic, sparkling, easily grasped and always enjoyable. The clarinetist here, Radovan Cavallin, is a Croatian who has played all over Europe. His command of the instrument is complete; both the Françaix and Mozart demand the utmost of the soloist. His tone is like velvet except when he is playing the fast, glittering bits when it sounds like a rapier of sound. Wonderful!The Mozart Concerto is, of course, THE clarinet concerto and one cannot praise it highly enough. (It has been one of my most frequent earworms since I first heard it as a boy.) There have been easily fifty recordings of the work. My own favorites remain the ones with Antony Pay or Karl Leister, both still available here at Amazon. But make no mistake, Cavallin is a very good clarinetist and his comes a close second to my longtime favorites. He is capable of the crucial and brutally difficult articulated allegro parts and he really sings the lyrical parts.The orchestra is the regional Orquestra Filarmonica de Gran Canaria (the most populous of the Canary Islands, part of Spain) under two excellent conductors, Gabriel Chmura and Ernest Martinez; strangely, the booklet and jewel box do not precisely indicate which conductor led conducted which work although order of the listing suggests Chmura led the Françaix.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCONEDT70N0SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063BIS#wasThisHelpful","RCONEDT70N0SH","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know what I expected when I got this book. I certainly didn't expect that it would be set in the part of the country where I grew up, and consequently the sense of familiarity I experienced was a welcome surprise. But even more I was surprised and heartened by the ingenious plotting and the evocative feeling for words and how they are put together by a really talented writer. Other reviewers have talked about the plot and the characters. I second what those who praised them have said. I was a little uneasy by the magic realism (or skeptical religiosity, if you prefer) but still found it alluring. This writer knows how to weave a tale and he also knows how to leave you in suspense so that, given that the chapters alternate between present and twenty-years-past, you keep leap-frogging from one wished-for resolution to another.I hope this writer is working on another novel.

"This disc is a remastered reissue of one that was initially released in the late 1970s. It is important because it contains Pavarotti in his finest period singing arias you might never had heard him sing before. And he is accompanied by the marvelous Claudio Abbado and the La Scala Orchestra. Indeed, there are two orchestral selections: the discarded original Prelude to 'Simon Boccanegra' and potpourri Overture to 'Aïda' which was never used at the premi1ere, and only very rarely since.The arias include:1. Odi il voto from 'Ernani'2. Oh dolore! from 'Attila'3. Io la vidi from 'Attila'4. Dal più remoto esilio from 'I due Foscari',5. followed by its alternative cabaletta, Sì lo sento, Iddio mi chiama6. Ô toi que j'ai chérie from 'Les Vêpres siciliennes'Of greatest interest to me were the arias from 'I due Foscari' and 'Vêpres sicilienne'. In the Foscari cabaletta there is some awkward falsetto for some very high notes and they are a bit startling, but to tell the truth Pavarotti handles them as well as is possible.Meanwhile, one must know that these recordings were done when Pavarotti's young, plangent tenor was at its very finest. His is the most attractive tenor voice of my lifetime. I can still remember hearing, at the insistence of my Argentine friend Antonio Paschino, Pavarottis very first recording, in 1964, and I was struck dumb by the beauty of the voice. And I've never recovered!Scott MorrisonP.S. I just discovered, after I'd written the above, that the original issue is still available from some of Amazon's resellers.

"After the first thirty seconds of the first work on this CD I really thought I was in for an hour of undiluted pleasure. That first selection is the title track, 'An Amerikaner in Danmark', and it is a joyous, quirky and clever assemblage of musical snippets from the music of George Gershwin, its title an homage to Gershwin's 'An American in Paris'. Andy Pape, the composer, is an American who moved with his parents to Copenhagen when he was fifteen. He studied music there and has remained. The piece is refreshingly different and yet based on snips and snatches enough of Gershwin's music to leave a listener smiling at the familiar bits and even more so at the wonderful orchestration, harmony and sass. It has infectious joie de vivre and is marvelously played and recorded.However, after the first fourteen minutes of this disc we move on to 42 minutes of unrelieved boredom. No, I lie, some of those moments are irritating enough to relieve the boredom, but not the way one might want. The Tuba Concerto, the only one I've ever heard besides the wonderful Vaughan Williams concerto, is twenty-four minutes of tunelessness clothed in unremitting pedal points that underpin long, long held notes by the tubist with interjections of secundal harmonies in the brass and winds. There are also assaults by the percussion section that make one reach either for the volume control or the fast-forward button. One can admire the playing of the Odense Symphony Orchestra but magisterial playing in the service of such twaddle still doesn't amount to much. The actual title of the concerto is 'Suburban Nightmares', although I'm not sure why anyone would write such a thing which Pape describes as what one feels living in the suburbs -- 'man's eternal attempt to surround himself with security' -- it does not limn either security nor comfort. Unless, of course, those endless non-melodies and harmonic stasis are meant to describe the boredom of the suburb, in which case he succeeds.This is followed by what is essentially a bassoon concerto called 'Traces of Lost Time'. It is a three movement work -- The Echoes of Time, The Spiral of Time, and Traces of Time -- whose raison d'etre seems to be to provide, as Pape says, 'an echo valley' (which I frankly don't hear), an endless bassoon 'spiral' in the second movement; then in the third movement Pape says 'the bassoon' moves out of the eye of hurricane of time and out into the actual flow of time'. Say what? The bassoonist is good, though.I loved 'An Amerikaner in Danmark'. I hated the other two pieces. 'An Amerikaner in Danmark' will go into my iPod. The other two will be buried without any regrets.Scott Morrison","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRBF0XK7812O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WEHKZ8#wasThisHelpful","RRBF0XK7812O5","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My title implies that one can be the one without the other. And there are numerous examples of that. Benjamin Grosvenor, though, is both and at the tender age of 20. His playing is not only absolutely secure, it is musicianly, nuanced, sparkling, and attention-holding. The program, of course, is made up of, with one exception, what would generally be called encores. The exception is the Book 1 or Albéniz's 'Iberia', which I'm bound to say gives the classic recording by Alicia de Larrocha a run for its money.I am tickled to see that the recital starts off with jazz-inflected music by a Russian composer, Nikolai Kapustin, whose music seems lately to be getting lots of recordings after decades of neglect. Marc-André Hamelin has recorded all eight of the concert études -- Grosvenor gives us only three -- and I believe does a better job with them. Nikolai Kapustin: Piano Music Still, these are more than acceptable. Then the pianist plays a couple of familiar Scarlatti sonatas with grace and élan, using just right amount of pedal when required; so many pianists try to play Scarlatti without pedal and usually that doesn't work.Following the 'Iberia' tracks we get Moritz Moszkowski's étude on repeated notes and chords, the 'Caprice Espagnol'. It is not played here for virtuosic show but for the drama it presents. Two Chopin nocturnes are given good, but not field-beating renditions; but then the competition is horrendously stiff. I did love how he presented the D flat Nocturne, Op. 27, No. 2, with its dreamy melodies. Then we get two transcriptions by the great Hungarian pianist, Georges Cziffra, with their knuckle-busting difficulties. Grosvenor handles them without breaking a sweat.And finally the only weak piece on the disc, namely Percy Grainger's arrangement of Gershwin's late evergreen, 'Love Walked In'. But the problem is with Grainger, not Grosvenor. I'm sure there are those who will disagree with me about the value of the arrangement, but much of it simply sounds corny to me. Grosvenor plays it beautifully, though.Make no mistake, Grosvenor is a comer, and perhaps indeed he has already arrived. His earlier disc Chopin, Liszt, Ravel is a winner. And he has a new one coming out next month Rhapsody in Blue: Saint-Saens, Ravel & Gershwin.Try it, you'll like it.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AGEYOWBATGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZQL1GE#wasThisHelpful","R9AGEYOWBATGX","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sequeira Costa (b. 1928) is a Portuguese pianist long on the faculty of the University of Kansas. I had the opportunity to hear him play a number of times when I lived near KU's Lawrence campus. And I often heard his student (and stepson) Artur Pizarro who has gone on to a major international career. This disc of the three earliest Beethoven piano sonatas is labeled as the first of ten discs to present all of the Beethoven sonatas. It was recorded in 1999. I believe he has now completed that series. They were originally issued on the Claudio label and were underwritten by the Vianna da Motta Foundation. The connection there is that Costa founded the Vianna da Motta Foundation in honor of his teacher who was a student of Franz Liszt and Hans von Bülow. The discs are now in the process of being reissued on Claudio's offshoot label Claudio Bohema. I had never heard any of these discs before this one came my way.Probably the main thing I can say about Costa's playing is that it is very direct, very communicative, very clear, usually quite extroverted (and this is true even in the slow movements; that is not to say there is no poetry but it is never veiled, hinted at, or mysterious). In the outer movements the forward motion is compelling and sometimes it comes across as somewhat brusque. There are also moments that are a bit too much so. Still, this is a player who has definite ideas about how these sonatas should go and he stays true to his vision. If I hadn't known Costa was in his seventies when he recorded this disc, I would have guessed this was the playing of a very much younger man. The prestissimo finale of Op. 2, No. 1 is particularly exciting.Presentation is minimal, to say the least. The only thing in the jewel box is a single page with a picture of a frowning Beethoven and a young smiling Costa. There is nothing printed on the back of that page; no notes, nothing. The back of the jewel box shows just the contents of Opp. 2, Nos. 1-3, with timings of the individual movements.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4726DI16IDFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B73H0W#wasThisHelpful","R4726DI16IDFR","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Strangely, as of the date of this review the price for the CD is less than for the mp3 download. I wonder what that's all about!]This three CD set is a compilation of three previously issued separate single CD sets. For those of us who love Freni's singing and who don't own them, this is a no-brainer. Most of the recordings were made in the early 1970s. The exceptions are the selections from Sonnambula, I Capuleti e i Montecchi, L'Amico Fritz, Suor Angelica and Carmen from 1959 (Freni was only 24 then) which make up most of the third disc. If you're looking at this on the CD page you cannot see the contents of the three CDs, but it you go to the mp3 page and see which arias and ensembles are included. (Just go to the top of this page and click on the link 'mp3 music, 23 songs, 2013'. As you'll be able to see there are familiar arias from Traviata (actually quite a few, including a glorious Violetta/Germont scene that lasts almost twenty minutes, with Sesto Bruscantini), Bohème, Turandot, Butterfly, Manon Lescaut, Gianni Schicchi (a delicious 'O mio babbino caro'), Falstaff, Otello (a lovely and touching first act duet ['Gia nella notte densa'] with tenor Franco Bonisolli) et al.There are other singers involved where required. Primarily the tenor is Franco Bonisolli whose voice, while appealing, is occasionally stretched to capacity; his Otello, though, is surprisingly pretty darn good. The conductors are the virtually unknown Leone Magiera and Ino Savino; the Traviata excerpts are led by Lamberto Gardelli. The orchestras are all respectable German ensembles (Staatskapelle Berlin, Hamburg Philharmonic, Munich Rundfunkorchester).There is a brief set of notes about Freni, but no lyrics are supplied. The sound is remastered but still shows its age, but not jarringly so.I suspect this issue is primarily for collectors of all things Freni, but for someone who is attracted to this repertoire, or someone coming to these arias and scenas for the first time, one could certainly do worse.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R329JHKBGBBXO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNHKQEE#wasThisHelpful","R329JHKBGBBXO3","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first owned these performances in the 1990s when they originally came out Bartok: Violin Concertos, No. 1 & 2 but apparently lost that CD at a time when we moved from Kansas to Vermont. So I was delighted to see this reissue on the budget Brilliant Classics label. I gather it has been reissued a couple of times in between. The reason for this is simple: these are brilliant performances. Iván Fischer conducts surely one of the better European ensembles, the Budapest Festival Orchestra, and is in total synch with Zehetmair who is surely one of the shining stars among current violinists. Zehetmair brings a little more edginess to these concertos and that's precisely what they need as compared with the softer outlines of, say, James Ehnes's recent recording. There is an old Isaac Stern recording but it is let down both by its aged sound and by the somewhat dispirited playing of the Philadelphia Orchestra. I have not heard the recordings by Arabella Steinbacher or Isabelle Faust but can imagine that they, too, are competitive.At any rate, these performances are excellent and I can recommend them unreservedly. We don't often get to hear the First Concerto (which, written in 1907, had to wait 51 years for its first performance in 1958) yet it has its charms which, for me at least, have grown to be a favorite.Recommended.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VEN8WJAN3P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3ED2ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R35VEN8WJAN3P5","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The biggest work on this disc is the amazing Fantasie, Op. 17 of Schumann which was, as far as I know, not any sort of 'Homage to Brahms' as the CD's title suggests. But it's a masterful piece of music, possibly Schumann's best piano work, and it pains me to say that Ignacy Lisiecki's performance of it is a desecration. If it weren't for the modern sounding recorded sound -- and more about that in a moment* -- I might have been tempted to think this was a performance by that bad boy of pianism of yesteryear, Vladimir de Pachmann. The willfulness and downright misplaying of the music is barely tolerable to my ears. There is such pushing and pulling of the tempi, sometimes rushing here, sometimes slowing down to a crawl there that one gets seasick. It is clear that Lisiecki has technique sufficient to play the work as it should be played, although there are occasional smudged passages. Further he tends to bang in the loud passages rather than get deeply into the keys to render a thunderous but musical sound. His legato is tenuous and sometimes simply lacking. And when we get to the 'lento sostenuto - sempre piano' third movement it is neither lento sostenuto nor sempre piano; this delicate and deeply felt movement roars as if it were the typical allegro final movement of a sonata which it decidedly is not.The miniatures, Schumann's Romance Op. 28, No. 2, Brahms's Rhapsodies Nos. 1 and 2 from Op. 79, as well as Lisiecki's own 'Fantasy on a Theme from the (organ) Chorale Prelude of Brahms, Op. 122, No. 2, suffer from much the same treatment.Understand, I do not gainsay an artist's right to put his own stamp on a piece. In fact, one almost demands it. But the wild and willful depredations of this young pianist in these works is a disgrace.*The recorded sound is clattery and downright ugly at times. Part of that is, of course, due to the pianist, but much of it is surely due to the engineering from Dux.Scott Morrison","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YC7C5L7SRY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN2N8QM#wasThisHelpful","R39YC7C5L7SRY5","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title is a bit of a misnomer because practically all of Brahms's late piano music is more or less miniature in length. This is not to say that there is no profound music here. But none of these pieces from Opp. 76, 116 and 117 lasts longer than seven minutes. Granted the capriccios and intermezzi (as all of these works are titled) are gathered into three 'suites' but in fact Brahms didn't really expect them to be played as such, but rather as individual works. And indeed that is how they are most often heard in recital. One interesting thing about them is that there are knotty works alongside rather simple lyrical works. And that is what tends to cause music lovers to have disparate reactions to them. Some love them all, others love some of them only. All of them are in more or less ABA form but oftimes expanded or elaborated upon. There is nary a sonata allegro form among them, nor a rondo. Still the diversity Brahms finds within this simple format is astonishing.Peter Longworth is a fiftyish pianist born in England who studied primarily in the US and England and is known primarily as a teacher at the Glenn Gould School in Toronto, but he does concertize and perform in chamber music concerts primarily in North America. He is a gifted pianist whose approach to Brahms is rather straighforward. There are no pushing-and-pulling nor outré effects. But his playing does tend to have a somewhat grayish aspect. He is much more appealing in the lyrically attractive or light-hearted works, e.g. Op. 76 Nos. 2, 6 & 7; Op. 116, Nos. 3, 4 6; and Op. 116, Nos. 1 & 2. He is somewhat less successful in the denser, more dramatic works. These are acceptable performances overall but don't eclipse other better-known recordings, e.g. Julius Katchen (a magnificent 6CD set at a very budget price) Solo Piano Works. There are recordings of some of these works by such sterling pianists as Murray Perahia, Steven Kovacevich and Hélène Grimaud, among others. I can only manage a lukewarm recommendation then.Scott Morrison","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1JF6TGLPCHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIOFXXA#wasThisHelpful","R1A1JF6TGLPCHA","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have enjoyed the recordings of the Trio di Parma, a group formed at the Boito Conservatory in Parma twenty years or so ago. Their recording of piano trio music by the woefully under-represented composer, Ildebrando Pizzetti, was very satisfying: Trio in La / Tre Canti. But this two-CD set of Dvorák's piano trios is somewhat less than the best because there are some truly outstanding Dvorák complete piano trio collections out there, and for the most popular two (Nos. 3 and 4 'Dumky') there are many excellent performances. I imagine that the reason most people would be buying this or any other complete collection would be because they are curious about Dvorák's first two trios. The First and Second were written in 1875 and 1876 and they are much less likely on first hearing to be recognized as by Dvorák, but they are more than student works, too. The Third and Fourth Trios are masterpieces of the first rank, and indeed although No. 4 'Dumky' is the much better-known work, the No. 3 is possibly the greater work. In any event these performances by the Trio di Parma are mostly unexceptionable, but they also don't have much new, different or enlightening to add; indeed, at times the playing is a little wooden. Further, the recorded sound is just a bit shrill in spots.My preferred sets of the complete Dvorák piano trios are those by the Beaux Arts Trio Dvorák: Complete Piano Trios, the Suk Trio Dvorak: Complete Piano Trios and the Trio Fontenay (no longer available at Amazon but as a used set from one of their resellers) Antonin Dvorak Complete Piano Trios 1-4 (2 CD Box Set) (Teldec).Scott Morrison","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SA22B0GVUNIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPCEP4I#wasThisHelpful","R2SA22B0GVUNIP","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think about it: where, except for a set containing Saint-Sans' piano concertos, have you ever seen a CD with four, count 'em, four French piano concertos? These are excellent works which, except for the Ravel G Major Concerto, are rarely heard in concert or even on disc. Odder still, this is a CD with a German pianist and a German orchestra.So, how are they? Well, it's definitely a mixed bag. There is a definite lack of poetry in the Debussy Fantaisie for Piano and Orchestra. This proto-impressionist work by the twenty-year-old Debussy is a lovely, dreamy thing which in this reading is rather too literal. I lay most of the blame for that one the orchestra, the Deutsche Radio Philharmonie under conductor Pablo González. There is some lovely individual playing here and in the other concertos, most notably by the double reeds, but the whole thing just sounds like a casual saunter along the high street.Things are different in the sassy Françaix Concertino -- whose four movements last all of eight minutes -- because the orchestration is lighter and clearer. Françaix had a way of tossing off musical witticisms that catch one offguard and then make one chuckle. Uhlig, whose recordings I've tended to enjoy, is superb here.The Poulenc concerto seems to just miss the Gallic wryness that is so necessary to convey. The notes are all there -- although there are some decidedly odd tempo choices from the conductor -- but there doesn't seem to be the enjoyment that one wishes for in this piece that shows us both the light-hearted and the lyrically sentimental sides of Poulenc.Uhlig's performance of the Ravel is first-rate, but again the orchestra lets him down a bit. He is sprightly in the outer movements and appropriately understated in the melancholy middle movement. Again, there are some very odd tempo choices by the conductor. Further, there has never been a recording of this concerto that comes close to matching that of Arturo Benedetto Michelangeli Ravel: Piano Concerto in G / Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No. 4 (Great Recordings of the Century).This CD is a near-miss when compared to other individual recordings of these concertos. But as a collection of all four concertos on one disc I suppose one might be tempted, for cost reasons alone, to acquire.

"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli was 36 when these two live performances were recorded by Sudwest Rundfunk of Cologne. The SWR symphony orchestra is under a virtually unknown conductor, Antoine de Bavier, best known as a clarinetist. And the orchestra is not in top form, with a few sour notes and with almost running away with itself in the first movement of Concerto No. 15. However, this is full-blooded Mozart, recorded before 'historically-informed performance practice' began insisting on reduced orchestras, and because tempi tend to be very forward-looking, these are spirited, exciting readings. Michelangeli IS in top form with gorgeous tone and impeccable technique. I have rarely come across a D Minor Concerto with such sass. One tends to think of this concerto as being just a tad serious but Michelangeli makes one almost laugh with the way he tosses off the almost Haydnesque turns of phrase, particularly in the final Rondo. The Romanze is tender and yet not sappy. The opening of the D Minor does not take itself as seriously as some readings do; rather, the emphasis is on dramatic excitement, partly due to Bavier's and Michelangeli's choice of faster tempi than ordinarily used.Another highlight is the light-heartedness of the final Rondo of No. 15. Michelangeli, a rather dour man in person, seems to be having a great time.This is masterful, personal playing of the highest order. It's a shame Michelangeli is not quite equalled by the orchestra but the soloist makes up for any disappointment from the orchestra. This is, for me, a set of performances to treasure. (And it will immediately go onto my iPod so we can take it with us when we go on an auto trip next week.)Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQ1DNTWZT13D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZ4X3ZE#wasThisHelpful","R2YQ1DNTWZT13D","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The thing that makes this issue worth hearing -- aside from some terrific playing by the Trio Testore -- is a chance to hear, side by side, the two versions Brahms made of his Piano Trio in B Minor, Op. 8. He wrote the first version when he was 20 (1854), the second version 35 years later. Both versions were published but in the modern world we only ever hear the revised version. I'd never encountered a recording of the original version, and certainly never heard it in live performance. Scores of both versions are available for download at imslp dot org, and they make for interesting comparisons. (I do understand that there was an earlier recording of the 'Urfassung' ['original version'] made in the 1990s by the Arcadia Trio but I never heard it.)Brahms, from the very first, was dissatisfied with his first version and said even at the time that he would probably want to revise it sometime. Neither he nor anyone else realized he wouldn't get around to it until 1889, after he had written almost all his music. If it had been numbered in sequence (rather than retaining the Op. 8 designation, which he insisted on when it was published in 1890) it would have been Op. 108.One of the primary differences is the first version's prolixity, as well as a overabundance of rather prosaic material. It is really jarring to hear tightly organized, emotionally powerful sections cheek-by-jowl with what seems like mindless wanderings, particularly in the first movement but also in the finale. The timing for the first movement in the original version is 21:22, in the revised version 15:44; for the finale the original is 11:15, the revision 7:03. The Scherzo second movement is pretty much the same in both version except for the endings, each of which is effective; in the first version the ending more or less dissolves into sparsely voiced pizzicato strings, the second has some wonderful vigorous piano interjections. One wonders why Brahms thought he needed to change the original ending since each ending has its considerable merits. The Adagio third movement differs primarily in that in the original there is a sudden burst of allegro toward the end that, because it has been a quite slow movement, tends to quicken one's pulse and lead one to expect the brilliant finale. The composer took that irruption out in the final version of the Adagio, perhaps to its detriment. The finale Allegro molto, like the first movement, is extensively revised. In the first version there is a good deal of wandering about with stops and starts and inclusion of perhaps too many differing ideas. The revision tightens things considerably, drops some of the more mundane material, and creates a much more powerful conclusion to the work. There is, however, a lovely lyrical theme, or set of themes, that Brahms drops from the original in which I hear echoes of in his later Second Symphony. Perhaps he knew he had a good thing but needed to drop it from the original in order to make it more effective. Whatever the case, I'm glad it's in the original and that we get to hear it in this recording.The other two trios are given inspiriting readings by the Trio Testore but frankly nothing makes them stand out from other easily available recordings. My own personal favorites are the performances by Julius Katchen, Josef Suk and Janos Starker Brahms: Piano Trios Nos. 1 - 3 / Cello Sonata No. 2 / Scherzo for Violin & Piano and by Eugene Istomin, Isaac Stern and Leonard Rose Brahms: Piano Trios Nos. 1- 3, Opp. 8,87,101 / Schubert: Piano Trios Nos. 1 & 2, d. 898, 929 (Isaac Stern Collection- Trio Recordings, Vol. 1).I can recommend this two-SACD set for both performances and for sound. And for the wonderful experience of being able to compare those two versions of the Op. 8.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15QIYTKIXDLOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEMV0RA#wasThisHelpful","R15QIYTKIXDLOG","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[When I first saw this CD cover I thought Anagnoson and Kinton were modestly calling THEMSELVES 'piano titans'. Then I realized they were referring to Clementi, Beethoven and Schubert.]We seem to be getting a Clementi boomlet lately, which is good because for many of us he is best known either as the composer of music for students (études and the like) or as a manufacturer of pianos. But he was indeed a good composer of music intended for public performance and these two sonatas demonstrate that. There is plenty of virtuosity, of course, but there is also interesting music with pleasant melodies, sudden harmonic twists, and fluent forms.The marches by Beethoven were written for piano duet (four hands at one piano) and were intentionally not particularly serious or complex, intended as they were for amateur pianists. They are filled with march-like effects, imitating drum rolls and fanfares. They are among the most negligible of Beethoven's piano works, but they are charming for all that.In an entirely different category is Schubert's Fantasie in F Minor, D940, for piano duet. This is, in the opinion of many (including me), the most important piano duet work of its time. I would even suggest it is the most important piano duet of all time. There is much to admire in this performance -- the admirable legatos, the apt phrasing, dynamics that are in absolute synch between to two pianists. I would not rank it as highly as I do the classic performance by Radu Lupu and Murray Perahia which has never been out of the catalog since it was originally issued in 1987 Mozart: Sonata, K.448; Schubert: Fantasia, Op. 103, D.940. But it comes damn close, which is high praise.James Anagnoson and Leslie Kinton have been performing as a piano duo since shortly after they met at the Aspen Music Festival and School thirty years ago. Both of them teach in Ontario where they are on the faculty of The Glenn Gould School; Anagnoson is Dean. They are among the most highly regarded piano duos currently before the public. Their synchronicity is among the best one will ever hear.The playing on this disc is admirable. The music, aside from the Schubert, is not deathless but certainly pleasant, even inspiriting. As for the Schubert, I'm on record about it.Recommended.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8MRPH736BZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIOFXNK#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8MRPH736BZT","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There have already been three reviews here that laud these performances of Prokofiev's 'War Sonatas', Nos. 6, 7 & 8. I want to add my praise. With the minor exception of what I consider to be a rather too fast tempo in the finale of the 7th, one that somewhat smudges the alternating chords, these are examplary performances. (For what it's worth, the pianist writes in his notes that he consciously takes a wild tempo here rather than the somewhat more moderate tempo taken by the sonata's dedicatee, Sviatoslav Richter.) Giltburg manages to convey the ferocity,  dread, veiled sarcasm, and tenderness of these heartfelt works, written by Prokofiev at a time when Russian artists were experiencing brutal repression by Stalin's cultural police. The 7th, in fact, was almost certainly written in reponse to the arrest and exile and ultimately murder of his close friend, the theatrical director Vsevelod Meyerhold and his wife.Sound is absolutely first-rate and this helps make this a stunning listening experience.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROGRJ864HQW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008P76Y46#wasThisHelpful","R3ROGRJ864HQW8","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not realize when I ordered this 2CD set that it was played on period instruments: gut-strung violin, viola and cello, and four different fortepianos, a different one for each of the four works here. My review will be colored, therefore, by my own mild dislike for the sound of the fortepiano. For those who love the fortepiano this may be a revelation as to the variation in sound from the different instruments.In order:Felix Mendelssohn: Piano Trio No. 1 in D Minor, Op. 49. This is rather tame performance of this wonderful trio. This is true not only because of the milder sound of the older instruments but also because of the style of playing that these musicians present. There are many, many recordings of this trios (often coupled with the Second Piano Trio) and in no particular order I much prefer the recordings by Perlman/Ma/Ax Mendelssohn: Piano Trios Nos. 1 & 2, Opp. 49,66, Kalichstein/Laredo/Robinson Mendelssohn Trios - Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio CD, Istomin/Rose/Stern Mendelssohn: Piano Trios Nos. 1 & 2, Opp. 49,66, and the Florestan Trio Mendelssohn: The Piano Trios as well as newcomers Gilad/Müller-Schott/Fischer Mendelssohn: Piano Trios Nos. 1 & 2 [Hybrid SACD]. All of these listed recordings feature both Mendelssohn Trios. In this set the Second Trio is on CD 2 and the same comments apply although I found the performance rather more enjoyable, at least partly because pianist Hrvoje Jugovic is using a different piano (the individual pianos used are listed below) and the playing sounds more in keeping with the Trio's often brilliant piano writing.Also on CD 1 is the astonishingly assured trio written by the 11-year-old Mendelssohn using the unusual instrumentation of violin, viola and piano. It is clearly a work by an unformed talent, borrowing as it does from Mozartean models, but there is much to admire. There is a hint of the Midsummer Night's Dream 'fairy music' in the trio's Scherzo.CD2 begins with the Second Trio by Felix mentioned above and is followed by Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel's Piano Trio in D Minor, Op. 11. This work is new to me and is, quite frankly, pleasantly well-crafted, if not quite as graciously tuneful as the two trios by her brother. The bravura first movement is really virtuosic for the pianist. There are some unusual harmonic twists that make one catch one's breath; they sound like the kind of thing Schumann was to do later.The instruments:Hrvoje Jugovic plays four different pianos:Felix's Piano Trio No. 1 -- Johann Baptist Streicher, Vienna, 183611-year-old Felix's Trio -- Paul McNulty, made in Divisov, Czech Republic, 2006, after Walther und Sohn, Vienna, c. 1805Felix's Piano Trio No. 2 -- John Broadwood & Sons, London, 1838Fanny's Piano Trio -- Johann Michael Schweighofer, Vienna, 1854Maria Bader-Kubizek plays a violin made by Johann Rombach, Vienna, 2002, after Giuseppe Guarneri, Cremona, 1734Dorothea Schönweise plays a cello made by Georg Klotz, Mittenwald, c. 1770Silvia Schweinberger plays a viola made by Caspar Strnad, Prague, 1793CD1 42'30CD2 53'01The three-star rating is admittedly colored by my own feelings about period pianos.

"This set of performances was originally issued on LPs back in the early 1950s and then issued in 1992 on CD by Deutsche Grammophon Beethoven: Die Klavierkonzerte. It has rarely been out of print and has been uniformly praised throughout all these years. Kempff was a superb interpreter of these concertos, among the best on record. In Concertos 1-4 he uses his own musically apt cadenzas. Although these recordings were made in the 1950s and thus are in mono, the sound is very clear and one is barely aware of their being almost sixty years old. The Dutch conductor, Paul van Kempen, is hardly remembered today but he was prominent from the 1930s to his death in 1955. He suffered some bad publicity because he conducted in Holland during the German occupation while others had refused to conduct or had fled. Still, he was a marvelous conductor and these performances demonstrate that.There is something odd about this release on United Classics in that only Kempff's name appears on the jewel box or the cover of the enclosed booklet. One has to hunt to find that this is the Berliner Philharmoniker under van Kempen. The rather generic booklet notes confine themselves to an essay about Kempff and were not proofread very accurately; e.g. 'Potsdam', where Kempff lived, is 'Postsdam'). One wonders if this is an unauthorized release. Strangely, or perhaps not, the DG set is still available here at Amazon for a slightly lower price and includes the original liner notes. Thus I am inclined to give the overall release only four stars as opposed to the five stars for the original DG release.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REI564W8V4V8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYF4IJK#wasThisHelpful","REI564W8V4V8N","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this because our local opera company is doing a production of Eugene Onegin. I am not in the production but am an active board member who does the pre-curtain talks for some of the performances, so I have been going to rehearsals. The vocal score itself is fine in terms of the piano reduction of the orchestral score. But a big  drawback is that the sung text is only in Russian (using the Cyrillic characters) and in English. It would have been helpful if the Cyrillic had also been romanized, that is in western letters. But even more bothersome is that there are no rehearsal numbers or even bar numbers. It makes it difficult to discuss with others, during the rehearsal process, 'where we are' or 'where we will begin', etc. For these reasons I can't really recommend it except for those who already read the Cyrillic (Russian) alphabet and have no need of markers for locations in the score.Scott Morrison","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFKN25FFM7KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076924615X#wasThisHelpful","RFKN25FFM7KL","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the foremost Estonian composer of his era, Heino Eller (1887-1970) is revered in his country. To those of us from elsewhere he is probably best known as the teacher of Arvo Pärt, the current leading light of Estonian music. Thanks to critic turned music entrepreneur Martin Anderson, the founder of Toccata Classics, we are now getting a slew of recordings of music from the Baltic states and discovering some laudable works. This is the third in a series of CDs -- there will be seven -- of Eller's complete works for piano, all played by Estonian pianist Sten Lassmann, an artist in his early thirties.On this disc are works from what are roughly Eller's early, middle and late periods, including Three Studies (1917-1919), Five Préludes (1929-1930), Ten Lyric Pieces (1942-1943) and his Fourth Piano Sonata (1957-1958).In their order on the CD:The Ten Lyric Pieces, formally inspired by Grieg's Lyric Pieces, are mostly somber, even melancholy, pieces written in the period immediately after Eller's Jewish first wife was taken by the SS and a few months later executed. The music here is, in the main, gripping, heart-rending. Interestingly there is a seemingly inappropriate mazurka-like piece, No. 8, which however is secretly apt as a Chopin mazurka was one of the last pieces Eller heard his wife, a pianist, play. The last, and longest, Lyric Piece is a set of variations ending in a quadruple fugue.The early Three Studies are rather more lyrical than the Lyrical Pieces, sounding to some extent like Grieg or Christian Sinding. Most effective is the third one, in G Flat Major, which has ceaseless sixteenth notes throughout. The second study, also in G Flat, is brief and somewhat jocular. The first, in A Flat Major, is navely pastoral, describing dawn with the rising of a brilliant sun.The Five Préludes are considerably more spare than the Studies, even cryptic in style. Almost diffident, only one of them even has a key signature or easily discernible pulse. There is an underlying angst in all of them.The Piano Sonata No. 4, Eller's last, was written in the late 1950s after the composer had gone through the 'Social Realism', 'anti-Formalist' phase in Soviet music during which he had to conform to cultural czar Andrei Zhdanov's edicts about what kind of music was allowed. Modern-sounding without being atonal, the three-movement sonata is somewhat neoclassic, with a first movement in modified sonata-allegro form. The second movement is contemplative, musing, often lyrical. It leads without pause into the vivo finale, a rondo whose themes are graceful, lilting, and light-hearted until sforzando chordal passages lead to a dramatic coda on a pedal point, what the booklet writer, the pianist Sten Lassmann, calls a 'tragic outcry'.Many of the pieces here are receiving their first recordings. Sten Lassmann is a fine pianist doing a major service to the memory of a composer whose music deserves to be heard.Scott Morrison","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTA0QYZQSHXMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMZNO82#wasThisHelpful","RTA0QYZQSHXMR","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They have been recorded by just about every major pianist* over the years but Feltsman brings something of his own to them and they are definitely worth hearing. He never forgets that most of the individual movements of the partitas are based on dance forms, e.g. Minuet, Gavotte, Sarabande, Courante, Allemande, Gigue.Feltsman's style probably most closely resembles that of Gould with much use of staccato or detaché playing but his phrasing and dynamics are much more varied and full of life. He brings startlingly pleasant and convincing variation to some of the repeats which sound almost improvised. His obvious enjoyment in conveying rhythmic vitality is palpable, making these some of the most brilliantly charged readings on records.

"My mother was using Durkees sixty years ago and that's what I felt I had to have on things like hamburgers, grilled cheese sandwiches and the like.

"This Newton release is the same as the previous release on Sony Classical from 1990 Schumann: Schumann: Carnaval; Papillons; Toccata, which is still available here at Amazon for only a pittance more. I'm not clear why the decision was made to bring out this new release at essentially full price while the other release is still available. But I guess that's not for me to say.The reason I got this one is that Licad is the last pianist I heard in recital with my mother before her death. My mother had been my first piano teacher and she was awed by Licad's artistry. Licad is a Filipina who was a prodigy in her native country and came to the Curtis Institute in the US to study with Rudolf Serkin and Mieczyslaw Horszowski as a young woman. She is an elegant pianist whose touch is velvet but who is capable, as in the Toccata and the Paganini movement in 'Carnaval' of technical brilliance.An easily recommendable disc.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14NZRL0H9U6CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BF3B7JY#wasThisHelpful","R14NZRL0H9U6CR","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say that the clarinetist on this disc, Julien Hervé, is a fantastic musician with quick fingers and a velvety tone that can turn sassy as needed. I've known all these pieces for many years and these performances are right at the top. I'm even one of that dwindling number of people who actually heard Benny Goodman and Joseph Szigeti play Bartók's 'Constrasts', and this performance by Hervé, Lovett and Sugitani does not take a back seat to their classic recording made with Bartók at the piano.The other works here are certainly classics for the clarinetists of their era. Poulenc's sonata was the very last thing he wrote before his death in 1963. He was in poor health and yet the outer movements have all the sauciness Poulenc was famous for. The middle movement, however, is one of Poulenc's cries of the soul, reminiscent of some things from his opera, 'Dialogues of the Carmelites'. The work was premièred a couple of months after Poulenc's death by Goodman with Leonard Bernstein at the piano.Aptly then, the next piece is by Bernstein himself, one of his very early works. He was 23 when he wrote it and it was his first published piece. It was not written for Goodman and I don't know if he ever played it. It wasn't as well known in the 1940s as it is now; every student now plays it at least partly because it is jazzy and 'modern' sounding in the sense of being mildly dissonant.I have to admit that I had a small problem with hearing Gershwin's Three Preludes, largely because for years I played them in their original piano-only form, had not heard them as arranged for clarinet and piano, and could not get the sound of piano-alone out of my ears. On relistening, though, I hear that the arrangement by James Cohn is expert and easy to like. The jazzy portamenti do remind one of that famous gliss at the beginning of Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue.'Stravinsky's 'Three Pieces' for solo clarinet were written in 1918, long before Goodman (b. 1909) was playing. But Stravinsky became a fan of jazz clarinet and wrote his 'Ebony Concerto' for Woody Herman in 1945; Benny Goodman recorded it a few years later under the baton of Stravinsky himself. The brief 'Three Pieces' are given soulful readings here by Hervé.Morton Gould wrote 'Benny's Gig', eight duos for clarinet and double bass (!); seven of them were written for Goodman in 1962 to take on tour to Russia, the eighth was written for Goodman's 70th birthday in 1979. The eight pieces take just under fifteen minutes and are a real workout for both instrumentalists. A good word must be put in for bassist Ying Lai Green.This is definitely a keeper. And it has already gone on my iPod, a thumbs up from me.Scott Morrison","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1YN9B306TNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGB3YW8#wasThisHelpful","RS1YN9B306TNS","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I might as well put my two cents in. This set of Haydn includes some absolutely classic performances and mostly from an era when orchestras were full-sized and vibrato was actually used. (I'm not a huge fan of 'original instruments' or 'historically informed performances'.) And then there are the marvelous voices from one of opera's golden ages (even though they're not singing opera per se).Since I had gotten a $1 credit for buying other CDs and mp3s at Amazon, I got this 180+ band set for a grand total of 9 cents.

"As I said in a review some years ago, I yield to no one in my love for the Brahms String Quintets. These late flowers from Brahms's pen are simply magnificent works that don't get played in recital as often as they should be because they require a string quartet to add a second violist. Thus touring quartets don't get to play it as often as they might like; most performances, then, are heard by groups from a local orchestra or university. And indeed this recording is made by principals from the Uppsala Chamber Orchestra in Sweden. It is an entirely creditable performance albeit a little scrawny at times, a no-no when playing these lush Brahms works. Still, the group plays with fervor and obvious love for these works and since this is a review of the mp3 version of this recording -- it is also available on CD -- it is at a lower price than a CD would cost.My own favorite recording of the works is that by principals of the Boston Symphony on the Nonesuch label Brahms String Quintets Opus 88 & 111 - Boston Symphony Chamber Players but there are others that are somewhat better than this one from Uppsala: the Hagen Quartet with violist Gerard Caussé Brahms: String Quintets, op. 88 & 111 (Hagen Quartet, Gerard Causse), the Ludwig Quartet with Bruno Pasquier Brahms: String Quintets Nos. 1 & 2 (on Naxos, and thus less pricey), and the Raphael Ensemble Brahms: String Quintets Nos.1 & 2 (also at a budget price). All the cited recordings are on CD, rather than mp3.Scott Morrison","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HI0NP9FPIUQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFCE1OW#wasThisHelpful","R2HI0NP9FPIUQE","A2PAD826IH1HFE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PAD826IH1HFE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually have a few Christmas trees in my possession and I thought this one was the easiest to put together. It's made up of three sections that are totally lightweight. The base is metal and comes with three large screws that you screw towards the base to hold it steady. The tree is nice and full but you have to make sure to fluff up the branches individually. It takes some time to get it to look nice but totally affordable. It's also a really nice height without being too small or too tall. I thought the top part was kinda long so I trimmed mine easily with the scissors. If you have something like an angel doll you put up at the top then the length might work well for you. You will experience shedding while putting it together but it's not that bad and doesn't affect the tree's look. Once you put all the decorations in tree it will look extra full and lovely.

"What a wonderful set of metallic toe nails these are! You have twelves different sizes to choose from so you are bound to get that perfect fit. It was really easy to match up the correct size to my toes. They applied really easily. I recommend putting the nail glue on your nail and then applying the decorative nail on top. You have to be careful as to not get glue on the decorative nail top or it can get smudged. I think it looks really cool and something unique I haven't seen around before. I love them!

"Wow, these are quite fantastic! They have a nice texture on them and were made very well. I think these would look best on a natural nail that has grown out some. I have short kept nails so they would need to be grown out more to look perfect. You just apply it to the tip of the nail and have the curve kind of fall in to look more natural with it. There's so many different sizes that come in this set (10) and plenty of each to give you a few manicures straight from home. They are really easy to apply or you can just take them over to your favorite nail tech for application. I think they are gorgeous and would be great for the Holidays right now.

"I really love these socks and they are quite soft. They are very comfortable and keep my calves so warm. They probably could have gone just a bit over my knee if I wanted but my legs aren't exactly super skinny so it would look funny on me. I like to wear them just below the knee which looks cute.

"I love sports bras since they are so comfortable and this bra by Fittin is exactly that. I got mine in black and in a size Large. I am a 34B and I am 135 lbs at 5'3"". It pretty much fit me perfectly. The straps didn't dig into me which is important and gave me some lift. The material was breathable and the cups inside sat how it should.

The handles are a nice polished wood which is comfortable to hold for accuracy. The brush fibers are not super soft and not too hard. They are just perfect right in the middle.

The bag is very durable and comfortable to wear on my 5'3"" body frame. Something else I saw on this bag that I don't see often is how it's split into two compartments down the middle side of it.

"I've tried many different kinds of coconut oil and this one smells really nice compared to some of the others. It has a very fresh coconut scent. The jars were sealed properly which left me with very fresh and high quality coconut oil. I prefer to use this stuff for DIY product making at home such as body butter, lip balms and soap. It melts as it should and hardens up fine at both temperature settings. I haven't used this in cooking but this would be excellent for searing since it's a lot healthier to use.

"This hydration pack is really efficient and perfect for people who don't have much to carry with them. The best thing about this is how comfortable it is to wear around you. The back portion of it is kind of like a flat board on your back but comfy at the same time. You can definitely fit a small laptop or tablet in here easily. There are small pockets on the sides to store things and you have the strap going across it to hold something down.

You have to make sure to get it large enough to fit over a shirt as well. I would recommend going up two sizes though going up one size was fine with loosening.

It held three 6 packs of plastic soda bottles stacked on top of each other and survived the trip from the car to my kitchen. It definitely beats trying to grab them with my hands.

"These felted wall tiles are huge! These can definitely be used in so many different ways for decoration. You could use them as posters on a wall or like a framed art piece. You could even cover a whole wall with these if you wanted. It's actually pretty affordable to do if you want to skip something like wallpaper. These don't come with adhesive so you would have to get some at your local hardware store. I personally would go with a  sheet vinyl adhesive if possible. You just have to be careful because you want something that's strong but not something that will ruin the wall if you plan to take it down later on. I just wanted to point out that the stock photo looks kind of green for the damask print but it looks black in person.

"This plate is so cute! The finish on the wood is gorgeous and I wanted it as a small candy dish. You could also use it for eating small desserts. This would be excellent to have in a pair or group of four for guests. There is a slight curve to the plate as well so you don't have to worry about syrups or juices running off of it.

"I wanted this to hold my wooden cooking utensils. The fit is absolutely perfect. I really do hope they make this same holder in a darker wood color at some point but I am happy with it for sure. There are holes in the bottom so you can wash and dry it easily. The finish of the wood is smooth and the holder is weighted. You can feel and see the high quality of it in person.

"I have been reviewing for Amazon for a long time. I received these glasses for testing and review purpose. I have probably tested around 10 pairs of different brands of sunglasses which were all over the quality spectrum. Looking at the price, I honestly didnt expect these glasses to be of substantial quality.These glasses arrived well packaged and included a nice microfiber pouch as well as a microfiber cloth to clean the lenses. The lenses are polarized which are great for wearing in the sun, but I would prefer non polarized as all my devices look psychedelic while wearing these glasses. Other than that, I highly recommend these glasses if you are looking for an affordable pair of glasses. These are comfortable and have a nice rubber coating by the bridge of the nose and on the arms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SLPKKG7NLVVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GLMD0K#wasThisHelpful","R1SLPKKG7NLVVR","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We received this scarf about 3 days ago. I immediately gave it to my wife who was ecstatic. She loves the Tahari brand and could not wait to try it out. Everything she has ever owned from this brand has been extremely high quality and long lasting all while maintaining the upmost comfort. Today was a very windy day, so she finally had the opportunity to wear this scarf in some adverse weather. The scarf did an exceptional job at keeping her neck warm. She said she the wind was a non factor, and we had winds in excess of 40 mph due to a November storm here in the Midwest with a current Tornado watch. That really says something right there.The scarf itself is a very comfortable and soft fabric. It is machine made, but it gives the appearance of an expensive hand knit scarf. The material is 100% acrylic which is a good material for avoiding smells and odors. Acrylic scarves are known to keep their shape, color and also resist staining etc. Acrylic is also extremely lightweight and a good option if you have allergic reactions to wool, or are just someone who has sensitive skin.Style wise this scarf is superb. It fits her neck perfectly, protects her neck and just exudes an elegant appearance. If you are in the market for a winter scarf, look no further. This is literally the best scarf at an unbelievable price. Local big box stores sell a lesser quality version of this scarf for double the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQIJVDX6BQLGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170V9FA2#wasThisHelpful","RQIJVDX6BQLGZ","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this diffuser for about a week. This product is exceptional compared to other diffusers I have used. The color of the LEDS are very nice and I like the fact you can see the water moving a bit in the unit while it is operating. It adds to the depth of the color.To use the product is simple. Merely twist off the top, fill the unit with water up to the max fill line. By some concentrated essential oil, and add 2-4 drops depending on the strength of the aroma you are after. Instructions state 1-2 drops, we tried it with one drop and the aroma was not as strong as we would like.The best feature is the auto off feature. This feature shuts the device off when it senses there is not anymore water left to evaporate. This provides a sense of security that you can leave it on and fall asleep in bed. For that I recommend the Lavender oil, it really helps to relax you.Overall a great diffuser and an exceptional product.Product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTKONUQ8GBXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016I5KOW4#wasThisHelpful","R1YTKONUQ8GBXO","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Sentey Headphones about a week ago and I immediately opening the shipping box.  The headphones themselves come in an extremely elegant packaging, the packaging rivals that of Beats or Sennheiser headphones.  This packaging allows people to purchase these for a gift, because it gives off the appearance of a headphone 4x its price range.Upon removing the headphones from their box, I immediately was drawn to the design of these headphones.  They are extremely sleek and modern looking in appearance.  Also the brushed stainless steel finish is superb, it really makes these headphones look elegant.  The ear cups each reside below a hinge that allows you to fold up the headphones for easy storage in an included hard case.  The hard case is a huge benefit as you can now travel with your headphones with piece of mind that no damage will come about.  These headphones do connect via a 3.5mm jack, and have in inline mic along the cable for chatting.These heaphones have ear pads that encompass your entire ear, or Over the Ear earcups.I have a fairly large head, 7 5/8, and these were not tight at all on my head.  I do wish these came with an alternative velour ear pad as I find the velour material easier to use for prolonged time as my ears stay drier.The sound quality of these headphones are easily an 7.5/10.  I own dozens of headphones.  My everyday headphones are Sennheiser HD 600, I game with Sennheiser G4ME Zero/mixamp combo, I also have the Audio Technica AD700 for gaming with modmic.  I then have 4-5 sub 50 dollar headphones that I would all rate around a 4/10 or less.  These are substantially better than the cheap Sony headphones that I thought were a good budget buy.  I did not experience any distortion and I was quite happy with all three levels of sound, Highs, mids and lows.  These are a closed headphone, so sound leakage is kept to a minimum when you are in a public space. Of course you obviously must keep volume lower to achieve greater success at reducing sound leakage, but it is substantially less than an open back design.Overall probably the best headphones I have heard under 50 dollars.  They feel high quality and sound high quality.  The hinges are well built, and feel better than the Playstation Gold Headset hinges.Product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9TAQUUZ9U2E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMX5AY#wasThisHelpful","R9TAQUUZ9U2E3","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this LED Touch Lamp about 2 weeks ago from iRULU.  The lamp itself is a very futuristic design and it is very sleek.  It has a bright LED light that is emitted and it is plenty bright with the available different lighting options present.The lamp itself is comprised of 3 pieces that are interlocked by hinges.  The top light can be moved up and down to aim the direction of light to where it is needed.  The lamp has 3 different settings on it for light temperature.  It has a 2700k, 3500k and 5000k light output mode.  On top of the options, you can adjust the light brightness by using one of the five available levels of brightness.The lamp itself has no buttons and has a touch sensitive base.  I havent really seen a touch lamp since the 1980's and it was a pleasant surprise.  It really makes using the lamp simplified. There is a LCD screen that has a blue backlight.  On the LCD you have a the time, date and temperature.  There is an alarm but I would not really rely on it as I found the volume to be a bit insufficient for a medium to heavy sleeper.Overall this is a great product and I am happy that iRULU provided me a sample to test and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA8L5ROXJ1AI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GQBHUY#wasThisHelpful","RA8L5ROXJ1AI8","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I recently came to a revelation.  I need new clothes.  My style has been stuck in the 90's with cargo shorts and baggy shirts that dont fit.  We are going on vacation this winter so I decided it was time to get back into style. A little about myself, I am 6'6"" and currently weigh 235lbs.  Finding clothes that fit takes hours upon hours going from store to store to find clothing that fits. That is part of the reason why I never wanted to buy new clothes.  The clothes are either really baggy because of needed length or if you buy big and tall, its normally boxy due to being more big than tall.You tall guys know what I am talking about so I will leave it at that.  This shirt fits great thought.  It does have a slight slim fit to it that makes it less boxy, which is the look you want.  By no means is this shirt skin tight.  Like I said I am 6'6"" and 235lbs.  I first bought size XXL and it was boxy and wide.  I then ordered a XL to compare in my house before returning one of them.  The XL is exactly the fit I needed. The arms themselves are shorter than I am used to, but the length of the shirt itself is PERFECT for tall people.  I highly recommend trying this shirt if you are having trouble finding shirts that actually fit your tall body.Overall this is a great shirt,  fit is good and feels comfortable.  Hope this makes the shopping process easier for other tall people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BCM66M8DADR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5GDYOW#wasThisHelpful","R22BCM66M8DADR","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this watch from Burei about a week ago.  I was surprised at just how well the watch was packaged.  The box it came in is very fancy and the watch was wrapped around a jewelry pillow giving it a very high end feel.  At this sub 40 dollar price range, I was not expecting to see anything like that.The watch itself has a polished stainless steel bland that is very classy and elegant.  So far the band has resisted scratches well.  The front of the dial contains an elegant black face with chrome markings to indicated time.  The date is displayed in a white rotary dial and can be displayed in both english and spanish according to the instructions.According to the listing, the watch has a Miyota quartz movement which is a very accurate way of maintaining time in wrist watches. It is a proven method and used by some very well known brands of watches.Also the dial is water resistant up to 100ft which will provide peace of mind for most users who are concerned about contact with water.

"My wife is a marathon runner and was excited when this product arrived. Upon opening the product she immediately noticed it didnt get as small as she needed, she is a waist size 22-24. So in turn I had to use the product as I have a waist size of 36.  Once I put the belt on, I filled the bottles with water and took a run with my wife.The greatest feature I feel is that the inside of the runners belt has an anti slip layer.  Its sort of a grippy rubber/silicone that will hold onto your body or clothing which prevents the belt from bouncing or riding up while you run.  All my previous belts suffer from that so this feature makes the belt stand out.I currently use a LG G3 phone in a large bulky Otterbox type case.  The case I use is called a Ballistic SG Case.  My phone easily fit in the pouch.  Also inside the pouch is a clip for your house key.  One thing I will recommend is washing out the bottles prior to using, I do this will all new products.Other than that, this is a great product that is very well made and thought out.

"Great set of pruning shears. My wife and I have found ourselves gardening more this year. We used these shears on our Rose bushes, rasberry bushes and some clematis. We had zero difficulty cutting through any stems or branches with these. The cuts were smooth and did not damage the plant any more than needed during the cut. Our old shears would fray the stems when cutting flowers as they werent sharp enough to cut through.These shears have the ability to be stored closed so to avoid any possible injury from the sharp blades. I ran my finger along the shears when they were closed and it does a good job and hiding the blade to prevent accidental cuts to fingers if placed in a toolbox with other small tools. The grips on the shears are rubberized and prevent any slippage and gives you good grip to make a cut cleanly.

"I received this product for my wife about 3 weeks ago now.  It came in a well packaged box and immediately I began assembling it.  Instructions were clear and thorough and all necessary tools are provided for assembly.  Assembly itself probably took me around 15 minutes.  While I was putting everything together, every pieces I touched made me certain that this was a well built product, and a product that can withstand years of use.The reason behind wanted a device such as this was for my wife while she worked.  My wife is a highly active person, and she just recently obtained a desk job that requires her to be seated in front of a computer for the entire day.  She was getting restless and fidgety and needed some way to expend some energy.  This is where the FitDesk comes in.After assembly, I actually packed up the FitDesk and drove it up to surprise my wife.  When I started going into her office, everyone there started looking at me really strangely.  I arrived at my wifes desk and to she immediately got excited to try it out.  She placed it under her desk, locked her wheeled desk chair into the included chair lock on the elliptical and started to exercise.The elliptical itself is EXTREMELY quiet.  If you have a cubicle or whatever, you will not disturb anyone else around you.  We have not encountered any squeaking yet over 3 weeks, but I informed my wife that if it does squeak, just spray some wd40 near the wheels. My wife averages about 250 calories burned a day on this elliptical and she is just ecstatic.  Her knees do not hit the desk, changing resistance is easily done with her feet.  This is a superbly thought out product and the build quality is fantastic.My wife was so happy with her new FitDesk Elliptical, we actually started telling all of our friends on our various forums and facebook running groups.  A lot of people have asked questions and a couple have actually purchased this product based upon our experiences.  They have both written to us thanking us for providing them with an honest opinion.  Out of all the products I have tested here on Amazon, I can easily say that the FitDesk is the best product to date.This product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FS00ERUGOK18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIBYETQ#wasThisHelpful","R1FS00ERUGOK18","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I recently lost some weight and was actually needing to get a new wedding band, as my original Tungsten ring was too large.  Tungsten is a strong metal that cannot be resized.

I work with my hands and do not see any scratches at all on the finish of the ring.  I have very sensitive skin and I have had no reaction at all to the materials used in this ring.  I highly recommend this product as the fit and finish is exceptional.  This is one of the few companies that gives a no questions asked 30 day return policy.Product was obtained for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131M9G0IP9YP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BH1NN8#wasThisHelpful","R131M9G0IP9YP6","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the 12 Liter version about 2 weeks ago.  This unit will store about 3 gallons of water which is a good amount for a family of 4. Upon opening the filtration system from its package, you really can sense this is a high quality product.  Included instructions are very clear and well written. Setting up the Lifestraw filtration system is easy as well.  You simply have to find a source of water, ideally the cleanest water available to you at any given point.  Fill up the bag, roll it, seal it and then hang the bag.The next thing you do is attach the hoses.  You then allow some water to escape/purge from the red colored valve which is going to be the polluted/unfiltered water, remember red means stop.  You then wait until you see water coming from the blue valve which will be your clean filtered water.  This is the water you are able to drink. When you are done, you can roll up your filtration system and store it in the included carrying bag.This system is a top of the line gravity fed filtration system.  If you plan on hiking long distance in the wild, oftentimes it is too burdensome or impossible to carry enough supplies with you to last your entire trip.  I know I am going to gift this to a family member who is planning on taking on the Appalachian trail within the year. I will update this review to reflect upon how well this product helped him during his bucket list challenge.Product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JL5HPEZ4VX3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWAP2SU#wasThisHelpful","R3JL5HPEZ4VX3O","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife received these earrings about a week ago.  We were very happy upon opening the package and seeing these.  The earrings themselves arrived in a small black jewelry box that makes gifting simple.  The outside covering is a nice suede/velvet type covering that gives it a nice touch.  Also included inside the package is a microfiber cleaning cloth that will allow you to keep the earrings looking new.The earrings themselves seem of good quality.  My wife really loved the violet color.  It is a unique design of the cube that accentuates the violet and makes the earrings flashy.

"I received this bottle opener about a week ago.  Upon removing it from the box, I was a bit skeptical on how well this opener would work.  While examining the product, it basically is just a plastic covering with an enclosed magnet that will catch the cap once you pop it off.I tried it first on my Mexican Coca Cola bottles.  The cap came off really easy and attached to the magnet.  I then proceeded to try it on some of my apple ciders.  Each time I used it, the cap came off on the first try and the cap was caught by the bottle openers magnet.  It really is a neat little gadget and it can make a great stocking stuffer.Now I do not know if this really could replace a wall mounted bottle opener, as that is the easiest of all openers to use. You simply walk up with one hand, insert your bottle, and pop the top off.  What I think the next step for this product should be would be to design a wall mounted version, that will collect the caps as you pop them off.  That is my holy grail.Product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2EA1G5R0PGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N177OSU#wasThisHelpful","RI2EA1G5R0PGI","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this thermal mug about a week ago.  Immediately upon opening the box, you could tell this was a quality product.  The only part of the mug I didn't like was the handle, I think it is a bit thin and awkward to hold.  A wider/thicker handle would provide a better grip and make it more comfortable to hold.The mug itself is constructed of stainless steel.  The manufacturer does not list if this is dishwasher safe, so I have been hand washing my mug to ensure longevity. The mug itself is double walled, but I am not sure if it is vacuumed like a thermos or not.  Either way it does allow my beverage to stay cold longer.  I do not have a timeframe that says how much longer it kept it cold.  Overall a good product with room for improvement.  I gave the product 4 stars and it would easily be 5 stars with a better handle.Product was obtained for testing and review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RT55F5HUWIYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142FM1NM#wasThisHelpful","R2RT55F5HUWIYB","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item about 2 weeks ago and finally got  a chance to use it.  It is really easy to install, you simply slide it over the umbrella pole and it adjusts to fit the size of the pole.  The unit is plenty bright, I do wish it allowed you to aim the lights that shine down.The light comes with 4 rechargeable batteries that powers the LED bulbs.  The great thing about LED is it doesnt attract as many bugs as our old lights did.  There arent as many moths etc flying at these lights.  I would rate the color of these lights around 3500-4000k, so your average LED light output.  It isnt a soft white, more of a white so it isnt really a soft white light.Overall the light worked well, recharging was simple and I would recommend this as an affordable lighting solution for your patio table at night.Product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20C4REEXX1LLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHMQAYO#wasThisHelpful","R20C4REEXX1LLO","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have recently gone on a kick to review a bunch of bluetooth speakers. For listening at work and at home while cleaning/showering,  This speaker gets plenty loud. All the devices tested (LG Optimus G Pro, Kindle Fire HD, Samsung S5) all found and connected via bluetooth seamlessly to the speaker. The whole process took 10 seconds or less for each device.The sound that is delivered is clear, crisp and full. I listen to alot of 80's pop/rock and punk while my wife listens to Country.

"Just like another reviewer, I also had an opportunity to review the EcoGreen storage space saver product, which were storage bags that did not require a pump but instead you rolled them to get the air out.  I was then contacted to see if I was willing to try these bags that come with a hand pump to extract all the air out of the storage bags.The bags I received were of high quality.  They all worked properly and they were nice and thick.  What I did prior to pumping the air out was to squeeze as much as out as I could by hand, this should save on the effort required to use the pump to get the rest out.  Another review advised that because they were over 50, it became burdensome to pump so many time.  I implore them to try to roll or squeeze as much air out prior to pumping, it should cut the effort in half or more.Overall these are a high quality storage item at a great price.This product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D9B4B8D1EH48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QO8H1S#wasThisHelpful","R3D9B4B8D1EH48","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this knife set for the past week.  I am extremely pleased with the quality of this set.  All knives feel well balanced and feel high quality.

My everyday set of knives cost 3x the amount these go for and I cannot tell any difference in the weight, feel, or cutting ability between the two sets.  I am not a chef, but I do cut alot of meat and veggies as we cook at home daily.

"I received this speaker about two weeks ago and just recently began to use it. When I first opened the box, the speaker had a nice shiny, black color. The speaker is very lightweight, and is constructed of a plastic surround. I did like the fact that the speaker has an actual button to turn the speaker on and off specifically dedicated for that function. Also on the top, there is a play/pause button, and a volume button. All the buttons feel nice and solid to the touch. The sound of the speaker is good. It competes with many speakers around its price range. The one area that I feel the speaker lacks in is having any discernible bass. The speaker is nice and clear though and makes up for it in that respect.Bluetooth pairing was extremely simple, probably took about 6 seconds for my phone to locate the device. During playback, there was no dropped bluetooth connection while using my LG G3 while playing Pandora/Amazon Music. Battery life is pretty good too, lasting around 5-6 hours of playback on high volume. I did walk into other rooms with my phone, around 20-30 feet away without any dropout or disconnecting from the bluetooth. So the bluetooth strength is good.The compact form and the clear mids/highs gives this speaker a 4.5 rating. If there was a way to get this speaker a little increase in bass, the speaker would easily be a 5. As it stands its a solid contender in an extremely competitive small speaker market.Product was received for testing and review purposes","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36595ZHWHA1JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RCTEJVS#wasThisHelpful","R36595ZHWHA1JM","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I received this set about a week ago now.  We have opened 4 bottles up to this point and the process has been simple.  Both products seem to be of high quality, although I have had other foil cutters that last a short while, so the verdict is still out on the foil cutter.  Both products arrived in a nice display type box that I am using on top of my wine hutch.  It is a nice black box with subtle wine red lettering.In order to use the set, we first used the foil cutter and cut open the foil, which allows you to expose the cork.  We then placed the bottle opener on top of the wine bottle and pressed in the handles on the wine opener.  We then pulled down the lever which causes the cork to become punctured thus allowing an easy removal of said cork. You simply pull up on the lever and the cork pops out.  It truly is a simple way to open a bottle.This set is a great gift set as well due to the fact it comes in such a nice box.  Makes gifting it alot easier for those you know who love the finer things in life.  Overall a great product.

"I received this camera a week or so ago. I have used many different types of IP cameras in the past and consider myself to be experienced in the use of this type of camera. The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that I really enjoyed the sleek black look of this camera. It really enables you to place it someplace without sticking out like a sore thumb.Included in the package is the IP Camera, mounting hardware, the power cord, a usb cord,  and an instruction booklet. The setup of this camera is extremely similar to other types of IP cameras. There is an app available to view this camera via your smartphone which is how I set this camera up. Once the app was downloaded, the setup process took me about 8-10 minutes to have the camera live and to have it setup where I wanted the camera to record. I liked that this camera will actually notify you via email when there is motion or sound detected within the selected field of view.The quality of the image is very good as well. In normal light situations, the images appear clear and the ability to see what you are looking at is extremely easy. Night vision also provides a good image. While it isnt as detailed as the normal light conditions, it still allows you to see facial features if someone happened into the field of view. I would say a safe night vision distance for facial recognition would be 15-25ft max.The ability to pan and tilt via the smartphone app is a great feature. I have been looking into the possibility of paying for an app that actually will store recorded images offsite just in case I were ever to need ""evidence"" for something that occurred in my home.I have over 100/25 Mbps download/upload internet speed, but still experience artifact and lag issues at times. Granted lag/artifact can be present on all brands of IP Cameras, I just wish someone could solve the issue and allow a more fluid pan/tilt feature Other than this issue, the camera has functioned well and has provided me with the ability to see my home while away from home. Its a means to peace of mind and safety.Item provided for testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEOKJBCD69TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145OQTPG#wasThisHelpful","R2OEOKJBCD69TN","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this wallet about a week ago for my wife.  Upon opening it we were excited as the wallet felt really nice, like a high quality wallet.  The one touch of the exterior we didn't like was the big gold badge with the company name on the wallet.  Maybe a lower corner logo or the like would make the wallets appearance that much better.With this being a RFID blocking wallet, I expected that the wallet may be heavier than normal.  You really cannot discern any difference from a non RFID wallet, to this wallet that has the ability to block it. Inside of the wallet, there are various pockets.  We love the number of pockets that are available to store cash, cards and other goodies.  The thing we didn't like was the material that was used inside the wallet, it was the reason why I dropped the star. Its almost like a vinyl type material that holds all of the cards.  It would be so much better if the wallet actually was made with the same exterior material on the inside.  It would feel more high quality and probably be more durable.We like the fact that it zips up to protect your items.  Other than the few areas I hope to see improvement in, this is a really good wallet for a low price that will protect your cards from being attacked.  Wallet was provided to me for testing and review purposes and I strive to be extremely honest in my reviews.

" 2:38 MinsThis is really a terrific power washer.  I received the power washer extremely quickly after ordering directly from Powerhouse.  Assembly of the unit was easily achieved and the included instructions made assembly and operation easy.  As you can see in the video, I put this power washer to the test.  I used it on my extremely dirty patio that is filled with mildew and dirt from years of abuse.  This patio has never been power washed, yet this electric power washer cut through the grime and made my patio appear new.Also in the video you will see me using it on my siding.  The siding was dirty and when the water is rushing off of my siding, you can literally see black water sliding down the house as all the dirt is swept away.  It knocked old leaves, spider webs and general gunk off of my home with easy.  The ability adjust the pressure on the nozzle was awesome allowing me to ensure my siding would not be damaged.This power washer does come with a spinning patio cleaner.  Seeing that my patio was never cleaned in the 20 years I have lived there, I needed the strongest stream of water to clean off the patio.  The adjustable nozzle changes the stream of water from a wide fan to a narrow stream of water.  The handle is a foldable handle and a soap bottle is included to attach and spray soap on say a deck or even the siding.  All you would have to do is simply attach the soap dispenser and turn the tab to on.  You can then turn it to off but continue to use the power washer without the need to disconnect it.  It really is a great system and it is quite powerful for being run off electric.Overall this is an extremely high quality power washer.  If I had one complaint is that the base of the power washer is quite narrow, so the unit tips over quite easily while you are moving around and reach the end of the hose line.  If there was a way to balance it a bit better, this would improve an already exceptional product.This product was received in exchange for my testing and reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUK9V0ONXQLQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVLL3WO#wasThisHelpful","RUK9V0ONXQLQ4","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the even more recent events unfolding in the news, I decided it was time to get a second dash cam to protect my family and myself. There is no better witness out there than video evidence. I am glad I did, I now have an extra set of eyes that records every move and can prove my version of events if ever needed. When opening the box, you can expect to find an array of things such as: The Dash Cam itself, a suction mount, USB cable for charging, USB cable with 12v outlet for power while in your vehicle, and a 16gb kingston micro SD card. .The camera itself is alot smaller than I imagined it from the pictures on Amazon. It basically sits in the palm of your hand which is great because it doesnt obstruct your view while on the windshield recording. The camera itself barely weighs anything and is easily held in place by the included suction cup. When you have the camera plugged in via the included 12v power cord, the camera will turn on when the vehicle ignition is turned on and turn off when the ignition is turned off. This makes it easy and effortless to record your video. Daytime recording is very clear and it is easy to make out the license plates of the vehicles in front of you. Nighttime driving is slightly grainy, but all of these night vision cameras have this same downside.Overall this camera is an excellent product that should provide video recording for many years to come. I havent found any issues to date with the camera and operation has been flawless over the past week.  I have not attempted the GPS as I didnt want the additional cord run along my dash. I have looked at various videos to check on the quality and it has all been consistently good. One last note is you can set your segments on the recording to 3 minutes, 5 minutes or 10 minute loops. This means the video will be saved in these increments making finding what you need alot easier. Again, a great product that I received directly from Black Box in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293DSRX1ND06C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KNU880#wasThisHelpful","R293DSRX1ND06C","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the Black Box F1S 1080P dashboard dash camera about a week ago.  I immediately took it out of the box and foudn it came with the camera itself,  a micro USB cable, a windshield suction mount, a micro usb cable with adapter for the car,  a gps antenna, and the instructions.The reason for the 4 star rating is the fact it did not come with a SD card and required the end user to purchase it.  I have sampled other dash cams that include the card at a comparable price.The camera itself is extremely simple to use.  The first thing I did was clean my windshield to ensure a nice clean surface to adhere to.  I attached the mount and camera.  The hardest thing I did was make a run up to the top of my headliner, ran the cord down the passenger A pillar, and then ran it under the dash to a cigarrette outlet to provide power.  I wish there was an easier way to run a power source, but that will be the most challenging aspect to mounting a dash cam.  Once that is done, everything else is easy.Picture quality wise, this little camera is very good.  Night vision is on par with other dash cams I have tried.  It becomes difficult to read plate numbers more than a car lengths away, but that is the normal limitations of these types of cameras. You can select how many minute loop time you would like, I normally choose 3 or 5 minute intervals.  I always keep the resolution set at its highest and it averages just about 10gb every hour.  On a 32gb sd card, you will have around 3 hours of video.The camera does has an option to replay video on the screen.  This is useful if you were in an automobile accident and a police officer would like to view the accident itself.  The screen is 2.7 inches but it is clear and you can see the video on demand.  There is an auto off and auto on mode where the camera while plugged into the DC power will power itself on and off when the ignition is turned on.Overall a very good dashcam at a good price.  I would prefer if it shipped with either a 16-32gb sd card as they cost very little and the camera requires one to operate.Product was received for testing and review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCVVJ34BYFBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT65KZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1GCVVJ34BYFBE","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been playing with this camera for a little over a week now.  It is a really good camera for an extraordinary price when you compare it with the big box store model that is very popular, its barely a fraction of the price. The camera came boxed in packaging that would make it stand out on any shelf, it actually is really nice packaging. While unpacking, you will find the camera, some accessories like mounts/arms/stands, a case which is waterproof, instructions and the USB Cable.The camera itself is really easy to use.  Its very small and weights around 2 ounces making it easy to bring everywhere you need it.  There are only a couple buttons on the camera itself making operation simplified for people of all age groups.  The software on the camera is pretty good and playback is easily achieved but difficult to view on the smallish screen.I read on a previous review about which memory card to buy.  I found a 32gb Samsung Class 10 card on sale for 17 dollars at a big box store.  I have been using that card without issue.  Video records well and I have not lost any footage that I have recorded.  Video quality is very good as well, motion shots have turned out with minimal blur.  Microphone quality is average, and some wind noise should be expected.Overall a great camera considering the price point.  I was provided the camera for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBYYDNDI93PZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT6V5H0#wasThisHelpful","R2SBYYDNDI93PZ","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the InaRock 2-in-1 Solar Powered LED Landscape Light a few days ago. I do have a few other solar lights that I have purchased for almost double the price and this is equal to the quality of those found in the Orange colored big box store. This light has an output of 200 lumens through the use of 4  LED bulbs. The best part of this light is that it is solar powered so there is no continuous cost of batteries like in other lights or the need to run wiring.Inside the box is everything you need to operate the light.  There are two mounting options, a ground stake, and screws for mounting it elsewhere.  I used it with the ground stake and have it aimed up on a white birch trunk.  It works really well for this purpose.  The one thing I was really hoping for was the ability to maybe have a cord to run the solar panel a few feet away enabling me to place it in an area that may not get direct sunlight.Overall this is a great light and I highly recommend it up to this point.Product was received for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ZSAOOVKS4OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011O8OXXG#wasThisHelpful","R20ZSAOOVKS4OG","A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TGT1Q4QHXB2H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:16 Mins hi there-i ordered 2 of these- i uploaded a video so u can see how they arrive & what you're getting-  were only $7 each when i ordered-these are smart chargers- they guarantee not to over charge your device & to charge your device at the safest, fastest rate capable.these are 20 watt & 4 amp_ i'm not a tekkie_ so in the vid i said each port was 2 amp_ BUT i read the fine print on the plug- & the top charging amp is actually 2.4_ but still can't go over 4 total.  so that basically means you can charge a tablet & a phone.  cause if one port is juicing you up at 2.4 amp then the other port can't give  you more than 1.6 amp...definitely faster than generic $5 wall chargers.because of the smart technology- PowerIQ is what Anker calls it- you don't have to worry about which port to plug the phone in & which port to plug the tablet in--- this is smart- so it figures that out for U & charges accordinglyi was impressed with the packaging & informational inserts_ they pretty much guarantee your satisfaction  if you're not- they include their phone # & email address so you can contact them.what if your phone/device is only 1 amp- will this burn it up ?  no it won't-  it will only supply the maximum charge current allowed by your phone/device- up to 2.4 amps.these are small enough for you to keep 1 in your purse/pocket_ in the desk drawer at work_in the glove box- if u can get them for $7 i'd buy a few & share with your friends & family.  a lot of the 4 & 5 port smart chargers were $20-ish_ so i decided to go with 2 separate units with 2 ports- so that i can leave 1 in the kitchen & 1 in the bedroom_ plus it was less expensive- $14 for two 2-port chargers.i hope that my shopping experience helps u with your shopping choices_ thanks","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSA4KQLEZUPAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8L36A6#wasThisHelpful","RSA4KQLEZUPAD","A2YIO225BTKVPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YIO225BTKVPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:31 Mins crisp cookie-- smooth-buttery caramel- all encased in milk-chocolatey goodness_  tastes great!the fun size bars make great snacks & good for portion control.- 1 stick/candy per wrapper- wrappers are foil/mylar to keep snack fresh.-even the bag is foil/mylar- so double wrapped for freshness.each fun size twix has 80 calories-  distributed by MARS inc.  they put the phone # on the bag & guarantee your enjoyment.i ordered Sep 2015 & 'use by date' is June 2016_ that's like 9 months shelf life_ so if the price is good- stock up.Sometimes u worry about ordering chocolate in warmer weather- but these arrived packaged in a box turned cooler- lined with thick layer insulation & 2 ice packs-- that were still mostly frozen  when arrived..  as you can see in video- arrived in pristine condition.i would recommend u get some if the price is reasonable_ i hope this was of some help in your decision making- thanks","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32L5YT8JNN7T5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B10XI0W#wasThisHelpful","R32L5YT8JNN7T5","A2YIO225BTKVPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YIO225BTKVPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"updated/edit_9-12-2015pepsi left a message for me in the comments_ i called them_ they apologized & sent me coupons for free pepsi products as compensation_i was pleasantly surprised that such a large company with so many products would make an effort to reach out to me & make things right.even though i did not like the cherry dew_ i love pepsi customer relations_ & i did find a way to enjoy the flat soda- i poured it into popsicle molds & froze_ it makes great popsicles- which makes sense- since it taste like a melted frozen slush/slurpee when it's liquid.I never thought that i'd HATE a soda with the name Mountain Dew_ cause i love the regular flavor Mountain Dew-so i assumed this was that Mountain Dew but with a splash of cherry....because on the label it says_ ""Dew with a Blast of Citrus Cherry Flavor""But this is not Dew- it doesn't even have orange juice in it- which is the 2nd ingredient listed on the regular Mountain Dew label.so what does it taste like ?  a melted Slurpee/slushy-  a frozen cherry slushy/Slurpee that's melted-& nowhere on the ingredient list is the ingredient cherry listed--- so it's NOT Mnt Dew & it's not real cherry- it's just gross.i received my case in August 2015 & the 'use by date' is September 2015_(see pics)_  so there was no carbonation- a few bubbles when you pour it over ice- but no bubbly, effervescent, fizzy  when you drink it..now i know why it was on sale- cause it's awful & was 1 month away from expiration date.i've posted some pics with 'use by' date & the label that says this soda is dew with a blast of cherry- which it wasn't.i do not recommend- if my experience was any help in your decision to buy or not buy- plz check the box saying so- thnx !","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V6CCX18QP5EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV6YBDO#wasThisHelpful","R1V6CCX18QP5EN","A2YIO225BTKVPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YIO225BTKVPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're looking for instructions/guide/hints_ do a search for abcarverpro guide _dot_comsome high lights if you want to know some of what you'll find_ some of what you need to know to effectively use this:The Ab Carver Pro has many modifications; like the one on its rolling function. The spring like mechanism, known as the carbon steel coil, installed in this equipment will create a resistance. That’s where you’re really working those ab muscles. When you roll back, it provides assistance.This workout can be a bit strenuous if you’ve never tried it before. That’s ok. Go easy on yourself. Your body needs some time to get accustomed to this workout. So if you’re a beginner, intermediate or advanced, there’s a different rolling plan for each:For beginners:If you’re a beginner, position yourself about 12-15 inches against the wall, and roll out against it.  The wall will act as a blockade, so that your rolling is controlled. Your thigh area should be approximately 65-70 degrees against the floor. By doing so, you’re allowing yourself to understand the movement and exercise.For intermediary:At intermediary level, there is no such need to use the wall as a barrier. Roll out a little further than the beginners’ level, with your thighs about 45 degrees against the floor.For advanced:This is a pro position. If you’ve worked with an ab wheel for some time now, then this is the position you should be going for. For the advanced level, roll against the floor.Based on the level you’re rolling at, roll forward and backward; 5 seconds to roll forward and 5 seconds to roll back.Step 4: Rolling left and rightNow that you’ve understood the rolling, let’s move on. Continue the same movement in step 3. Use the handle to maneuver the grip to the left and right by placing pressure downwards. The wide wheel of the Ab Carver Pro and the coil system will allow an easier turn, without putting added pressure on your lower back.This position of alternating between forward, left and right will exercise your obliques.Step 5: Pace yourselfIf this is your first time, carve about 10 repetitions or “reps”; that is 5 left and 5 right. Remember, this exercise is not about how fast you can accomplish a certain round; it’s about exercising your muscles without causing them injury. Most people wrongly presume that if they work out faster, they are burning more calories. Not quite.

"I ordered this at the end of Oct 2014_ it was only $60 with free s/h then. i would not pay the $80 + that some vendors are charging now.i've been using it a couple of months now- & it's worked wonderfully.  i honestly didn't have very high expectations of this- but i figured i could return it if it sucked.  But it ended up working great.  you've got to follow the instructions. Does NOT get as fizzy/bubbly as store bought- no matter how many times i press the button to carbonate water_ but it does get adequately fizzy_ i would prefer more fizzy/bubble.i've noticed a lot of people who rated this low have been because of user error_ 1 customer complained that he didn't know how to plug it in- & how amazon & sodastream ruined his christmas holiday table- because when he tried to carbonate his wine- it sprayed all over the table.....it states clearly in description & in instructions that this is to be used to carbonate only water----there are even pieces of paper in the included bottles- that you have to pull out to use the bottles- that say-  only carbonate water with this machine....he did manage to figure out how to make it work without plugging it in (because it doesn't plug in)_ he even managed to carbonate with it-  the problem was he tried to carbonate wine instead of water.- i'm sure you've seen similar.it's true that you don't save much, if any money, using this machine/system_ the benefits/pluses of owning it are you don't have to carry cans/bottles to & from the store.  & you don't create as much waste/recycling. you can keep unique flavors at home that you can't find in store.You can save money-if you modify your machine to use other carbonation tanks (which sodastream doesn't want you to do- but lots of people successfully do it w/o problems.  U can also save money if you use other sources for flavors/soda-syrups._ some of the reviews here have mentioned how to make your own syrups or to use brand name soda pop syrups or to use slushy machine syrups, etc._ you can find lots of info by googling what you want to know.you can also save money by shopping at the sodastream website.  they have an outlet/clearance section where they offer syrups for 1/2 off_ they say they're a couple/few months away from expire date- so not to order more than you would use in a couple months.You can also order xtra carbonation tanks from them.  this machine will take the larger 130 size tank-  it's only $50 at sodastream website- plus they have free s/h with $50 purchase___so don't let other vendors try to sell you these 60 size tanks for more than $30 or the 130 size tanks for more than $50_ because you can get them directly from sodastream with free s/h..another benefit is you can make/mix your own flavors_  i add a splash of cream soda to the orange- & it tastes just like a creamsicle or orange push-up pops. you can make your soda weaker/stronger to your taste- with bottled soda from store you have to drink it the way they make it.they say to pour the syrup in the bottle of carbonated water after it's carbonated.  but you risk fizz over- you have to wash the bottle- you risk spilling.- i have a large cup that holds 50 ounces of liquid- i put ice in it- i pour the flavor syrup over the ice- & then i pour the carbonated water from the bottle into the cup- it mixes in the cup as i pour the fizzy water- there's only ever water in the bottle- so i only have to put more water in it - put it back in fridge till my next use.the machine isn't pretty- it's a big chunk of flimsy plastic.  but if you don't move it around a lot or handle it too harshly-- it should last. & if you break the back cover the machine can still be used. if you break part of the side or bottom it can still be used.as long as the top stays in good shape the machine will work- the top parts are where you attach the tank & screw the bottle of water on to carbonate.  if you're crafty you can always decorate the plastic shell- that might be fun.  you can probably also by xtra shells cheap on ebay-","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17X33D8NEJYUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RGRE7A#wasThisHelpful","R17X33D8NEJYUP","A2YIO225BTKVPU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YIO225BTKVPU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:16 MinsI really like this.  it was $23 when I bought it- less expensive than most toasters.First use was for reheating leftover pizza.  It did an excellent job at reheating the pizza without making it soggy like the microwave does.I put a piece of foil on bottom plate-so I wouldn't have to clean the grill-  the top plate can be locked in any position- so it doesn't touch top of pizza. The bottom of pizza became crispy & the pizza heat all the way thru in just a few minutes. There was enough room for 2  thick, square pieces plus a couple of breadsticks.The instructions say this is not to be used to cook things like steak & burgers.The top plate can be locked in any position between fully opened & closed.The cord can be wound around pegs under bottom plate.There's a clip to lock machine in closed position.It can be stored on side only taking about 5 inches of counter space.Instruction book has a few recipes using tortillas, pizza crust, refrigerator crescent rolls.You can go to Hamilton beach website to register appliance & find more recipes.It comes with a 1 year warranty- but we have to pay for shipping to & from repair center- & if you can buy a new 1 for $25-ish__ it might be cheaper to buy a new one.It's very sturdy/solid- metal & hard plastic.

"I am conflicted about this review. Yes, the vacuum is lightweight but the heaviest part is the unit above that you have to support throughout vacuuming so it seems heavier than it really is.It is a fairly compact vacuum but there is no way to get it to stand on its own- the brush unit does not lock into place for stand-up mode; it just hangs limply. Which is why, I discovered, there is an included hanging hook- because that is the only way to store it.I like the nozzle attachment but there is no where that it can attach to the unit so when I need it, I have to run and fetch from wherever I last left it.I do like the extra long cord and I like the cloth bottomed unit for cleaning my hardwood floors. And I also really like the easy dump debris canister. And for a more thorough cleaning, the filter comes out from the top of the recepticle.I also like that I can take off the extender, put on the nozzle and use it like a small power vacuum for edges and crevices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LQOVH5I7WLFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142VVAPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LQOVH5I7WLFW","A3SQQYS79AV13M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SQQYS79AV13M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, you're looking at this title wondering, ""Did she accidentally fall into being a feminist?"" ""Did she wake up and discover she is a feminist and needs out?"" The title is ambiguous, so allow me; Courtney Reissig is a ""complimentarian,"" as opposed to ""egalitarian."" So that's the premise for the book.Before I get all sorts of ugly comments and shoved in the ""man-hater"" box let me state that  I am a stay-at-home  mother of seven who managed to homeshcool them all to amazing success in the arts and sciences. I married at 19 and 35 years later am still smitten with that guy.Reissig has nothing new to say. These complementarian/egalitarian camps have had their tents pitched for a very long time and Reissig brings the same interpretation and nuances to the same verses that every other complementarian has brought. But she is sweet about it.Nothing new here right down to the single curse for Adam- haard work, and the double (?) curse for women- childbearing and wresting the pants from the man (which by the way, wouldn't that be actually a curse for the man- always trying to keep his pants?)Reissig also spends quite a bit of time trying to convince women that ""helper"" isn't that bad, that really it's a wonderful stint. And honestly, it is but I find it odd that books and books have been written about how gosh dang wonderful it is to be the ""helper"" the ""submitter"" like they're trying to convince themselves of it too. And that always rings hollow to me; that something seemingly so wonderful and beautiful would have to be sort of forced and cajoled on the reader.I did appreciate this, ""In my life, my problem was that I was trying to master a stereotype rather than trying to love my husband. I was trying to fit into a box of my own making, not seeking to serve the husband God had given me. Helping my husband looks different from how my friend might help her husband.""That is ultimately why it is so impossible to split the Christian world into two camps- complementarian/egalitarian- It does not/ should not look the same in every marriage.Reissig does not plow any new ground and in fact simply trundles forward the same divide that has been debated for ever and ever. She just does it nicely. And maybe scuffles the line a little bit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WFTNUP2Z12M5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433545489#wasThisHelpful","R2WFTNUP2Z12M5","A3SQQYS79AV13M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SQQYS79AV13M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(I am 5'3"" and wear a 36  b or c cup depending on style)When Laid Flat on the table it measures 12"" Across and 5 1/2"" Deep *Before Stretching*.The Top and Bottom 3/4"" wide Spandex Elastic Bands offer a good amount of stretch and stayed in place fairly well.The Front of this Spandex/Lycra Bra features Thin Ribbing around the Smooth Cup areas.There is a 1 3/4"" x 1/4"" section of Gathering in the Center of the Front, Between the Cups for separation.The Backside of the Bra features a Spandex/Lycra Mesh material between the Top and Bottom Spandex Elastic Bands.Seams are Well Stitched throughout.On the downside, as the material over the Cup Sections is Not Very Thick, this Bra offers Minimum Breast Support and Shaping Qualities.It also does Not hide the nipple area very well, so if you have larger nipples, they will most likely be noticeable if worn under a thinner fabric top or shirt.As far as comfort, for the most part it performed well.  I did, however,  find if I was very active while wearing it, I was having to adjust it often.For these reasons, it does not, in my opinion, qualify as a ""sports"" bra, as most sports bras are designed for support as well as comfort when active.Great for everyday wear, just not what I would consider to be a ""sports"" bra.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N960BKCRXRI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0DB2C4#wasThisHelpful","R1N960BKCRXRI2","A3LX2VT91TE1M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LX2VT91TE1M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very pleased with the overall results after using this Silver Jewelry Polishing Cloth from Only Cool Products!I own a Sterling Silver pendant that I have had for over 30 years and just recently found in a box in my storage locker.As it has been in that box for almost 2 years, it had accumulated some tarnish and needed to be cleaned before I could wear it again.In spite of the fact that there are several carved indentations in the pendant, with just a little bit of effort, I was able to clean it up nicely.There are Two Different Cloths involved in the process.The Beige Inner Layer is used to Loosen and Remove the Dirt and Tarnish build up.The Grey Outer Layer is used to Polish and Shine the Silver once the tarnish is removed.Both Gray and Beige Cloths are Folded to create 4 separate sections of cloth and for each section, both front and back of the cloths are usable.Each section of the Grey Polishing Cloth measures 5 3/4"" x 4"", while each section of the Beige Cleaning Cloth Measures 5"" x 3 1/2"".Both Cloths are Securely Stitched together at the fold, which allowed for me to get a bit aggressive when cleaning and polishing my pendant without worry of separation.Only Cool Products includes a Cleaning Instruction Sheet and ships the cloth in recyclable plastic.As noted on the Instruction Sheet, this product is Not Intended for use with 24K Gold, Ivory, Pearls, Opals, Coral, Lapis, Malachite or any other Soft Porous Stones.It Does, However, Do a Marvelous Job of Cleaning Sterling Silver!!I received mine in exchange for testing and offering my honest and unbiased opinion and am pleased to give this Silver Jewelry Polishing Cloth  from Only Cool Products an A+++ Recommendation.Note: Photos show Actual Results.

"My grandson will be so pleased that I received such a Colorful Variety of Lures with my order!No two were the same and each Well Constructed Lure features Two Sharp Treble Hooks which are attached to the lures with very sturdy coiled jump rings. Each lure also features a sturdy coiled jump ring on the tongue to secure it to the line.My 15 yr old grandson goes fishing several times a week and he is always looking to replenish his supply of fishing lures.As  grandmother who lives on a very tight budget, I am always open to receiving  fishing related items at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion because I know that he will be more than happy to help with the testing process.Each 3 1/2"" Lure features nicely detailed markings and the 3-D eyes really add to the overall realistic appearance.We live in Florida, so my grandson will be using these lures for both brackish and fresh water fishing. I will update my review as to their performance as soon as I get his feedback.A Great Deal for the asking price!

"Extremely Versatile 13 Gallon Office Trash Bags that can be Color Coordinated with every room in your house!When laid flat and unopened,  these trash bags measure 28 1/2"" Long by 25"" Wide.I chose the White bags and while they are a bit thinner than more expensive trash bags, they are more than adequate for most uses.Keep in mind they are sold as Office Trash Bags, meant for paper and lighter trash items.If you intend to use them for wet food trash in the kitchen, I would suggest doubling them up as they might split if overfilled.I have used them in 3 different sized trash cans. In my Tall Kitchen Trashcan they would have reached to the bottom, but as the opening of the bag is much wider than the can, I would Not have been able to secure the bag to the can by tying the excess.The Box contains 4 Rolls of 20 bags each. They are well Perforated between each bag, so they tear apart easily.First-for-Office also includes Eighty 3 1/4"" x 1/8""  Plastic Twist Ties.Each Twist Tie has a thin piece of metal running through it to keep it tightly wrapped.The design of the box allows for easy removal of the bags.I received mine in exchange for testing and offering my honest and unbiased opinion and will be purchasing more in different colors when my supply of white bags runs out.Note: As stated on the box, these Trash Bags are Not Intended for food Storage.

"The Bamboo/ Polyester Blend Material used for the Pillow Case on this Shredded Memory Foam Pillow  is one of the Softest Pillow CASES I have ever owned.  The actual pillow offers a medium to firm support once it is completely fluffed up.The Queen Sized Pillow I purchased measures 20"" x 30"".It's a nice sized pillow that will fit into a Standard Sized Pillowcase. however, the Hypoallergenic Pillowcase it comes with features a Pretty Bamboo Plant Design, so an additional case is not required.RelaxHomeLIfe.com compresses the pillow to pack it for shipping, which causes the Polyurethane Foam inside the secondary cloth covering to arrive in a very condensed form.I didn't want to pay to put it in the dryer where I live, so I spent a little time kneading the foam and breaking it up until I got the lumps out, but it was time well spent.The Bamboo Pillowcase had a bit of an odor, which dissipated with the initial run through the washing machine.  I appreciate that the pillowcase can be put in the dryer, however, I chose to air dry it and after it dried it actually felt softer than before I put it in the washer!Once fluffed, the Memory Foam does a nice job of conforming to my head and neck, while offering enough support to allow for a very comfortable night's sleep.I received mine at a reduced cost in exchange for testing and offering my honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231T1HU2K7JCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AVRYUQ#wasThisHelpful","R231T1HU2K7JCM","A3LX2VT91TE1M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LX2VT91TE1M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The texture is a mix between creamy and crunchy.I am making the transition to a gluten free diet and this Nutria Organic Royal White Quinoa is so versatile that I am certain I will be using it in many different recipes.There are several delicious sounding recipes available on the internet and I look forward to trying them out.Low in calories (155 per  1/4 cup serving, only 12 fat calories), a great source of fiber, carbohydrates and protein, plus it even adds a bit of calcium and iron to my daily intake.It comes in a Resealable Pouch and the 16 oz size is plenty enough for me to prepare several meals.Truth is it tastes pretty good and I am so glad I decided to try something new!Giving it my highest recommendation!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOVUB2Y1VTF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0164VFZ0S#wasThisHelpful","R1QOVUB2Y1VTF3","A3LX2VT91TE1M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LX2VT91TE1M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I must admit that when I first received my Keliwa 12 Cup Silicone Muffin & Cupcake Pan from EJM I was a little apprehensive because the Silicone was thinner than I expected it would be, however, after using it to bake some Sweet Potato Muffins, my concerns have been proven unfounded.Not only did this 13"" x 9 1/2"" Silicone Cupcake and Muffin Pan allow my muffins to bake evenly, it also allowed me to remove each and every muffin in one piece!For testing purposes, I had used a cooking oil soaked paper towel and greased half of the 3"" wide x 1 1/4"" deep Cups before adding the batter, only to discover that greasing them beforehand was unnecessary, as both sides of the pan released my muffins with their golden brown bottoms equally well. The thinness of the Silicone allows the pan enough flexibility to simplify removing the muffins from the center.Clean up was a breeze with some soapy water and a hot water rinse.I will note that it's best to place the pan on a cookie sheet for added support before filling the cups.Also, the silicone gets pretty hot, so be careful to protect your fingers if removing the contents right out of the oven.I received mine at a discount in exchange for testing and offering my honest and unbiased opinion, and I can honestly say that this Keliwa 12 cup Silicone Muffin and Cupcake pan performed above and beyond my expectations.A+++ Recommendation!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UOXYUJKJEDBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP8M67Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UOXYUJKJEDBI","A3LX2VT91TE1M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LX2VT91TE1M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found these Black and White Chevron Pattern Printed Harem Pants by G2 Chic to be very Soft and Comfortable!The 92% Polyester / 8% Spandex Lightweight Material is perfect for year round wear in warmer climates such as where I live in Florida.They feature a Flat Pocket on either side of the pant, the opening of which is positioned diagonally for easy access.I ordered these Harem Pants in a size Sm/Med and laid them on the table so I could offer a few basic measurements with my review.The 2"" wide Stretch Cotton Waist Band graduates to 3"" in the front of the pant and measures 13"" across (26"" total circumference) and offers a nice amount of stretch due to the 1 1/2"" wide elastic band concealed within the outer fabric.The Inseam measures 27 1/2"" from crotch area to the bottom of the hem on the pant leg, with an additional 12"" of fabric from the waist band to the crotch area. (waist band not included)While flat on the table, they measure 21"" across the buttocks, 11"" across the thigh, 8"" across the calf and 5 1/2"" at the hemline of the leg opening.G2Chic was careful to match the pattern well creating a nicely balanced overall design.I am 5'3"", 120 lbs and I found the fit to be appropriate.The combination of the elastic waist band and the pleating on the front of the pant caused my hips to look wider than they really are when the waist band was exposed, however, I found that if i covered the waist band with a longer top, it balanced out the overall appearance.If you are fortunate to have the right body proportions, you could wear them with crop tops without issue.The seams are 1/4"" wide and feature Locked Stitching throughout the garment, which I expect will hold up well over time.According to the Care Instruction Tag, these Harem Pants require Hand Washing and should be Hung to Air Dry, so if you are looking for pants you can throw in the washer and dryer, these will not meet your requirements.In my opinion, the seller should have given these and the other similar straight cuff styles their own listing and not coupled them with the elastic hemmed jogger style pants, as they are not what most would consider to be ""joggers"".I would recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a pair of comfortable, lightweight Harem pants that are appropriate for both Casual and Dress attire.I received mine at a discounted cost in exchange for testing and offering my Honest and Unbiased opinion","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5M9UAMD3HF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DA5S4O#wasThisHelpful","R3J5M9UAMD3HF2","A3LX2VT91TE1M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LX2VT91TE1M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I can no longer drive a car due to peripheral vision issues. I thought this Self Balancing Scooter might be a great alternative to walking a mile and a half to the local shopping center.Before placing my order, I went to YouTube to check out some demonstration videos of similar Self Balancing Scooters and decided it was worth giving it a try, especially as I have a 15 year old grandson who would be happy to take it off my hands if it didn't work out for me.Once I removed it from the box and discarded the Styrofoam inserts which were used to secure it during transit, I started out by reading the Well Written Instruction Manual included in the box.Although I had learned a lot watching the videos, I really appreciate that Warrear took a lot of care in specifying the do's and don'ts of operating this Two Wheel Self Balancing Scooter and put them in a written form that I could refer back to as needed.For those who like specifics, I can tell you that the Scooter measures 22"" across and is about 3"" thick.The Exterior of the Scooter is composed of Two Sections of Heavy Duty, Well Polished Molded Plastic.Each Section features a Top and Bottom cover which encase the 1000w Motor, as well as the LG Lithium Battery and are held together by Deeply Recessed Screws.This Warrear Self Balancing Scooter features 7"" Rubber Wheels which offer a Good Amount of Textured Tire Tread, allowing the Scooter to be used on Different Types of Terrain.The End Caps on the wheels are Silver and Black and have a very cool appearance.The Wheel Wells are Molded to the Body and cover the Upper Half of the Wheels.The Top of the Scooter features Two 5"" x 5 1/2""  Non Slip, Textured Silicone Control Pads which Respond to Changes in Weight Distribution and Body Position to Direct the Movement and Speed of the Scooter while standing on them.Also located on the Top of the unit is a Battery Indicator Light which glows Green when the battery has power and turns Red when the power is getting low, as well as a Function Light.The On/Off Button and Battery Charger Input Jack are positioned next to each other on the Rear of the Unit.Warrear Includes the Charging Port and Adapter Cord in the box, however, I was pleased to find that my scooter arrived with the battery Fully Charged and Ready for Use out of the box.The Front of this Well Constructed Scooter features a Set of Super Bright LED Lights on Either Side of the unit. The 2 1/2"" x 1""  Heavy Duty Light Casings house 8 Well Marked LED Bulbs Each. These LED Lights stay on when riding the Scooter and Flash when making turns.They are much brighter than I expected them to be and did a great job of lighting a considerable amount of area in front of the scooter when the sun started to go down.This approx 27 lb Two Wheel Scooter has a Speed Capacity of about 10 miles per hour and will Beep when you are approaching maximum speed.Charging time is about an Hour and you can travel approx.10 miles on a flat terrain before needing to recharge the battery.Having read the entire instruction manual, I took care to wear shoes and put on some protective gear before attempting to ride my newly acquired method of transportation.At 62 yrs of age, I was a bit apprehensive about my ability to operate this Self Balancing Scooter, so I started out by holding onto the door frame to get the feel of standing upright and remaining relaxed.As the Response of the Control Panel to my body movement was pretty much Immediate, I had a few fails before I could travel more than a foot or two, but once I got the hang of how to position my body and coordinate my ankle movement to achieve turns, riding this scooter was actually quite fun!I still need more practice before I will feel confident enough to make my way to the shopping mall, but I am happy to say thatI can travel within my development without injury.So pleased to have been given the opportunity to receive mine at a reduced cost in exchange for testing and offering my honest and unbiased opinion. I am looking forward to my grandson's next visit so he can show me the full extent of what this Warrear Two Wheel Self Balancing Scooter is capable of.In the meanwhile I will continue to take it slow and steady while I build up my leg muscles and confidence.I honestly feel that since I am able to operate and enjoy riding it in spite of my age and lack of coordination, others would enjoy it as much as I do if not more and I am giving it a Well Deserved 5 Star Recommendation!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ENYFNVX86BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NTDFPY#wasThisHelpful","R39ENYFNVX86BL","A3LX2VT91TE1M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LX2VT91TE1M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 8"" x 4"" Genuine Denim Wallet by J.S.N.Y is too cute and it's functional as well!For months I have been walking around stuffing my ID, credit cards and various other necessary business cards along with my cash into the pockets of my check book cover.Problem was that every time I went shopping, most of the items would end up on the floor while I searched for the credit card I needed to pay for my purchase.When offered the opportunity to receive this this Denim Wallet in exchange for my Honest and Unbiased opinion I didn't hesitate to say yes, especially as it matches the denim purse I carry around with me during the day!The entire Wallet is constructed of Distressed Denim.On the outside of the front of the wallet is an open belt loop that I am using to secure my pen,On the back side is a functional blue jean pocket into which I can fit my 3 3/4"" x 2 1/4"" cell phone.The inner compartment on one side features a 4"" long x  2 3/4"" wide Clear Window compartment which now houses my ID Card.Above that are 3 other compartments in which I now carry my credit and store cards for easy access.Under these compartments is a 7"" x 3"" opening which I am using for my coupons and medical ID cards.The other side of the wallet interior features a 6 1/2"" x 3"" Zippered coin pocket with a Pleated 7"" x 3"" open compartment on either side.These pleated compartments are great for keeping folding money or any other important items you may need to locate in a hurry like a receipt for a product you are returning to the store.The stitching is straight and solid throughout and the edges are hemmed in a Black Vinyl-like material.The wallet stays tightly closed thanks to a 1/2"" Silver Metal Snap which is well secured to the wallet.Overall a very well constructed Genuine Denim Wallet for the reasonable asking price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBVFWEOSW2JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WXPHPS#wasThisHelpful","R3MBVFWEOSW2JR","A3LX2VT91TE1M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LX2VT91TE1M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found these listed under the “home and kitchen,” so one thing to note right away is that these aren’t for food storage. I don’t think that point is necessarily obvious unless you read the details of the product description.With that out of the way, this is an interesting set. You get twelve small, round containers with lids that lock into each other. They’re good for storing small items like rubber bands or thumb tacks or whatever you might think to place in them.They’re sturdy, but not too terribly heavy. They’ll withstand normal use, although if you were hoping to organize things in the garage or workshop, they might not hold up as well.I was somewhat annoyed that there are two stickers on each of these, as they were a pain to remove. The top stickers are supposed to come off easily, but that wasn’t always the case. Whatever - it’s not a huge deal, but it was a bit frustrating initially.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8VEIFC5IF20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176LFX6G#wasThisHelpful","R3H8VEIFC5IF20","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Foam rollers have been gaining popularity for loosening muscles either pre- or post-workout, and while I can see some benefits, the rigidity and uniformity of the foam makes it less than ideal. Moreover, it requires a certain level of coordination to use - more than some people may possess, especially if one has flexibility or mobility problems.The Merrithew Flex Massage Stick has a number of benefits. I think it is actually more effective than a foam roller because the flexible massage wheels conform to the contour of your target area in a way that is natural. I use this in situations where I would normally use a foam roller. For instance, I used to have trouble with my tibialis anterior when I was first starting to run. I’ve largely overcome this problem, but I always like to stretch and massage them before running more than a mile because they still have a tendency to tighten up on me. This pre-run massage forestalls shin pain, and I’m finding the Flex Massage Stick even more effective than the roller I had been using.It’s great for self-massaging your legs, although if you want to hit your back, it’s best to have a partner use it on you. It’s awkward without having someone help you because rolling something along your back just isn’t natural. If you’re reasonably flexible, you might be fine. It still feels kind of good when I use it on my lower back, but hey - it’s way nicer if I don’t have to reach behind me.Overall, it’s a good product with some obvious benefits over a foam roller. I particularly recommend it for runners, as it helps keep your legs feeling great before and after runs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7SSZAMTJB8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJXX800#wasThisHelpful","R1C7SSZAMTJB8V","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own some pairs of Brainwavz headphones, and I continue to be impressed with them. I thought these would be interesting to try and then give them to friends who have a small child who is *almost* ready for them. As you probably know, you can get into a lot of trouble with headphones. The audio transducers are so close to your ear that you can easily play them loud enough to sustain hearing damage. Since kids aren’t great judges of things like this, it’s not necessarily a great idea to trust them with headphones. Well, Brainwavz has you cover. These are limited to 85 dB, which is a pretty safe volume level. Typically, 85 decibels is safe enough to listen to for eight continuous hours without hearing damage.They are constructed pretty well, and the KV-100s can get tossed around a bit without breaking. Sure, if you abuse them, they will break, but unless your child is a terror, these should be fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XQT9L9AW0AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CLDSQK#wasThisHelpful","R23XQT9L9AW0AO","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own many pairs of in-ear monitors (IEMs) ranging from some inexpensive pairs in the $20 range to a pair of Etymotic Research IEMs that cost hundreds. My Etymotic pair has an unrivaled amount of sonic detail, but they sound terrible without a headphone amplifier. If I use them with my iPod, I get an anemic sound that is totally unsatisfying. This is where the Brainwavz S3s come into play. They produce a rich, full sound with plenty of bass (but not too much!) and great sonic clarity. AND, they do all this even with a low voltage source like a smartphone or iPod.The S3s come with some nice accessories. You get a rigid carrying case that protects the headphones, even if they make their way to the bottom of your bag and get crushed by heavy books (or whatever). It’s a surprisingly nice case. So many IEMs come with a soft case or a pouch, and these are really more for keeping everything together than offering protection. You also get a range of earpieces so that you can get a comfortable fit.The flat cable is surprisingly nice. You would really have to work to tangle these. All I have to do to tangle my Apple earbuds is give them a dirty look. The S3s also come out of their case as I left them. I also like the thickness of the cable. It offers more protection than the thin cables you usually find with this sort of thing.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the S3s. I love the sound. It’s balanced in a way that is rare. So many of today’s headphones are way too bass-heavy (thank you Beats by Dr. Dre…), and it’s nice to find a pair with a nice, full bass register than don’t overpower the rest of the frequency spectrum. The highs are clear, and the all-important midrange is way smoother than you would expect from something in this price range. These are now my go-to pair when traveling. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVC53U98RZWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162C1P9O#wasThisHelpful","R3PVC53U98RZWH","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the largest portable power bank that I’ve ever tested. With 16000mah available, you can charge any phone multiple times, and you can even charge a large tablet at least twice. The surprising thing is that the unit isn’t all that big. It’s pretty heavy, but it’s not too big to toss in whatever sort of bag you use. You could watch multiple movies on a long flight and power your tablet off of this thing. It’s amazing.The unit itself is well designed and aesthetically pleasing. I intended to test this really thoroughly and see how many times I could charge my iPhone 5s, but I got so many charges out of it that I lost track. Suffice it to say that this will last you a week, unless you have some sort of massive, power-hungry phone like an iPhone 6+.

"Since Amazon has combined the listings for multiple products, I am specifying that I’m reviewing the Lenox Holiday Glass Bowl.At 20 ounces, this is a pretty small bowl. It’s about the size of something you would use for cereal. It would be appropriate for something like candy or some sort of roasted nut mixture. With its traditional Christmas decoration, it will work well with most home decors. I do think it’s kind of disingenuous of Lenox to call this a “holiday” bowl since it’s decorated in a classic Christmas style.One of the things that should be noted is that the bowl is made in China. Lenox prides itself on being an American company that still produces things in the USA. *Some* of their current line of products are made in the USA, but not this. If you’re hoping to support domestic production, look elsewhere.In terms of functionality, it’s fine. There’s not much to say. It’s elegant and small.

"I’ll state right upfront that I’m no expert in this sort of surveillance and security equipment. I’m a regular guy with a solid amount of tech savvy, but again, no specific expertise in things like this. I’m writing this review for others like me who are considering some sort of security installation project but don’t really have a background in this sort of thing. I’m happy to report that it’s surprisingly easy to get this up and running.I imagine most people who buy this own some sort of small business, and if so, having 16 cameras makes a lot of sense. Even if you just want to surveil your home, the wealth of cameras allows you to get certain areas from multiple angles. I recommend making a list of vulnerable spots and assigning some cameras to them as an initial step. Check the angles, and ensure that there are no blind spots. If you can’t get total coverage of an area, use the rest of the cameras to assist with these areas.Installation of the cameras is simple, but running cable is not. Because I needed to test this system to create my review within a short time frame, I simply connected the cameras, set them in various places in my house, and powered the system on. I have spots picked out, but running sixteen cables through the walls isn’t going to happen overnight. That’s really the trickiest part.The software is easy enough to use. It’s not exactly elegant, but it’s good. The setup wizard is great. It handles most everything for you. I wouldn’t say this is an idiot-proof product, but the software aspect is definitely within the grasp of most adults who possess at least basic computer skills. Don’t worry; you don’t need to be a computer engineer to figure this out.The video quality is just great. Gone are the days of grainy, black and white footage where the pixels are as big as the intruders’ faces. With 1080p, you don’t have to worry about getting a good image of whomever you’re recording. Of course, you may want to lower the video resolution to get more recording time. Three terabytes is well and good, but when you’re recording 16 HD video streams, the data disappears fast. Even if you lower the resolution to 720p, the quality is still amazing.Two awesome things: first, the remote monitoring is awesome. I accessed the cameras through my iPhone and iPad with no trouble. I assume the Android integration is just as good. I also love the PTZ camera. It’s just really cool.I don’t have previous experience with surveillance systems like this, but I cannot imagine anything that I would improve here, other than making the software even more user-friendly that it already is. I’m really nitpicking with that comment. It’s quite easy to use. Overall, I couldn’t be happier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDR325E315A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2XENF8#wasThisHelpful","R1BDR325E315A3","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first, I thought this product was a solution in search of a problem. After all, it’s not hard to ignite charcoal. If you use enough lighter fluid, you get flames easily. What I hadn’t realized is that lighter fluid colors the flavor of the food a lot more than I realized. To my surprise, the Fire UP is actually a pretty cool product.The thing to realize is that it’s not really a tiny flamethrower. It’s not like spraying huge flames over your charcoal and setting an instant fire. It takes a bit of time, and you’ll end up using the wand for a few minutes in the process. It’s pretty easy to use, and the instructions are clear.Ultimately, this isn’t a totally necessary grilling accessory, but it’s kind of nice if you want to avoid lighter fluid.

"Calvin Klein’s Eternity is a fairly old fragrance, and the fact that you can still find it everywhere must be a testament to its popularity. Here we have “Eternity Now” as a body spray. I’ve smelled this fragrance in its original cologne form, and it was a nice, masculine scent. As an aerosol body spray, it smells like something cooked up by chemists in an industrial lab. The subtlety of the original is gone and the most obvious features are blown up to nose-piercing proportions. It’s really, really strong, so would recommend using it sparingly.Basically, it smells cheap. If you’re looking for an inexpensive cologne substitute, this will do just fine, and it will last a long time.

"I’m a huge fan of beef jerky (more than I should be, really). I could probably live off of Tabasco Slim Jims for about a week, if I needed to. The thing is, jerky is super, super salty no matter how lean the meat is (yeah, turkey jerky doesn’t really translate into a meaningful health boost). If I’m going to ingest this much sodium, it had better be worth it. The taste needs to be outstanding in order for me to justify the calorie and sodium penalty. Unfortunately, Old Wisconsin jerky just isn’t good enough.The flavor is very average. I wish there was something distinctive about it, but I’m having a tough time describing it because it’s just such a standard jerky flavor, which is to say, it tastes like salt with a little pepper and some other mild spices. The texture is a bit different from a Slim Jim, which is more fibrous. The Old Wisconsin jerky is more like a long, skinny summer sausage. When you bite it, it’s somewhat crisp. I didn’t like or dislike this, so I’m mostly just pointing out the difference here.12 grams of protein is a nice boost, but 580mg of sodium is a LOT for a 90-calorie stick of jerky that will leave you hungry an hour later. The whole idea that this is a healthy on-the-go snack is ludicrous. You don’t eat jerky because it’s healthy; you eat it because it tastes great.

"This is a great paint sprayer for small jobs. The reservoir isn’t huge, so it’s not really appropriate for painting something like the walls of a large room (unless you like refilling things continuously). It’s amazing for staining, varnishing, or lacquering smaller items. I suppose it would be fine to seal your deck with something like this. You’ll just need to plan on refilling a few times if you’ve got a large space to cover.I didn’t have a ton of experience with paint sprayers previously, but the PW25150 was really straightforward to use. Read the manual and you’ll be fine. Cleaning is simple. Take the things apart, wash them, and put them back together. It’s a great design, so it’s simple to figure out how everything fits together.If you’ve not used a paint sprayer before, this is a fine one to start with.

"I’ve not used a paint sprayer previously, but after this experience, it’ll be my go-to for most future paint jobs. I wasn’t sure what to expect. The idea of spraying paint seemed a little intimidating, mostly because I’m used to rollers and brushes, which offer a lot of control. I’m one of those people that likes be very slow and methodical. Well, the PaintWIZ PW25000 (25000!!) was actually really easy to use, and I felt good about the experience.Definitely read the instructions, if you’re new to paint sprayers. It’s easy enough to use, but there are a few things that didn’t seem overly obvious at first.One complaint I have is that you have to refill often. This would be great for a small job, but if I wanted to use it on an entire house, it would probably become tiresome to keep refilling it. On the other hand, it makes the painting job super fast. It’s a toss up. Another issue is the fact that the paint sprays really far. I recommend covering everything in the vicinity. It’s not like a little can of spray paint that sprays a couple feet. The PaintWIZ goes a lot further.On the plus side, it’s really easy to clean. Pull everything apart, wash it, and put it back together. It’s a fairly painless process. I’m sure there sprayers that are way nicer and offer more control, but as a starter unit, the PW25000 is great. Based on this experience, I’ll probably replace it with something nicer when it stops working. For now, I’m very pleased!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QI1VJ80D5EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AOH5TM#wasThisHelpful","R3QI1VJ80D5EE","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don’t have a baby or anything, but I thought I would try these anyway. After all, couldn’t we all use washcloths that are better for our skin? I’d never heard of bamboo washcloths, but now that I’ve tried them, I’m a huge fan.These specific washcloths are huge at 10”x10”. They’re super soft, and even after washing them a few times, they still feel great. I primarily use these when washing my face, so it’s nice to have something this luxurious. The only downside is that they’re pretty thin. If these were thick, they would be perfect; however, when you factor in the price, I can’t be too disappointed.It’s a really nice set, and I’m sure your baby will appreciate them.

"It seems that the science is still out on whether muscle rollers like this actually do much of anything. Chiropractors recommend them, but lets not forget that a chiropractor is not a medical doctor. Having read various studies, it seems that if you think this helps, go ahead and do it. Otherwise, you’re not missing out on much. For me, it feels kind of good sometimes, but it certainly doesn’t do anything that has a lasting effect. Tight, sore, or injured muscles go back to being tight, sore, or injured by the next day.How does this Gaiam massage roller compare? First of all, it’s not foam. Because it’s inflatable, you can adjust the firmness to whatever you want. This is kind of cool because some foam rollers are just painful to use. The fact that you can put this in the freezer is also unique, in my experience. It’s an odd sensation.It’s quite small - smaller than any foam roller I’ve ever seen. As such, it’s not great for larger muscle groups, like glutes or your back in general. It takes more work to position it, which some may find annoying.As with all Gaiam products, it’s aesthetically pleasing. Their design team is top notch. It doesn’t really help relieve muscle pain, but it does look nice.Overall, I’m ambivalent about it. It’s fine, I suppose. I wish the roller was longer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K6EZUO0CVPFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112RJY6A#wasThisHelpful","R1K6EZUO0CVPFX","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is rock solid. When I looked at the pictures in the product listing, it seemed like it would be kind of a light weight shelf, and I couldn’t believe that each shelf could hold up to 750 pounds. Well, handling it person was a totally different experience. It’s not incredibly heavy, but it’s really solidly constructed. I don’t have to think twice about putting things on it, no matter how heavy.Building the shelf was a pain. There are a bunch of nuts and bolts that you have to screw in. It’s not necessarily hard, but it takes a while. I recommend putting on some music and settling in for a long construction period. Thankfully I had some quality college football to keep me distracted. As per the directions, I can attest to the value of having an extra person to help assemble this. It’s just kind of heavy and awkward by yourself.Most people can probably get by with something weaker than this. Who really has that much super heavy stuff for a shelf like this? You could load each level up with a really heavy tool chest and you wouldn’t come close to reaching the weight capacity. However, when you consider the reasonable price, why not get something that will last forever?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9KR8FWHESL3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I2GRBW#wasThisHelpful","R9KR8FWHESL3F","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a pry bar, the DB16 works just fine. It’s shaft is weighted such that you get a powerful mechanical advantage over whatever you’re prying apart. The handle is a nice bonus, although I’m not sure how necessary it is. In terms of the nail puller function, I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained that the metal is too soft for extensive use. I too noticed some wear after pulling a series of nails (just for a test to verify his experience). If you’re a weekend project kind of guy (or girl), perhaps this is just the gadget you’re looking for. If you’re a contractor, this isn’t going to cut it.One thing I will note though is that the release button on my unit is indeed metal, not plastic. I’m not sure if that reviewer has a slightly different model or what, but my pry bar has a metal button. There’s that at least.I’m not sure how it won an editor’s choice award from Popular Mechanics (as the product listing claims). The idea of an adjustable nail puller is great, but the execution isn’t amazing. I don’t know if it’s because this was made in Taiwan or simply because Apex Tool Group (whoever that is) cut corners. The best I can do is three stars, and I think that’s being a bit too generous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0FQKQJZBA8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NM6VFU#wasThisHelpful","R2T0FQKQJZBA8O","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the benefits of compression gear are controversial, the massive increase in sales over the last few years shows that people want them. Unless you’re an olympic athlete, you probably won’t see much of a tangible benefit. That, however, isn’t entire the point. If we’re being honest, high tech workout gear is as much about fashion as it is about performance. With people spending more and more time at the gym, I can understand how the way you look affects the way you feel about yourself, which subsequently affects your performance. Maybe the effect is mostly psychological, but it’s still meaningful.Thus, I do not intend to argue that there is no point in compression gear. It serves a purpose for some people, and if you’re one of those people, this shirt is amazing. I have some Zensah socks that I love, and now I have this compression shirt. I don’t like to strut around in skin-tight clothing, personally, so I often wear this under a t-shirt or something. For me, it’s sort of like the world’s fanciest long underwear. It’s like a sort of undershirt that fits perfectly, keeps me warm when the temperature dips below a certain threshold, and offers a high level of comfort.There are some pretty nice features built in here. For instance, the seams are mostly flat. The arm holes do have seams, but it’s not in a place that sees much movement, so the chances of irritation are really low. The moisture wicking properties of the material work surprisingly well. It’s so weird how fast this thing dries. Basically, every part of this shirt is well thought-out and well designed.If you have virtually no body fat, and you want to show off, by all means - just wear this. If you feel like being a little more modest, this works just fine under a t-shirt. It’s incredibly comfortable and adds just enough warmth to help you out on cool-weather outdoor workouts.

"If you do yoga, you know how critical it is to have clothing that doesn’t restrict you. So many men’s athletic shorts now have such a long inseam that they go slightly over your knees, which is incredibly annoying when doing yoga (or squats, for that matter). These yoga shorts are a perfect solution. They’re stretchy, they don’t hinder your knee movement, and they’re just quite comfortable.Perhaps they’re a little shorter than I would wear for lifting at the gym, but I’d be okay wearing these in public for a yoga class. I can’t say that about all yoga gear that I’ve tried. They’re not skin tight, and that’s important to me. I think YogaAddict has struck a nice balance here.Overall, I’m very satisfied with them.

"Having tested about ten different pairs of bluetooth gym headphones, I would rank these somewhere in the middle of the pack. The sound quality isn’t amazing, but it’s not the worst I’ve heard. The fit is a bit better than some models, which actually counts for a lot.One problem I have with a lot of models is that the earpieces are so heavy that they fall out of your ears easily. Nothing bugs me when I’m trying to break my 5k time like having to devote mental energy toward shoving earbuds back into my ear. The way these wrap around the top of your ear holds them in place quite securely.The downside is that this design doesn’t really allow them to make a good seal in your ear canal. In-ear monitors (IEMs) depend on the seal for generating bass response. This means that the Soundpeats Q2s will always sound shallow when you’re wearing them simply because you can’t get them to stay sealed. I’m actually okay with this because I’ll take a secure fit over sound quality any day. It’s not like any of these gym IEMs sound that great anyway.The bottom line is that these sound kind of mediocre, but I can forgive that because they stay in place while I’m running.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17OF61AH82356/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWZ1JN6#wasThisHelpful","R17OF61AH82356","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own six different shower speakers and this is the worst by far in terms of sound quality. It’s certainly rugged, but that’s about all I can say. Of course I’m not expecting a transcendent audiophile experience, but this is so far below the shower speaker standard that I need to note a few things. First, the bass is the weakest of any shower speaker I tested. Its highs are also really dull. It kind of sounds like your ears are clogged up, and you can’t quite hear the high frequencies clearly.This model uses a generic design that different companies put their label on. If you search for bluetooth shower speakers, you’ll find at least ten that look exactly like this. I’ve reviewed three of them, and they’re all equally bad in the exact same way.In terms of functionality, it does make sounds, and it does connect fairly easily. I like that there is a dedicated power button because I hate having to hold down a multi-function button for long periods of time.If you want something that sounds decent, try the Mpow Armor. Or, there is another good, generic model made by a few different companies including iFox Creations and Superior Sounds. Once you see what they look like, you can pick any brand you want. I’ve got two of them, and they’re all the same, but they’re good.Avoid this one. The only logic I can find behind all the rave reviews is that these customers haven't heard any other bluetooth shower speakers.

I feel fairly good about its safety, although I’m an adult without kids or rowdy friends. If you have kids who occasionally go crazy, this might not be for you. It’s not like it’s filled with a lot of liquid or anything, but you still don’t want to knock it over.It takes a few minutes for it to heat up, but after that, it does a good job of filling your car with a pleasing aroma.

"I highly recommend using a protein supplement if you’re trying to either lose weight or add muscle because it’s a very efficient way to get a lot of protein without a lot of cholesterol or fat. However, I have to warn you about EAS products. The FDA does not regulate protein supplements, and some brands have higher levels of heavy metals (arsenic, lead, cadmium, bismuth, antimony, silver) that you would ideally ingest. In a recent study, EAS products ranked anywhere from a B+ to a D in terms of toxicity. I didn’t find this exact product amongst those tested, but it seems to indicate that EAS products are held to a lower standard of quality in terms of the amount of heavy metals they find acceptable.In small quantities, they won’t harm you too much, but if you drink multiple scoops of this daily, it can add up and cause problems. I would highly recommend doing a bit of research and finding a brand that is a bit less toxic, if you’re going to consume a lot of this regularly. Garden of Life, NOW Foods, Integrated Supplements, and the easily obtainable Optimum Gold Standard brands all have a lower toxicity, and those are just a few that I could remember off the top of my head.I’ve been using protein supplements for years, and they really did help me lose a lot of weight and add a lot of muscle (in conjunction with a drastic lifestyle and dietary change). They can be useful, but brands matter quite a lot, and EAS isn’t meeting the standard.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HT5REZ784FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WE0AWM0#wasThisHelpful","R23HT5REZ784FS","A145B8OHVNNFAJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A145B8OHVNNFAJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product is the same as the DBPOWER version I recently reviewed, just branded differently.  Also note, the DBPOWER version I reviewed has since changed models but kept same reviews. They all appear to be manufactured in the same place. I deducted 1 star when compared to my review because the IOS application provided with this brand is a little slower than the DB Application.  However, you can still use the DBPOWER IOS application (and likely the android version).I did not expect this product to work frankly, especially after reading the instructions. However, I was incredibly surprised.  Just keep in mind you MUST HAVE a smartphone to use this device.The camera comes packaged very well. As I said, instructions were weak. However, the camera is so simple to use, the instructions are more than good enough. Setup took about 10 minutes! !0 minutes after opening the box, I was viewing the camera on my Iphone via the ""DB Cam"" Iphone app, which performs flawlessly. Key installation points are: 1) make sure your phone is connected to home wifi. 2)make sure you plug in the camera and wait for the blue LED light to slowly flash before playing the configuration sound from the phone. That's pretty much the only possible glitches you can run into.Now, whether on my home or cellular network, I can easily access the camera AND REALTIME AUDIO. There is even a talk feature- that doe snot work too well however! I was impressed when I was able to very easily access the camera while my phone was on my home network. However, the app and camera really shine when I am away from home. The picture is great, you can zoom in on part of the video, listen to audio, and switch between multiple cameras with a click on the screen. When away from home, I access the camera via my cellular LTE network (ATT) in less than 3-5 seconds (connection time).The only issue with the camera is that it is not suitable for low light (as most are not).

"This product simply does what it is supposed to do.  This product replaced my older version.  It can be used with an extension pole (not included).  When combined with the pole, the usefulness of the product is significant compared to without the pole, which of course limits reach.  Nevertheless, the kit is good and the included handle versatile for reaching behind areas.  The Swiffer product also collects, and for the most part, traps dust particularly when compared to traditional feather dusters that just seem to move dust around.  To extend the life of the dusters, we shake them out outside (do so gently).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2FIHJHY3A07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLUOM1W#wasThisHelpful","RV2FIHJHY3A07","AT28RL25Q2OLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT28RL25Q2OLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We tried these types of tanning solution in the past.  In nearly every case, we dealt with a lingering chemical smell.  This is not the case with this product.We are light complexioned and found the product blended very well.  Essentially, it is a mousse form product that provides and even non obtrusive color, that does not look fake (i.e. orange).  Probably best described as a ""glow.""  On body parts with hair, we found best results are produced after shaving and exfoliation.  There was no greasy feeling and the tan will last a little less than a week in our usage.  I would apply the product in strong natural light if at all possible.  This will help you avoid streaking. I also strongly recommend use of a mitt in application to avoid the discoloring of the palm of tour hand.As a side note for comparison, we all thought this product was better than the Sephora.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF5W07AJGHE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OSADQE#wasThisHelpful","RF5W07AJGHE5","AT28RL25Q2OLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT28RL25Q2OLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

From that perspective, it likely is as it provides 1,600 practice questions with online access to 1,100 more and 20 online quizzes.  Therefore, my daughter will have a good sampling of questions.  However, where the book lacks, unless I am missing something, is in test taking strategy you often seek with other publications.  For us, this is no big deal at this stage.  However, for those preparing to take the test soon, it could be.The book is divided into same four elements as the ACT; English, Math, Reading, and Science. Each section has a list of questions and possible answers with answers are listed at the end of the chapter.  The font and layout is clear, which is critical to good review and study.

"I did not expect this product to work frankly, especially after reading the instructions.  However, I was incredibly surprised.The camera comes packaged very well.  As I said, instructions were weak.  However, the camera is so simple to use, the instructions are more than good enough.  Setup took about 10 minutes!  !0 minutes after opening the box, I was viewing the camera on my Iphone via the ""DB Cam"" Iphone app, which performs flawlessly.  Key installation points are:  1) make sure your phone is connected to home wifi.  2)make sure you plug in the camera and wait for the blue LED light to slowly flash before playing the configuration sound from the phone.  That's pretty much the only possible glitches you can run into.Now, whether on my home or cellular network, I can easily access the camera AND REALTIME AUDIO.  There is even a talk feature!  I was impressed when I was able to very easily access the camera while my phone was on my home network.  However, the app and camera really shine when I am away from home.  The picture is great, you can zoom in on part of the video, listen to audio, and switch between multiple cameras with a click on the screen.  When away from home, I access the camera via my cellular LTE network (ATT) in less than 3-5 seconds (connection time).The only issue with the camera is that it is not suitable for low light (as most are not).

"Putting aside the practicality of using this product, when used, I found the product worked exceedingly well.In my case, my feet are in bad shape from very hard years in the military and then what can be best described as extreme law enforcement.  My right foot also continues to suffer the effects of full blown frostbite from a winter survival course.  These prior conditions result in dry and cracked feet, sometimes painful.  Therefore, I was particularly interested in this product and its application.  Application is as you would expect for a mud type product.  The scent is not an issue and better than what you could reasonably expect.  I really have to put time aside to use the product however.  I first use a pumice stone after cleaning my feet.  After drying my feet, I apply the mud cream.  I let the cream dry for about 10 minutes and then wash it off.The first application showed immediate, though not miraculous, improvements.  Results from repeated use after nine days impressed me.  My dry skin is nearly no longer an issue.  Period.  The bottom of my right heal, which typically developed layers of dead skin and formed one large callous pad, is nearly gone.  I find myself no longer dreading showing my feet in public.Bottom line, even at the high cost, I highly recommend this product if needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SHWCMEC71HLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUY46E#wasThisHelpful","R3SHWCMEC71HLW","AT28RL25Q2OLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT28RL25Q2OLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using regular screen protectors for a while and considered moving to glass.  While the product is perfectly designed for size, cutouts, and application, it ultimately did not work for me after two days (see below).The product comes very well packaged.  Included are items for cleaning your screen prior to application.  Unlike traditional non-glass screen protectors, glass screen protectors apply very easily with just some minor adjustments for alignment.  If you properly cleaned the screen, you should have absolutely no issues with bubbles.  Also, repositioning a glass screen protector is far easier than non-glass.I love that the screen protector protects the screen and in fact, it works well.  Touch is as easy on the iPhone as without a screen protector.  However, the issue I has was that after three days, the left side of the screen protector would no longer adhere to the screen.  The screen protector still remains on the screen and everything remained functional, but the air gap is annoying visually and I cannot get over it.  This issue may be limited to my product sample as the anomalies do happen.Overall, I would love the product if only it did not start separating from the screen.

The blades are set at a great angle for shaving your face or your head.

"First, the unit is packed very well and arrived undamaged.  I was impressed in that assembly was an absolute minimum.  Essentially, you insert racks and smoker box.  The unit itself seems very well constructed throughout.  Also, it's nice that the unit is on wheels (already installed), making movement easy, even when hot. Though I actually prefer analog controls and indicators, the digital readouts and controls did an overall good job for us.  A key element differentiating this unit from competitors is the substantial side latch.  Very heavy duty and nearly toddler proof (nearly).The smoker did a great job out of the box.  We simply set the initial temp.  Once the unit achieved that temp, it cooks as set, then drops to 120 to keep it warm.  The smoke (on one fill) went for over 5 hours.  The cubic capacity is more than sufficient for a family of 10, even around holidays.  We found the digital gauge mostly accurate.  However, we like to use a second thermometer anyway.If you are a first time smoker, you cannot go wrong with this product.  Just follow the directions.  We keep the smoker on our back porch (unenclosed- open on one side, with roof) and have experienced no issues with the ceiling.

"We have extensive experience with Proactiv products and we swear by them.  This product is good - if you need it.  Using as a regular shave cream in the context of prevention is both cost prohibitive and not as good as regular shave cream in my opinion.  This product applies like a thick cream and was prone to clogging my razor.  The product is best equated to a thick shaving gel combined with benzoyl peroxide.I want to emphasize that if you have a need, this product will fulfill that need at a high cost.  However, my son's friend uses this product without an acne issue, as a means of prevention, and they go through at least a tube a month.

"This doll was an instant hit (after fighting to get it out of packaging) with our daughter and her friends.  The doll appears well constructed and designed very good.  While she eats (food included- you can also use play dough), she does not drink.  The doll is interactive (Spanish and English) and responsive.  Making and feeding the food can get messy and there may be times you have to clear the mouth out.  The doll will ""poop"" but not ""wet"" her diaper.  This actually works out good because you do not need to replace the diapers.Perhaps the biggest issue with the doll is the food.  When it comes out of the doll into the diaper, kids take off the diaper and the food then usually falls onto the floor and gets ground into the carpeting.  It can be a pain.  So, plan to regulate that aspect to some degree.  Otherwise, we like the doll.

"The microscope came packaged very well, which was a relief compared to some prior experiences I have had.  Packed inside the box is the USB microscope, stand, USB cable, an installation software (CD) a manual, a quick start guide, and calibration chart.  However, if you do not have a CD< you can get the manual and software online.  Assembly was easy and intuitive, taking about one minute.  The software installed on my Dell Windows 7 system with no issues.Simply plug the microscope into the computer and you are off and running.  The software of course interfaces with the computer and does so exceedingly well.  You can even open the interface software to a full window. To view objects, one knob provides general control and the other provides fine tuning.  This is perhaps where a more expensive unit might be better suited for some.  The fine tuning takes effort.  A variable light adjustment is provided on the cable, as well as a trigger/shutter control for the camera. The shutter button works very well and the software provides a means of organizing your images.  It is important to remember that there is no viewing piece on the microscope.  Instead, you view images on your computer.  Magnification, up to 330x, is controlled through the software.The general design of the microscope is good for the intended purpose.

Our daughter has come to rely on this book to use the calculator.This book covers the TI-84, TI-84 Plus CE and TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition graphing calculators.  There is absolutely no need to read the book from cover to cover.  Instead, we use it as a reference, similar to how you would use a ""Dummies guide.""  The book is needed because there is a significant learning curve to mastering a TI-84.  Even, as in our case, parents used a similar calculator in the past, those skills are likely long gone.  So, we jumped around the book as needed to learn tasks as they were instructed in school, rather than trying to study and memorize the book.  Especially helpful were the screen shots and the error table provided in the back of the book.It is also worth noting that purchasing the book also gets you the e-book (via download), making it that much more convenient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF0SV7IU9VUF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617293156#wasThisHelpful","RF0SV7IU9VUF5","AT28RL25Q2OLK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT28RL25Q2OLK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a roomy and well constructed sleeping bag with some limitations.  This bag is clearly intended for use above 20 degrees and I would opine, probably closer to 30 and 40 degrees or above.  Much of that opinion is of course personal preference as back in the day I could sleep on the ground in 30 degree temperature with nothing but a poncho liner.  In other words, this bag is very well suited for mid spring to early fall usage in temperate climates.  Anything colder than that, and you will need to move to a bag better rated for the cold.  Alternatively, you could simply wear layered clothing to adjust to the local climate.The bag design is roomy but more importantly has a cinch string around the head.  This significantly reduces the rate of heat loss as it takes the true form of a ""mummy bag.""

"This unisex apron is 100% cotton and fits very well ( 5'7"" ).  Construction is nice and strap around the neck is adjustable, making custom sizing based on your torso length very easy (one size doe snot fit all in this regard).  Waist ties are long enough that assistance will not be required for most people.  The pocket turns out to be very useful.  I did find the fabric a little thin compared to my previous apron's.  However, I also do not get as hot when using it.This apron is well priced and very adequate.

"The Barbie horse was a huge and immediate hit out of the box (8 ear old).  Barbie (included) stays on the horse very well.  However, the Barbie doll seems to be specifically designed to be used with the horse and therefore has limited use aside from the horse.  You will need the directions to learn how to use the horse.  The horse can be posed, stand on its own, and do a number of tricks. The mane of the horse cannot be brushed.  However, the tail can be brushed with included brush.  The horse requires four AAA batteries which are increasingly becoming uncommon so be prepared- they are NOT included.  I has to run out to the store and get them.Bottom line- this was a huge hit with our 8 year old and her friends.  First time use resulted in at least 90 minutes of play.

"I tried previous jump ropes of this type.  However, in all the instances, the rope itself was usually too light.  Not the case with these ropes.The rope is a good length at about nine feet.  The foam core handles are very comfortable and feel durable with thick handles with a non-slip surface that will prevent slipping even when you are really sweaty.  Adjustments are easy by unscrewing the handle.

"It is difficult to tell from the product images; however, it is a large accessory.  It is also built and designed very well and it should be for the price frankly.  The camper provides quite a few options for play.  It includes kitchen, jacuzzi, water slide ouch, upstairs deck (3 stories), bedroom, (fits 3 dolls), bathroom, campfire, and more.  Initial setup and first use can be a bit confusing.  However, our 8 year old and her friends quickly overcame that.  I highly recommend parents place the stickers, otherwise you can end up with a mess.Our daughter and friends spent quite a bit of time playing with the camper and integrated it into other Barbie play and accessories.  They have gone back to it over the last few days and I predict it will get some serious use.  This camper is a solid accessory for any Barbie lover.  However, the real turn off is the price.

"Simply a great doll, sort of throwing back to the old days but with a contemporary look.  The material and stitching on this doll is top notch.  The mop of hair is tough and will withstand abuse from using it as a handle.  The pacifier is permanently attached (sewn) to a string on the doll and has a magnet to attach to the mouth (sealed). Personally, I elected to cut it off at the hand.  One less thing to worry about (string and magnet).  Probably one of the most important points is that the product is 100% washable unlike many other dolls.

"Like the Fintie ipad mini case, this case is one of our favorites as it is nearly the same style. The construction is solid and tight and the stand options are really unbeatable in such a slim design. There are no signs of any glue on the cover. The functionality/usability of the case is simply impressive and includes a magnet for auto off, which has not failed yet. The case also provides what I believe is optimal protection in a slim and usable form factor. Also, once you use the handhold on the back, even if you think (now) it is something you do not need, you will wonder how you did without it for so long.This is the #1 case (once again, like the Fintie) we recommend to all our friends.

"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for WeiHeng and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Here in CA, the requirement to pay for bags at the grocery store or bring your own came into effect a couple years ago, and people are still adjusting.  At this point, my very mismatched collection consists of bags from two or three local grocery stores, a few different ones from Target, and on from Trader Joe's.  These Flatworld totes are much more comparable to the more expensive ones from Target/Trader Joe's in terms of quality and assumed reliability.  I've tossed in as many canned goods as could fit into them, and then set them out to hang, so as to see how long they could handle that much weight.  A week later, and they were still hanging there, none the worse.  I washed them a few times and repeated the same test with the same results. The printing on the front doesn't seem to be flaking off, but I'm going to guess that eventually it will start cracking and/or coming off.  Really, I'd be much happier without the designs, but, more females have commented on how cute the bags are that I'd suggest that it's just me that doesn't like the designs.  One more thing to note, the bottoms of these aren't flat like grocery bags, but instead are narrow like book bags.  Again, something I wasn't fond of, but doesn't seem to be a problem for the gals I gave the bags to after I finished trying them out for a month.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T71I8S44Y8Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCI6G9M#wasThisHelpful","R2T71I8S44Y8Y7","AX05DBU8IRUWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX05DBU8IRUWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Tayogo and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*I was pretty skeptical about this little cube, but as each of the Tayogo products I'd reviewed previously were pretty good, I held out some hope.  The Magic Cube it turns out, did not disappoint.  While many other brands tack on extra features to justify the price, such as TF card and motion control, Tayogo's design sticks to the basics.  The Magic Cube plays music, and that's about it.  I tested the Bluetooth functionality across 8 different devices, and had zero problems getting them to connect with the Magic Cube consistently.  The controls built into the top worked with all the common apps found on the device (forward/backward track & play/pause).  As with other similar items, the Magic Cube has an independent volume control from your device, something to remember if you're thinking it's not loud enough.  Between using the Bluetooth mode and straight pumping music in through the 3.5mm AUX port, there was a noticeable difference in the max sound level, which is common.  Further testing showed that the max level varied based on the device, meaning when Device A was connected to the Magic Cube, output from the Magic Cube was louder or quieter than when Device B was connected.  When connected the the AUX port, the output level from the Magic Cube was consistent across all devices.  No specs are currently listed, but in my testing, the Magic Cube was able to produce 98db worth of distortion free (measured by ear) sound.  The sound quality itself was good.  Not Bose quality, but superior to many of the other Bluetooth speakers I've reviewed.  A fair about of bass, which got even better depending on where Magic Cube was placed.At the current price of twenty-five, I'd call the Magic Cue a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34THZ5EZ99JE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K11K4KE#wasThisHelpful","R34THZ5EZ99JE6","AX05DBU8IRUWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX05DBU8IRUWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Tayogo and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Alright, lets get down to heart of the matter.  This is a very basic media player with an FM receiver, wrapped in a waterproof shell.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If you follow the instructions, which I must say are about the best I've seen in a while, you should do ok.  It comes with a number of extra earbud tips for differing sized ears, in both standard and water sport types, as well as a USB extension cable should you need one.  As a whole, it does seem like Tayogo put some thought into what they are selling.In practice, the unit performed rather well.  Everything functioned as it should, though getting at the controls was a pain.  That's probably what I disliked the most about these.  Then again, if I were in a constant workout out or swim routine, I'd not be fiddling with it much.  Sadly, no playlist option with these, so if you want your music in a specific order, you'll need to fool about with the naming of your files to get them to queue up in the order you want.  As I said before, it's all very basic.  The FM mode too is just as Spartan.  Whatever it can scan and find, you can listen to.  No presets allowed here. The battery lasted 8 hours on average for me, doing MP3s at max volume.My wear and tear test comes in the form of two tots.  I tossed them the unit and stood back.  These two are professionals, and whoa be to anyone that gets in the way of their work.  In about a week, I snagged the unit back, charged up the battery, and gave a listen.  Though the cables looked to be intact, both speakers cut in and out.  Fiddling with it, I found the break in the line to be close to where the cord entered the body of the headband.  Too much twisting and bending resulted in the wires inside breaking or shorting together.I dunno, for the price I'd like a little more functionality out of these, and more robustness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM2ER41FWYNFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G91T686#wasThisHelpful","RM2ER41FWYNFA","AX05DBU8IRUWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX05DBU8IRUWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for DBPOWER and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Fitness related wearables are currently at an all time high for desirability.  Heck, Apple's new iWatch is aimed squarely at this market, trying to take down the likes of Fitbit.  This smart bracelet is aimed at the price conservative crowd, with a lower price and claims of all the same features.  How does it do?  Meh.  It's just ok.Let's start with the band itself.  It's really comfy to wear, adjustable to accommodate differing wrist sizes, and holds the electronics pretty darn snug.  The big problem is that it doesn't want to stay put.  Wearing it about for a few days myself, as well as another few by my test victim, the darn thing refused to stay clasped.  Slight brushes against the end of the band would cause it to come apart and hit the floor.  At first, I thought it was a fluke, but on the average, it came apart 3-4 times a day for me, regardless of which wrist I had it on.  Really, it needs a better clasp design.Ok, now the actual electronics.  Waterproof?  No.  At least, it makes no claims to be, so I didn't drop it into a glass of water.  When inside the band, the buttons are still easy to operate.  The display isn't too difficult to read in direct sun, but, it could be better.  The pedometer feature works pretty well.  When matched up a couple others, there were within 5% of each other.  The Bluetooth is tricky, but I'll get to that in a bit.  Oh yeah, and, it does tell time too.So, without the companion app, this band is little more than a watch with a built-in pedometer.  There wasn't a CD in the box, but, there was a QR code for a website where one could get the app.  No thanks, I'm not installing an app from an unknown source.  At least not on my primary phone.  Using a disposable, I loaded the app up and was very underwhelmed.  It was ugly and getting it to sync with the band was next to impossible.  In theory, there was copy in Google Play too, and sure enough, I located it.  (Wristband by GZGAMUT)  This one looked much better, but still had issues with things working correctly, or at all.  Alarm?  Didn't happen.  Notifications?  Didn't happen.  Sustain a Bluetooth connection with my phone?  Nope.  Syncing relied on me toggling the Bluetooth enable in the app off and then on again.  Sleep tracking was difficult to judge, as the band kept falling off in the night.  Further, it assumes that you go to bed at the exact time you set the app to.  Having used Sleep As Android, both with just the phone as well as with a Pebble smartwatch, this DBPower model lags way behind in what it's supposed to do.  It works, yes, but overall the app is finicky and only partially functional.When it comes right down to it, if they fixed the app, and the wristband, this wouldn't be half bad. As is though...nah.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBNR66E04EHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LL4HR5K#wasThisHelpful","R2FBNR66E04EHK","AX05DBU8IRUWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX05DBU8IRUWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for DBPOWER and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Unlike the other cameras I have about, from generics, to FOSCAMs, to old smartphones I've converted, this DBPower model uses a different protocol, ONVIF.

"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Gearist and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*This is certainly not my first FM transmitter, nor my first bluetooth version.  This Gearist unit, the GB01, has gone for a small footprint while maintaining functionality.  For the purposes of this review, I am going to compare it against another recently reviewed item, the MPOW Streambot Y.  In terms of looks, it's a toss up for me.  The GB01 is nice and small, plus you can stick it where you like.  The Streamboy however is easier to read and operate, but it has to be located near your power port.  Both power on and off with you vehicle, which is nice.  I found that the GB01 paired up with my phone much quicker than the Streambot, up to 10 seconds different.  An annoyance with the GB01 is that it consistently forgot the volume level it had been set to previously, which is not flaw shared by the Streambot.  The GB01 also includes a dual USB port adapter, from which it can operate on either.  I'd put it in the 1A port, using the 2A port for your phone or other device. The Streambot on the other hand only offers a 1A port, which may make newer devices charge more slowly.  The GB01 also ups the ante for Apple device owners in that it works with Siri, while the Streambot does not.  Myself, I had no problem using Google Now with either device. For some reason, the GB01 changes frequency at half steps, like 83.1, 83.2, and then 83.3 instead of the standard frequencies for US radios (83.1, 83.3, and then 83.5).  A small irritant.  Call quality was ok for the most part, depending on where the unit was placed.  And speaking of placement, in my car, placement is very important.  Why?  Because until I found a sweet spot, the static on nearly every frequency was too much to be listened to.  The transmitter inside the GB01 just isn't able to pump out enough juice to override even the faintest stations.  Here in the SF Bay Area, I don't think it's possible to find an unused frequency, so the weak transmitter is a big problem.  Even after finding the sweet spot for placement, I have to change frequency once along my 45min commute.  I should note that even under the best circumstances, there is static.  The Streambot on the other hand does have similar problems, but not to this extreme.  The Satechi SoundFly View, which is my usual unit, doesn't have this issue at all.When it comes right down to it, the GB01 isn't a horrible unit, but, I'd opt for something else, something with a stronger transmitter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38H6L1UTTEN4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEM0Q92#wasThisHelpful","R38H6L1UTTEN4K","AX05DBU8IRUWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX05DBU8IRUWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Eachine and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Alright, yeah, the mushroom is cute.  The package includes instructions, which are a cut above the common half understandable stuff one gets with cheap products.  The touch interface for turning the lamp on and off is nice and works well.  The light emitted isn't overly intense, suitable for a night light, but not something one would be reading by.  The dimming level is adjustable, depending on how long you hold your hand/finger to the top.  This function was hit and miss for me, working only some of the time.  Pairing up via Bluetooth is easy, step by step as usual.  Though not mentioned here, it operated off a rechargeable battery, which I measured to run at least 4 hours with light and sound at max.  Speaking of the sound, the output gets up to almost 90dB (measured at 5 feet).  The quality of that sound isn't great, with more than a touch of tin to it.  If your input source is too high, distortion comes through at even low volume levels.  Note, the mushroom has it's own volume control, operated by long pressing the << and >> buttons.  Operation with the TF card is very basic, just play/pause and jump forward/back.  Taking away from the aesthetics, a little red light glows from an off center position on the base near the buttons.  Overall, it's not bad, but, buying this will be exchanging looks for function.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AGZJ3UZ4ZS68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGML1PE#wasThisHelpful","R1AGZJ3UZ4ZS68","AX05DBU8IRUWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX05DBU8IRUWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For any user of GoPro cameras a desire to use it in different ways and in different environments is a constant. When a purchase of the GoPro is made, often one is not aware of the many accessories, different types of clamps, other bits and pieces that you will need and want in the future. I have been using GoPros since their first model and have every one of their subsequent models except for the 3+ so the need for various accessories and straps is mandatory for me.This small kit will provide the straps you need that will enable you to take hands free video.  It doesn't provide many of the other accessories you may eventually need but these straps are as good as gold for most activities and are well made.Chest Belt Strap Mount and head mount straps-I have used the strap as a drummer getting a unique type of footage to be mixed in with standard footage. This strap is a must accessory and can be used by boaters, skiers, horseback riders, skydivers...you name it.Head Strap...Good for many activities including filming while scuba diving.  However, you will be aiming blindly as to your video composition. The quality of each piece definitely meets the same standards as what GoPro provides with their own accessories.I do hope that this brief review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HDLP7OR74COE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU70CSI#wasThisHelpful","R3HDLP7OR74COE","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this, his eighth album, Bob Malone offers a rollicking CD release touching on many of blues bases batting a solid average of tunes mixing hard core blues with rock tinged numbers, spirited songs with contemplative ones.  With his classical training and jazz background, Bob Malone makes Ray Charles’ ‘Hard Times’ his own, his voice stretching his resolve not to bend to the rough periods that life brings with it.  ‘Looking for the Blues’ has that Louisiana feel to it that makes you just want to dance.  Backed by a strong band of players and backup vocalists, this song and ‘Rage and Cigarettes’ are strong blues numbers anyone would want to cover for themselves.  There is no questioning his prowess on the keyboards but he keeps his integration within the song to balanced input until a keyboard lead is called for, and even then, you can feel him restraining from going over the top.  Who knows what might be your favorite tune, but mine is his ‘Toxic Love’, a song of addiction to someone he knows can only bring him down.  Written by Bob Malone & Bob DeMarco, the lead guitarist on most of the songs on this album, the tune is enhanced by the soulful harmonica playing of Stan Behrens.If you are unfamiliar with Bob Malone’s previous CD releases, despite his having performed in the past with the Neville Brothers, Bruce Springsteen, Rev. Al Green, and Dr. John, than the release of ‘Mojo Deluxe’ will be a surprisingly enjoyable treat for your ears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JACANUUGQWNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JC0Z7U#wasThisHelpful","R1JACANUUGQWNX","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems as if everyone has one or more devices that constantly need recharging. Whether they are laptops, cell phones, different pads of one kind or another, music players and bluetooth devices....they all need recharging eventually.Unfortunately, we are not always in a position or place where recharging is convenient.  We might be in the car, in the field on a trip or any other number of circumstances.It is fortunate that has been a proliferation of external chargers that serve as recharging devices and can charge your personal device no matter where you are.  So for this situation the Idaye power bank fits all your needs.  The Idaye power bank has two ""smart"" USB ports”, which deliver 1 A and 2.1 A at 5 Volts alternatively and interchangeably.  Basically, this means that whether it is a laptop that needs recharging as mine always does or just a cell phone or iPad, iPod or kindle, the Idaye power bank comes in very handy.It weighs in at slightly over 3 oz. and is small enough to fit in a pocket, the glove compartment of your car or a woman's purse.  From a complete discharge of my laptop, it took slightly over 2 hours to bring the laptop's battery up to full charged.  A smaller device will charge considerably quicker.If the Power bank itself is fully discharged, it will take several hours to recharge it to full off your computer's USB port or a USB hub.  This is true for all power banks I have used and reviewed.  The good thing is that these power banks do a great job of holding their charge over time.  You can go for weeks with this power bank and discover that its charge has been retained.  I have had this power bank for a month now and it is still almost fully charged.So why holding onto it for so long before I write a review. Even tho I received it in exchange for a review, I take these seriously and do not like fake or hyperbolic reviews. Thus, true  testing and reviews are important to me.While there are many good power banks on the market and  in this price range, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to some or to give it as a gift which is what I plan to do this weekend.I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.

"I have reviewed several earbuds in the past and some clearly do stand out while others are just so-so. These earbuds are the exact same earbuds I reviewed awhile ago called the Matone QY7s. They are strictly a rebranding of the headset.  You can tell this by looking at your Bluetooth connection settings where they also come up at QY7s.  This does not mean they are a poor product, in fact, these are really quite good.Set Up....as most Blu Tooth earbuds and headsets I have found, these paired and connected very quickly and easily. Initially, a blue and red light on the right earbud flashes and, once connected and paired, switches to solid blue before going out completely. These earbuds do come with a few different sized ear pieces should the ones already attached be too small or large for your ear canal.With your device's volume set to its highest, these earbuds will go even louder with the volume up/down button. Therefore, be careful, if giving these to a kid, that you and they are aware of possible ear damage caused by setting volumes too loud.Each earbud is marked for the right and left ear but the marking is uber small and you have to look for it. The right ear bud is the one with the power on button. I do like that the entire side of the earpiece is the on/off button so I do not have to search around with the earbuds in to find and separate it from any other tiny buttons. When turned on a voice comes on saying 'Power On'. When the earbuds are going to be fully discharged, there will be an audible beep and a voice warning as well. When charging, the red light will come on on the right earbud showing that they are charging. Of course, a charging cable, the aforementioned extra size ear pieces and a decently, if not tiny, manual is supplied.Ergonomically, these are great buds. They fit comfortably in my ears and, like most buds, are connected by a strong enough plastic connecting string. If one drops out of your ear, you won't lose both.For me, the audio quality is the most important thing and while these are not $1,000.00 audiophile ear pieces, they do a fine job of reproducing your music. I am wearing them now as I write, listening to James Brown's ' I Feel Good' and there is excellent transient response and bass reproduction with just a hint of bass muddiness. Most people will not ever notice this as they will be listening while working or exercising and not sitting there for critical listening. Now listening to ZZ Top's 'Just Got Paid' and the sibilance of the high hat hits and cymbals is spot on and well balanced.Since I am the last human on Earth who does not use a cell phone, I was not able to test this area of the earbuds but they are enabled to be used as both a receiver and transmitter connected via blue tooth to your phone.As I am sent many products for review, I usually donate them after testing to different charities. However, these really are darn good so I will probably keep them for myself.I do hope that this brief review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.Thank you for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKADZLYH1Z3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010DL9484#wasThisHelpful","RAKADZLYH1Z3A","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems that I have been reviewing a great many blue tooth speakers and earbuds lately and I basically knew what to expect these earbuds came in. Let me make it clear that these were sent to me by the company in exchange for a review but, if you are familiar with any of my reviews, I do not hesitate to point out any negatives I find as well as praise the positive. I have lived with this speaker for over a week and don't buy into the hyperbole of using a product for an hour and thinking it is absolutely great just because it was free.Not everyone has a blue tooth connection so these buds are connected to your device via the supplied cable. The connector is quite small so even if you have a tight fitting cell phone or iPod case, you should have no problems with the connection. Extras ear pieces are supplied should you have larger or smaller ear canals but I found that the ones on them were already pretty comfortable.Audio quality is the most important thing and the Mengo Bumps stand out in a few categories and fall short in one as well. The transparency of the music reproduction is quite excellent. There is no veil over the audio you are hearing, no muffling and excellent transient response throughout the entire frequency range. Though VOIX says that these ear bumps have Ultra Bass, I did not find that to be the case. The bass, while very decent in its response when I was listening to an audiophile jazz recording of Charlie Byrd as well as some ZZ Top tunes, does not go any lower in bass reproduction than the great majority of ear buds, bluetooth or cable connected, than any others I have listened to and reviewed.This does not mean that these aren't quite good, they are good but do not expect audiophile type earpieces for this very inexpensive cost. For yourself or as gifts, they are some of the better looking buds I have seen, if not the best. They certainly do not appear cheap and plastic-like as most of the others on the market. They look far more expensive than they are.Personally, I do prefer the convenience of blue tooth ear pieces so I do not have cables hanging down to be caught on an exercise machine or something, but if this is your choice than you shouldn't be unhappy with them at all. They sound fine, just do not expect an explosive bass and deep bottom end.I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.Thank you for reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R121XW4TH1CKU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVT4DLO#wasThisHelpful","R121XW4TH1CKU3","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did receive this small bottle of Respire Oil in exchange for a review which in no way obligates me to write something positive or negative. I hate reading nothing but hyperbole,Keeping things simple, there is a very subtle and extremely pleasant spicy aroma that just a few drops of this oil in one of our diffusers emanates. I do not have the scent palate that some do but it smelled to me of peppermint, and eucalyptus with a whiff of lemon. There are ingredients listed on the label but they were printed way too small for me to read.If you are feeling stuffy, this is the oil to use either in your diffuser or just to put a drop beneath your nostrils.  It does clear the sinuses quite well and, in that, it meets its objectives.My wife put in only about 3 or 4 drops of this oil in a diffuser and the fragrance that filled the bedroom was very pleasing. She loves this stuff. The oil is very concentrated and by cutting down on the number of drops, the bottle of oil will last longer. No real need to add more than 4 drops and it should last a goodly amount of time.I really have nothing negative at all to say other than that the oils produced by Prime Cosmetics are really high quality.I do hope that this very brief review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.

"I did receive this Titanium Men's bracelet in exchange for a review but that doesn't obligate me to write one way or the other.  The bracelet arrived very quickly after ordering from Amazon and comes in a handsome box, nicely packaged and protected.There is no false advertising with this bracelet that appears to look like a bike chain.  They say it is heavy, and it is.  I never considered my wrists to be excessively large but the large size bracelet is what they sent me and actually fits as it should with a little play up and down the wrist area.  It is not choking or catching on the skin at all and really does look quite nice.There are no instructions whatsoever about how to attach the clasp and after 20 minutes of my trying, I brought it to my wife who figured it out in about 5 minutes.  That is why I cut it down to 4 stars.  The clasp holds on solidly so losing it shouldn't be an issue. To  be honest, it might take some time to get used to the weight of it on my wrist.Never the less, it does look cool, though with the weight of the thing, I doubt I will keep it on when playing drums at a gig.  Drumming is tiring enough without your arms holding up a weight.I do hope this brief review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.Thanks for reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2AYOAUA7D4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z5HUD6E#wasThisHelpful","R1V2AYOAUA7D4T","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I do not have the scent palate that some do but it smelled to me of clove, and eucalyptus with a whiff of lemon.My wife put in only about 3 or 4 drops of this oil in a diffuser and the fragrance that filled the bedroom was very pleasing. She loves this stuff.  The oil is very concentrated and by cutting down on the number of drops, the bottle of oil will last longer. No real need to add more than 4 drops and it should last a goodly amount of time.I really have nothing negative at all to say other than that the oils produced by Prime Cosmetics are really high quality.I do hope that this very brief review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase. I think you will be quite happy with this oil.Thank you for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100UUKXLXFC7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ALBEAS#wasThisHelpful","R100UUKXLXFC7D","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had and used this bag for a while now and I can safely say that it is really well made and durable.  There is plenty of room in the inside lined pockets that have both a zipped pocket and two smaller pockets as well as a larger area.  The outside pocket is ok except that it lays flat against the main bag; there is no additional width extension on the outside pocket so, if the main enclosure were completely filled, the outside pocket would be essentially useless. There is also a small zippered pocket on the backside of the canvas bag and it also has no width extension.  While the canvas material of the main bag will stand up to a great deal of wear, the lining material feels a bit on the cheap side and I do not know just how long both the material and  the stitching will last.The wide strap is unpadded so that after long hikes it may feel as if it is digging into your shoulders.Bottom line, this is a handsome bag and should fit the need for most people who do not overload it.  If all you are putting in it is a cell phone, some makeup, purse, money and change than my bet is that many will compliment you on its appearance.  However, if you are going to overload the bag, the zippered pockets on both sides of the bag will not serve much of a purpose.I hope this brief review has been of some help to you.Thanks for reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QOH5XUWC0QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X2PSUT8#wasThisHelpful","R28QOH5XUWC0QT","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have reviewed a great many bluetooth headsets, ear buds and speakers and, while I received this one in exchange for a review, I am not inclined to judge a product either positively or negatively based on getting something for free. Most items I donate to a charity and do not keep.My first impression of this DB Power speaker was very positive.  It looks impressive and, even more importantly, feels solid and well made.  All necessary cables are supplied as well as the users manual with its typical horrendous English and confusing verbiage for those who are not familiar with Blu Tooth products.Unlike an on/off power button,  this speaker has a switch on the side of it laying underneath a protective rubber cover which also protects in the USB charging port.Pairing and Connecting to my device went super quick with an Asian voice saying so.  The woman's accent and pronunciation is so strong it makes me laugh each time.The speaker had a small charge on it when received and I did need to recharge it from a full discharge. This took only a couple of hours and  there is a small red LED indicating charging and a blue LED when the speaker is in use.The round tube of a speaker has a flat side side that it can rest securely and not roll around.The most important thing to me is the audio reproduction quality and when I first listened to it, I thought it was the best I had heard from these inexpensive speakers in some time.  After repeated listening on multiple days, I can say it is still up there with the best, but is not heads and tails above the best.  I listened to several genres of music, which is what I always do for testing.  For classical music, I used Ravel's Bolero.  In most cases, the beginning of the Bolero can not be readily heard with Blu Tooth speakers as the volume is too low to reproduce.  This speaker made me aware of the Bolero from the beginning...a strong point.  Then on to a regular test number by jazz player, Charlie Byrd's 'Old Hymm' which features an amazing drum solo as well as other instruments demanding only the best reproduction.  This is where this speaker's  strengths and weaknesses showed up.The DBPower BX-400 had excellent transient response...it shifted gears very quickly in terms of staccato notes and there was a clear transparency to the music.  Toms and cymbals during the drum solo were reproduced beautifully......however, deep bass. as from a kick drum, was severely  lacking.  Bass in its higher registers, during a bass solo, came across nicely, but the speaker simply can't get down that deep.  Blues Rock from ZZ Top was nicely played but the frequency response for their numbers is not quite as wide or demanding as classical music can be.  On the negative side...while the volume it can reach is pretty decent, I have tested several other blue tooth speakers that could get to considerably louder volumes.The speaker has the power to raise the volume even above your devices volume max, however, bring it up too much and you might get a shriller sound with some distortion.I still maintain that, for the price, this speaker is well worth the money and one of the best of its type out there and here on Amazon.I do hope that this review has been of some help to you.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVJX67WGBQY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AG2MZW#wasThisHelpful","RRVJX67WGBQY3","A1FNES0QEBJZD1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FNES0QEBJZD1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This, faithful readers, is not an easy book to read.It is frustrating, demanding, heartbreaking, provoking, and anxiety-filling. It is also compelling, and it inveigles itself into your head before you realize what’s happening.You will not be able to stop reading it, even though you dearly want to at times, because you will want – you will NEED – to know how it ends.Julia and Julian are separated by one letter, yet also years of missteps and mistakes. They meet by chance, and their attraction is immediate and intense. Not only is Julia married, she’s also eight years older than Julian. Neither gives him much pause, although his friends and family are more nonplussed by the relationship.At first, all is well for the couple. They have a baby girl, Mira, and their lives in London bring them happiness. He’s a writer, she’s an artist, and they are content.Which means something is about to go horribly wrong. Or, in this case, several somethings.First is the availability of Firdaws, Julian’s boyhood home. It’s now for sale and he purchases it, somewhat to Julia’s consternation and regret. She’s a city girl, and a country lifestyle does not hold interest for her. She loves Julian, though, and she allows herself to hope that Firdaws will further tighten their bond.When Mira falls ill, though, Firdaws does not provide the balm Julian desperately seeks. Nothing does.And then some secrets are revealed, and things begin to fall apart.Polly Samson’s writing sinks into you before you know what’s happening, rendering you unable to put down her book. But goodness does she make it hard on you to keep reading. Samson crafts her story with such intimacy that you sometimes feel uncomfortable reading it. You want a break from its intensity and sadness. Just when you think that Julia and Julian will be okay, whether together or apart, Samson introduces another fissure, making you wonder if any of the cracks can be filled.This is a case of a reader needing to trust the writer to tell her tale the way it must be told. You will not always like Julia or Julian or their friends and families. You will not always be on their sides. You will not always enjoy spending time with them. But you will always want the best for them, even as they make you feel conflicted. Samson knows exactly what she’s doing, and you absolutely must have faith that she knows Julia and Julian and what they need.Samson slowly reveals The Kindness in question, making it evident that one person’s kindness is another’s cruelty. That opposition is greatly at play here, not only for Julia and Julian, but for their family and friends as well. When you perform a kindness for someone, Samson avers, you impart a cruelty for someone else.I didn’t always like reading this book, but I could not stop thinking about it. The ending …. we must discuss this, faithful readers. Please read this book and come back to tell me what you think about what Polly Samson means by its ending.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NXO3B1321INA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVCWCO8#wasThisHelpful","R1NXO3B1321INA","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the conclusion to The Fowler Sisters trilogy, Monica Murphy lets you get to know Lily, the oldest and wildest of the girls. You've seen her in passing in previous books, but this is your chance to discover the woman beneath the reputation.The book opens with Lily on a plane to Hawaii, to which she is both escaping and hiding. It seems that she has provoked the wrong person, and she thinks she might be in danger. Lurking several rows behind her is Max, hired by the person Lily angered to steal her laptop.If you read Owning Violet and Stealing Rose, it will take you all of a minute to figure out who is upset with Lily. Fortunately, the identity of this character is secondary to the story of Lily and Max. If their relationship begins in a manner that seems awfully similar to Rose and Caden's, rest assured that the similarities do not end there. Caden and Max could be twin brothers of different mothers: each is using (somewhat) a Fowler sisters, each feels guilty about it, and each enjoys a little spanky panky when rocking the headboard.Oh, and one more thing they have in common: both of these men are exemplary headboard rockers. Strap on your vibrators, girls. You will give them quite the workout.So, yeah. A lot of this book will have a ""been there, read that"" feeling to it.Rose and Lily, though, are quite different. Rose was timid and good, determined to always comport herself in a manner that brought pride to the girls' father. Lily, on the other hand, is a hot mess. She drinks too much, she parties too much, she engages in the sexy times with too many men. She is, in a word, wild.Hence the need to be ""tamed,"" although Lily would never see it that way. Tame her? No. Give her the freedom to tame herself? Yes.The subplot involving Lily's enemy controls too much of the book to be relegated to such a simple dismissal. It is dispatched with far too quickly and easily, which hurts the story. You are fully on Lily's (and Max's) side by this point, and you expect the conflict Lily faces to not be given such short shrift.Then again, this is an erotic romance novel. It is what it is. Lily is fun, Max is hot, and the headboard rocking is delicious.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IBASJCW58KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEXJBZ4#wasThisHelpful","R11IBASJCW58KX","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsThank GOODNESS Jessie K, who is a high school teacher, understands that Romeo and Juliet are not the great romance for the ages. Yes, Matthew refers to Lynn as his ""Juliet,"" but he means it in the spirit of Shakespeare's play: she's the (young) woman with whom he is obsessed, and he senses that his obsession will wind up as happily-ever-after as Juliet and her husband.As an aside: Taylor Swift set us back decades, if not centuries, with her little Romeo and Juliet ditty, which, while toe tappingly delightful, nonetheless imparts an incorrect understanding of the happy couple.Back to this book.It's the first of a three-parter, and it introduces us to Matthew (our narrator), a good looking man on the cusp of turning thirty. He's an itinerant actor who teaches and substitutes to supplement his income. During an audition, he meets Lynn, a young woman with whom he is immediately smitten. They enjoy some passionate exchanges involving their naughty bits, and poof! Off they split into two different directions.About those passionate exchanges: gird thyself with thy vibrators, girls, because Jessie K all but demands that you use to to relieve tension caused by how hot her sex scenes are. Scorching hot. Blisteringly hot.Matthew seems like a nice guy, given what little we know about him, and Lynn remains a mystery. This is largely due to the scant size of this book.Which brings me to why I give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 or more: I am beyond aggravated by this tendency to split up books into smaller sections that end with cliffhangers. I feel as if a money grab is occurring, and I am not amused. I understand piquing your readers' interests and I understand wanting to sell books, but sixty-four pages? That veers mighty close to being insulting, and I am not amused. If you write well enough, people will buy your books. If you entertain your readers with one reasonably sized tome, people will buy the next book you write. Trust us and don't split up an otherwise fun, hot read into piecemeal.My rant is over.Until the necessity for it arises again.Will I read the next one? Yes. I want to know what happens between Matthew and Lynn. I like him, so far, and I want to get to know her better. Will I be happy about it? Yeah, probably. I like the way Jessie K writes, from what little I saw ...Review copy provided by the author in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU86E2EHRSPZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014T9U4GM#wasThisHelpful","RU86E2EHRSPZX","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are those who fall under the spell of celebrity, and then there is Emma, who goes (nearly) cold at the thought. She makes it a point to be blithely unaware of people who are in People, and she finds her friends' obsessions with the hot and famous annoying, if not a bit tedious. Perhaps, then, no one is more surprised than Emma herself when she finds herself inextricably drawn to John Davies, the gorgeous, wildly famous, and utterly mesmerizing movie star.They meet when Emma is out with her pals, celebrating her thirty-second birthday. She and John strike up a conversation, and when they run into each other later, it seems like kismet, non? They decide to continue their evening by getting to know each other through their naughty bits, although it is also clear that these two connect on a deeper level than just sexually. Their night in Room 702 is, as Mary Poppins would say, practically perfect in every way.Except it has to end, with John heading to a film set in Iceland and Emma back to her job.The two keep in sporadic touch, and events conspire to bring them together and pull them apart. Paloma Aínsa does a fantastic job of keeping you wondering whether Emma and John will find a way to stay together or if you even want them to do so. John's career sends him hither and yon, frequently in the company of attractive women, and Emma's life in Valencia, Spain, is simple (although increasingly complicated by her relationship, such as it is, with John Davies). There are times when I thought she'd be happier with a different man, and I think Emma herself wonders this, as well. Perhaps she needs to learn that some sacrifices aren't worth it.Aínsa writes engaging characters, giving them depth and breadth. It would have been easy for Emma to wait for John, pining for him until he rode in and whisked her off to Hollywood. But Aínsa takes a different approach, making Emma a character with real substance. This isn't to say that I always liked Emma; she occasionally acts selfishly and even childishly but, if anything, this makes her more real. I'm all for a fairytale, but it helps when it feels as if the dream could come true.Don't expect any detailed sexy times. Sex really isn't the point here anyway because the focus is more on Emma and the woman she wants to be. Will she take risks? Will she settle? Will she realize that her time in Room 702 was wonderful and lovely and entirely blissful but decidedly not reality - and will she not let that deplete her?I enjoyed this book because of the way Paloma Aínsa writes it.

"This is one of those books that I tried so hard to like. I got about 25% through it, had an iPad mishap, thought I lost it, frantically tried to contact NetGalley and even Lexi Maxxwell about getting a replacement copy, and then was able to reload it, thanks to a somewhat precipitous backup I had happened to do. I thought - I hoped - that it would get better.Aaaannnnndddd ... not so much.It isn't that this is a bad book as much as it just feels rather lifeless and uninspiring. It feels overly familiar, in a ""where have I read you before"" kind of way.Let's look at the synopsis: Ella works with (but really for) her mother in a job she hates, is in a relationship with a guy she doesn't like all that much, gets dumped by text, has a glass of wine too many to salve her wounded heart, and winds up confiding in a gorgeous stranger with whom she feels an instant connection. Only - whoopsie! - he's the son of the man her mother is about to marry, and the gorgeous stranger is engaged to be married himself.So, yeah, that sounds like something you've already read, doesn't it? I'd be okay with that if Maxxwell had interesting characters or something to add through her writing. Neither is there, though, and that's a disappointment.Ella herself is annoying and immature, to the point where I prayed she would get dumped by everyone and have to start over. I think I'm supposed to feel for her because she isn't doing what she wants to do with her life and she isn't in a relationship. But she's so whiny and unappealing that I felt as if she had what she deserved. Another weakness is her sister Carly, who contradicts herself at every turn. I could not figure out why Carly was so awful to Ella (aside from Ella being such a pill), but it turns out that there is an answer for that, and, in fact, that answer is the best part of the book. Nathan, our hero, is likable and interesting, and I wish this had been told from his perspective because he is by far most interesting character.Maxxwell uses a lot of humor in her writing, which helps make Ella a bit more endearing than she actually is. I liked what Maxxwell tried to do more in theory than in practice. The idea - a girl falls for a guy she can't have - is cute and ripe for romantic writing. I just couldn't get past Ella and Carly. They seemed too rote for me.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HD0EOTBBGIIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629550450#wasThisHelpful","R3HD0EOTBBGIIF","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsI like these. I like them a LOT.The MUSE Kegel Balls Exercise Kit is the fourth - yes, fourth - Kegel balls set I've tried. I've gone with the stainless steel variety, and others made by ""adult toy"" companies. This kit is by far the best I've used.For one thing, the shape of the balls is unique. Thanks to the pointy end, they are easy to insert. The silicone covering is soft and feels very comfortable sliding in, and the string is the perfect length. I followed with the directions, starting with the solo one, and then worked my way up to the twosome. A small mini vibe is included, but the battery was dead in mine, so I can't speak to its effectiveness. That's the only reason I am not giving these five stars.A carrying pouch comes with the balls, making storage work well.Now, about how they feel. You are aware that you have something inserted Up There, although I felt the single ball wasn't as effective. The two balls worked better for me, giving just the right amount of pressure to remind me to do Kegel exercises. I can't speak to whether bladder issues are cured because I don't have bladder problems, but I can say that if you're using these to increase arousal, they work very nicely.I liked this product.

"Matt and Grace meet when he decamps from Los Angeles to New York his senior year of college, having forced his attorney father to realize that he will not follow in the family business but rather will pursue photography. Matt moves into a dorm and the first person he encounters is Grace. Theirs is an instant attraction, but one they keep at bay while they form a friendship. Eventually, though, their friendship becomes more.All college romances face one common issue: what will the couple do after graduation? Grace is a cellist and has an offer to tour Europe with an orchestra, while Matt has the opportunity to spend the summer in South America with National Geographic. Their careers aren't just taking them to different locations; they are headed to opposite ends of the earth. Grace isn't sure, though, that she will go on tour. For one thing, she feels responsible for helping her family surpass their almost Dickensian existence. And for another, Grace is astute enough - or pessimistic enough - to realize that she and Matt may not last through the separation.And now, fifteen years later, Matt and Grace see each other in a flash. She's boarding a subway in New York while he stands on the platform. They acknowledge each other. And Matt leaves a note in the Missed Connections section of Craigslist. Will Grace see it?I think you know the answer to that.Fortunately, Renee Carlino makes the answer almost superfluous. Sure, Matt and Grace will reconnect, but what happened to cause them to disconnect? And what will happen when they find each other again?This, faithful readers, is a story that you will love reading. Matt and Grace are interesting, intriguing, and engaging, even through the mistakes they make. Matt is occasionally a bit too clueless, while Grace sometimes can be defensively difficult and intractable. They are opposites in so many ways, yet they share fundamental similarities. They are artists, drawn to beauty, fantasy, grit, and turmoil. They understand a certain peripatetic nature to their art, even as they crave stability and a sense of home.When Carlino brings her couple back together, she does so with care and passion, even as she plays a card that causes even more drama and angst for Matt and Grace. Not a surprising card - careful readers will know what's coming - but one that will necessitate communication and empathy. After fifteen years apart, can Matt and Grace give that to each other?Carlino peppers the story with some hot headboard rocking, scenes that have just the right amount of detail and spice. It's important that we see Matt and Grace connect sexually as well as emotionally and intellectually, and connect sexually they do. Oh, yes, they do. One of the things I was curious about was how they would react to that spark when they find each other after all that time apart. Even though their relationship began (somewhat) platonically, an intense attraction existed. What will come of it now that they are in their thirties?If you like love stories featuring characters who know they belong together but have to make choices that keep them apart, this is for you. If you like reading love stories with hot sexy times and characters you wish you knew in real life, this is for you.

"This is one of those books that made my life miserable. I hated having to put it down, and the bad moods caused by needing to work or feed my family rather than read caused endless fun for friends, loved ones, and my students. (I will admit, since we're all friends and you won't tell on me, that I gave assignments that would keep my students busy so that I could read while they worked. Yes. I did.)Catherine and Zoe are sisters, but aside from blonde hair and a shared bloodline, that's about all they have in common. The older sister, Catherine is responsible, independent, level-headed, and stable. She's a nurse practitioner, married to her college sweetheart, and lives in a cozy home in a Boston suburb. She's happy and content, despite being unable to conceive a child. Zoe, on the other hand, is the wild child, the one who always bucked constrictions. The drinking and partying of her youth led to an unplanned pregnancy, and, in the midst of a harrowing addiction, she abandoned her daughter Willow in a bus station, calling Catherine to come get the child. Now, five years later, Catherine and husband Russell are Willow's legal guardians and consider themselves her parents.Catherine always felt loved and cherished by her father, and insecurely lacking by her mother Eve, who seemed (and continues to seem) to prefer Zoe's recklessness, labeling it ""brave."" Eve's husband - the girls' father - died, and now she's facing the task of selling their vacation home in Chance Harbor, Nova Scotia.Told through Catherine, WIllow, and Eve's perspectives, this is the story of a family in a state of flux. Catherine's seemingly loving marriage turns out to be anything but; she receives heartbreaking news from Russell that sends her spiraling. Willow adores her aunt, struggles with adoring her uncle, loves her grandmother, but, more than anything, misses her mother. She's a teenage girl who appreciates what she has but yet feels a yawning gape where her mother belongs. As the matriarch, Eve knows that she is the caretaker of her husband's memory, but she's hiding her own secrets that will rock her daughters. She also has to come to terms with certain realities of her marriage, and part of that means forgiving herself.Of all of the characters, including the reprehensible Russell, I found Eve to be the most dislikable. In fact, I did not enjoy the parts told by her, and I sort of wished that she would be miserable and unhappy. I don't think she was a good mother, certainly not to Catherine. When the truths about her marriage come out, it is clear why she prefers Zoe to Catherine, something she never bothered to try and minimize around her eldest daughter. Sure, she tells herself that Catherine doesn't need her like Zoe does, but her failure to recognize the power she has to hurt Catherine is deplorable. Catherine has a memory of her and Zoe playing in the ocean and getting ensnared by an undertow. Eve comes to help them and it is Zoe who she tugs to the shore; Catherine is left to an uncle. That act gutted me. It isn't that Catherine is perfect - she's prickly, insecure, and an occasional harridan, but I sympathized with her. To be expected to be the ""good"" child is a burden. So to be jettisoned aside like something disposable when the ""bad"" child returns can crush you.Willow, on the other hand, is utterly adorable. Her conflicted feelings toward her mother are understandable, as are her feelings about Catherine and Russell. Her adoration of Eve ... well, I forgive her for that because she can't see how awful Eve truly is when it comes to Catherine.This is an utterly engrossing book that slowly infiltrates you till you can't let it go. There are occasional pacing problems, and there are a few moments that seem a wee tad overwrought, but those are negligible. Holly Robinson makes you care about her characters, and she doesn't take quick, easy shortcuts.Read this and then come back and let me know what you thought, particularly about Eve.

"Jennifer Weiner, how much do I love the way thee writes?A considerable amount, as it turns out.My love is so tremendous that I will forgive you for The Feels that Who Do You Love provoked, for the wads of tissues that littered the floor around me as I read, for the puffy red face I got as I ugly cried, and for the times I had to wipe off my iPad when I had a spit-take from laughing.I will forgive you because I loved - and I mean LOVED - this book.When Andy and Rachel are sixteen, she tells him that she knows what it feels like to be the only one, She knows because she's always been the only one. Born with a heart defect, she spent the first eight years of her life in and out of hospitals, sporadically attending school, and feeling lonely and isolated. The one person who understood her died, leaving her ""the only one."" She tells Andy she understands this because he, too, feels like the only one. The son of a black father and white mother, Andy grows up poor but not impoverished, wearing hand-me-downs and solving problems with his fists. In Rachel, he feels he has found someone who does, in fact, understand what being the only one means.The two met when they were eight and Rachel happened upon him in a hospital lobby. In that moment, they connected in a way that true soulmates do. But of course the path of true love never runs smoothly, and over the next few decades, these two come together, break apart, come together, break apart, and so on. Do they belong together? Absolutely. Do they know that? I think they do. But their connection is almost too intense, almost too overwhelming.Jennifer Weiner uses the motifs of Rachel's broken heart and Andy's inability to know where he belongs throughout the book. Rachel and Andy, in many ways, are twin souls. They each suffer from heart defects, even though Rachel's is actually physical, and they each struggle to find a place where they fit in, even though Andy's stems from his parents' racial differences.On the surface, Rachel ought to be settled and content. She's from a wealthy family, she's pretty, she's intelligent, and she has the unconditional love of her parents and grandmother. She has everything, and yet she lacks what she wants more than anything: a full, deep, complete love. Andy did not grow up in such financially secure circumstances. His single mother struggled, oftentimes keeping her affection for her son at a distance. Andy may not have had a father physically present, but he did have a father figure, a neighbor who taught him how to be a man. Andy learned to channel his anger and frustration into running, earning a college scholarship. The longer and faster he ran, the more he gained confidence. Andy races his way to having everything, and yet he, too, lacks what he wants more than anything: a full, deep, complete love.Weiner lets you see the parts of her characters that are not lovable, that are not endearing. Both of them suffer from vanities, and both are terribly insecure. There were times I wanted to scream at Rachel, and there were times - oh, there were times, faithful readers - when I was disgusted with Andy. But I always, always wanted them happy, content, and together.What makes Jennifer Weiner's writing so exceptional is how well she understands her characters and their stories. She respects them and does not give them easy paths. You never feel manipulated when reading her books, and when you get to the last page, you feel as if you lost a friend or two. After I finished this book, I went back and re-read certain chapters, so loath was I to say good-bye to Rachel and Andy.Get ready to laugh, cry, and beg for more.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11HI2C02SRNGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145161781X#wasThisHelpful","R11HI2C02SRNGI","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had these straps (there are two in the package) for a couple of weeks now, and I have no complaints about them. They are long enough for me (I'm 5'10"") and my husband, who is 6'4"", to use with ease. They are sturdy, functional, and help me stretch out my hamstrings and back. I haven't used them for yoga, but rather just in daily stretching exercises. They are constructed in a durable fashion, and I can tell that I will get a lot of wear out of them. At the same time, though, they are lightweight, so don't assume that just because they're sturdy and durable that they somehow weigh more than your average strap.Give these a try.

"This book has been compared to We Were Liars, and that makes me want to scream, ""YOU WISH YOU WERE LIKE We Were Liars!""We Were Liars is evocative and heartbreaking and bittersweet, and it makes you think and feel. E. Lockhart's characters are unforgettable, and she knows how to craft a mystery that keeps you fully engaged because even if you think you know how this will play out, you can't be fully certain.And then there is Damage Done, which all but telegraphs the solution to the ""mystery"" right from the first page. Worse, you won't be all that interested.The central problem is Julia, now christened Lucy. She is a detestable character, and it is nearly impossible to get close to her. She's mourning the loss of a family member and the tragedy that caused it, as well as bits and pieces of the life she left behind when her family had to move to avoid fallout from the tragedy. She doesn't miss much, actually, about her time as Julia Vann, and she might even be happier as Lucy Black.But someone is determined to bring Julia Vann back to life, and that someone presents a threat to Lucy Black and her parents.And so there is this whole ""what does this person want and why"" and ""what really happened"" thing that you're supposed to care about. Maybe you would, if you could care at all about Julia/Lucy. You may not even mind the fact that Amanda Panitch gives away the big mystery right at the start. It would take the blindest, most unaware reader to not figure out what's going on, and I found that a little offensive. It felt as if Panitch thought I was so stupid that I needed such obvious clues.Fortunately, you have Michael and Alane, Lucy's new boyfriend and friend respectively. Those two deserve far better than Lucy Black, that I can assure you. In fact, I spent most of this book not wondering what happened during the 22 minutes of hell that Julia suffered ""before,"" but rather wondering why on earth Alane was friends with Lucy and what in the hell Michael saw in her that made him want to date her.In We Were Liars, E. Lockhart made sure we bonded with her main character, and she kept us guessing. It isn't necessary that you always like characters (Nick and Amy Dunne, I'm looking at you and Gone Girl), but it is necessary that you become invested in their story. I could not have given a fiddler's fart about Julia/Lucy or her mystery. The only reason I kept reading this was to see if Michael and Alane ever realized how much better they would be without Lucy Black in their lives. So I suppose the fact that Amanda Panitch could create characters like Michael and Alane gives me hope that I will enjoy her next book more than this one.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G98JHVU36QLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWWKFSO#wasThisHelpful","R2G98JHVU36QLD","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot to like about this book, or should I say that there is one character to truly enjoy: Adam. It would be easy for him to come across as pathetic and weak, but Natalie Martin makes him completely empathetic. He's a man who fell in love with the person he thought was his soulmate, ignoring along the way things to which he should have given stronger attention. Sarah closes off parts of her life from him, not revealing much, if anything, about her childhood. But Adam loves her, and love, as they say, is blind.It isn't until he proposes to her while on holiday that he realizes how much he should have noticed, how many questions he should have demanded she answer. Sarah rejects his proposal, and Adam is left reeling and brokenhearted.Due to certain issues with their housing, they are forced to continue living together for months. Sarah largely hides herself away, refusing to say any more to Adam about her rejection aside from telling him that he's better off without her. Adam reacts with anger and pain, attempting to soothe his hurt through alcohol and hook-ups. He tries to exorcise his love for Sarah, even as he has to come home to her.Desperate to understand the woman he loves, Adam stumbles upon Sarah's journals, dating back to her girlhood. The more he learns, though, the more questions he has. Why didn't he already know these things about her? Why did she keep so many secrets from him?This is a somewhat frustrating book because you find yourself questioning Adam's judgment, and since he's the only likable one of the pair, you need to be on his side. It is nearly impossible to figure out why he's drawn to Sarah. She's cold, she's remote, and she's abhorrently selfish. When you find out why she's kept herself removed from him, I think you're supposed to sympathize with her. I didn't. It made her actions even more of a head scratcher. I didn't mind when Adam messed around with other women because I hoped he would realize that there was someone far better for him out there.Natalie Martin's story is interesting, and Adam is a wonderful character. The weakness here is Sarah. She's just irredeemable, and in order to buy in to Adam's love for her, we need to find something about her to like ourselves.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190GT6VT04RTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6Z3S6Y#wasThisHelpful","R190GT6VT04RTT","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something about these Fool's Gold romances that makes me want to move to this fictional town and find myself a man. Even if I'm already married.Maya isn't a Fool's Gold native. She moved in her teens when her mother married a wealthy man with two sons. For the first time, Maya had stability and a family, but of course it didn't last, following the dissolution of her mother's marriage. Maya moved to Los Angeles, where she worked as a television reporter and then a news producer. Now, ten years later, she's back, working as a public relations agent of sorts for the town. The spokesman hired to star in the ads happens to be the handsome Del, Maya's first love and the man she abandoned.You might say that their first meeting is a wee tad awkward.One thing quite apparent is that the attraction between them has not dimmed at all, even with a decade between Maya quitting Del and Fool's Gold. Sure, he's still nursing a grudge, but he can't ignore the spark that remains.When you don't know what commitment looks like, as is the case with Maya, it makes it even more difficult to actually try it. When she left Del, she had - she believed - valid reasons for doing so, the strongest of which was her fear. Maya knew she loved Del, but she was afraid that her love would not be enough, that she would not be enough. It's the pattern she observed with her mother throughout her life.Del's family life was more stable than Maya's only in that he and his siblings were close and his parents remained married. But there were instabilities, too, and, like Maya, Del left town. In fact, he's continued to roam, far and wide. He isn't sure he wants to stay in one place, even if it is the nirvana of Fool's Gold.You know that these two are meant to be together, but how can they? What if Maya is finally ready to put down roots, but Del still wants to travel the world? How can they reconcile that?Susan Mallery serves up fun, engaging characters, as well as some hot headboard rocking. Surely the sexual chemistry between Del and Maya will be enough to keep them together, right? i know I'd have a difficult time leaving his prowess.You will reconnect with some past stars in the Fool's Gold series, and you will welcome Del and Maya to the fold. I enjoyed their story, and it did not diminish in the least my dreams of moving to Fool's Gold myself.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P3Z6ZNQPNK6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFSZVPI#wasThisHelpful","R2P3Z6ZNQPNK6V","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a long, deep attachment to Kristan Higgins. I want to be her best friend (even if she's a Yankees fan), and, even more, I want to live in her books. I love the way she writes. Love stories that break my heart and leave me feeling happy and crushing on her heroes.This one, though, gave me pause. For one thing, it's about two sisters, one of whom clearly is going through a terrible time in her marriage. Rachel has been with Adam for years, struggled through infertility with him to become parents to preschool triplet girls, and loves him and her life deeply. She's the perfect homemaker, making sure that fresh flowers are in a vase, dinner is simmering, and that the house and children are clean and tidy when he comes home. She is proud of the life they have crafted together, so when she happens to see an incriminating text on his cell phone, she chooses to believe that it is not a photo of someone's lady parts but rather, in a burst of Higgins humor, that of a tree.Younger sister Jenny does not have the happy home or beautiful children. She's been divorced from Owen for a little over a year, but has managed to stay close friends not only with him but her successor. She's even delivered their first born child. But it's difficult. She feels unfulfilled, so when the opportunity to open up her wedding dress making business in her hometown of Cambry-on-Hudson, she leaves Manhatten and heads home, where she meets her building's superintendent, the mysterious - and wildly snarky - Leo.Rachel and Jenny each face turning points in their lives. Rachel has to decide if she can stay married to Adam. Or rather, she has to decide if not being with him is worth the cost of breaking up her family. Maybe this photo was a one-off, something Adam didn't intend on happening and will not allow to happen again. She loves him, and she knows he loves her. Marriages go through this sort of thing, don't they? Doesn't she owe the girls and their family life a mind open to second chances?Jenny, meanwhile, has to figure out where she wants to be in this world. Is she content to be Owen's buddy, on the outside of his happy marriage? Doesn't she want one of her own? And what of Leo? He's private and closed off, yet she can't be wrong about the spark between them, can she?For all of the humor in this book, typical of what Kristan Higgins does, there is a greater sense of the bittersweet. This is a heavier, more emotionally intense book than what you're used to from her. She breaks your heart and puts it back together, leaving you hopeful that Rachel and Jenny are on their way to the happiness and contentment they crave.Told in the sisters' alternating voices, you get to know the sisters and you become immersed in their stories. It took about two chapters for me to realize that I could not, even if I wanted, put this book down. I desperately wanted to know what would happen between Rachel and Adam, which Higgins keeps as the bigger mystery than that between Jenny and Leo. At the same time, Higgins addresses life moments that you can relate to - the busyness of parenting, the occasional lapses in a marriage, the longing for emotional commitment.My love of Kristan Higgins' books knows no bounds. If You Only Knew does nothing less than entrench my adoration for her, showing me that she can make me cry and laugh in equal measure.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UBZ6GD7XLVDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFS2A98#wasThisHelpful","R1UBZ6GD7XLVDI","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sinclairs, a Kennedy-esque New England family, summer together at the family's private island off the coast of Massachusetts. Two parents, three daughters, and the daughters' six children. One of the grandchildren, Cadence, narrates this story of what happened one a sultry summer evening between her, her two oldest cousins Johnny and Mirren, and a family friend named Gat.The problem is that Cady can't remember the events that led to her illness, a debilitating case of headaches that send her to bed. She is desperate to recall how she wound up with the headaches, just as her divorced mother and father, aunts and grandfather, are to keep her safe and healthy. Cady begs Johnny and Mirren to tell her what happened, as she also asks Gat, a boy whom she loves desperately. No one will tell her, though. They wait for her to remember on her own.Cady's memories detail the events leading up to that night, revealing her parents' divorce, how Gat came to join them, and the evolution of her love for him. Together with Gat, Mirren, and Johnny, Cady forms a quartet that calls itself The Liars, largely because they are teenagers and, as such, none too keen on full disclosure. They take care of themselves first, and if the occasional fib is needed to cover their tracks, so be it.The King Lear allusions are in full force, with the patriarch of the family causing friction between his three daughters. With the death of their mother, the sisters begin drinking and fighting, their arguments escalating to the point that The Liars become increasingly frustrated by and disenchanted with the women and their grandfather.Relationships between the characters are every bit as integral to this book as its central mystery. The grandfather and his daughters is but one. Mothers and children is equally as important, whether between Cady and her mother or the other two sisters and their kids. Cady and The Liars is another important relationship, especially that between Cady and Gat. She loves him, in that first teenage love way, and, in doing so, hands him the power to hurt her. She relies on The Liars to help her. They know, even as she does not, that her memories must come back to her without their help. She has to do this on her own.And yet Cady cannot remember. What happened the night she got hurt?E. Lockhart leaves you clues, laying them out in a way that escalates tension and mystery while building empathy for Cady. Lockhart ensures that you never lose sight of the fact that The Liars are four teenagers, kids who may know better but yet are still too young to truly discern the questionable wisdom of knee-jerk reactions to their elders. The revelation of what did happen that awful night is surprising, even if Lockhart gives you plenty of hints.This is a wholly engrossing, evocatively written book. You will feel the isolation of that island and Cady's frustration and her family's fractured, tenuous truce. There is an overaching sense of despair and grief, but why? When Cady does remember, that sense of sadness becomes even more intense. And yet there is also a bittersweet sense of completion and contentment. Cady and her fellow Liars have to re-establish peace between them and their families, and it all hinges on Cady's memories.I loved this one. I could not put it down, and when it was over I missed the characters and story terribly. It's a young adult story that appeals to all adults, regardless of whether they are teenagers or not.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW52I134QTBCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574126X#wasThisHelpful","RW52I134QTBCL","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of those ""opposites attract"" kind of stories that warms my cold hard heart and makes the blood flow at the same time.If you know what I mean.Ryan's one of those guys whose family only understands love and support. They are almost too good to be true. Brandon, on the other hand, is one of those guys whose family is catastrophically homophobic. They are almost too awful to be true.When they meet, it isn't quite instantaneous love, largely because Brandon isn't just in the closet, he is absolutely petrified and in the closet. For them to be together, it's going to take a lot of love and patience on Ryan's side and a lot of bravery and courage on Brandon's.Some people like the F/F romances, but I am all about the M/M. Something about that combo and some hot headboard rocking really piques my interest. Z.B. Heller sure knows how to deliver the sexy times because this book has some scorching scenes. Strap on your vibrators, girls. If you're into M/M hotness, this book takes you to DEFCON 5.At the same time, the love story itself is gentle and occasionally bittersweet. Ryan and Brandon have a lot to work through, and those issues won't be solved quickly or easily. This isn't a fairytale. It's the story of two people who make mistakes and who have to suffer the consequences of those mistakes. At the center, though, is a connection that can't be fractured.I liked this one quite a bit.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQMJUH27Z5NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I6922S#wasThisHelpful","R3FQMJUH27Z5NK","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsNina knows nothing about life except that she must always be the responsible person. With an alcoholic mother and a young teen sister, the maintenance of her family falls to her. Unfortunately, her mother's alcoholism causes her younger sister to be sent to foster care, her mother to rehab, and Nina to the arms of the man who was her beloved father's boss. Her beloved dead father, who died in an accident while in the employment of this man.But Nina is nothing if not practical, and so she gets a job, working in a nightclub, with someone she suspects should be her enemy. She meets Alex, a young, wealthy profligate and finds herself irresistibly drawn to him. Nina, the young woman with a ground, practical sensibility, can't fight the attraction.The one thing Nina has always known is that she can trust her instincts. They tell her to RUN from Alex, but she can't. They also tell her to be far more suspicious of her boss than she is, but she can't. As strong as her practical, common sense may be, her need to live a little supersedes it. She's nineteen, and she's spent most of her life taking care of others. Isn't it time she get a chance to live a little?If only her heart wasn't involved.There is a sweetness to this story that isn't evident at first. Nina is tough, both on the outside and the inside. She does not suffer fools, least of which herself, and her BS radar is finely tuned. Yet when she meets Alex, she finds herself letting go of all of those rules, all of those worries. Alex gives her a chance to breathe and to feel free. What girl her age wouldn't jump at that, even with every cell in her brain screaming at her to play it smart and cautious?The thing about Alex, though, is that Nina can sense a vulnerability to him that he wants to keep on lockdown. He's every bit as wary of Nina as she is of him, and he's also every bit as drawn to her as she is to him.Like I said, there is a sweetness to this story that takes a while to develop. Alex presents himself as a Dionysian kind of man, one for whom responsibility is an anathema. Nina, on the other hand, needs stability. Alex's lifestyle will not help her get her sister back, nor will it help her mother stay sober.So what will happen between these two? Well, I suspect you have an idea. Even with that sort of predictability, Tara Bond invests you in Alex and Nina's relationship and takes you on a few unexpected detours.Oh, and she also writes some panty dropping sexy times. Strap on your vibrators, girls. Alex, for all of his self-indulgence, knows how to please a woman. BLESS HIM. Outside of the bedroom, though, is he the right man for Nina? Is she the right woman for him?The ending may seem a tad too neatly tied, but the rest of this is sheer fun. Nina's story is a sad one, as is Alex's, which means you will root for these two to find happiness together.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VE8PA7T0XH9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1471111601#wasThisHelpful","R3VE8PA7T0XH9V","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you think men and women can be best friends without one of them wanting the sexy times with the other? Before I got married, most of my friends were male. I was always more comfortable with men than women, and I enjoyed hanging out with guys. But as good of friends as I was with those dudes, none of the friendships was as close and emotionally deep as the one that Parker has with Ben.And, really, those two ought to be smart enough to figure out that the friendship they have is so rich and complete because they love each other. And I don't mean platonically, although that certainly exists too.They have spent six years of friendship stubbornly trying to prove to one and all that they can be friends without the benefits, and it's worked out well for them. When Parker's boyfriend dumps her, though, she thinks she wants to ""be like Ben"" and have a string of sex-only encounters. Except that isn't Parker. It isn't the person she is.Ben tries to teach her how to sex and sex only, but .... well .... you can probably predict how that turns out. Thank goodness Lauren Layne gets you to the ending with heart and emotion, making you care about Ben and Parker. She writes with respect for her characters and their story, never manipulating you or forcing a happy ending where there might not be one.And the sexy times. Strap on your vibrators, girls, because Lauren Layne writes some juicy delicious hot headboard rocking. Ben is, um, adept, let's just say.I enjoyed this book so much. It's fun, it's emotional, and it has characters I liked spending time with.

The thing is, Liz might just want that breakup to happen.When she and Dante begin, she is somewhat disgusted by his new high-end hiking boots and gung-ho demeanor. Dante is almost like an overgrown puppy, so earnest is he in trying to make Liz happy. More than once while reading this, I wondered why. Why, Dante, do you want to stay with this woman? Liz is about as enjoyable as a bad cough, and she makes it undeniably clear that Dante's companionship is not what she wants on this trek.Liz's hike is equal parts self-discovery and suspense, the latter due to the arrival of a Deliverence-type duo of brothers that makes her Spidey Sense tingle with distrust. Are these two up to no good, or is Liz perhaps projecting her own harmful traits onto them? And what of Dante? Will he stick around despite Liz's inhospitable demeanor, or will he head back to civilization?Sonja Yoerg does a nice job of balancing the various dynamics at play. On the one hand, you have Liz's attempt to understand herself and to make peace with some of her selfish decisions. Liz is one of those people whose first thought is of herself (again, WHY, Dante?) and others second. I think she'd be surprised at that assessment, though, because she can justify any hurts she inflicts by pointing out that they benefited her at the time. She also feels that the world owes her something, largely because she's a widow. With a dead husband in her life, she's surely entitled to indulging in self-interest, right? As she puts one foot in front of the other on her hike, though, she is forced to face the reality of the pain she causes. She begins to understand the mistakes she has made, and she might - just might - also realizes the depths of her selfishness.There is also the mystery surrounding the brothers. Are they as dangerous as Liz suspects, or are they merely strange and odd? Liz's relationship with Dante is also part of the mix. Dante is lovable and sweet, but he's also fairly rigid in his religious beliefs. Liz finds his lack of tolerance frustrating at best, and she knows that he will react with extreme anger and hurt when he finds out what she's done.Her time on the trail helps Liz forgive herself for her mistakes, but I'm not sure that process would have been all that tedious under any circumstances. She's a selfish woman at this point in her life. She needs to hike that tendency out of herself, so those 200 miles are an opportunity to reflect and grow.I enjoyed the story, even if I didn't enjoy Liz. I understand why she did what she did, but, like I said, her selfishness is so extreme that I don't think she could excise it with a long hike. I liked Dante, but the fact that he was so devoted to Liz made me question his wisdom. Like, a lot. The subplot with the Deliverance boys is a bit much at times, although it does provide a workable mechanism for Liz's adventures.In the end, I just wish I'd liked Liz more.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R26IJTIBR5GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI028IQ#wasThisHelpful","R1R26IJTIBR5GR","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anna Geneva (I love that name) left Haven, Michigan, in disgrace five years ago after it was revealed that she and Mack, a married father of one, were rocking the headboard. Well, ""were rocking"" implies that they rocked it more than once, which was not the case. But that sole experience was enough to besmirch both Anna's and Mack's reputations, made all the more humiliating for Anna when Mack told her he wanted to stay with his wife and try to rebuild his marriage.Now, a half decade later, Anna has returned to town for her mother's wedding. Maeve Geneva has spent the last twenty-some years pining for the idiot husband who abandoned her and her daughter, a man cruel enough to send her an occasional postcard, just to keep her hooked. Thankfully, she met a kind man whose patience and devotion won her over ... or so it seems.Anna's return agitates Haven, even if Mack and his wife are over. He knows he treated Anna badly, and he wants to make it up to her, but as deeply as Anna cared for him, she isn't sure that this is a smart move for her.This novella is a companion piece to Kristina Riggle's The Life You Imagined, in which you revisit not just Mack and Anna but other characters from that book as well. I didn't read The Life You Imagined, and I suspect that's why this book was just sort of meh to me. It's sweet and cute, but it didn't really leave any lingering impression on me. Mack and Anna are nice characters, but I felt an emotional disconnect from them.My suggestion is to read The Life You Imagined and then pick up this one. Perhaps you will have a better experience.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REUGULN01IJSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EJBI7A#wasThisHelpful","REUGULN01IJSE","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when your mother abandons her family to run off with a famous playwright? Perhaps it goes without saying that you would have some adjustment issues, which no doubt are exacerbated by your father deciding he isn't up to the task of raising you, either.When Sara dies, her grown children Nigel and Louise return to the country ""estate"" where she decamped after her marriage to Patrick, a man as revered as he is reviled for his talents. (One of his plays receives excoriating reviews, to which Patrick takes extreme - and hilarious - umbrage.) Nigel and Louise encounter not a sprawling home but a house in extreme disrepair. Nothing seems to work as it should in this home that should be far grander, far more opulent. If Sara left them for this, not to mention the irascible Patrick, then what does that say about her love for her children?The pair manage their, let's face it, minimal grief, by focusing on what the house could be. They are determined to restore it to its glory, and, along the way, make it theirs. Of course, each of them has singular motives: Nigel and his wife would like to make it a second home, while Louise flat out wants to live there with her ill-begotten teenage children. But what of Patrick? He never liked them anyway, as flashbacks display with hilarity, so he's on his own.Into this hot mess comes Mia, a somewhat scattered grad student who wants to interview Patrick as part of her thesis. For Mia, this house represents the chance to reinvent herself in a new career as a bed and breakfast owner and hostess. Of all the parties at play, Mia is the most transparent, but in a good way. Sure, she has ulterior motives, but she doesn't hide them.One thing that everyone can agree on is that each of them sketches a very different character of Sara. For Nigel, she tried to compensate for leaving him by footing the bill for his schooling. Louise felt distinctly like an outsider, watching her mother choose Patrick to the point of never defending or supporting her while in his presence. And Patrick views his wife as his passionate lover, a woman who devoted herself to him in absolute fullness.Even together, these three do not know the real Sara. As they come together after her death, though, they, with the aid of Mia, begin to form a fuller, truer picture.The house in the story symbolizes Sara: what she should be is not what she in fact was, her supporting beams fractured in ways not apparent on the surface. Together with Mia, Sara's survivors are able to renovate (so to speak) their visions of her.There is much to like and enjoy in this book, not the least of which is its humor. Amanda Coe writes some laugh-out-loud moments that are dearly needed in the midst of characters who are, on the whole, rather unpleasant. Nigel is a somewhat spineless man completely directed by his overbearing wife, Louise is just flat out pathetic and annoying, and Patrick is a complete boor. Only Mia is presented as someone you would want to know, and, even then, she makes a couple of decisions that are less than impressive.Fortunately, Coe's writing is entertaining enough to overcome a rather sparse, rushed ending. Enjoy the wit she delivers.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NT7NMGXI237U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD8Z546#wasThisHelpful","R2NT7NMGXI237U","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1.5 starsUnfortunately, this book fell flat for me. As I read it, I kept thinking it seemed like other books I've read, and when I finished it, I couldn't remember much in particular about it.Chloe Bennet (yeah ... you've got some metafiction on your hands) is a teenage girl desperate to understand Boys. They make no sense to her. Why are they drawn to Mean Girls, rather than intelligent, talented, pretty - if not all together beautiful - girls like her and her friends? Whyyyyy?To understand this, Chloe and her chums devise a data collection process involving spreadsheets and other stuff, and they set out to 'boywatch.' The girls attend an all girls' school, and they somewhat eagerly, somewhat anxiously, somewhat fearfully anticipate the annual dance held between their school and St. Thomas', an all boys' school. Last year, the girls were roundly humiliated by a Mean Girl, and while they are determined that it won't happen again, they are also savvy enough to acknowledge that it very well might. In order to forestall it, though, they have to be able to anticipate and appropriately respond to those St. Thomas boys.And now a bunch of stuff that's happened in hundreds of other YA novels happens. Was I supposed to feel charmed by Chloe stepping in dog poo? Or was I supposed to sympathize with her? Empathize? My reaction was more one of vigorous eye rolling. One of the girls has an alcoholic, absentee mother. Gosh. I've never encountered that before in a YA book.Sometimes there is loving, respectful humor directed at Chloe and her friends, as well as Boys and the Mean Girls, and, of course, parents and other out-of-touch adults. The girls have a little band, called Overgrown Throttle and the Tempted Obscurity, which should give them some sort of coolness points, but doesn't. At least not to the extent that they wish it would. I enjoyed those scenes, largely because the girls' interaction and dialogue in those had more originality than the rest of the book.The thing is, I did like Chloe. She's occasionally abrasive, and she is almost comically self-absorbed, but both of those are very real attributes in teenage girls. She felt real to me, and I commiserated with her insecurities and her frustrations over finishing second (or third or fourth) behind the queen of the Mean Girls. You can't help but hope that Chloe will get her boy.I wanted to like the book as much as I liked Chloe, but it all felt so predictable and familiar.Review copy provided from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on voxlibris.net@VoxLibris","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGUQVSRU03OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140833738X#wasThisHelpful","R2QGUQVSRU03OZ","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where there are three sisters, tears and drama are sure to follow, right?The Herington sisters fall into their own defined categories. Firstborn Maggie is the captain, the organizer, the one who maintains order and tradition. Jess, sandwiched between the older and youngest, is adrift. She doesn't cause trouble and tends to play it safe. The baby, Virgie, lives on the other side of the country and, as the youngest tend to be, is a bit more free-spirited than her sisters.The girls and their families gather every year at Maggie's house, or their parents', for a summer holiday. This year, though, they face something new: their parents' divorce.Things change, people change, and the measure of your emotional health is how you respond. Each of the sisters is facing her own personal adjustments, even as they still attempt to come to terms with the dissolution of their parents' marriage. Maggie is at that stage where her babies aren't babies any more, and she thinks she might want another one. But what of Mac, her husband? What does he want? Jess isn't even sure she wants to be married any longer. It isn't that she doesn't love her husband so much as she isn't in love with him. And Virgie (my favorite of the three) is at a professional standstill. Is she willing to stick with the job she's had, or is it time to move on? She's also in a new romantic relationship, although she has no idea where it is headed.Of course there are dramatic moments. One family member faces a health scare, another one is in the grips of a health crisis, and two have to confront emotional crises. The sisters' mother no longer lives in the family home, but she's very present, offering observations and guidance when she can. She comes across as a sort of benevolent god, mostly adored by her daughters (despite being the one to terminate her marriage), and fairly grounded. Maggie, Jess, and Virgie need her, and she makes the effort to be a presence in their lives.There are humorous moments and times of sadness in this book, as you would expect. In many ways, it's straight out of Central Casting for Chick Lit. It has such a strong sense of familiarity that you feel like you've read this book before. There are no big surprises (well, one of the storylines was dispatched with far quicker than I thought), and the overall sense is that of one big warm fuzzy.I don't have much to say about this book. If you're a fan of traditional women's fiction, this is a solid choice.

"2.5 starsSomewhere in this book lies a fantastic YA mystery. It's in there. The hope of discovering it kept me reading and reading.And yet ...Lena and Charlie dated for years. Granted, they were apart for a good amount of time, attending colleges in different countries and each traveling hither and yon. But she met his family, for goodness sake. It was a serious relationship, and she loved him. Imagine her shock while at his funeral, when she discovers that Charlie had been dating another girl: Aubrey, a midwestern American girl whom he'd been seeing for about a year. Aubrey had not met Charlie's family, and the Charlie she dated seems quite different from Lena's. One Charlie loved olives, the other Charlie hated them, amongst other things.And then there is his death. No body was found, and Lena is suspicious. Is Charlie really dead? Or did he fake his death? And if he faked it, why?The two girls team up to find out what happened to their boyfriend, a partnership that takes them from France to England to India. Along the way, they discover that there was a third Charlie, and they begin wondering if either of them ever really knew him.The girls do not immediately trust each other, which adds another layer of mystery. Are their motives pure? Aubrey is honest about hers (Charlie took something of hers that she wants back), but is Lena? There is an undercurrent of ""who do you trust"" to this book, which makes you question every character you encounter.The problem is that as a reader, you have to trust someone in a mystery. One of them must appear to be legitimate, even if that turns out not to be the case. These people are so transparently selfish and self-serving that you can't be sure that any of them are legitimate. Then again, that's one of the ongoing motifs of Heltzel's story: we partition ourselves out of necessity. For one audience, we put on one face. For another, a different one. But what happens when you can't keep track of who you're supposed to be?Charlie is presumed dead, but that is not the only presumption in this book. Aubrey appears to be an innocent victim, especially in light of the far worldlier Lena, but is she? And is Lena the victimized girlfriend, or was she up to something as well? Then there is Charlie. You do learn about him, although not nearly enough.The big plot twist that comes is not such a shock because the build up to it leads you there. But - and this is a biiiig but - it makes no sense. The ""why"" is not answered with any effectiveness whatsoever. In fact, what appears to be a justification for why this happened turns out to be every bit as obfuscating as the rest of the book.What Charlie, Presumed Dead needs is some answers. All of the vagueness adds up to a book that doesn't leave much of an impression. The intended audience for this is teens, and teens don't do well with the nebulous. With no clarity of character (or plot, for that matter), you're left without a firm investment in the story. When you get to the end, I doubt Anne Heltzel intends for your reaction to be, ""So?""I wanted to like this.

"Beth and Jack met eight years ago while on vacation in Corsica. She thought both felt love; she was certain of it, in fact. Yet she has heard nothing from him since he put her on a plane to leave, despite his promises that he loved her and would come for her.When she interviews with him for a job, the betrayal she felt all those years ago comes back full force. Beth isn't sure she can work for Jack, yet she needs the job, and it's something she's good at doing. Jack is glad - and relieved - to have Beth working with him. He knows he has some apologizing to do, and he wants to help her understand what happened when she left Corsica.This is a sweet, adorable romance novel that might just make you cry. (I did. I had to grab more than one tissue.) Beth and Jack are enjoyable and likable, the sort of chick lit couple you want to be together. He tries to do the right thing, even if the right thing hurts him most of all, and she somehow manages to maintain hope that she will get the love she wants.There is one scene with some sexy times, and it isn't wildly detailed.

"How good is this book? Well, first of all, ""good"" is an insult. Let me see if I can come up with something more effective. How compelling? How intoxicating? How sublime? How FREAKING TRANSCENDENT is this book?It is so compelling and intoxicating and sublime and transcendent that I am worried about writing this review for fear that I will not do Jandy Nelson justice.Noah and Jude are twins who look nothing alike. He's dark and awkward and socially withdrawn, while she is golden and bright and open to friends and engagement. The two have an ongoing barter system of sorts in which, believing that they own the universe, they offer its various parts in exchange for something. When Noah, an artist who draws and paints, sketches a cubist-style portrait of a mysterious - and naked - British male model, Jude offers him the sun in exchange for the drawing. It magnetizes her, and she must have it.This turns out to be one of the last friendly exchanges between the two.It isn't that Noah and Jude are combative or competitive with each other. Quite the opposite, in fact. Noah acknowledges certain truths: their father loves Jude more, and their mother shows no preferences. The latter point, in fact, becomes the chisel that causes the first fracture. Remember that Rod Stewart lyric? The first cut is the deepest? Such is the case between Noah and Jude.Exacerbating the situation is the appearance of Brian, the boy next door. That first cut? It has a partner now, and so strong is the resentment that Noah and Jude hold against each other that their relationship might never overcome the onslaught.Told from both Noah and Jude's perspectives, the time frame jumps back and forth between Noah's story, the ""before,"" and Jude's, the ""after."" You see what divided the twins, and you see what might tear them asunder for the rest of their lives.This novel is an ode to art and the power it has over us. Jandy Nelson uses magical realism to show the depth and breadth of art - the way you can actually see someone's spirit in the colors and bursts and flares that emanate from them. Jude is an artist, too, only her form is sculpture. One twin draws and paints, the other molds. Separately they create beautiful parts, but together they could create stunning fullness. Noah, however, is not inclined to any sort of partnership with his sister. As he observes, ""Revolutionaries aren't team players.""Noah certainly is a revolutionary, although he heads in a direction he does not anticipate. The same goes for Jude, who is every bit as revolutionary as her brother. She does not see art as her future, yet it is there, within her grasp. She needs Noah to help her find her way, though, just as he needs her.As much as this is a book about the power of art, it's also about the power of love. Jude and Noah each realize love's destructive power; for the most part during their sixteen years, destruction is what they know best. But as Jude comes to see, ""Love does as it undoes. It goes after, with equal tenacity: joy and heartbreak.""Yes, twins joy and heartbreak are as physically present as Noah and Jude. You can't have one without the other. You can't know joy unless you've experienced heartbreak, and vice-versa. Jude puts it this way: ""We are, each one of us for the other, a key to a door that otherwise would've remained locked forever."" What she and Noah need to understand is that they are the keys for each other, and without each other, parts of them - important, vital parts - will never be opened.I could go on and on about symbolism (the names 'Jude' and 'Noah' alone) and subtext and all that sort of stuff. The literature geek in me is so excited about this book that I made it part of the reading list for my AP seniors this year. I cannot wait to analyze and discuss it.You need to read this book is you appreciate lyrical writing. You need to read it if you like characters who make you feel, all the way to your toes. You need to read this if you want to experience joy and heartbreak yourself.It's that .... good.Published on VoxLibirs.net@VoxLibris","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP9AS9F08YFTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803734964#wasThisHelpful","RP9AS9F08YFTC","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is a woman who began in the mailroom and has held nearly every job at her father's business. Now she is on the cusp of earning a top managerial spot. What she needs is Derek Block's brand new high rise as her account.At first theirs is a strictly professional relationship, but COME ON. You know that won't last. Frankie discovers that Derek is even more adept at pleasuring a woman than he is at designing buildings. Strap on your vibrators, girls. When Derek starts rocking that headboard, he will rock it right into next week.Clearly neither Derek nor Frankie reads romance novels because these two think - they really believe - that they can have a sex only, no strings attached relationship. Yeah .... no. Not that either is open to disclosing that they are seeing each other. Frankie doesn't want to risk her father's censure, and Derek is blocking certain truths from Frankie. (GET IT? Blocking truths?)Across this series of novellas, you will find some corporate intrigue, some romantic intrigue, jealousy, passion, romance, emotional cruelty, professional malfeasance, and, occasionally, True Love. And a whole lot of sexy times.It's a fun, hot series, even if it feels a bit drawn out. The occasional lapses in pacing and somewhat predictable storyline are overcome, though, by the romance between Derek and Frankie.

"You know the story of Sleeping Beauty, right? Rose gets pricked by a needle and takes a nice, long nap, until a handsome prince gives her a sweet kiss (I'm thinking he slipped her some tongue), after which she wakes up and the two live happily ever after.Well, in this retelling, you have Amelia, who wakes up not knowing who she is, where she is, or anything about her life. Fortunately, Ian, the handsome prince, is there to fill her in. Amelia is a clone of his dead lover Susannah, who made sure that Amelia looks like her but doesn't share any of her memories. Amelia likes foods that Susannah didn't like, and she (apparently) enjoys submissive sexy times.Ian is worried that Amelia is programmed to like him and submit to him, when he'd really rather these things be her choices. Meanwhile, there is a sect of the population that is vehemently opposed to clones, which means that Amelia is in danger.So there is a lot going on.I tried, faithful readers, to get into this book. But Amelia was a little too dull for me, the whole anti-clone thing was a bit over-the-top, and Ian is a bit too unknown. This is the first of a three-part series, and I don't knkow if I will read beyond this because I don't know if I'm interested enough in Amelia and Ian's story.But. The sex? The sex scenes are pretty awesome. For a virgin-clone, Amelia knows what she likes, and she knows that she enjoys experiencing these things with Ian. And who can blame her? I pictured him as older than he is (he's in his late twenties), which seemed to fit his back story better, but that really doesn't have anything to do with anything and I'm not even sure why I'm including that observation.Anyway.The sex scenes are pret-ty awesome, so you girls will need to strap on your vibrators while you read this one.Unfortunately, the rest of the book isn't so hot. Amelia is a tabula rasa to some degree, and the people around her try to mold her to what they think she should be. You are told (more than once) that she resembles Susannah but has her own look, which I guess fits with cloning? I thought clones were supposed to be precise copies, but, when you think about it, each copy loses some of the sharpness and clarity of the original. Perhaps there is no such thing as an exact replica.I think part of the problem with this book is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it an erotic romance? A damning commentary on the dangers of cloning? A sort of exploration of how we expect people to be the way we want them to be as opposed to how they are?If you read it, let me know what you thought.

"This book defies any quick categorization or labelling. It also defies any quick and easy review.It is Senna's thirty-third birthday, and she wakes up in a strange room in a strange house in a strange place. She has no idea where she is or why she is there. All she knows for sure is that she is trapped.Senna quickly discovers that she is not alone; someone else is held captive as well. This person has a particular significance to Senna, yet she cannot figure out what commonality shared between them is cause to kidnap them. The two form a somewhat easy alliance, born more of a desperate need to survive than of any lingering affection. There will be no escaping this jail, that much is certain. What the two prisoners must determine is whether they can, indeed, survive.I always tell my students that writers never give their characters the age of thirty-three accidentally. If you are told that a character is thirty-three, you must expect that something cataclysmic will happen to that person. It is an age that demands some sort of spiritual death, some sort of reawakening and rebirth. Such is the case with Senna. She has to revisit particularly painful parts of her life in order to stay alive. She has to confront certain pains and agonies, and she has to kill off parts of herself in order to be reborn.The immediate problem is that neither she nor her fellow inmate realize this. At first, their sole goal is to get through the first day, and then the second, and then the third. They take care of each other, instinctively becoming strong when one is weak, and allowing each other the space and forgiveness to have moments of weakness.Throughout her captivity, Senna slowly comes to realize that her past is the true jailer. She needs to rid herself of the ugliness that holds her captive. That's where the title comes in: a mud vein is the dark vein that runs through the outer edge of a shrimp, otherwise known as its digestive tract. ""Senna,"" in fact, is an herbal supplement that aids in digestion. In other words, this is a book about purging yourself of that which poisons you. In Senna's case, it's a lifetime of hurt, abandonment, grief, and loneliness. Not that she isn't occasionally the architect of her own misery; she certainly is at times. But aren't we all? Who amongst us glides through life without making mistakes? The problem for Senna is that she lacks the ability to react to her mistakes in a healthy way because she internalizes them. She has convinced herself that she deserves all of the ugliness - all of the mud in that vein.This is not a perfect book, despite my gushing. The 'who' and 'why' behind Senna's captivity is a bit of a stretch, especially the 'why.' As big of a head scratcher as this is, it nonetheless feels like a minor quibble in the face of such stunning writing. The good news is that Senna's fellow prisoner is also her path to salvation. She cannot free herself without this person's help, not in any aspect or fashion.Tarryn Fisher wrote a powerful, visceral book, one that will affect you and stay with you long after you read it. Its power lies in Senna. Much like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, Senna has had the keys to release her all along. She just doesn't realize it until it is very nearly too late. But as with Dorothy, Senna can't free herself until she is ready. She has to learn for herself that she is not her mud vein. It is a part of her, yes, but it does not define her.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLVH8JI87U3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497455049#wasThisHelpful","R3LLVH8JI87U3Z","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nothing has come easily in Cassie's life except her friendship and relationship with Graham. Her father died when she was a toddler, and her mother suffers from bipolar disorder, which means Cassie is genetically predisposed to get it herself.At eighteen, Cassie found herself trying to decide between colleges, acting as a caretaker for her mother, and newly engaged to Graham. Its all too much for her, though, especially the fear that she, too, could develop bipolar disorder. So she does the only thing she can think to do: she runs away in the middle of the night.Now, nearly a year later, she receives a phone call from Graham. Her mother nearly burned the house down, and Cassie needs to come home.Whereas Cassie's mother almost burned down the house, Cassie absolutely did burn some bridges. Her friends can't and won't forgive her for hurting Graham, and he has spent their time apart desperately trying to get over her. He has a new girlfriend, and he has plans separate from anything related to Cassie.Their first few interactions are awkward, to say the least. Each has lingering feelings for the other, but whereas Cassie's feelings don't affect another relationship, Graham's do. He has Molly, and he's quite fond of her. Cassie is the girl next door, though, and that proximity, coupled with the way his heart (and body) responds to Cassie, means that Graham faces a world of trouble.Then there is the matter of Cassie's mother. Cassie recalls some fairly harrowing events from her childhood of what it was like to live with her mother's manic and depressive moods. The responsibility she felt for her mother permeated everything in her life, even adding a stronger sense of need for Graham than might have existed otherwise. Through Graham, we hear that Cassie as a child was full of energy and light, but the Cassie in the book is sad, reclusive, and dark. It's hard to see the Cassie that Graham recalls, and I think you need that to have a stronger connection with this book.Fortunately, Cassie and Graham are likable and empathetic. This doesn't mean that you will always like them. Each of them does and says things that make you cringe and cause you to question them. Danielle Ellison very wisely follows these scenes with those in which Cassie and Graham redeem themselves, establishing you firmly on their sides.The crux of the conflict is Cassie's abandonment of Graham and her home. Why did she leave? Graham never asks, largely out of fear. Does he want to hear that he wasn't going to be enough for her? What reason could she give that would justify her leaving him? Is there anything she can say that will make him hurt less? It isn't that she doesn't have her reasons, at least in a way she can justify it to herself. And this is another weakness. Cassie's rationale for leaving Graham just doesn't click. I think it's because life with her mother never seems so awful that she would need to hurt Graham the way she does. I get that she's afraid, but is that enough of a reason for her to leave in the middle of the night?Despite those issues, this is a pretty decent read. I wondered if and how Graham and Cassie would come together, and Ellison makes this happen in a natural way, one that doesn't feel forced. This is labeled as a New Adult book, which I guess it is. There are a couple of sex scenes that have just enough detail to move them out of YA. I doubt many parents want their thirteen-year-old daughters reading the sexy times.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5OOXKKV2M4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGTN85S#wasThisHelpful","R3S5OOXKKV2M4Y","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When last we saw Jax and Lizzie, she had met someone, and, in the interest of seeing what might develop, she ceased her sexual tutelage under Jax. He is, to put it simply, shocked.In Part 2, Jax must come to terms with a couple of truths that leave him unsettled: he wants an actual relationship with Lizzie, and he doesn't know how to go about it.Whereas Part 1 was a breezy, sexy romp, this one has more emotional depth. You still don't know as much about Lizzie as I would have liked, but you do learn more about Jax - his childhood, his family, the origins of his business. He becomes a more fully developed character, not simply because he shows his vulnerability, but because you get to see more of him than just Jax the Architect and Jax the Sex God.Whereas Lizzie is still a bit too two-dimensional, she does become far more sympathetic than she did in Part 1. JD Hawkins gets us into her head and lets you understand why she's drawn to this new guy. You know why she's drawn to Jax, but this new man. What is it he offers that Jax does not?If you learned anything about Jax from Part 1, it's that he usually gets what he wants. Lizzie, though, defies all of his assumptions.Of course you want to know about the sex. If Jax and Lizzie are apart, how can there be any hot headboard rocking? Oh, faithful readers. Rest assured. JD Hawkins knows how to get these two in the sack, and he most certainly puts them there. Strap those vibrators back on, because you'll need them for Part 2.Again, I find myself wishing this were one book instead of two. But, again, I am alone in that sentiment.JD Hawkins shows that men can write hot romance novels. He knows how to create heroes women swoon over and heroines women want to be.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GOETFV9C7XKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XW9ZQEG#wasThisHelpful","R2GOETFV9C7XKW","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want a fast, hot book, this is the one for you.The first in a two-part novella series, Insatiable introduces you to Jax, a man for whom the word ""cocky"" is a wild, vast understatement. And I mean that in every sense of the word. (wink wink)Jax's idea of a relationship is two hours spent rocking the headboard, after which he will (a) not remember her name and (b) not call. For one thing, he's got a successful business to run. Jax is a self-made man whose architecture skills beckon the rich and famous in Los Angeles. He will not permit a relationship to interfere with his professional successes.And for another, he's Jax! When he walks into a room, women converge on him like kittens to catnip. He chooses which lucky girl will benefit from his carnal craft.Then Lizzie shows up, and Jax's world as he has constructed it begins to crack.She's gorgeous, feisty, and ... resistent.This book is so much fun to read because JD Hawkins writes not just hot headboard rocking (and, oh, does he ever do that ...) but romance too. In Jax, Hawkins has more than a sex god hero, he has a romantic leading man, and he instinctively knows what women want and how to write it.Strap on your vibrators, girls. JD Hawkins is going to leave you a quivering, needy wreck who very likely will wear out the motor in your favorite toy. Or, better yet, wear out your lover. You will feel inspired after reading Jax and Lizzie's adventures.There are a few weaknesses, largely in terms of character development, but those are addressed in the second book. Readers of this blog know how I feel about one good book getting split up into smaller installments; I am not a fan. I wish this was one substantial read instead of two novellas, but it isn't always about me. (Even thought it should be, really.)At under 150 pages, this won't take you long to read. It ends on a cliffhanger, so make sure you have Insatiable #2 locked and loaded. You will want to know what happens between Jax and Lizzie.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WG615HUX961R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X2J688Y#wasThisHelpful","R2WG615HUX961R","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pull up a chair and make yourselves comfortable, faithful readers, for I am about to gush, and gush unabashedly.I loved this book.You know how you're coming up on the last few chapters and you don't want the book to end? That was me! Reading Miss Match! I did not want to say goodbye to Andy and Blake because I liked them so much!Andy isn't so much at a crossroads in her life as she has taken out residence on one and does not seem inclined to move any time soon. She lost her job under cloudy circumstances, she has no man friend, she is sponging off her struggling musician sister, and her idea of a good time is eating name brand cereal.What is she doing to change things? Nothing.It isn't until her sister insists that she apply for a rather unusual job that she sluggishly proceeds to do so.Wealthy (and oh-so-gorgeous) businessman Blake Donovan is successful in every aspect of his life, except finding a wife. He places an want-ad for a matchmaker, promising a substantial financial payoff when he gets married. Andy is perfect for this job because she has the ability to read people quite intuitively. She can divine, based on how you line up the ink pens on your desk, all sorts of clues about your personality.Blake offends Andy on so many levels. He can't be bothered to use her name - he shortens Andrea to Drea, rather than Andy - and his requirements for a wife lean heavily toward the superficial. Yet she agrees to work for him. She needs the money, yes, but she also finds herself uncomfortably interested in him.In order to buy into this premise, you have to like Blake and Andy, and YOU WILL LOVE THEM. Andy is a real woman. She's flawed, she's got a heart, she is sexual, she is leery, she is confident, she is self-conscious, she is bold, she is reluctant. She is someone I wish existed in real life because I want to be her best friend. Blake could have been a one-note character, yet another billionaire with a heart the size of a pomegranate seed who learns to love under the tutelage of his soul mate. But in the hands of Laurelin McGee, Blake is interesting and empathetic. He's as well-developed as Andy is, and nothing he does seems out of his character or manufactured for plot.Told from Blake and Andy's alternating points-of-view, this book has far more depth than your typical romance novel. Blake is more fragile than he wants you to think. He endeavors to protect himself by choosing a bland, attractive wife who will pose no challenge or, really, interest to him, beyond her service as a homemaker and hostess. He believes his life will be easier if it's free from emotional obligations. While Andy welcomes emotional involvement, she nonetheless leads a life that requires very little from her. It isn't until she meets Blake that she begins giving more of herself, both professionally and personally.You know I love some hot headboard rocking, and this book succeeds spectacularly in providing some deliciously arousing sexy times. Strap on your vibrators, girls, as Laurelin McGee delivers searing sex scenes that will melt the panties right off you. But - and this is an important distinction - for all of the hotness of the headboard (or desk or wall or whatever) rocking, it's made even more satisfying because the emotional hook is every bit as powerful as the sexual.This is the debut novel from Laurelin McGee, who is actually two writers, Laurelin Paige and Kayti McGee, and I can't wait for their next endeavor. Like, seriously can't wait.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11YQYUU9YKI32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R18GCP6#wasThisHelpful","R11YQYUU9YKI32","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The synopsis for this book is almost as long as the novella itself.So Sophie has been with Scott since, like, five-ever (as the kids today like to say), and their relationship is as stale as your grandma's saltine crackers. The couple are headed in different directions, have diverging goals, and it's time for a break-up.Fortunately, Sophie's transition from girl-living-with-boyfriend to girl-dating-hot-dude comes simply and easily when she is enlisted by her boss to accompany Nick, a big Hollywood star, to an awards show. Before you can say, ""Cinderella,"" Sophie is gussied up in a designer dress and hanging on Nick's arm.She isn't convinced that there is anything more than the fulfillment of a work obligation between them, but Nick has other ideas. He wants a relationship. But can he give Sophie what she wants and needs? He's constantly working, which means he travels a LOT. And then there is the matter of tabloid photos of him playing tonsil hockey with costars and starlets.Tasha Cotter moves her romance along at a brisk pace. While she doesn't give much depth to Nick or Sophie, she does know how to tell a fairytale. There is a fairy godmother (of sorts), an evil stepsister, a prince, and the sweet, kind-hearted heroine. There is not one bit of realism here, but you won't care. The romance is sweet and adorable, and that suffices.My biggest quibble is with the New Adult labeling. NA lit typically means that there is some (super) hot headboard rocking, and that, I am sad to report, is absent entirely from here. Most of the sexy times have a ""fade to black"" sense about them, in which Coleman ends the scene right when it starts to get hot. I felt a distinct case of blue boobs while reading this. There is one scene that has a little more detail, but even that needs more in order to justify the NA label.This is a cute, breezy romance, one you can read in its entirety during a trip to the pool.Review copy received from publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBWB8JKF8V2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWQANVS#wasThisHelpful","R3PBWB8JKF8V2A","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you could find out whether you are going to battle a terminal illness (or even a potentially terminal illness), would you? This question holds particular resonance for those susceptible to genetic illnesses. My grandfather had Alzheimer's, and I know that every time my father forgets something he knows that he knows, there is an attendant fear. Do I have it?Claire's father had Alzheimer's and died of complications related to it, so she knew there was a chance she would suffer from it, too. She also knows that hers will be the lesser suffering; her husband Greg, her two daughters, and mother will all bear far more trials and agonies than she will. Now in her early forties, she receives the crushing diagnosis: she has early-onset Alzheimer's, and it is progressing with great aggression.Told from Claire's perspective, as well as that of Greg and her oldest daughter Caitlin, The Day We Met gives you the frightening and devastating effects of a degenerative brain disease wreaks on a family.Claire remembers some things with clarify, such as her relationship with Claire's father, a man she hasn't seen since she was newly pregnant with their daughter. She knows who Esther is, her three-year-old daughter with Greg. She knows her mother, and she has some memories of her father.She is slowly forgetting Greg, though. The two met when he did some construction work on her house, and, undeterred by a ten-year age gap, they fell in love. Theirs has been a happy, contented, passionate relationship, and Claire is becoming further and further removed from it. Greg will lose his wife twice: emotionally first, physically last.At twenty, Caitlin faces particular fears that no child wants to consider. She knows that her mother and grandfather had Alzheimer's. She could get it, or pass it on to a child she may have. She also feels the immediate push and pull of her mother's illness. Should she leave school and help care for Claire, or should she live her life, knowing that she could be struck with this disease in a couple of decades?At times the story is intimate and deeply emotional. Claire begins a friendship with a man she meets in a coffee shop, and her behavior shocks and saddens. Can she be blamed, though, for something that is out of her control? She is held hostage to Alzheimer's. The disease dictates her behavior, but what of her family?So much of this book is emotionally gripping and demanding. Claire's relationships with her mother and Caitlin are moving and affecting. But the relationship intended to be the emotional center of the book - Claire and Greg's marriage - feels oddly distant and removed. Part of this is due to the disease, but part is also due to storytelling. I needed more Greg. Rowan Coleman tells us how he met Claire and how their courtship began, but she skims the surface when we need more depth. Clearly Greg is intended to be the magnetic pole. His mother-in-law and stepdaughter direct you to be concerned about him, and Claire frets over the burden she knows she will become. Perhaps if Caitlin's story had been less significant or detailed, more attention would be paid to Greg's, giving his greater emphasis and emotional significance.This is a difficult book to read because the ending you want - for Claire to be cured - is not going to happen. How can Rowan Coleman end this book in a way that you don't lose hope for her characters? As she takes you closer to the ending, that need to know Greg better intensifies. If he had been a stronger, more dynamic character, this would have been a better book.As it is, it's a good book, one that you will enjoy. You just may not be as emotionally invested as you should.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21NGYIJAW3NG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD2GK#wasThisHelpful","R21NGYIJAW3NG7","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes life offers you a do-over. But rarely does that do-over come without cost.Amber realizes this when she returns home to Australia to help care for her father after he suffers a stroke. She leaves behind her husband Ned, with whom she is struggling to find the passion and affection that connected them when they first met. Part of her has always thought that she settled in marrying Ned, believing that her heart lay somewhere else.That 'somewhere' is right where she lands, shortly after arriving back home: Ethan. He and Amber were friends from childhood, best friends even. Although she wanted more, she made peace with the fact that Ethan did not. He was a bit of a cad, always dating and discarding gorgeous women. Like Amber, he is married. Unlike Amber, he has two children.As Amber finds herself drawing closer to Ethan - and to the possibility of discovering what might have happened - she also recalls her mother, who died in a car accident when Amber was a toddler. Amber was in the car, too, and survived, and she has fractured memories of what happened. What role, she wonders, did she play in her mother's death?She receives a letter from a woman who was on the scene of the accident, asking if Amber would come see her. The woman wants Amber to know what her mother's final words were.The title is a play on several factors. First, there is the car accident. Was Amber's mother distracted by something? Or someone? Then there is Ethan. Is he distracting Amber from what truly does make her happy?The thing with distractions is that sometimes you need them. When you're struggling with serious emotional challenges, a distraction can help clear your head, in a way. It can help you refocus, recommit. Distractions can be more sinister, of course. They can sidetrack you from what you need to such a degree that you allow yourself to believe in the distraction rather than the truth.Amber has to realize these things. She has to accept her father's illness and his long-term relationship with the woman he became involved with several years after the death of his wife. Amber also must determine which man is her truth and which her distraction, Ethan or Ned. And of course she needs to understand and process her mother's death.My favorite part of this book was Amber's relationship with Ethan. Maybe you have an Ethan in your life; I sure do. That one person about whom you find yourself occasionally wondering 'what could have been.' Of course, in doing so, a certain romanticization occurs as you forget the hurts and pains, preferring to recall the joys and blisses. Amber does this, to a degree, but she does acknowledge and reflect on the many times Ethan hurt her, however inadvertently. For her it isn't so much a wistful wondering of what might have been, but more of a question of how Ethan would respond if he knew she loved him for so many years. Even though she is a married woman, she finds it easy to forget about Ned. He's in England; she's in Australia. He hasn't been making her happy lately, and she uses this as an excuse to let her thoughts wander to Ethan. The little things in her marriage that bother her become amplified in her mind, justifying her renewed interest in another man.I really enjoyed how Paige Toon wrote about Amber's marriage and relationship with Ethan. There was no attempt to glorify either one, and both men are presented roundly and fully. We see their strengths and weaknesses, and Toon makes you change your mind several times over which man is the right man for Amber. Amber, too, is drawn with flaws. She does some things that could alienate a reader, but Toon crafts her in a way that you don't want to abandon her.The part of the book I found a tad overwrought was that relating to the death of Amber's mother. Too often those scenes felt intrusive, throwing off the pacing. I wonder if the book needs that subplot.More than anything, this is a romance, and it is not limited to just one. Those were the book's strengths, and those are why you should read it.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QT6TNPRJVRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MK38Z7K#wasThisHelpful","R32QT6TNPRJVRO","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fabulous job? Check.Designer wardrobe? Check.Scion of a Cape Cod dynasty? Check.Complete fraud? Checkmate.TifAni FaNelli (that's how it's spelled) lives a lie from top to bottom. So immersed is she in manufacturing the perfect faade that she almost forgets who she really is.Almost.It's hard to put your unappealing past behind you when a documentary filmmaker wants to interview you for a film he's putting together focused on a tragic, horrific event from your past. But as desperate as TifAni, who has rechristened herself Ani (pronounced like the last two syllables of ""Tiffany""), is to refashion herself as a beacon of flawlessness, she nonetheless agrees to participate in the documentary.No one in her life wants her to do this film. Not her social climbing mother, not the fiancé she marked and claimed, and not her closest friend. They all think that dredging up this event is unsavory, but the greater the resistance she faces, the more determined Ani becomes to be interviewed.Ani takes us through her present time - preparing for her wedding and that interview - while also taking us back into her Bradley School years, the time in which the event in question occurred. TifAni FaNelli was desperate to fit in with her new, wealthy, entitled classmates, and she was willing to promote whatever alliances necessary to achieving that goal.As Jessica Knoll makes clear, TifAni (and Ani) is always focused on achieving her goals.When you're in high school, though, especially when you feel unworthy, awkward, lonely, and self-conscious, you might find your perception compromised. What appears to be a friend may be an enemy; what appears to be a kind gesture may be something far more nefarious. Like most teenagers, TifAni will do some things that clearly will not end the way she anticipates. The difference is that her actions lead to terrible, awful actions on the parts of others.Recalling her childhood steels Ani as she prepares to revisit those days with the filmmaker. She redoubles her efforts to be a size 0, both for the interview and for her wedding. Her relationship with food, in fact, serves as a metaphor for how she sees herself. She desperately wants to be thin, believing that dropping pounds will make her look good on camera and as she walks down the aisle. Yet she regularly binges, voraciously stuffing herself and sabotaging her diet goals. She does not recognize this behavior for what it is: an attempt to fill a gawping void within her.From the opening pages, Jessica Knoll displays that void with unflinching rawness. As Ani considers her job, clothes, and fiancé Luke, she also imagines plunging a knife into the Luke's neck. She loves him, or at least the idea of him, yet she hates the part of herself that needs Luke to feel better about herself. Luke represents what she strived for in high school. He embodies her social compulsion to be an object of envy, to have (and be) the best there is.This drive for perfection is a rebuke against how society defines 'perfect.' Ani's life is every bit as airbrushed as models in magazines, and every bit as fake. But people want to be like her. They envy her - they use her as the standard for them to reach - and she loves that. It validates her. And it makes her a wickedly unlikable character. (Not many characters in this book are people you want to know in real life, by the way, and you can tell that Jessica Knoll had a lot of fun creating them.)What makes Ani the luckiest girl alive? Is it Luke? The fancy duds? The job that causes young women to regularly ask her for advice so that they, too, can have a job like hers? Ani might be the first person to tell you that none of that involves luck. She worked - she works - resolutely and tenaciously to achieve those things. Yet she is the luckiest girl alive, and as you read her story, you will see how and why.TifAni FaNelli has worked assiduously to create Ani FaNelli, the future Mrs. Luke Harrison IV. When she introduces herself on the documentary, she uses her future husband's last name, further removing herself from her past. Confronting and revealing the truth about what happened at Bradley, though, requires confronting and revealing the truth about herself.It requires understanding what being the luckiest girl alive means.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SISLRH5JTQC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789630#wasThisHelpful","R1SISLRH5JTQC3","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the damnedest book.The beginning feels as if it were shot out of a cannon. A nameless woman writes a letter to Deb, the wife of the man with whom she has been having an affair. The letter taunts and shames, its intention clearly to devastate Deb and wreck her marriage to Jack because included with the letter are print-outs of text messages and emails that Jack and the woman exchanged.The couple's eleven-year-old daughter Kay opens it, however, and reads its contents, page after page of sexual exchanges between her father and another woman. Kay's instinct is to protect both of her parents, but she's only eleven. She acknowledges that she doesn't understand what all of this means, so she shares the box with her brother Simon.Julia Pierpont's story details the destruction of a marriage. She introduces you to Deb and Jack at a critical juncture of their relationship and then retraces their beginnings, letting you see how they started and how they built a life together. Jack is an artist; a man who views his life as a constant series of urges, some artistic, some emotional, some paternal, and some sexual. He compartmentalizes these urges, not believing that his infidelity is a threat to his marriage. It's part of his work, and whereas Deb may see his cheating as something that distances him from her, he sees it as something that spurs his art.Ever present are Kay and Simon, who are as much a part of this marriage as Deb and Jack. It is impossible for a couple's marital trials and tribulations not to affect their children. Simon is fifteen, not a kid any more, but not an adult, either. His emotional immaturity dictates how he responds to challenges that come his way. He lashes out, he retreats, and he tries to process what Jack's infidelity means to his mother, his sister, and himself.At eleven, Kay is more precocious, although she disguises it well. She comes across as fragile and easily wounded, but she processes her anger and fears more productively, for lack of a better word, than her brother does. Part of her wonders what would have happened if she hadn't been the one to open the box, and another part certainly resents her brother for what he did with it when she showed the box to him. Kay still views her father as a bit of a hero, even as she is disappointed in him.The first part of this book is fantastic. And then, about halfway through, Pierpont tells you how it will end. I was gobsmacked by that maneuver. Why would she do that? What function does this serve in the novel? I can't say that I ever was able to answer either question. It still makes no sense to me, and it made the backtracking that came after it somewhat nonsensical. We know what will happen, and it doesn't take a huge leap of imagination to figure out how and why it does. I kept wondering what the book would have been like if Pierpont had followed a more traditional timeline. I'm all for mixing things up in terms of plotting, so long as there is a purpose for it. That's what is missing here.For all of the frustration this causes, the wonky timeline cannot detract from Pierpont's ability to create interesting, sympathetic characters. It should be easy to dislike Jack, yet I found myself unable and unwilling to choose him over Deb. Not that I forgive him - he disrespects and disregards his wife in an awful, hurtful way - but his rationale for his behavior strikes a chord. Pierpont takes care to show that Deb is not merely the scorned wife; there is far more to her than that. She makes mistakes as a wife and as a mother, and she is fully aware that she does.I think this book would be a good choice for a book club. There is a lot to discuss, whether regarding Deb and Jack's marriage or what happens with Simon and Kay. Also worth discussing is Pierpont's plot choice. How would the book have been different if she waited to tell you what happens to her characters?Review copy provided by publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAUUIIPVUPBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWWOLM0#wasThisHelpful","R1LAUUIIPVUPBV","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only thing worse than being a teen, I should think, is being a teen who thinks she's invisible.In every part of her life, Sarah is eclipsed by someone, whether her glamorous older sister Scarlett or the popular and gorgeous cheerleader whom Sarah's boyfriend is tutoring. (And, yes, if your Spidey Sense is tingling over that one, you have a far better understanding of Sarah's relationship than she does.) Even her nickname - Bean - seems inferior. Beans are commonplace and utilitarian, not sparkly and shiny.Every summer, Bean and her family head to Cape Cod to spend their vacation with crotchety great aunt who - shocker - favors Scarlett over Bean. This summer, though, Bean is determined to study Scarlett, much as she studies the stars every night. If Bean can plot and predict the arrival of a comet, surely she can crack Scarlett's code and become the center of someone's universe.Bean quickly determines that she has to appear older. A not-quite-sixteen-year-old is not going to cut it in Scarlett's social world, so Sarah ages up. She is now a high school graduate, headed to MIT. Her ruse works well: she attracts the attention of Andrew, a handsome college student and buddy of a guy Scarlett is seeing. As Bean applies her findings from what she observes of Scarlett, she and Andrew become closer and closer.The question for Bean is whether Andrew loves her or if he loves the person she pretends to be. She has to ask herself if, aside from using Scarlett's clothes and mimicking her confidence, she is different with Andrew than with her other friends.As she struggles with this, she realizes that she isn't so sure that she likes attention. She is the scientist; she is the one who places others under the microscope and studies them. Sure, there are benefits to being noticed - Andrew's attraction to her, for one thing - but she doesn't like the fear that comes with the pretense.Then there is her family. There is a heartbreaking scene in which Bean has to confront her place in her family. Scarlett is a sort of black hole of attention. Her parents and great aunt aim their telescopes straight at her, viewing Bean as more of an orbiting satellite than a star herself. The only person in her family who seems to value her is her grandmother, and she feels as far away as the comet Bean waits for.This is a coming-of-age book, and what sets it apart from its brethren is that it feels so real. Beans anxiety about her place in her family and amongst her friends is utterly relatable, as is the first love she experiences with Andrew. She desperately wants to matter to someone, yet the only way she can figure out how to make that happen is by pretending to be someone else. What she doesn't fake are her feelings. She loves Andrew, and she wants to experience everything that comes with being with a college boy.Rebecca Maizel's storytelling is lovely, and it is as bittersweet as adolescence can be. There were parts of this book that I read with only one eye on the page, uncomfortable with how much I could relate to what was happening to Bean. She's such a likable, adorable character that I dearly wanted her to somehow get out of the mess of her own making. As much as I wanted her and Andrew to have their happy ending, I knew that Bean was only just sixteen. She has too much in front of her to have found her Mr. Forever right now. Right? Maybe?The Universe, though, is expansive, and within it are constellations we will never discover. Bean's fascination with stars and space marks her as an observer, but what people don't understand is that she also actively, passionately participates with those stars. She learns about them and knows them, and she feels a kinship with them. Bean does not keep herself at a distance, not with the stars and not with Andrew.I loved this book. I liked Bean, I liked Andrew, I liked the story, and I liked the way Rebecca Maizel wrote it. I even liked Scarlett, who could be one-note in another writer's hands. In Maizel's, she's a girl who takes advantages of the opportunities that come her way. Even when you're hating her, you kind of like her. The only weakness is the pacing. There were parts that dragged a little.I especially liked the ending. This book ends the way it should for Bean.Review copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review.Published on VoxLibris.net@VoxLibris","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9ABL0F1Q4H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7XELJW#wasThisHelpful","R2P9ABL0F1Q4H5","A2DER7R7N0DL3C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DER7R7N0DL3C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When this tripod arrived, it came packaged with some other products I had ordered.  The tripod is so small that I didn't even notice it among the other items.  The tripod is so small, I doubted it could hold a large, heavy camera.I was wrong.  Though it's only about six inches long when folded up, it is sturdy enough and the legs are spread far enough to provide stable support even for heavier cameras.  The locking ball head allows me to position my camera at about any angle I want, without my needing to worry about the tripod tipping over.So, if you are looking for a way to stabilize your camera, and if you would like a tripod that you can just toss into a backpack, this is an excellent choice.  It is priced a bit higher than other tripods its size, but for good reasons: solidy, sturdy, metal construction make it worth a few extra bucks.Reviewer's note: I received this tripod free for the purpose of testing and reviwing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29NFTWI3JNVYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163MY3LA#wasThisHelpful","R29NFTWI3JNVYE","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had incorrectly assumed that since these were ""hearing protection"", the music quality would be sub-par.I was pleasantly surprised to find that music actually sounds very good on these headphones.  Besides using these while mowing the lawn, they are equally good for casual listening in the living room...the sound is that good.  Surely, they are no match for some of the high-end headphones out there.  But they are a perfect balance between protection and sound quality.I also found the controls very easy to use.  Without even referring to the instructions, I was able to figure out how to connect to my phone (Galaxy S6) using Bluetooth.  Switching from line-in to radio to Bluetooth listening was all quite simple.One other thing that I like: some Bluetooth headsets control the ""master volume"" of your phone.  These, on the other hand, operate independently of the master volume.  That's a good thing.  It means you can set a maximum acceptable volume on your phone, and then use the headphone volume control to stay within that maximum range.One minor complaint: I'm not a fan of needing AA batteries to operate this.  I would much prefer the ability to have a built-in rechargeable battery.  Of course, that would increase the cost of the headphones.  I guess a reasonable compromise is for me to purchase rechargeable AA batteries.All in all, these are quite impressive...good functionality paired with good music quality!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTWKXO0OYNQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146A4SWA#wasThisHelpful","R2KTWKXO0OYNQ7","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for shredding hard cheeses such as Parmesan.  It is perfect for that purpose.Previously, I had been using a Cuisipro grater.  I liked it, but found that the Cuisipro's shred was sometimes too fine for my needs.This grater from Erayco is slightly longer, and produces a slightly coarser shred.  With the Erayco, shredded Parmesan roughly resembles the texture of coconut flakes.  I would still call it a ""fine"" grind, but it's not so fine that the shreds lose their definition.I still like my old grater, but find myself turning to the Erayco when I need a fine grind rather than an ""extra fine"" grind.Reviewer's note: I received this grater free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPPDRYM6HE8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016ORD5EA#wasThisHelpful","RLPPDRYM6HE8D","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether or not you plan to purchase any of the colorful ""Symmetry"" inserts, this is a decent case that offers good protection.  Its main drawback is that after a short time, you will begin to notice light scratches on the clear plastic.I got this case with the intention of not adding any of the Symmetry inserts.  I liked the idea of the clear back that showed off the phone itself.  Overall, I'm happy with the result. But after a couple weeks, I have begun to see light scratches all over that clear plastic back.  That kind of cheapens its appearance.  Perhaps I would not notice the scratches as much if I had one of the colorful inserts.  Note that I am not particularly rough and abusive with my phone.  It spends most of its time in my pocket, which is probably where it picked up those scratches.  Note too that I may just be a bit too fussy about those scratches...maybe you won't care.  But I just figured that a couple weeks of light use should not reveal such scratches.As far as functionality is concerned, I have no complaints.  I like the plastic/rubber edge around the phone.  It feels solid (I expect it will offer sufficient protection against minor drops).  I also like that the rubber on the edge means that I can lay the phone face down on a smooth surface and it won't slide around...even if that surface has a slight incline.The case feels nice in my hand...quite comfortable, again thanks to the rubberized edge.All in all, a decent case.  If you can put up with the scratches, you are likely to be happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13HABEC3B7CK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53T4A6#wasThisHelpful","R13HABEC3B7CK9","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately, I've become a big fan of Epson's line of multifunction printers.  In the past month, I've had the opportunity to test both the XP-830 and now this XP-960.  Both are solid performers...which should you choose?  It depends on your needs.The main strength of the XP-960 is its photo quality.  The 960 uses six ink cartridges, as opposed to five in the 830.  Both printers have black, cyan, yellow, and magenta cartridges.  The 960 has two extra: light cyan and light magenta.  By contrast, the 830 has one extra: ""photo black"".  What does all this mean?  Better rendering of colors in my printed photos.  I particularly notice the 960's more realistic skin tones in portraits.  On the 830, skin tones seem a bit more ""splotchy"".  On the 960, they are more smooth and realistic.  To be fair, though, ""splotchy"" overstates the problem.  I'm actually quite happy with the photos from the 830.  But when held side-by-side with those from the 960, I notice a difference (my wife did not notice the difference though, so your results and satisfaction may vary).The weakness of the XP-960 is simply this: unlike the XP-830, the 960 does not have an auto document feed.  This means that you cannot scan in a stack of papers.  The XP-830 is better for high volume scanning and copying.  The 960 also lacks fax functionality...not a problem for me, but could be for you.So, the XP-960 is a perfect choice if your primary need is photo printing.  If you are looking for a good all-around small office workhorse, this is not it (the XP-830 would be a better, less expensive choice).As for me, the XP-960 is now my go-to photo printer.  I'm really happy with the quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5S3YA5JFDSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","RR5S3YA5JFDSW","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite its light weight, this is a solid kitchen performer.I had an old colander that drained slowly because it did not have sufficient holes in it.  The Codream has holes everywhere, making it much better when I'm straining pasta.I also really appreciate the light weight of this.  I was concerned that the stainless steel might make it bulky, but it's not.  The stainless steel construction also does a nice job of keeping the heat from the handles, so the colander is immediately safe to handle even if I've just poured boiling water through it.All in all, a great colander!Reviewer's note: I received this colander free for the purpose of providing an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R184Q10USXAB8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OG5EXG#wasThisHelpful","R184Q10USXAB8H","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been using another iPad Mini case for a while, and had been happy with it.  When given the opportunity to test and review a different case, I hesitated.  Why switch?  Given my trust in Urban Armor Gear, having used their iPhone cases, I took a chance.I'm glad I did.After a week of use, I have a new favorite case.  A few noteworthy points:* The texture is amazing.  Really.  I love the feel of this case.  The rubberized grippy material makes it easy to hold on to.  The grooves on the front cover feel good, too.  And, the case has a black accents throughout that give the case an overall solid feel.* The UAG case offers great protection.  I liked my old case, but it didn't do much to protect it from drops and bumps.  The UAG case has solid protection on all sides, including thicker reinforced corners.* The case is highly functional.  The little magnetic latch has kept the case from popping open at incovnient times.  The auto-on/off works flawlessly, and the multiposition stand works fine (though it is not a feature I use much).  If I could voice one small complaint: the little magnetic latch sometimes gets in the way when I flip the case open and hold it with one hand, portrait-style.  I've learned to tuck it out of the way, but it is a bit of an annoyance at times.The Urban Armor Gear case seems perfectly matched to my iPad Mini 4 (note: it is specifically for the latest version 4, and is unlikely to fit previous versions).  I highly recommend it if you are looking for solid protection with a good look and feel.Note: I received this case free from UAG for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMOLLHUVQS6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143Q680C#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMOLLHUVQS6H","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you realize that set-top boxes such as Roku, AppleTV, and Amazon Fire TV, are all just small computers with interfaces that make it easy to browse for media?  For example, Roku is a computer that runs a version of the Linux operating system.  Those set-top boxes do their best to hide away the complexities of a typical desktop or laptop computer so that they are simple to use.What I like about this MXQ Smart TV is that it has the ""expected"" simple interface (browse Netflix and other apps with a remote control), but also exposes the operating system enough (in this case, Android) that I can do some normal computer things with it that I can't so easily do with Fire TV and Roku.  If you are a tinkerer, and like to play around a bit ""under the hood"" of your electronic devices, then try this: plug in a mouse and keyboard to the MXQ Smart TV, and see what you can get away with.  I find that menu and app navigation is far simpler with the mouse than with the remote control, and the keyboard greatly speeds up searching for titles.But that's not all...Since this is just another Android OS device, I can go to its app store and download apps that I want to use.  I can also surf the web, send and receive GMail, and more.When you start to ponder all that you can actually do with this ""media box"", you begin to realize that the price tag is amazingly low.  You get an Android computer with HDMI output, along with all the features you expect from a set-top box, all with a sub-fifties price tag.If you prefer the ease and polished interface of one of those ""polished"" set-top boxes, then this MXQ offering might not be for you.  But if you like tinkering under the hood to see what can be accomplished, then this is exactly the way to go.Reviewer's note: I received this device for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T74W24Z3O5UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PYQRNY#wasThisHelpful","R1T74W24Z3O5UF","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a winner for two good reasons:1) It is so very simple to use.  I managed to get it up and running without the instruction manual.  Just plug it in, mount it on your windshield, and start your car.  The camera begins recording automatically, saving a file to the included memory card every few minutes.  Shut off the car, and the camera saves the last bit of data before shutting down.  In other words, no need to push any of the buttons or fumble through menus to get up and running.  If you do want to make changes, the configuration menu is there for modifying exposure, video quality, frequency of file saving, and more.  One minor complaint, there is an ""OK"" button on the camera, but you can't tell which button it is since none of them actually say ""OK"".2) The video quality is really good.  I kept it on the default video setting (one step down from the highest 1080pHD setting), and found that the video quality was great.  Cars, people, street signs...everything was quite clear during playback.  Note that the files produced by this are easily viewed either on the device itself, or on a computer.Overall, I am very pleased with this, and recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive way to record your driving.Reviewer's note: I received this camera free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.Those two reasons...ease and video quality...are reason enough to recommend this.  But add to that a good suction cup windshield mount, lots of configuration options for fine tuning my recordings, and an overall nice look and feel, and you've got a great little camera here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3482HH4NCLHAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KPQBJO#wasThisHelpful","R3482HH4NCLHAY","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When season 1 of Fargo came out, I was hesitant: how could they make a series from that movie?  And yet...success!  Season 1's story was not the same story as that of the movie, but it had enough similarities that it was fairly easy to map certain key movie characters to their TV counterparts.So, what about season 2?  Success!  Now that I am 4 episodes deep, I must say that I love season 2 even more than season 1.  I literally am counting days until I can watch the next episode.  This is the only show I care about right now.  And, I have become a huge fan of Bokeem Woodbine who plays the smooth talking Mike Milligan.  Oh, and Jesse Plemons (whom you may recognize from Breaking Bad).What not to expect...Do not expect the same characters.  Look, however, for the name ""Solverson"".  That was a clever touch.Do not expect the same plot.  Unlike the movie and season 1, this is not about a man killing or kidnapping his wife.Do not expect the same time period.  Here, we find the characters in 1979, where the calm town of Fargo is even calmer without the distraction of internet and cell phones.What you should expect...The same great atmosphere, where the light cheerful manner of speaking will stand in contrast to the dark subject matter.Amazing music...both the score, and song selections.Clever nods to other Coen Brothers creations.  Look for the names ""Mundt"" (as in the movie Barton Fink) and ""Solverson"" (as in season 1).  Look for a UFO (as in The Man Who Wasn't There).  And, is it just me, or is there a pair of characters who are very much like John Goodman and Steve Buscemi in The Big Lebowski?Good people in desperate situations.Great storytelling.Sorry I'm gushing over a TV series, but Fargo has won me over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHF83GS36UMXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016624Z7Y#wasThisHelpful","RHF83GS36UMXJ","A19NP8YYADOOSF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NP8YYADOOSF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
