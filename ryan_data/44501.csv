"This is exactly what I was looking for. It's nice and thick, water-based, and sticks like super glue. Better get placement right the first time, though, because it's pretty difficult to peel off the pad to move it (initially)--and forget about just sliding it over real quick-like. Your best bet is to wait for your skin to warm it up a little to loosen the gel, and then try to move the pad by sliding it a bit or peeling it off completely. I like to add more gel if I'm going through the bother of peeling it off.Clean up on the skin is easy--plain water or soap and water. My other (runnier) TENS adhesive cleans up with soap and water and then alcohol to pick up any residue. Tensive doesn't respond to alcohol clean up (I ended up with sticky, gross balls of the stuff all over my neck and hair), so I don't recommend using isopropyl alcohol with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPOXU8SUFFYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011YY9YM#wasThisHelpful","R3UPOXU8SUFFYB","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"but they don't LOVE them because they aren't shiny. I wanted Kamik boots because they are supposed to be super durable, and my girly-girl daughters require bows or belts or some kind of blingy-flare type of embellishment on all of their clothes/shoes. The Raindrops Rain Boots have buckles, but the matte finish on them didn't impress my princesses. My older daughter, 1st grader going into 2nd grade this fall, thinks they are fine but my younger daughter prefers the shiny polka dot boots with hot pink bows on them that do not match her red raincoat.I actually love the boots and would wear them myself if I could stuff my old-lady, size 9 foot into them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SFC423PICQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CUETYQ#wasThisHelpful","R22SFC423PICQC","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He is totally into all things Pokemon, and I had no idea what was already on his bookshelf. I bought the set, wrapped it, and dropped it off at the party after telling his mom that I could return the set if he didn't like it or already had the books. HE LOVED THE SET.

"I purchased this product with the sole intent of lightening melasma patches on my cheeks. After 2 uses, I noticed that the spots have lightened a little. Other reviewers have mentioned that this product burned their skin: everyone's skin is different, and that is why it is important to do a small test patch before applying to your whole face!The Lactic Acid peel has a VERY tingly, minty feel to it--so much so that my eyes started to water shortly after applying the peel. The product is viscous enough (about as thick as Elmer's school glue) that I didn't have to worry about the stuff running into my eyes or nose, so I knew the watery eye-thing had to do with the herbal additions. After a few minutes I rinsed thoroughly and applied moisturizer: no burning or excessive tightness (in contrast to the Glycolic Peel, which continues to sting for about an hour after rinsing). I didn't notice lightening of the age spots until I performed another Lactic Acid Peel at the end of the week. PLEASE BE REALISTIC IN YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF ANY PEEL--this isn't laser treatment! No miracles, just slow and steady improvement over time.I have used the Salicylic Peels (in two different concentrations) and Glycolic Peels in this product line for over a year and have noticed that my skin responds very differently to each of the peels. I wait at least 10 days between using different types of acid. All of their acids improve my skin texture--tighter pores, firmer appearance, and fewer lines--but I noticed that the salicylic helps with breakouts the most, while the glycolic peel seems to help with the age spots and deep lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows. I have the least experience with the lactic acid peel, but I did notice that it seemed to lighten my age spots even more than the glycolic acid mix. The spots are still there, but they are more easily covered by foundation/powder, and the color has shifted from dark brown-charcoal to a light brown freckle-ish tone in just a couple of treatments.I highly recommend all of the peels in the Perfect Image line. I have tried a few peels from other manufacturers with less success and more than a little trepidation regarding their quality control/safety.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231C4NUE9NPW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZBP8NM#wasThisHelpful","R231C4NUE9NPW5","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***5/19/14 UPDATE***Trays arrived via USPS today--just in time for some pre-vacation whitening!I received all 3 sets of trays (one came with the kit and I bought 2 extra) in one case that is identical to my husband's plastic retainer case. The trays fit my mouth PERFECTLY. I repeat, THEY ARE PERFECT. I love them and believe they are worth every penny.I'll be honest: I had no idea when the trays would show up, so I tried a couple of other reviewers' suggestions for application (sans trays) over the weekend.1. I simply wiped the peroxide solution onto my front teeth (top and bottom) with a Q-tip and left on for about 10 minutes. This resulted in some really messy drooling, sore lips and a sore tongue. Not good. I attempted to buffer these softer tissues with cotton balls, but the cotton balls became soaked with saliva and peroxide and resulted in the same discomfort and mess.2. Applied peroxide solution in the same manner as #1, but held the solution in with Saran Wrap. No offense to the person who suggested this in his review, but it was truly a terrible idea. The stuff ran out of the wrap and onto my gums and tongue--I ended up swallowing some of the solution, and the wrap fell out of my mouth and onto my pajamas. Yuck.Needless to say, I did not get good results using the application methods above. My teeth may have lightened just a bit, but not enough to justify the considerable physical and mental irritation.OK, regarding my new trays--they are WONDERFUL. They are like tooth-gloves. The rubbery material is very thin and just barely touches my gum lines. I squirted a very thin line of product from the syringe into the ""valley"" of each tray and slid the trays onto my upper and lower teeth. What a difference. I was able to bark out instructions to my kids, wash my face, wash the dishes, and change into PJs. I didn't leave trails of drool all over the place, my tongue and lips remain unmarred, I don't have soggy Q-tips lying all over the sink, and my teeth look about a half shade lighter after 10 minutes. It was SO EASY. I feel stupid for jury-rigging the contrivances mentioned above.I did a little online research to see how Whiter Smile Labs prices ranked among other custom tooth whitening systems and found that their pricing is on the low- to middle end. Another company sells essentially the same kit (actually, it seems identical, but I don't know about the efficacy of their whitening solution or fit of the trays, I just read the product description) for $109--$20 more than Whiter Smile Labs. Other places sell similar kits, but you end up with bulky one-size-fits all trays, some of which require some dipping in hot water to ""mold"" the product to your teeth. I have tried these molds with no success.I'll post some pictures of my trays. I am so glad I got 3 of them... I bought some re-mineralization gel from another vendor, so one of my trays is a dedicated post-whitening, re-mineralization tray and the others are whitening trays. I am a very, very pleased customer.***5/12/14 UPDATE***Picked up my order from the post office today. It actually arrived on Saturday, May 10, 2014; however, I was not home to sign confirmation of order receipt, so the post office left a note. Items were well packaged in multiple padded envelopes--no boxes like what is shown in the Amazon.com photos, but there really wasn't a need for them. This is what was included:--Three (3) peroxide syringes--Three (3) putty packets (containing one white roll and one purple putty roll that have to be kneaded together for use)--Two (2) hard plastic mold forms--Paperwork requiring name/address and option to order additional dental trays for $26 per tray (you don't have to order additional trays). I am throwing caution to the wind and ordering 2 additional trays in case my kids take off with the one that comes with the kit.--VERY DETAILED instructions on how to use the molds/mold putty and how to return everything to Whiter Smile Labs.--The additional peroxide syringes I had paid for separatelyEverything was very professionally done, and contact information was included in the paperwork in the event I had questions or problems with the order.I mixed the putties, rolled them, inserted them into the forms, and placed the forms on my teeth. I waited 3-4 minutes until they ""set"" and ran cold water over the putty (per instructions). Putty really did harden pretty well. I didn't need the extra putty, but it was nice that they included it just in case. I placed the trays containing the hardened putty molds into the little padded envelope along with the (completed) portion of the instruction page requiring my name/address/phone and additional tray order.Even though they paid for the return postage, I am in a time crunch and will overnight express ship the molds tomorrow... even USPS priority shipping to Wisconsin will take 3-4 days and I want to get started on this before we leave for the beach.My previous negative review is below... a manager from Whiter Smile Labs was very quick to respond via ""comment,"" and another rep, Paul, from Whiter Smile Labs responded via email at 1:00 am, just a few minutes after my initial review went live. Based on the quick and professional response I received from this company after the initial problems and delay in receiving my order, I really do believe at this point that the issues I had were a fluke. I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of my finished trays so I can get started!INITIAL REVIEW: 5/8/14***THIS REVIEW ONLY COVERS CUSTOMER SERVICE & SHIPPING SINCE PRODUCT STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED***Please note that this is a real review from a real person--you can look at the 100+ other Amazon.com reviews I've written for other products over the past 6+ years.I purchased this product from the company's website over 2 weeks ago with the hope of brightening my teeth for our family vacation.  Based on the company's claim that they usually ship orders within 24 business hours, I thought that giving myself about a month lead time would be plenty... boy, was I off the mark.They clearly state on the Amazon page and their website that they usually ship the product within 24 business hours. After a week of checking my order info online (via the link in the order confirmation email), there was still no tracking information available. I completed the online contact form through their website requesting tracking information and waited for a response. No response. On day 12, I called the customer service line and pressed ""2"" for ""tracking""--the polite auto responder indicated that tracking was not available for my order and I should wait for the beep to leave a message. I left a brief message with full name and contact info. In my vain attempt to get through to a human, I called again and pressed ""1"" for sales (there's always someone staffing the sales line, right? WRONG!) The same polite auto responder indicated that a sales associate was not available and I should wait for the beep to leave a message. I left another message on the sales line.After about an hour of waiting for a response, I emailed ""support@whitersmilelabs.com"" and requested the status on my order since it had been 12 days since I placed the order and still didn't have tracking info. Two hours later, I received the following response: ""Thank You for contacting Whiter Smile Labs. We will answer your email within 24 hours. We value you as a customer and will try and get back sooner. Thank You again for contacting Whiter Smile Labs."" Twenty minutes later, I received another email:  ""Hello, I will look into this in the next 30 minutes and as soon as I find out what the isse is, will contact you... You should be able to track it in 2 hours.""I waited 4 hours and received neither email nor phone call follow up (how about a quick, ""sorry for your inconvenience"" email follow up?) I did, however, check my order status that evening and tracking information was finally available. I had imagined that a company that prides itself on speedy service would expedite shipping in some way--hah! no luck. First class USPS service for me and my $100+ order. According to USPS.com tracking, I should expect my order on Monday, May 12, more than 2 weeks after I placed my order.We leave for our first-ever family trip to the beach on the 24th. Even if I overnight the imprint of my teeth to the WhiterSmileLabs.com,  I have little to no hope that I will receive my customized dental tray before we leave. To say that I am disappointed in my experience thus far is a gross understatement. The only way for them to redeem themselves at this point is to provide me with an AMAZING product that is well worth the aggravation of ordering from a company with this level of poor communication and customer service.I will update this review after I receive my order and use the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBL1KNLV4YM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KNCSIG#wasThisHelpful","RFBL1KNLV4YM0","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've added eucalyptus oil to the multitude of other measures we are taking to combat indoor allergy issues. I put quite a lot of it in my fragrance-free laundry detergent along with tea tree oil and lavender oil to combat dust mites (as an alternative to my much-beloved Demite additive, which doesn't smell quite as nice). I also add it to my ADMS Anti-Allergy spray along with lavender oil and spray it on rugs, carpets, bedding, and curtains. I do not spray this mixture onto wood surfaces since I do not know how the oils will react with the various finishes on our furniture, cabinetry and floors.We've also added eucalyptus oil to our special mix of essential oils we put in our detangling solution to prevent lice--both of my girls are in classrooms where there have been lice outbreaks, and we've managed to remain lice-free since they started public school last year. Yea! The anti-lice solution is as follows: approximately an eighth teaspoon of eucalyptus oil, an eighth teaspoon of tea tree oil, and a couple drops of peppermint oil in one bottle of Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel® Conditioning Spray (8 oz.) Shake well and spray liberally on hair EVERY DAY.I really like the Now brand of eucalyptus oil--it is very concentrated (unlike a couple of other brands I've used), and it pours rather than drops out of the bottle (I despise those little dropper caps). The price is also very good, but I would buy it even if it weren't as competitively priced since I am convinced it works for my purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLVRVSM4J2R11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019LRZ2A#wasThisHelpful","RLVRVSM4J2R11","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty much the only cracker-type food I am not allergic to is rice. Most other gluten/wheat-free cracker manufacturers sneak things like corn, sesame seeds, soy product, nut products, etc., all of which elicit an allergic response. This cracker is made of brown rice. That's about it.I really enjoy eating these with salted butter for a snack. They are also nice with cream cheese or honey. They are G*d-awful with guacamole or salsa. They do not go well with the following cheeses: Brie, Edam, smoked gouda, plain gouda, sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, fresh mozzarella, Parmesan, bleu, Swiss, colby-jack, and pepper-jack. I will hazard a guess and say that they probably do not go well with most cheeses other than cream cheese.The price is pretty good for the 12-pack case. One case lasts me about a month. I cannot find these crackers anywhere locally, so the price is really pretty irrelevant in my case (if I want to eat crackers without suffering through hives and other problems).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HMXKQGHHI23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4GP3C#wasThisHelpful","R23HMXKQGHHI23","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, I have an Earth Fare within 5 miles of my house and in in a perfect world I'd tootle on over there, buy my flour, and support local businesses. HOWEVER, as we all know, it's not a perfect world, I use a ton of this flour, and dragging my kids to Earth Fare is on par with getting a Brazilian bikini wax (i.e., not a good time).Now on to the product itself. Anyone cooking with rice flour knows that it can produce a somewhat gritty texture in baked goods. The finer the flour, the less gritty the product (usually). I have made sugar cookies, chocolate chip cookies, almond cookies, berry cobbler, and a vegetarian pot pie with this flour. The cookies were the ""grittiest"" of these foods. The pot pie was the least gritty--the crust was just extra-firm, yet still buttery and tasty. One needs to adjust her expectations when going grain- and nut-free. I get wild and occasionally add some tapioca and potato flour into my baking mix, but the bulk of it is brown, white, and sweet white rice flour.In conclusion, this flour is the probably the best rice flour I've used for baking thus far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUMSJEV82BMJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000216O16#wasThisHelpful","RUMSJEV82BMJ1","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:Covers up all cooking/doggie/children smellsAllergen neutralizer works well enough in hallways/livingroomTidy little bottle and good spray/misterCons:Allergen neutralizer not strong enough for bedrooms of those with severe dust mite/pet allergiesFragrance REALLY strong if product is used in quantities sufficient to control allergy symptoms (and my bedding ends up soggy)I use this product in conjunction with the not-as-fragrant ADMS Anti-Allergy spray (http://www.amazon.com/ADMS-Anti-Allergen-Spray-32-oz/dp/B0010DLYR4/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1398535801&sr=1-1&keywords=adms+anti-allergen+spray). The combination of these products takes care of the allergy issue and the weird chemical issue of the ADMS spray. Another reviewer indicated that he sprayed it on his return vents after a kegger to freshen up the house. While I am at least 20 years beyond the demographic that enjoys that style of bacchanalian festivity, I agree with the latter part of his statement wholeheartedly--the spray will definitely freshen the house when sprayed liberally on return vents.If the allergen reducing properties of this spray were just a little better, I'd have given this product 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEGSHNIQ8JE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIIJGVS#wasThisHelpful","R2XEGSHNIQ8JE7","A2NW131BJQQ3LS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NW131BJQQ3LS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you liked Dragon Age: Origins, or Skyrim, you'll probably like Dragon Age Inquisition.I found it to be much better quality than Dragon Age II, but that isn't saying much as that was pretty much filler between the two major installments. I still find the gameplay inferior to Skyrim, however the interaction between characters is much better. If the two were merged into one game I'd be a happy camper. That said, I also found the character interaction inferior to Dragon Age: Origins. I quickly ran out of inter action with many of the characters and had less control over the quality of relationships. Also the misleading or less than exact communication options tripped me up again, though not as badly as in DA2. The answer choices should be what they actually will be. Otherwise you're gambling on how you want to represent your character, so I never am able to play through personal interaction with any confidence. As a side note, I also disliked that things you can loot say ""LOOT"" on the ground. Makes for lousy suspension of disbelief. And I was disappointed all containers didn't open, and thievery in game was nonexistent. And my final gripe, that you never loot potions... therefore if you're in the thick of it, you'll need to pick up and fast travel back to a camp for supplies when you run out, or look for supply cache boxes that are rarely around.All that said, I'm very happy with the amount of gameplay so far. I like the towns and areas and closing the rifts is very cool. The story line from Origins to now has always been really interesting and I feel very drawn in. The conflicts and perspectives with magic vs control, the mysteries of the fade. I feel like there is a lot here and it's ever deepening. This makes me feel good about the game series in general as reliable entertainment. They can make tweaks to the gameplay with each release, so it can improve, but if the story sucks, you're nowhere. So I'm glad that EA has done more right than wrong here... for now. ;)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNTOXKU0EW7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUFT1F6#wasThisHelpful","R3KNTOXKU0EW7S","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love this. Tara is one of my favorite instructors for her tireless effort to remind you to breathe. These disks are soothing, beautiful, relaxing, and fun. There is definitely a flow for everyone in these disks. Great variety for beginners up past intermediate and even on to advanced who still like a guided practice that is a nice self-challenging no-brainer.Tara's narrative is like a constant path guiding you through every moment with your body in each pose, suggesting play and even micromovements within the greater poses of the flow. I love it! Flow yoga constantly moves, so it can be hard to get clear guidance in new practices unless you choreograph it yourself.Can't say enough good things about this set. Really. It's exactly what I've been looking for in a DVD set for years. Hours of good feelings for body and mind! Varieties of length practices from a 5 minute routines in bed for am and pm, 15 minute Gentle Flow on Disk 2 to an hour long flows on Disks 1 & 3, and plenty of 30-40 minute flows too.Thanks Tara and Strala Yoga for being inspiring, warm, friendly, and approachable. Your love of yoga shines through everything you do, and is contagious. Thank you for being the breadcrumbs we need from where we are in our yoga practice to where we know we want to end up.People seem confused about routine time lengths. Disk two's descriptions have a few names for each flow, so I can see where the confusion is from. The descriptions and times are listed on the back of each disk, but here's a quick guide:Disk 1  - Strong Flow (1 hour play time) listed at 60 minutes  - Relax Flow (34 minute play time) listed at 30 minutesDisk 2  - AM Flow (33 minute play time) listed as Beginners Flow  on back of case at 30 minutes  - Gentle Flow (14 minute play time) listed on back of case  as Relaxed Easygoing Flow on back of disk at 15 minutes  - PM Flow (48 minute play time) listed on back of case  as Calming Night Time Flow at 50 minutesDisk 3  - AM Yoga In Bed (4 minute play time) listed at 5 minutes  - Daily Flow (32 minute play time) listed on back of case  as Daily Basic Flow at 15 minutes  - Energy Flow (1 hour 2 minute play time) listed on case  as Energizing Strong Flow 60 minutes  - PM Yoga in Bed (6 minute play time) listed on case as  Bed Time Flow at 5 minutesDisk 4  - Pose Library  Sets of poses related to topics such as Seated, Standing,  Sun Salutations, Arm Balance, Inversions, Back Bends,  Reclining and runs 90 minutes total according to  back of case  - BONUS: Strength and Flexibility poses listed as 20  collective minutes on back of caseHope that helps! :) I'm printing it up and putting it with the disks for quick reference for myself too since I don't have them memorized yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z2RL1OQQI4Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096WOKWM#wasThisHelpful","R2Z2RL1OQQI4Y9","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Other reviews complained of handle damage, rust, hot handles, and other issues.I have NOT experienced ANY of these issues.The kettle is beautiful and shines up nicely. It heats well on gas or electric stoves. I put it on a burner the same size as the pot, and no matter how high it is boiling at, the handle has never been too hot to use by hand. The rubber handle stays cool and is in as good condition as it was the day I got it 6 months ago.I'll check back in when it starts to show wear, but for now, there's not a bit.Love it. It was a great buy, and I'm so glad I have it.----------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE! - 1 YEAR AND 6 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE  ----The handle is still in perfect condition. The rubber still looks and functions as good as day one. Shines nicely and works wonderfully. We used it several times a week, sometimes every day, or several times a day. HEAVY USE, but it's holding up gracefully.The only wear and tear on it is some corrosion at the base in the crack. I think the salt in the air is causing gradual damage. But it is only in the crack between the stainless steel part and the copper part. Doesn't look as good there, but the pot still works in every way I need. If we didn't live on a small island in the middle of the ocean, I'm sure it would be 100% perfect in every way still.The 5 star rating stands!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HP289PF5P8SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LGFF6U#wasThisHelpful","R3HP289PF5P8SF","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know Christians who would roll their eyes at how overwhelmingly religious this book is, forget those of us who are free-thinkers and don't live our lives based on myth and superstition.This book is not terribly well-written, but I continued to read since I related to the goal of creating a fresh homeschool year. We all know that feeling of needing to refocus the family and create a positive environment for all to learn and live in. The author proceeded to identify all parts of the family and experience through their Christian and Biblical relationship with their ""God"" and worked toward homeschooling function from there.If you are Evangelical or Baptist and homeschooling, you will probably like this book. Even despite it's bloggish level of quality.I'm giving this book 1 star, and would give it zero if I could because this book should be obviously titled and marked as a Christian handbook. I was drawn in by the classy appearance and high reviews (probably made by church friends). Many good books and homeschool books include the presence of their beliefs, and that is fine. This is not one of those books.This book is so overwhelmingly religious, it is useless to any other variety of belief system. To a non-believer, it's so dogmatic and imbalanced that its almost offensive. I suppose it was written for a very tiny group of people. What a shame.If you aren't a very conservative and deeply traditional Christian homeschooler, this book is NOT for you. I hope there is a way to return Kindle books. I definitely want those few dollars back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG81PQFN8JXEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088IQ3PM#wasThisHelpful","RG81PQFN8JXEK","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hard book to review.Narration: WonderfulTechnical Writing: ExcellentOverall Concept: RelatableSupporting Characters: ColorfulMain Characters: unintentional TRAIN WRECKAllow me to elaborate. Eleanor Brown is obviously a solid writer. Her description and narration was absolutely masterful. However, I couldn't read it thanks to the frustration created by it's contradictory nature. The characters are young and they are written to sound like old women. I LOVED this book until the moment any of the sisters spoke, and then I was instantly snapped out of the enjoyable read. For a modern book, the characters were just too old. They were painfully unrealistic. Not because of their born and raised flare for Shakespeare (which I adore), not for being eloquent or bookish (I'd quite relate to that), and not because of any age disconnect (they're my age). Their manner of speaking and choice of words even in the most casual situations made it impossible to believe the young one was any kind of rebel or free spirit, or that the fashionable one wouldn't have literally been laughed out of any social scene suggested to have been part of her New York life. I suppose the homey one could have been as frumpy and dated as she was written, but even that was pushing it.This book would be great for old ladies reminiscing on young life. It strikes the elderly chord well while wrapped in the romantic package of younger women finding themselves.I wonder a bit how it ends, because I really enjoyed the general premise... but I'll never know. I couldn't possibly torture myself long enough to read it and find out.Ms. Brown truly is an excellent writer, but I think it's obvious she should write main characters of her own age group. Sorry if this is a bit harsh, but it's completely true. If this had been a book about sisters in their 50's or 60's it would have been perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260JGFHTLOZ6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425244148#wasThisHelpful","R260JGFHTLOZ6F","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son has used his size large from 5 to 6 years old. It was absolutely perfect for him to gain confidence in our pool at home. Now my older son is growing out of his and able to swim on his own. But my toddler is about ready for a vest of his own, so I'm back to buy a medium for him.In case there is still any confusion about the use of this vest, let me help clear it up:This vest is a swim trainer, not a life-jacket. It supplies enough support in the water for weak swimmers to gain strength and confidence. Any circumstance they would be practicing swimming in a pool, on the shore of a lake, pond, or the pool of a waterfall, this vest will allow them to swim without sinking easily. They will have to work a little to keep their head above water. It is a swimming vest, not a lazy floating vest. When my son was about 5, it took him an afternoon to get used to the vest and taking partial responsibility for keeping himself up and swimming. After that we both felt reasonably confident of his general water safety and became very comfortable swimming with this product. He was free to use his arms to paddle, as well as kick around. This vest gives kids a good strong start in the water.(Please note, this is not for use in the ocean in most circumstances. Sometimes a floating child in the sea is in more danger than a sinking one. Better keep kids safe, within your reach in shallow water they can stand in, and/or secure in a certified life vest. No young child should be allowed to swim unsupervised regardless of how great their floatation device is.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20SV9XIGZY8VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QHVFAY#wasThisHelpful","R20SV9XIGZY8VI","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this book, the author Liz Fraser interviews her grandmother to compare notes on good old fashioned parenting vs new parenting trends and lifestyles. The result is a fascinating view into even her grandmother's childhood and her parents' views and techniques, as well as a wonderful dialogue between generations of mothers.My favorite thing about this book, however, is the tone. Liz comes across in an informed, but playful and relatable way, making the book a very entertaining read. I highly recommend picking up this book.On a side note, Liz Fraser is out of the UK and the book isn't widely distributed here in the United States. A real shame as I think the US lacks a character like her in our parenting advice world. She's a great example of a modern mom that so many American women would both relate to and be able to learn from. She has a couple other books available too, and a new one coming out in 2012 I believe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9442IRMHBSSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007284772#wasThisHelpful","R9442IRMHBSSP","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The pictures are lovely, the recipes are creative. However only one or two of the recipes are even remotely ok to feed to kids on a regular basis unless you want them to develop obesity and diabetes... very un-fairy like.On a personal note, I'm a bit confused in general. Fairies are supposed to be lovely little nature creatures that live among flowers and mushrooms, drinking dew and wearing acorn tops for hats. How does one make the leap from such natural surroundings to a fairy cookbook made with refined sugar, chemical food colorings, and frostings, and candies, and maraschino cherries?I guess that was my big disappointment with this book. My daughter could only make a fairy recipe once in a great while because eating them all the time would be terrible for her. If the book had been creative like it was but in a tolerably less sugary way, I'm sure we'd have had little fairy meals much more often. And when getting rid of things, I did dump the book since we could only use it rarely for parties rather than for fun on a more regular basis.The idea was cute though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R142EYPNCGSPTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423602900#wasThisHelpful","R142EYPNCGSPTS","A1UJSOZN1ERD2A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UJSOZN1ERD2A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had a personal yoga practice for a while now. I began with several books and dvd's, but it is really important to have a good reference book. A yoga reference book should contain enough for you to pick from a variety of poses, and should inspire and empower you to create and continue your pursuit of your own yoga lifestyle. This book is a great reference book for beginners and intermediates.Slim Calm Sexy has an good number of poses (though I have books with even more variety). I prefer using this book over my others anyway. This book is a better total package. The practical yet playful and casual tone in the written content comes across as friendly and easy to relate to. But more than anything, Tara Stiles inspires tremendously through her unparalleled grace and elegance in the photographs. Slim, calm and sexy, Tara is the Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Yoga world. Could anything be more interesting, motivating, and inviting?And, if I can top all of that with one more thing... She is a really nice person! I've never met Tara Stiles, but I've watched several videos and interviews now. She seems gentle, approachable, calm, but energetic and fun. I'm sure she'd make a great friend. In the mean time, she can be the best friend of our yoga practices through her book and videos.

"Walt Disney Studios came out with the first version of Chilling, Thrilling Sounds Of The Haunted House in 1964.  The first side is narrated by Laura Olsher and the overall record is composed of a lot of things that actually don't have much to do with Halloween, ironically.  It's a classic vinyl record, though.  However, in 1979 Disney released a new version that carries the same title and guess what?  It is waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy better than the cheesy 1964 original.  This 1979 album has EVERYTHING to do with Halloween and it's incredibly scary as well.  Pretty much the full Halloween spectrum is covered.  Take a look at the names of the tracks on the first side of the album:1. Night Creatures2. Haunted House3. The Dungeon4. The Witches5. Encounter In The Fog6. A Grave Matter (The Grave Robbers)7. Mad Scientist's LaboratoryThese seven tracks on Side One make up ""Frightening Situations"" (Seven spooky scenes in sound).  These tracks are like short scenes in imaginary movies that are designed to trigger the imagination.  Side Two consists of ""Eerie Sound Effects"" (Create your own tales of terror), which are designed to help your own creativity.  Here are the categories and the individual sound effects:The Elements: Thunder and Lightning/The Storm/Winds/Dripping CavernCreatures: Howling Wolves/Rats/Shrieking Cats/Owls/Baying Hounds/Crickets/The Raven/Unearthly MonsterGhosts and Phantoms: Moans and Groans/Laughing Ghost/Cackling Witches/Assorted Screams/Heartbeat/Dragging FootstepsFrightening Devices: Creaking Doors/Rusty Gate/Fog Horn/Clock Striking Midnight/Rattling Chains/Laboratory Sounds/Tolling BellHaunting MusicThe cover art is awesome, both front and back.  Every spooky scene in sound is top notch, but my three favorites are Haunted House, Encounter In The Fog, and A Grave Matter.  This album captures the essence of Halloween perfectly and that's one of the reasons why I still listen to it to this day.  Other Halloween albums have come and gone, but this one has stood the test of time.  This album got some negative press at the time of its release.  Critics said it was too dark and scary compared to the original album from 1964.  Well, isn't Halloween SUPPOSED to be scary?  This 1979 release even has a warning on the back cover:WARNING: This album will scare your socks off.  Parental guidance suggested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VWDY2GD0E6X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UIZAWC#wasThisHelpful","R2VWDY2GD0E6X7","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Psycho II (Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) by Intrada is the complete original score to Psycho II (1983), starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Meg Tilly, and Dennis Franz.  Jerry Goldsmith did a good job composing music for this criminally underrated sequel to the original Psycho (1960).  This score is drastically different from Bernard Herrmann's masterpiece from the original movie, but it has its own identity and memorable music all its own.  The opening Main Title is my favorite piece in the movie, but all of the music is good throughout.I suggest picking up a copy of this soundtrack before all are sold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RA7FBI66JAOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDSS3CW#wasThisHelpful","R1RA7FBI66JAOJ","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a full description of the plot (if there is one), etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this David Lynch movie...Inland Empire (2006) might be the weirdest David Lynch movie of all, and we all know that ALL of his movies are weird, but this one might come in first place.  This three hour movie seems to have everything that is vintage David Lynch and then some, including people dressed as rabbits.  Honestly, I'm not quite sure what this movie is about, but that's actually a normal reaction for anybody who watches David Lynch movies.  Bruce Dern's daughter Laura turns in a good performance.  This movie also stars Jeremy Irons and Justin Theroux.  I didn't care for the use of the steady cam in a lot of scenes in this movie because there was some shaking of the camera which I find distracting.  The second disc of this 2-DVD set contains about three and a half hours of extras with a lot of weird stuff.  While I like other Lynch movies such as Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, etc., better than this movie, Inland Empire is still a good flick that I recommend seeing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIDLZIQ5X1H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QQFKYE#wasThisHelpful","R3GIDLZIQ5X1H0","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three Dog Night - The Complete Hit Singles is a 21-song collection of Three Dog Night's rather large number of hits.  There are lots of recognizable tunes here, such as ""One"", ""Mama To Me (Not To Come)"", ""Joy To The World"", ""An Old Fashioned Love Song"", ""Shambala"", ""The Show Must Go On"", and many others.

"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...Lincoln (2012) stars Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role.  He does an excellent job as Abraham Lincoln, definitely worthy of the Academy Award.  He not only looks like Lincoln, but also captured Lincoln's mannerisms, posture, even how he pronounced certain words such as pronouncing the word ""get"" as ""git"".  Sally Field is a dead ringer for Mary Todd Lincoln.  She looks exactly like her and portrayed her bipolar personality brilliantly.  Tommy Lee Jones is also great in his role as Thaddeus Stevens.  This movie also stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, and James Spader.  Really, everyone nails their roles in this movie.  The movie looks really good.  By that I mean the picture is clear, there's great scenery, color, etc.  The movie is on the dark side and covers the last four months of the Civil War and Lincoln's presidency.  It focuses more on Lincoln as a man rather than a mythic figure.The only thing I didn't like about this DVD was having to skip through about a dozen promos, previews, and distributor and film company credits, etc. before seeing the actual movie.  Very annoying.  I hate previews and I'm proud to say that I've never watched a single preview on any DVD I own - EVER.I recommend seeing Lincoln.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SKET324EVA6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMANBA#wasThisHelpful","R3SKET324EVA6A","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this Tim Burton movie...Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (2007) stars Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Sacha Baron Cohen.  This is a weird sort of horror movie that's actually a musical.  All the singing done by all the characters drove me nuts.  I swear, there's a song a minute!  I'm not kidding.  I'm not much of a fan of musicals in general, so even horror musicals such as this one have a mountain to climb before they win my approval.  The only horror musicals I like are The Wizard Of Oz (1939) and the borderline horror musical Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971).  This movie would have worked waaaaaaaay better if it was just straight dialogue with no singing whatsoever.  The weird thing about this movie is that it's a musical with a very dark atmosphere.  The best aspect of this movie is indeed the atmosphere, which is dark, creepy, and macabre, so the nonstop singing brings the movie down.  I deducted 2 stars because of this.  The singing is just too annoying and waaaaaaaaaaay too frequent.  This is definitely a vintage Tim Burton movie, but he's done so many other movies that are way better that have similar dark and macabre atmospheres, such as Batman (1989), Sleepy Hollow (1999) and others.I don't plan on watching this movie again due to all the singing.  I could, on the other hand, mute the TV and turn on some horror music on the CD player.  That would probably make the movie way more effective than listening to all the singing.If you're curious, this movie is worth a look.  Recommended only if you like musicals and/or want to watch something different.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TS7XBLA2J9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEBBAEK#wasThisHelpful","R34TS7XBLA2J9K","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...Sherlock Holmes (2009) stars Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, and Eddie Marsan.  This movie has a lot of action and darkness throughout.  The fight sequence near the beginning comes off as a little awkward with the film being sped up, etc., but it's definitely a unique sequence.  The acting throughout is good, especially by Downey.  The musical score by Hans Zimmer is pretty good.  The CGI was done well, with the exception of some scenes that looked quite fake.  The DVD comes with Special Features, including a feature called Sherlock Holmes: Reinvented.This movie is clearly a different spin on the Sherlock Holmes story and character.  He seems way more active than he normally would be and I feel that this was done deliberately to satisfy today's audience who expect and want everything to be high octane or they'll get bored.  This is Sherlock Holmes for the 21st century.Worth a look.Chow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQNW24INV98T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OQCV6A#wasThisHelpful","RLQNW24INV98T","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Disc One features the history of the Browns from their early days of winning many NFL Championships in the 1940s and 1950s to the then-present day (2008).  You'll see a wealth of old black and white and color footage with highlights, interviews, profiles, and commentary from many Browns greats as well as sportswriters, sportscasters, and historians.  A great deal of attention (of course) is given to all time great Jim Brown and his legendary career.

"Jets: The Complete History (2007) is an awesome NFL Films collection of footage and documentaries on the history of the New York Jets, who originated in the AFL and won the AFL Championship before playing the NFL Champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III on January 12, 1969.  The second DVD in this set has basically a drive thru version of Super Bowl III.  Nearly every play of the game is shown, but it gets to the point rather than showing the entire game.  You'll hear Curt Gowdy calling the game.  During the game, every once in a while you'll see and hear commentary by some of the players on both teams as well as the head coaches, who give analysis of the game.  Also on Disc Two are bonus features - The Coaches, The Midnight Miracle, 1968 Jets Highlight Film, and 1998 Jets Highlight Film.  Disc One features the complete history of the team from its AFL days up until the then current day (2007).  The Bonus Features are excellent, with features on Curtis Martin, Herman Edwards, Wayne Chrebet, The Sweetest Victory, Duel Of Legends, The Miami Rivalry, Super Bowl III - An All-Star Tribute, and Joe and the Magic Bean, a feature that was filmed in 1971.Quite a bit of attention is given to Joe Namath, what makes him tick, his legacy, etc.  Attention is also given to the historical significance of Super Bowl III and how it changed pro football forever.  The first few Super Bowls had the NFL champions competing against the AFL champions.  As a result of the Jets' victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III, all ten of the AFL teams were absorbed into the NFL, thus creating the American Football Conference (AFC) that we know today.  The Jets' win in the Super Bowl showed that an AFL team could defeat an NFL team and that the AFL was not an inferior football league to the NFL.  You'll also see interviews with lots of celebrities who remember Super Bowl III and their reflections on that game.If you want a really awesome history of the New York Jets, then I highly recommend this DVD set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VPY8SUUIHLN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PY52DQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VPY8SUUIHLN4","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you who are burnt out on the old traditional overplayed Christmas music that you hear over the P.A. system when youâre at the grocery store, then Midnight Syndicateâs dark Christmas album Christmas: A Ghostly Gathering (2015) will satisfy your need for something refreshingly different.  Unlike so many Christmas albums that have been released over the past 75 years or so, this album has a definite conceptual theme and the music is tailored to that theme, which is:âAs fierce winter winds cut across the frozen landscape, a welcoming golden glow beckons from the windows of a venerable country mansion.  Decorated in the festive trappings of Yule, its stately walls seem to offer a much-needed respite for the weary traveler.  But the holiday spirits are restless and eager for company this night, as the haunting strains of melodies old and new call forth from the shadows.âHere are the tracks:1. Christmas Overture2. Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy3. Carol Of The Bells4. Night Of The Krampus5. Angels We Have Heard On High6. Greensleeves7. Up On The Housetop8. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen9. Coventry Carol10. Little Helpers11. Sing We Now Of Christmas12. Winter Storm13. Into The Stillness14. The Parade Of The Tin Soldiers15. Everywhere, Everywhere, Christmas TonightBonus Track16. Christmas At MidnightI really like the songs Midnight Syndicate chose for this album.  They offer the greatest chance of putting a dark spin on them.  The opening track - Christmas Overture â sets the tone for the album.  It starts out very atmospheric, very magical sounding with harp, then turns dark with what sounds like an out-of-tune piano.  The track is very dark and haunting the rest of the way.  Out of the 16 songs on this album, 5 of them are totally original.  The other 11 are familiar classics but with a dark twist to them.  This album has the best version of Carol Of The Bells Iâve ever heard.  It walks the tightrope between cheery and creepy.  Wait until you hear Sing We Now Of Christmas â extremely well done and haunting.  Night Of The Krampus is destined to be a classic with its haunting choir, creepy piano and bells.  Winter Storm will make you visualize wind gusts spinning snow around and forming snow drifts.  I like what was done with Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy â very much their own dark and haunting twist with ghostly voices.One of the things I like about this album is that the pipe organ is used quite a bit, sounding very much like church music.  This gives the songs a haunting tone (Angels We Have Heard On High is just one example).  Choir voices are used to maximum haunting effect as well.  A wide variety of instruments are used throughout the album, which just makes the songs even better and more sophisticated.  Midnight Syndicate specializes in Halloween/gothic music, so it was only natural that somewhere along the way theyâd come out with a dark Christmas album.  This album delivers big time.  The overall feeling I get when listening to this album is of being alone in a huge mansion at Christmastime where things are on the creepy side and restless ghosts are haunting the halls and eager for company while dark and ghostly versions of Christmas tunes are playing, making me feel pretty creeped out.  Itâs a feeling of not being 100% comfortable in this mansion, but comfortable enough that Iâll stay for the creepy entertainment (because I like dark and creepy stuff to begin with).  Just look at the album cover.  I think youâll get what I mean.  I must add, though, that the last two tracks add some happy cheer to close out the album.If youâre looking for the traditional cheery Christmas album with Jingle Bells and Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, look elsewhere.  If you want something different and on the darker side, yet still has a good helping of cheer, then give this album a listen.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHZSEAGBQFTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JP8EOU#wasThisHelpful","R3DHZSEAGBQFTD","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This colorful action photo of Raiders great Ray Guy punting will make a great and vital addition to your collection of action photos.Congratulations to Ray Guy for being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014.  It's about bleeping time!  I watched this guy (no punt - I mean pun - intended) punt the ball into the stratosphere back in the 1970s and 1980s when he played for those great Raiders teams back then.  I remember back then thinking that he'll be a first ballot Hall of Famer.  He ended up being a 23rd ballot Hall of Famer, and that's only because the voters have had a long standing bias against pure punters getting into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  In fact, he is the first and only pure punter in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  For some strange reason, punters were not seen as vital to a football team's success and were ignored for Hall of Fame election up until 2014.  As Guy said during his induction speech, ""The Pro Football Hall of Fame now has a complete team.""  He's absolutely right.  Every possible position player had been recognized and represented in the Hall of Fame except punters.  I've been to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio five times and in those years that I was there..................no punters.  Completely absent.  Punters are a vital and crucial part of any football team.  They can make the difference between a team winning and losing.  It's all about field position.  When it comes to Guy, he had only three blocked punts in his entire career.  He was also the team's emergency quarterback and is a great multi-sport athlete in general.  He played in seven Pro Bowls.  He was part of three Super Bowl winning teams.  He was drafted by the Raiders in the first round in 1973.  That says it all.I recommend this photo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWNI0422SOJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7SRQ6W#wasThisHelpful","R1YWNI0422SOJ9","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sizzler: George Sisler, Baseball's Forgotten Great by Rick Huhn is really the first book to delve into the Hall of Fame career of St. Louis Browns great George Sisler.  Huhn sheds light on why George Sisler, as great as he was, is largely forgotten in this day and age while at the same time gives the Browns great his due, something that is looooonnnnnggg overdue.  Sisler, playing in the early years of the lively ball, had two seasons in which he hit over .400.  In 1920, he hit .407 and set a major league record for most hits in a season (then a 154-game season) with 257, a record that stood for 84 years until Ichiro Suzuki broke the record with 262 hits in 2004 in a 162-game season (Suzuki played in 161 of those games).  Sisler played all 154 games in 1920 and had 257 hits.  What's really amazing is that after Major League Baseball established a 162-game season in the early 1960s due to expansion, Sisler's hits record still stood for another 40+ years after that.  In 1922, Sisler hit .420, which is the third highest single season batting average of the 20th century, trailing only Nap Lajoie's .426 in 1901 and Rogers Hornsby's .424 in 1924.  Sisler's .340 lifetime batting average ranks among the best ever.  He sat out the 1923 season due to eye problems cause by a sinus infection, but came back in 1924 and, though he was never quite the same player again, still put up impressive numbers for the rest of his career.  Ty Cobb once described Sisler as ""the nearest thing to a perfect ballplayer.""  Why did Cobb say this?  It's because Sisler could do it all - hit, field, run, steal bases, even pitch.  He also had moderate power.  In 1922 he had a then-American League record 41-game hitting streak, which held up until Joe DiMaggio hit in 56 straight games in 1941.One reason why Sisler is largely forgotten is because he played most of his career for the St. Louis Browns, a team that were second class citizens to the other St. Louis team, the Cardinals.  His career lasted 15 years, shorter than a lot of legendary players, but not excessively short.  In those 15 seasons he accumulated an impressive 2,812 hits.  He had six seasons with 200 or more hits.  He led the league in stolen bases four times and swiped a total of 375 in his career.  He won two batting titles (1920 and 1922) and led the league in hits each of those years (257 and 246, respectively).Anybody who says George Sisler is overrated needs their head examined and doesn't know anything about baseball.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FPYI25WOZ4DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0826215556#wasThisHelpful","R3FPYI25WOZ4DF","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Batman: Season 3 contains every episode from the third and final season of Batman, which ran from 1966-1968.  This third season was definitely the weakest of the three seasons, no doubt.  The reasons?  Compared to the first two seasons (with the first half season which ran from January 1966 to April 1966 being the best season by far), the camp element was off the charts.  The scripts weren't as good.  The plots were barely there.  A lot of the episodes were flat out ridiculous.  The villains weren't as good.  There were too many Hollywood actors wanting to be villains on the show.  The sets weren't nearly as good, and a lot of them were downright cheap.  Most of the episodes were only single episodes that ran only a half hour long.  The show was on only one night a week compared to the first two seasons when it was on back-to-back nights.  Some of the episodes even had the whole '60s flower child element in them.  A lot of episodes had the actors poking fun at themselves and the show rather than playing it straight and serious.  Then there was Batgirl...................Wait.  Batgirl.  Barbara Gordon.  Played superbly by Yvonne Craig (RIP).  One of the definite highlights of the third season.  A huge plus for the show.  Barbara Gordon/Batgirl gave the third season a unique boost, a shot in the arm.  But it wasn't enough to save the show from cancellation.  However, for as many negatives as I have pointed out about this third season, it does stand out as being so different from the first season that it has its own unique identity and charm all its own.  I've always been a fan of the show's music by Nelson Riddle, and the third season's music is no exception.  I also like the Batgirl theme song.  Classic.  Some episodes - such as the Joker and Batman having a surfing competition - are episodes that are so bad that they're good.  Then there's Eartha Kitt as The Catwoman, who put her own unique spin on the character.  Her Catwoman was much more serious and evil than Julie Newmar's more seductive and playful Catwoman, probably because Batgirl was now on the show and the producers didn't want Catwoman being seductive towards Batman.If you want to watch the campiest of the three seasons and are out for just sheer entertainment and don't mind the camp element being in the stratosphere, then I recommend this third season.  If you want the best (in my opinion) season of the three, get the first half season.  The first half season and the third season make good bookends - one season that got everything just right and one season that has a totally different look and feel to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MEGSFLT7JNIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011Q8F1Q2#wasThisHelpful","R3MEGSFLT7JNIB","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been many well written reviews of this great book already, so I just want to give a brief synopsis and a few thoughts...Exporting America: Why Corporate Greed Is Shipping American Jobs Overseas is really the definitive book on the topic of corporate downsizing, outsourcing, cheap foreign labor markets, and overall corporate greed.  Lou Dobbs, former CNN anchor of Lou Dobbs Tonight and current anchor of Lou Dobbs Tonight on the FOX News channel, delves deep into the roots of what is making U.S. corporations utilize cheap labor through outsourcing to foreign countries.  Also discussed in detail is the topic of illegal immigration and corporations capitalizing on this, plus many more relevant topics.  Dobbs has the ability to see the big picture, something that's increasingly rare these days among the populace.  I don't want to give away too much, so you'll have to read the book for yourself.As a side note, my view is that corporate executives in the U.S. owe the American people and American society in general for their own success.  They were born and bred in the U.S., yet they shamelessly turn their backs on the American worker and the country as a whole that provided them with the opportunities they have had to succeed both occupationally and financially.  Well, there's a narcissist born every minute, and that is what so many corporate executives are - narcissists.  They don't care about anybody or anything but themselves and they certainly lack even the slightest bit of patriotism.  With their piercing eyes that penetrate right through you, it's no surprise that they do the things that they do, like buying $6,000 shower curtains and gambling workers' pensions away at the craps tables.  Besides that, we live in an age where greed and self-centeredness is at an all-time high.  It's the Me Generation if there ever was one.  Everyone is out chasing the buck and many are lying and cheating their way to financial gain, and corporate executives are leading the way.We need more great Americans like Lou Dobbs.  He'd be a perfect presidential candidate, that's for sure.If you want to read the definitive book on outsourcing and corporate greed, then I highly recommend this extremely well written book by the great Lou Dobbs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B06RX3ELLZI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446577448#wasThisHelpful","R3B06RX3ELLZI1","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raiders: The Complete History (2004) is a fantastic NFL Films history of the Oakland Raiders and Los Angeles Raiders.

"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some very quick thoughts on this movie...Changeling (2008) stars Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich.  This movie has great acting, passion, and great screen presence by Jolie.  Jolie gave a great Academy Award-winning performance in Girl Interrupted (1999), but she's equally as great in this movie.  This movie is based on a true story about police corruption and a woman's search for her missing son.  This movie is set in the 1920s.  That's all I want to say.  Watch to see how everything unfolds.If you want to see a good Angelina Jolie movie and have an interest in the time period in which this movie took place, then I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35NV4E3ADOY39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NFNFNU#wasThisHelpful","R35NV4E3ADOY39","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Myself, I've been there five times (1994, 1995, 1998, 2006, and 2010) and it really doesn't get old at all.  The Hall keeps expanding and adding new players, new exhibits, etc.  This DVD set profiles the 229 Hall Of Fame inductees and shows a little bit of old footage of their playing days.

"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this Disney flick...Maleficent (2014) stars Angelina Jolie in the lead role.  I'm not much into Disney flicks or Disney anything (in fact, the only Disney movie I own on DVD is the 1983 horror movie Something Wicked This Way Comes), but I rented this out of curiosity and because I've read the reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie.  The movie is loaded with CGI, which I expect to see in a 2014 Disney movie.  The CGI looks fake as usual, as it does in 95% of movies that contain it, but the CGI is more tolerable in a Disney movie versus other types of movies.  That's because Disney movies are mainly for kids and they usually have that classic Disney children's charm to them and the CGI just accentuates it.  Angelina Jolie was perfectly cast in this movie.  She does a good job.  The supporting cast seems good as well (I'm watching the movie right now as I'm typing this review).  I like the dark atmosphere throughout the movie as well.  The lighting, the shadows...it's all done right.  Overall, a good movie that I recommend seeing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTIT0CXGVG26Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4ADWTK#wasThisHelpful","RTIT0CXGVG26Y","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013) stars Leonardo DiCaprio and is directed by Martin Scorsese.  I rented this movie not knowing too much about it and about halfway through the movie I thought, ""This movie seems so much in the same style as movies such as Goodfellas and Casino.""  Sure enough, when the credits rolled at the end of the movie, it showed Martin Scorsese as the director.  This movie is vintage Martin Scorsese.  The movie is predictable.  I mean VERY predictable.  Along the way, there is endless cussing, nudity, sex, drug use, etc. - just like the two above mentioned movies.  This is one of those movies where the central character strikes it rich, then begins a predictable downward spiral.  His life spins out of control, he gets into drugs, he's a party animal, his drug use escalates, he has marital problems, he loses tons of money in various ways, he wrecks a car or two, he gets busted by the feds, goes to prison...basically he ruins his life.  Another movie that falls into this category is Blow (2001) with Johnny Depp.  Many scenes in The Wolf Of Wall Street are shocking and high impact, which is typical of Martin Scorsese movies.  Leonardo DiCaprio's acting is outstanding.  There is no doubt that a lot of the scenes in the movie were greatly exaggerated, which require the viewer to suspend disbelief.  However, knowing that some of the stuff that's in this movie actually does happen on Wall Street is an eye opener and truly shocking when you see it onscreen.  Overall, this is a movie that I highly recommend seeing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R63N8GWOQB1J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9KKKAY#wasThisHelpful","R63N8GWOQB1J5","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just some quick thoughts on this Christmas classic...It has been 25 years since National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was released in theaters, so I thought I'd finally write a quick review of it.  I saw this movie in the theater when it came out.  This is my favorite of all the National Lampoon's Vacation movies, even better than the first one called National Lampoon's Vacation (1983).  This movie is the funniest of all the Vacation movies, in my opinion.  So many scenes are hilarious, I can't even count them all.  Lots of memorable lines as well.  Randy Quaid is back as Eddie and he steals the show.  Chevy Chase as Clark is in top form.  The entire cast is perfect.If you want to see a Christmas classic, then see this movie.

"If you want to watch a documentary that gives a logical, fascinating theory and explanation about what happened to President Kennedy in 1963, then watch this documentary.  If you already have a lot of interest and knowledge about this event and you're a logical-thinking, reasonable person, after watching this you will probably connect all the dots in a logical, reasonable way and realize that the Kennedy ""assassination"" was an accident.  It was also a conspiracy, but a different kind of conspiracy other than the countless conspiracy theories that are out there, such as the CIA, LBJ, Nixon, Castro, the Russians, the Mafia, etc., etc., etc.  The conspiracy was after the fact, rather than pre-planned.  Why did the Secret Service and FBI act the way they did after the shooting, at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, etc.?  I don't want to give away too much.  Watch the documentary to see for yourself.Now, of course, there are still a lot of unanswered questions out there that have been lingering for decades, and I don't blame anyone for still questioning a lot of things (I still do myself).  But if you approach this documentary with an open mind, you might be swayed.  At the very least, it will open your eyes and realize that this event might have been an accident with a massive coverup after the fact in order to protect the reputation of the Secret Service.  How many shots did Oswald fire according to this documentary?  Watch to find out.It is very possible that Oswald's second shot (the shot known infamously as The Magic Bullet) would not have been fatal.  It is very possible that Kennedy could have survived that wound.  I've always believed in the single bullet theory.  I've always believed that one bullet could cause seven wounds.  It has even been proven in several experiments on documentaries I've watched.  But what I've always questioned FOREVER is the head shot.  Why did the head explode the way it did?  It's so obvious that the head shot came from a different type of gun, a bullet that was designed to explode on impact.  A bullet from Oswald's rifle could not have caused such an explosion and massive injury.So, if this documentary's theory about how Kennedy was killed turns out to be actually true (and I believe that it is), then the history books need to be re-written and amended.  The history book have always said the following:John F. Kennedy's cause of death was by assassination.The history books would have to be amended to say:John F. Kennedy's cause of death was by friendly fire from a Secret Service agent who was responding to an assassination attempt by an individual who was later captured and identified as Lee Harvey Oswald.Thus, that would mean that the last U.S. President to be officially assassinated by definition and beyond any doubt was William McKinley in 1901.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZD1P7O720KCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DT55OBI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZD1P7O720KCG","A22BPC7LRSGSYQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The most hilarious part of this book on Norway is the reference to ""lush palm trees"" lining the lakes and the great opportunities for ""dolphin watching"". This particular individual (whose first language is neither English nor Norwegian, judging by the peculiar grammatical syntax) has written dozens of equally uninformative travel guides to many of the world's vacation destinations under different pseudonyms, each available for less than $5.00 and containing less than 2 cents of information each. A great example of the limits of technology and the downside of the e-reader experience: Anyone with a computer and Internet access can be an expert on anything, and he or she can become a ""published"" author within a couple of hours just by being a reasonably competent typist.

I've read nothing like this by anyone else and I am pretty sure that is what makes it appealing to me. I don't need things to be 'real' to enjoy them. I loved the female narrator, but the male voice was just too old to pull off a 16-year-oldâ boy and it was sort of annoying thinking of him doing commercial voice-overs (which I'm pretty sure he has).

"This installment was one heck of a roller coaster. It has equal parts intimate moments with action and drama. I have to admit that I love when the hero is brought to his knees and shocked into admitting his love.

"I wasn't too keen on this authors other shifter book. It was oddly built so you were jarred out of the story constantly. This story would've gotten more stars, but the mistakes and syntax in this story were kinda a mess. I can excuse a lot of things but just because your indie published doesn't mean your exempt from hiring an editor. I have a list of very well priced editors that do a very good job so there is no excuse for the mistakes in this book. The story does have a HEA and a very unique storyline and mythology with shifters, unfortunately the lazy editing makes this a three star for me. It's a shame it could've been a five.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R74Z5S5170V02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLEG82U#wasThisHelpful","R74Z5S5170V02","ASLSCL3KWHFSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLSCL3KWHFSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"But the author pulled it through for me. When the story first starts we have a unlikable lead female that makes you hope nothing good happens to her. She's selfish and whiny. Well, enter our hunky step brother and he literally makes her a better person. When she's forced to work for him, she becomes responsible and hard working. What starts as her trying to manipulate him turns into a romance that blooms and you really connect with.

"This story needed some work. The pacing was horribly choppy and it seemed like it was written by a teenager, or someone who normally reads young adult and wanted something sexy but was too afraid to write sexy.

"Mina Carter very rarely disappoints me. She just has a knack for telling stories in a very small amount of word count. This story was no different. We got to feel and connect with the characters very quickly and then we got to see the hotness. This one was bold and left me wanting to cry because, well, they are doomed to different cities and now I'm sad :-(The only thing I may suggest is the book isn't bbw. It was actually drilled into us that the lead was lithe, small, and petite.

"Now this is an original shifter series! Seriously, from page one I was gripped and I got stuff to do around the house. The whole story has fantastic characters that pop from the page, and a unique storyline that keeps you guessing from page one. Kinsey has a talent for jumping right into play and instantly getting you wrapped up into the characters. I love and hate Elijah with a passion but he is written so perfectly as a male. And he literally thinks like a proper man! It reads like a man is writing a man not like a woman is trying too hard to write a man.

"Don't get me wrong the intimate moments were very steaming in this story, but I felt like the male dialogue and personalities were a bit forced. You can't force that you have to naturally just act male and it flows out in the pages of the book. But I felt it read more like a woman writing a man rather than a stable character development. I like my bear shifters really rough and this got lost in the story somehow. It wasn't holy or original either, quite a few people have used this plot point to get their characters together. As a whole I was disappointed. I also didn't like how it kept being brought up the girls were bbw, I only need it said once and I got it.

"I'm so totally speechless that I had to wait a few days before I actually sat down to do this review. It is so hard to do reviews for book I loved. Everything about this just worked. I kinda loved how the men were stupid but thought the chicks were dumb so they totally underestimated Liv. Now, here is the deal. Liv is immune to the island. Which means that its influence and its 'magic water' doesn't work on her at all like it does the other women that come to the island. Roen came through for me as a strong, yet still Alpha. He respected Liv, but at the same time he was so bent on keeping her safe he didn't stop to think that she could do that all on her own and his way of keeping her safe actually endangered her.The pacing on this book was must faster than the first. The first built the world and boy were you in it, now that the stage was set the book hit the ground running and didn't stop. I loved how Liv was the one to unravel EVERYTHING! But that ENDING! ZOMG! I'm STILL thinking about that ending two days later! I don't know if I want to hate or love Shane. I don't know if he wants her as a mate or if he just wants what he knows isn't really his anyways. But when we were in his head for that very brief amount of time I didn't get hostility from him, I got something totally different he way I hated him the whole two books and I was like WHAT THE---?Now, who the heck is in the tank? I think I know how is in the tank but it is a Mimi book so I could be totally wrong!As a warning this book does end on a HUGE cliffhanger and the last book isn't out until November.

"Oh what a tangled web Mrs. Pamfiloff weaves! And here I didn't think it could get anymore twisted than King's story and I was oh so totally wrong. I seriously went into this book like a giddy school kid. I didn't know what I was going to get and what mytho was going to tossed at me and I found that my jaw was on the floor 90% of the time. Roen I liked straight away. I have a habit of liking the broken man, and he's totally not broken in the wrong way, and he quickly does a 180 when he sets his eyes on Liv. I adore Liv! I appreciated her strength, her stubborness and her ability to love Roen unconditionally even if she believed he'd gone all wrong. This is a shorter story than the King books but it packs this crazy punch that your left thinking about it days, possibly WEEKS later. I can honestly say that I had a huge book hangover after this book and I read it in about 3-4 hours. I devoured it because just when you thought it was getting slow it slapped you across the face to wake you up!I want to know what the author's writing process is, because she honest took a fantastic legend and really molded it to flow and eb perfectly.

"Oui Maks. I didn't think I would enjoy him as much as I did. He seemed like the easiest of the three brother's and I thought for sure that I would be able to handle him without tears... HA! Yeah right, I totally forgot I was reading a Kresley Cole book. Notorious for making me sob like a baby in EVERY immortals after dark book. Not one left me not screaming, crying, and kicking things in frustration!In this installment of the Game Maker series, we get to dive head first into Maksim, brother to Aleks aka Roman. Roman was one heck of a challenge and I didn't know how I could possibly get more frustrated with a man. Well, then you enter someone that is very arrogant and instead of just making it easy on everyone and saying, ""Hey I like you, let's see how this works."" Maks has to go the long way round. Which I believe actually helped Cat to fall in love with him all the more because she was under the impression it was based on one thing, when in fact we know Maks knew pretty much most of the truth the whole time, atleast that she wasn't really an escort lol.Krelsey Cole is the master of the Alpha male, I read one of her books and then I go to another and the men all pale in comparison and I'm left disappointed and thinking about rereading the IAD series because I know I'll get some hella barbarians in that series. Oh the demon men....Oh, wait, Russian Mobsters, right.So, I know we are all in for it with Dimitri's book. He seems like he got the worst of them all and is the most bitter.

"You know, I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of the MC genre. Most either seem over the top, too far fetched, or the cheating element in them puts me off. At a certain point of the book the couple should be beyond getting head from 'club whores'. I was at first reluctant to read Jenika's MC series, but so many people seemed a fan, and you know, Jenika was my first step brother read, she was my first 'fighter' series read and she made me enjoy all the books I read when other authors left me feeling annoyed and slightly ragey.So, I was gifted a copy for an honest review. Let me tell ya, I LOVED this book. It wasn't just that she mixed two genres and pulled it off. It was that she told a great story with intense plot devices and characters that really came to life for me that I could honestly relate to. I mean I was never kidnapped by an evil MC, but I was able to put myself in the heroines shoes and feel her journey very intensely. I felt that her responses were honest, and it did take quite a bit for both H/h to give onto what they felt for one another, but that made it all the more real for me.She even had an evil female in it, and I hate to be 'anti-feminist', but I love when there is an evil chick for me to rage at and hope to god she is taken down. As a whole the story had a great flow, the characters popped out of the pages, and the smexy was very steamy!

"So, I have taken it upon myself to read all the books that my daughter is reading. Not just to content check, but to make sure she's reading it for AR lol.Anyways, I found this story really dry, even for a children's book. Not just that but the book was littered with grammar errors, poor sentences, and very stilted dialogue. I could've written more realistic dialogue from Anna and Elsa, any parent who has seen the movie a gazillion times with their kids could write Anna and Elsa better than this book. I know that I'm being a bit mean, but if you are a big five pub and you're going to agree to take on a Frozen chapter book series you better buck up and do it justice.I found that it took until over halfway through the book for the story to really kinda be 'fun'. My daughter even struggled through this and fought me on reading it saying , ""This is really boring mom, can I just read something else."" I told her it gets better, and she seems to agree once Elsa started using her powers. That is another thing. They almost make her powers seem like a bad thing while trying to 'tell their lesson' I thought the whole point of Frozen was a whole ""Baby, I was born this way."" deal. I'm not sure how Random House got the rights to write this, I honestly believe if this would've stayed in the hands of Disney Hyperion they would've found someone better to take on this series. I made the mistake of buying book two for my daughter. I think we will be going back to the Equestria Girl's books and NeverGirls.In summary: Disappointing, stilted, poor grammar that shouldn't be allowed in children's books, and a contradictory 'life lesson' makes this children's series a miss for me. I wouldn't recommend it to fans of Frozen.*I purchased a copy via my local Barnes and Noble*","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38AXLBRFQFNZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736432841#wasThisHelpful","R38AXLBRFQFNZ2","ASLSCL3KWHFSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLSCL3KWHFSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to give this book five stars! First off it was written by a 14 year old, for 14 year olds! It was entirely colorful, adorable, playful, and age appropriate. It is not often you get books that actual 14 years olds should be reading in the young adult genre.If I am being honest, Belle has a writer talent. She was born to weave clever stories about ancient gods being reborn. She brought the characters to life so well, and there were no plot holes! It was refreshing, clever,and fun to read. I instantly bought a copy for my daughters kindle and will be buying a copy for her school!

"So, I didn't expect to read this, but while cruising my netgalley I came across this SilkWords publisher. Well, they publish choose your own adventures, romance editions! I'm like WHAT! Yep. So the first one I grab is this awesome little story that has some greek mytho, and it is lesbian theme romance. It was fun getting to choose which journey my character went on. I could've picked two totally different options and I can even go back and mix them around. On the website it seems like I can read what I want but I don't know if its just a free trial deal because it looks like there is a subscription fee involved. But the website is allowing me to read what I want. I think 2.99 is a deal for these because I get more than one story in one book.I loved this one, it was sexy, intriguing, and had all the elements I loved most in a book.*I read this via SilkWords website.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP3C9QWRXQ5FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZYW490#wasThisHelpful","RP3C9QWRXQ5FJ","ASLSCL3KWHFSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLSCL3KWHFSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a tough one for me to review, because as a whole, the story was very good. However, the technical aspect of the story jarred me and pulled me out enough where I was left feeling lack luster about the whole thing.I want to note that I didn't read book one, but I did go download it so at first I was lost on the themes of this story. Once I realized it was a book two I had to read it as if I had read book one.As a whole, this story has the vast potential of being GREAT! Literally, for a theme that could be easily labeled dark romance it could dominant the genre. I'm not a huge fan on dark romance. Mostly because I take issue with glamorizing human trafficking. On the other hand, when you tell a story properly, it can work. This has all the markings of a story that could work.My likes:It was unique. In a world full of over saturated ideas and nonsense, this plot had me really wanting to know how it would end. It has meat, it is just lacking a proper execution. The characters worked. Albeit written very lack luster and in a grey tone, it was very hard for me to connect with anyone until the last few chapters of the book. It was as if the author found her rhythm and started to fly. But at the end of the day, a book is about its characters. Those need to outshine even a good storyline in order for a book to wow the reader.My issues:Now I normally don't review books this way but I wanted to be honest and not a totally a-hole, and if the author happens to read this I don't want her to curl up in a ball and cry. Trust me I know how that feels and I see the potential this author has. If she takes anything away from this review I want it to help not discourage.First off, the dialogue tags are a mess. I didn't know who was talking half the time. Someone would say something, and then someone else would feel the emotion. I had to reread the dialogue quite often until I could lock down who was saying what, and who was feeling what emotions. With the poor dialogue tags came stilted unrealistic dialogue. The words felt unemotional and robotic. Remember when people are talking you can talk in slang. It's okay. Contractions are a good thing in dialogue!Second, the editing was a mess. I'm not sure if this was a draft before edits or not, but I really struggled with how things were ordered and placed in paragraphs. It didn't have good transitions and it didn't flow from one scene to the next how it needed to. The BDSM needed some work. As someone in the lifestyle I appreciated how accurate the author was, while trying to put a darker spin on it. My brain had to shut off at the idea of a clue that didn't allow safe words and if you used them you got kicked out for life. Once I swallowed down my judgments, as a masochist, I kinda wanted to know where The Black Door was lolThird, my advice? Which I normally don't slot into reviews, but like I said I NEED this author to be great! She has so much untapped potential that I was screaming at the book in my head! Find critique partners that are NOT your friends, and that will be very honest with you. Sometimes it will hurt, and you are going to pout and stomp your feet, but at the end of the day, it will help your writing. I would also suggest a proofreader that is not the current editor. As many set of eyes you can get you your work the better.As a whole, like I said the story was good. I struggled with the characters because they weren't giving me enough to care. That opening scene was such a punch in the gut and then it sort of just went frozen on me until the ending build up. I found myself enjoying the secondary characters more than the two main protagonists.I will read The Red Door and I will read the next book in the series because now I gotta know if they catch the ""Auctioneer"" duh! I just hope that a little more time is spent in the revision process because I want these books to be GREAT! You can write a full length book in 14 days, but it takes an army to revise that sucker!*I received a copy via The Book Enthusiast Promotions*","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKMXETSGGXFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TU3TEPK#wasThisHelpful","R3FKMXETSGGXFA","ASLSCL3KWHFSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLSCL3KWHFSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my second audio book. I realized its really handy to listen to an audio book while I do busy work like graphics, blogging, and all that other stuff since I can't actually read. The Selection has been on my list for ages. Finally, on a lazy weekend I started it knowing my daughter could listen to it with me. This was a different dystopian type tale. I mean it has its moments of harsh reality like all of them do, and its a bit odd that they have to go through this whole Selection process. Think Hunger Games meets The Bachelor because the dates and how they talk is SOOOO like the Bachelor but the whole rating system and when they got cleaned up for the Prince. I have to admit I'm not favoring Maxon. He had these incredible moments of sweetness that made me go awwwwww. Then he was all mean about the Celeste thing. I mean yeah, he explains that its because he's got pressure later. But then he's whining that he's sick of being told what to do. But dude. America told you she's a a-hole, she's an a-hole. I guess it's cheaper to keeper. Oh, and it will lead to more drama in the books lol. I don't believe he kissed the one chick on the roof. I think that's a lie. It seemed out of character for him based on his kiss with America.At the moment I'm digging Aspen. Don't like the name so much but he's willing to fight. I wonder if Maxon knew he had competition if he would be as aggressive. At times America got on my nerves but I think that was more the way the narrator played her. She seemed to keep America very monotone and the rest of the characters when they would speak seemed to have more color. I'm starting to notice that narrators make or break a books when you listen. The book ended on a slight cliffhanger type ending with Aspen laying down the game, Maxon being a little bit passive, and America willing to give it a shot with him. Personally, I don't think she's gonna cope well because I think Celeste is going to be around until the end and I don't know if I can cope with that. If she is I might have to stop reading lolAnyways, this was a very sweet, fluffy easy young adult story and I will be continuing.*I listened to a copy via Scribd*","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SPPRDIDWPT6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WZU5E2#wasThisHelpful","R2SPPRDIDWPT6F","ASLSCL3KWHFSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLSCL3KWHFSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a tough one for me. This book had me feeling bipolar in some ways. It had these really great moments where I felt the author would redeem the female lead for me, and then he would go back down into this pit of unlikablity. Hannah wasn't a character I would call strong. I guess with the way the author wrote her, he pulled if off if that was his goal. She was weak-minded, superficial, selfish, and really mean. But I also felt that every female character in this book was laid out to be this way. I couldn't figure out if this was the way the author wanted this 'town' to be, but based on Hannah's introspect, the author seemed to make a generalization of how girls are in high school. It is laid out that every teenage girl wants to be popular, blonde, worshiped, and adored. This guy has obviously never met the comic book|fangirl|nerd chick (That was me.) I didn't care about popular, actually I related to Lukas if I am being honest. I live my life in origin stories, revenge stories, or redemption stories aka comic book story arcs. But I'm not sure if this author was venting a personal hatred towards high school girls in general, or if he was writing a cautionary tale. I honestly was thinking one way, then Hannah's action would have me going towards the other story arc option. Not to mention the author built TOO much tension. He waited until the last 2 1/2 chapters for anything amazing to happen. I was waiting and waiting for zombie action, how this was going to take place, and I was WAITING. When you spend too much time in a characters head who is unlikable you tend to not care about the awesome gruesome action when you get there.I kept finding myself wanting more Lukas, then feeling bad when he came into the scenes because Hannah treated him like garbage. Then she realizes AT THE END he was a good person? I kinda wanted to toss her ot the flesh eating cheerleaders at that point. When I don't care if a cheerleader lives or dies that is a problem. It was written similar to old school Tales from the Crypt episodes because the leads in those were very rarely good people. You always were waiting for them to get their comeuppance. At the end of the day, I just wasn't totally feeling this story. I am not sure it was right for him to write in a female POV, I would have totally enjoyed the book if it was in Lukas's POV. The book gets two stars for him putting in what I like to call one of MY people into the story, and for the fact he isn't a bad writer, he just wrote in a female POV and it didn't work for me. I have to like the girl who's head I'm in. I see this as more of a 'boy book' he wouldn't mind it because I'm pretty sure teen boys think this of teen girls. But on the other hand with the rise of the comic book films no one has to face persecution for showing you like comics now--so this book might prove to date itself a bit.As a whole, I would recommend this book to the teenage boy crowd. I don't think females would find this book very flattering.*I purchased a copy of this book at the friends of the library bookstore*","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMA8DQHXXEDD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312573758#wasThisHelpful","RMA8DQHXXEDD6","ASLSCL3KWHFSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLSCL3KWHFSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now THAT was fantastic young adult fiction! It is going to be very hard for me to write this review because I want to do that telling gush, but I want people to actually read the book, and most people don't read a book based on gush. They want facts, they want why, and they want to know really why they should read it other than ZOMG! It was soooo good!So here is the low down. The Duff was written by a teen, for a teen. She wrote this book when she was a senior in high school after hearing the term 'Duff'. When she thought to herself that she was the Duff with her hot friends around her, she realized her hot friends also thought they were the Duff. So in terms I can make you all understand, its a realistic book, about more realistic teens, that face self-esteem issues. Because lets face it, even the hot chicks think they are ugly on a bad day. Not only was that an endearing quality to the book, but Bianca is a very likable and relateable character. I was Bianca in high school. I just didn't give a crap! I thought relationships were silly, I thought love was fake with teens, and I looked at the hot dude like a walking STD. Which it turned out he was, and I called him out in the middle of science class about it, and it didn't seem to make him afraid of me it made him 'curious'. No I didn't even up with the hot guy, I ended up nearly beating him up at a party, but that is neither here nor there. The rises and falls of this book were perfect. It was paced so wonderfully that I never caught myself skimming (which does happen) I wanted every introspect, every word, and every struggle that the characters were going through. I loved have well Bianca and Wesley complimented one another. I liked how it was more of a joke to use the term whore, and when Bianca finally put it into perspective she just didn't feel that it was right to use at all. The hot girls were a-holes, and there was no token mean girl, they all just got along. Yes, there was a group, but they were mostly isolated to their own 'mean girl' world. That was very telling because it was that way in my high school. Yes they bullied, or tried, but when called out they backed off and went back to their own reality.Wesley. Well, he's not likable as a hero at first. So we have a bit of a redemption story in here. He was totally hilarious and his banter with Bianca was easy, quick-witted, and hysterical right from the start and you just knew that these two were built for one another. Bianca never allowing Wes to, well, be Wes. And Wes made Bianca feel beautiful. It was a match made in young adult book heaven and I loved all the good young adult reading qualities this book had!I wouldn't recommend this for younger young adult, more upper grade into college. There is a lot of sexual content, it wasn't shown but it was lead up to and implied. So I wouldn't let my daughter read it until I felt her maturity could handle it. I can also tell that the movie is going to be NOTHING like the book, they manufactured a 'mean girl' character ""Madison"" who is not in the books. Not sure why they needed that plot device when the plot devices in the book would've worked just fine for conflict.*I purchased this book at my local Barnes & Noble*","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H3Q8MREA4M8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316381802#wasThisHelpful","R3H3Q8MREA4M8W","ASLSCL3KWHFSE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASLSCL3KWHFSE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Le sigh...I went on this journey with these characters not really knowing what to expect. I'd never read this author before but I LOVED forced marriages. Call me old school with the whole bodice ripper mentality, but I love when a woman is picked and a dominant male insists on her accepting him. If that makes me a non-feminist then label away but I love me some barbaric manly chest pounding heroes. This is my cup of tea and I love how the author had a very effortless way of world building and bringing the story to a full arc. I'm a fan of the serial format because I'm a busy girl and I haven't got all day to sit and read most of the time, I get the weekends. This is one of my favorite serial series to date. I love how Tanya didn't give into the men, they were forced to work together for the sake of the women they loved, and for their race of people. It wasn't just a 'forced' situation. They all needed one another and sometimes stubborn people need to realize that they get along with someone that someone isn't an enemy just because your daddies didn't like one another.

"....This one made me so happy to start with. I was on top of a cloud and I was so into the book that I had no clue that the author was going to toss the inevitable trouble at the reader. Then I was feeling it. I knew that something was coming. Our boys Zane and Brant were acting off. Even during the ceremony they were being silly and they were trying to get Tanya to doubt--to reconsider. If I was here I would've looked at both of them then and been like, ""Um... wtf!"" But she was in the moment, getting married/mated, and I get it! Then WHAMO! I cried... I was so hurt for her and I wanted to snatch her up and allow her to cry in my arms because she was totally justified in being as upset as she was. They don't get it.

"BRILLIANT! AMAZING! MY FAVORITE BOOK OF THIS SERIES!Jenna Galicki has become one of my favorite rocker authors. I have fallen in love with her writing and her books. The characters and story-line in all her books always leave me wanting more. I can not wait for the next book of this series!This book has become my favorite book of her series. The moment I picked up this book I knew that I would have hard time putting it down until I devoured every last page and I had it devoured in hours.I love the story between Audra and Jimmy. If you have read all the books of this series then you know that Audra and Kira have been part of the history of Immortal Angel. In each book the readers have been watching these two sisters grown up and become part of the executive side of the band then just the groupies they were at the beginning. This history between the band and the two sisters really brings out the true story that becomes the love story that will tug at your heart.This is a must read book! You will fall head over heels in love with the twist and turns that Audra and Jimmy endure while discovering themselves as well as each other.I HIGHLY recommend this book! Go grab your copy!

"AMAZING! Jani Kay has done it again!I am a huge Jani Kay fan and love all her books. Jani's writing is unique and has her readers captivated from the beginning of every book. This book will have you fallen in love and not wanting to put it down until the end.The Scorpio Stinger MC is an amazing series. I have fallen in love with the story-line and characters since the beginning. This book will have you thinking different of Harrison and have you fallen head over heels for the arrogant, cocky, broody cop.I love that Jani Kay wrote a book that goes more in depth of the character of Harrison. She shows the more sensitive and compassionate side of this character. I was not a Harrison fan for most of this series, but after reading this book I have fallen in love with his character.I highly recommend this book! Go grab your copy!

"I absolutely love great friends to loverâs stories, and thatâs exactly what Something for the Pain was!Alex Carter and Tripp Daniels are best friends and have been since childhood. They have always been there for each other through thick and thin. Now all grown up, the lines are starting to blur. The sexual tension is intense, and their friendship is being put to the test by a proposition that neither of them can deny.Alex and Tripp captured my heart. Alex is your typical bad boy (hot, sexy, tatted, pierced, etc.) with a less than stellar past and panty melting smile, but under all that âbad boyâ heâs got a soft spot for Tripp, and it shows, and makes you fall in love with these characters.

Rock star YES PLEASE!!!!I have to say that I was pulled right into this story and against better judgement fell head over heels in love with Alex and Natalie's story... This is the story of prick and I use that term lightly rocker and his P.A..For me this story was awesome because unlike most rocker books out there they didn't fall right into bed together. Natalie resists Alex just as long as she possibly can.. I loved the buildup to the hotness that was Alex and Natalie.For me all around this book was awesome.

It was an awesome hot and sexy second chance love story...Linc and Simone had their summer fell in love hard and fast and then that thing we call life moved got into their way..One of the things I really loved about this story and book. Is that the author sectioned parts off. What I mean is the past gets its own section rather than jumping back and forth between past and present.

OH NATE OH NATE, I fell in love with Nate and his Alpha ways. Nate was an awesome character because he had this really awesome push and pull with his emotions and with what he wanted although we didnt really get to hear his side of the story (which I would have loved to).

"The cardstock used was very thin light weight paper, some of them had fold marks across the corners, packaging was bent out of shape.  If I bought this for a really serious project that I was putting very important photos into, I would have returned it.  The designs are nice and thankfully did not come loaded with the standard TC cliche design motifs like Fleur de lis and crowns etc. (just one card had a damask design on it).  I bought it for the color palette, soft neutral, peach, kraft.  Most of the sentiments are very brief which I liked, plenty of white space on at least half of the 3x4 cards for journaling.  Only perhaps 2 of the designs were duds.  There were 2 lazer cut designs, one with FAMILY and one with PHOTO cut out.  There are  2-3 acetate cards in 4x6 and 3x4 sizes that you can layer on top of the printed designs which worked out really pretty.  I've only ever bought these kinds of cards once before from the Project Life brand (when they first came out) and the cardstock they used was very sturdy, but the design was not so great.  I guess this is one of those things where its safer to look at it in the store before you buy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLWOQM4VM7DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHN6ALU#wasThisHelpful","R3VLWOQM4VM7DA","A24FX30B20WLMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FX30B20WLMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We found one of these at Target, managed to snag the last one left during a run on fans during a massive heat wave.  Went back the next week to get any fan at all and the entire inventory of fans at all big box retailers was ""SOLD OUT"" within driving distance from my home.  We hadn't done any reviews on this fan, just bought it because it was the only one left, but it turned out to be a really great fan.  So we bought our second one here on Amazon and discovered how many other people love this fan based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews here.  I didn't really think it would add any value to provide one more review but thought I'd mention a few things.  Our first fan made a regular humming noise, the other one made a noise as if something was wobbling on the inside but this didn't seem to effect the performance at all, just made me wonder if something inside the outer box was loose.  We have tiny pets in the home and we feel very safe leaving the fan on the floor with them in the room and they love it.  So far no nasty dust has collected around the blades like they do on ceiling fans (have only had them for one month).  The cord is rather small, so you can only place it somewhere fairly close to an outlet unless you use an extension cord.  I do prefer this style compared to a ""rotating"" fan, and there are 4 settings for the amount of ""air"" that comes out of the fan.  I do WISH it had one more setting for a level of air that is more gentle than the lightest setting.  Even during our 100F heatwave, we could only use the most gentle setting, if that gives you a sense for whole powerful the settings are.  We don't have gigantic rooms, so perhaps if you have really huge rooms in your house you might like the settings that come with the fan.  We gave central air but it causes my arthritis to flare up so this has been a great way to stay cool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P41F2I6YM97S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037W4YD2#wasThisHelpful","R2P41F2I6YM97S","A24FX30B20WLMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FX30B20WLMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned better quality mesh bags, but these do the job and are not bad for the price.  So tired of the drum in my washer creating little holes in t-shirts, ruining new clothes after only a few washes!

Not sure if I would buy this brand again if I find myself in need of more but they do protect your clothes from damage done by your washer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TYL1XGC4GL1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6QRDZ8#wasThisHelpful","R2TYL1XGC4GL1H","A24FX30B20WLMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FX30B20WLMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this book because I just purchased the Accu-Quilt Orange Peel die (same shape but not size as those used in the quilts in this book) and was fascinated by the brief sneak peak posted here on Amazon in terms of the different variations of quilts that could be made with just this one applique shape and was not disappointed at all.  If I were only rating the book on design, I would have given it a 5 star rating however due to some serious problems with the book's tutorials and illustrations I had to mark it down to a 3 star rating. There are 8 quilts with 8 matching pillows, and I absolutely loved at least half the pillow designs and half the quilt designs.  While the applique shape is the same, they vary in size according to the pattern, however, all templates are provided full size in the book (digitized, not hand drawn).  I also love the fact that the pillows were ""quilted"" for the front and made to be used with standard size pillow forms and an ""envelope"" style backing (no zippers, button holes etc.)  I also thought the instructions for the ""window fusible applique"" method was very good.  I did have a few ""issues"" with the book that I felt could have been improved.  The first 30 pages discuss ""quilt making"" - if you've never made a quilt before, I don't think there is enough information in these 30 pages to teach you all the ins and outs of piecing, quilting and binding a quilt, you really need a separate book that just focuses on quilt making to learn all the essentials.  I think these pages could have been more wisely used to focus on one area that was almost completely ignored in the book yet very essential to the success of making these quilts - applique placement.  There are ""no diagrams"" for each of the quilts"" that provide a ""step by step"" visual of how to place the applique pieces onto the quilt blocks, there is just one sentence which says the same thing for each quilt.  This applique shape is very unique as you need the points to meet up but you must applique them onto the block before the blocks are sewn together and I could see that even the samples in the book had some problems with getting the points of the ""petals"" to meet up properly.  The instructions that came with the Accu-Quilt orange peel die gave more advice on how to address this issue than this book did, so between the book and the instructions from my die, I had a better sense for applique placement.  Another important thing that was left out of the instructions was guidelines for ""height and width"" of the blanket stitch when machine appliqueing the petals to the quilt blocks per each petal size.  (By the way, ""satin stitch"" was not even mentioned as an applique stitch option in the book or the ""invisible machine applique stitch"" which would have really enriched the educational aspects of the book as this book does focus on applique specifically.)  The stitches have to meet up ""perfectly at the point so you can pivot around the point just right, but the book only says that it might ""take a couple tries"" to get it just right (in other words, you must play around with your stitch settings until you get the width just right so it will pivot right at the points for each petal shape (that's ALOT of work!  I was interested in these designs because I thought they wouldn't be too labor intensive!). The other thing that bugged me was the ""drop shadow"" that was used by the graphic designer in illustrations where different prints are sewn together, which makes things look more confusing than they actually are.  Finally, it felt like the editor was very ""heavy handed"" in their editing of this book, which made it feel like very cliche/cookie cutter/boiler plate reading, more like a series of magazine articles, rather than having a narrative with an authentic voice from the author.  The book cross promotes other C&T books and Moda pre-cuts (product placement??) as well as name dropping for the Moda Bakeshop website. I have an enormous amount of respect for the author and have been aware of her work since her first fabric line came out and am very happy for her success in having this book published in her name.  But I think the publisher could have done a better job on the editorial side in the preparation of this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MTSF6XUJKS95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607057972#wasThisHelpful","R3MTSF6XUJKS95","A24FX30B20WLMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FX30B20WLMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is so difficult to find a dress pattern from a sewing store where you actually see the finished dress on a real model.  If I just see a graphic design of a pattern, I feel like I have so little to trust in terms of how well the pattern will turn out when you see the finished product.  Also, there are so many patterns in the sewing stores that are just pure duds, its really hard to find anything classy yet contemporary and thats where this book really shines.  I would love to make at least 75"" of the dresses shown in the book.  This isn't one of those books where just the cover photo is adorable, they are all super awesome dress designs.  The premise behind the book is that every top can be mixed and matched with every skirt for up to 200 different combinations of dresses to make.  Just some things you should know.  I guess all standard sewing patterns are designed with the assumption that you have a ""B"" cup bra size, according to the author, so I think all her patterns are based off of that assumption as well.  Every pattern in the book comes in size 1-12 but they are not designed in particular for petite, tall, woman's sizes etc. (but there is a section in the book on how to lengthen/shorten, widen etc. your patterns as needed).  Also, the sizes are not marked on the patterns numerically.  None of the patterns are hand drawn, they all look digitized.  The pattern paper is very thick and sturdy, not the tissue paper kind, I would imagine you would want to trace your pattern size onto drafting paper for sewing.  The book assumes that you will take your own measurements, make adjustments to your pattern accordingly and then make a ""muslin"" or ""voile"" mock up first for a custom fit.  She recommends quilt fabric along with many other fabrics for dress making but I can't really recommend quilt fabric as it is 100% cotton and gets very wrinkly/difficult to iron (she even recommends washing and drying twice to insure full shrinkage of the fabric before sewing with it because cotton will shrink even more on the second wash).  I don't know where one goes to find dress maker fabrics anymore except if you are lucky enough to live in a very large city with a ""garment district"" like LA or New York.  I've never really felt confident making and wearing a hand made purse for any other purpose except to go to the farmers market or the library but these dresses are something I would actually feel proud to wear if my skills were as good as the seamstress who made all the garments for the book.  I get the sense that this was a collaborative effort with some expert advisers, seamstresses etc. involved.  I don't know if Tanya served as ""art director"" and the actual ""hands on"" work was done by others but whatever the case may be, the end results were outstanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIQ0M6V417QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770434940#wasThisHelpful","RAIQ0M6V417QT","A24FX30B20WLMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FX30B20WLMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked the designs too.  The color palette is much more bright, the colors are more saturated then they appear in the photo here and on Prima's website.  Especially the pink and turquoise colors.  I'm not sure I would have been so gung ho to buy it if I had known that.....The only thing I was disappointed with is the fact that these papers come in a pad that is actually about 7x6"" with about a 3/4-1"" margin on top that you have to cut off with a paper trimmer or scissors.  If you have a storage system for 6x6 paper pads, this pad will not be 6"" in height, only 6"" in width, just FYI.  So while I was hoping the colors would have been softer and more toned down like they look online and I didn't like the way they made the papers with margins that have to be cut off, overall, I was happy to find this and add it to by stash of papers for card making.  The overall vibe of the designs is very retro 50's in style except the dark chocolate brown pages looked more modern/contemporary to me.  Definitely check out the Prima website to see the full collection, they have some really awesome coordinating products, especially their flower embellishments that have the most beautiful colors.  I only wish I could ""see"" them in person at a real store first because the price of buying all those accessories can really add up and I'd like to make sure they look as pretty in real life as they do online.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SW934U6LI9CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MX7806Y#wasThisHelpful","R1SW934U6LI9CG","A24FX30B20WLMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FX30B20WLMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In ""Attract Your Ideal Customer,"" author Mark Anthony Germanos offers a refreshing and new approach to social media marketing and actually getting to know your customers at a level beyond the impersonal data of demographic numbers. Germanos sets forth that specific targeting rather than the blanket approach to an age-group, a gender, or a group of a certain income or educational level not only yields superior results, but affords a personal touch that is more likely to attract new customers and retain old ones.Germanos boldly deconstructs the conventional approach to marketing by taking aim at what he calls the âpain point,â or the problem a business or company seeks to solve. His unflinching claim is that internet marketing is the countermeasure to the debilitating symptoms of the pain point, and he adeptly lends support to this claim in each chapter of this intriguing book.Numerous worksheets inserted throughout the book offer a practical application toward developing a greater understanding of this unique and groundbreaking system. This is one of the most innovative approaches that I've seen in a long time, and I am eager to test-drive some of these fascinating and well-grounded theories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TT7TMEYKGFVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983576912#wasThisHelpful","R2TT7TMEYKGFVO","A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Blackthorne ups the ante with another epic trilogy in ""Meditations of Madness."" Using a mix of pure imagination and settings that are loosely grounded in medieval history, Blackthorne loves to mix and match and move things around in his stories. While these tales contain his trademark fingerprint of action and magical allure, the humanity of the characters shine brilliantly through, posing the ultimate question of whether we can really ever know anyone deeplyâ¦even ourselves. As always, Blackthorne juggles lots of characters and sub-plots in his tales, but he manages to tie up all the loose threads in a satisfying manner by the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OD2LSHMZPYCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502922665#wasThisHelpful","R3OD2LSHMZPYCJ","A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In ""Tribute to a Trilogy"" author James Blackthorne combines three powerful stories to create a thrilling mix of adventure and intrigue that is sure to appeal to fans of fantasy. Blackthorne does not shy away from a thicket of characters, subplots, and themes as he fearlessly hacks through them with machete-like ease. He gives his readers credit for their intelligence by not dumbing down his writing. His style is straightforward and introspective if, at times, a bit jerky.

"This is a raw, compelling, and often disturbing peek into the turmoil and pain of a troubled young woman. The content is broken up into a collection of essays, poems, and short narratives that is reminiscent of Jack Kerouacâs stream of consciousness style. Unlike Kerouacâs free-spirited protagonists in his most famous novel, however, this young lady casts her imprisonment behind the walls of her own pain into the forefront. One gets the sense that much of her pain is self-inflicted through poor choices in men and through a basic lack of rational decision-making skills that often lead to poor choices, in general.Her talent as a writer is undeniable, but the book has many disturbing aspects that elicit both sympathy and exasperation for this young woman. One can only hope that she will recognize the forgiving nature of youth and the opportunity for second chances before her story culminates in the tragic ending to which she seems to have resigned herself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2ZDLXHMZLAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503211347#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2ZDLXHMZLAS","A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this first installment of the Market with Numbers series, authors Frank Bria and Mark Nogaki propose an entirely new approach to the way we look at marketing. Rather than devising a blanket campaign to a generic audience of ""18 to 34-year-olds"", Bria and Nogaki blow the lid off traditional demographics with the concept of breaking up an audience into smaller pieces so that each may be motivated by a different strategy or technique. In short, the authors boldly seek to deconstruct the conventional approach to marketing in an entirely new framework that offers a fresh way of thinking about gaining new customers and retaining existing ones.Using a system they call Market with Numbers, the authors present a multi-faceted strategy that enables you to make decisions based on specific facts and hard data rather than targeting a broad and largely undefined demographic segment. In other words, their system seeks to use marketing with the precision of a sniper rather than using the shotgun approach to an expansive age range. This is one of the most innovative and exciting approaches to marketing that I've seen in years, and I plan to recommend it to my colleagues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQE5A3ZKOX91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVU3MMY#wasThisHelpful","R3KQE5A3ZKOX91","A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book for anyone who appreciates poetry, but it is especially for those of us who wonder how ANYONE can appreciate poetry. As one who was forced to memorize the sonnets of Shakespeare and the heroic couplets of Chaucer in college, I couldn't get away from those vile, torturous verses fast enough once Iâd served my sentence in a required English Lit class. It was, therefore, with my tongue planted firmly into my cheek that I opened the sample pages of a book called ""Why Poetry Can Save the Planet.""The writing was immediately welcoming and humorous rather than the stuffy and indecipherable babble that I usually associate with poetry. Author Joe Sottile writes warmly and with a sharp wit as he presents his case. He immediately states that this isn't a scholarly perspective on poetry and that he, too, was once among the ""others"" who just didn't ""get"" poetry. I was intrigued.What followed was an entertaining, intelligent, and well-written romp through Sottileâs evolution as a lover of poetry that is inspiring, cute, and just plain fun. It did not surprise me to discover that Mr. Sottile is a teacher as well as a writer. If he had been my teacher, perhaps I wouldn't have spent the past three decades hoping that poetry would suffer the same ride into oblivion as disco and Sea Monkeys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM26UFHVT2JYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4PP386#wasThisHelpful","RM26UFHVT2JYA","A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Daryl Capuano takes a no-nonsense approach to parent participation in the academic success of their teenage boys. Drawing on his experience as the father of his own teen boy, and on his expertise as an academic consultant devoted to helping students achieve their potential, Capuano has devised a practical and groundbreaking plan geared specifically toward teenage boys.As the founder of a company called The Learning Consultants, which focuses on guiding students toward academic success, Capuano noted a disturbing trend with boys in the early 2000s. While it has always been the case that many teenage boys are easily distracted from academics by sports, buddies, girls, and social life, the ratio of calls from concerned parents in regard to their academically unmotivated child was a disproportionate 20 to 1, with boys tipping the heavy side of the scale. This prompted further research, and Capuano was both saddened and alarmed to discover what he believed was the beginning of an epidemic of male underachievement. Not only did he find that high school boys were largely lackadaisical, but the lethargy seemed to be following them onto college campuses. Perhaps the most disturbing statistic of all was his finding that at least one in three men between the ages of 22 and 34 are still living at home with parents!As the parent of my own teenage son, that astonishing statistic hit me like a ton of bricks. While I have no greater desire than for my son to be successful, I also do not wish for him to still be living under my roof when heâs 30! Upon reading that horrifying claim, I immediately closed the sample portion of this book and purchased it. I wanted to see what this guy had to say.Capuano articulately describes the root causes for a lack of motivation in teen males, and the three paths of abundance, struggle, and disaster that lie before them. Most importantly, he utilizes the lionâs share of this book to describe his innovative approach to guiding teen boys toward the desirable path.As we all know, teen boys can be prone to resist parental intervention, but the techniques in this book strive toward guiding your son toward self-motivation so that nagging will be unnecessary. Capuano understands that it is impossible to have no motivation. Rather, unmotivated boys are actually motivated not to perform and to resist parental intervention. These techniques offer a sensible solution to breaking through that barrier or, preferably, to avoid the construction of such a barrier in the first place.Overall, I found Capuanoâs background knowledge of the topic, his sound philosophy, and his practical approach to a complex problem to be educational, inspiring, and original. I intend to employ some of these methods as I open a dialogue with my own son. As parents, we all wish to lead our children toward a path of abundance. Maybe this book can help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RWNQ1RNG7RXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X6UEA4#wasThisHelpful","R1RWNQ1RNG7RXQ","A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QBB1F8P8NAUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That was enough, after the 2 hours of assembly.  I must say, I felt the whole day.  My legs and arms had a great workout.  I had the Amazon Webpage on my computer as I was assembling too.

"As a ""civilian""I really enjoyed Phishing Dark Waters.  I don't have an IT Department to guide and protect me.  If I goof, I'm on my own.As someone who has had to have their computer completely ""wiped""  3 times, I wish I had this book sooner.Hovering is a great tip that I accidentally discovered about 9 months ago.  I've found, if I get an email with a friend's name it can still be  Phishing. I now know the subject line is just as important if it looks suspicious.The authors write in a down to earth, friendly manner that is easy to understand.  I'd recommend Phishing Dark Waters. It's not overly long.

"Kennaway tells the story of her evacuation and return in a breezy tone, as if she's talking to you over a glass of tea. She is good at showing how she felt as a child while also looking back at things from an adult's perspective. I will warn you though: the early part of her book, pre-evacuation, describes a happy childhood in her upper-middle-class English family, but the remaining two-thirds are basically nothing but misery. There was nothing like she would have suffered had she spent the war in England, but the cold, unloving, unfeeling adults in her life made things very unpleasant for her and her sister, and their parents were no better.Susan and her sister Gyll, aged nine and eleven, were evacuated to South Africa to stay with an elderly aunt and her aunt's employers, a family (parents and grandparents) with a daughter Susan's age. Their carers basically didn't want them there and made no secret of it, particularly as months passed and the war continued on and it became obvious that the girls would have to stay a very long time. (They anticipated staying six months. It turned out to be four years.) It wasn't that anyone was outright abusive (mostly) but Susan and Gyll got no love or affection from their hosts, who could barely tolerate them. Gyll was sexually abused by one of the men in the family, and when she finally got the courage to tell, she was blamed for ""seducing"" him. (She was about thirteen at the time. He was a middle-aged man.) Their parents stopped writing them and all they really had was each other, and their friendship with the daughter in the family.I wanted to basically grab every single one of the adults in the story, particularly her parents, and give them a good shake. I mean, what the beep? As I said, the parents stopped writing. And when Susan and Gyll returned to the UK, both their father and mother made it clear that they didn't want them around. In addition to that, for three their parents lied to them and kept an important secret for no good reason other than that they didn't feel like telling them.The book is not as depressing as I make it sound in this review. Although the author, Susan, doesn't sugarcoat the emotional deprivation she suffered, her perspective and the details she has about her relationship with her sister keep the story going. I recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12H72PRVX0KNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408822377#wasThisHelpful","R12H72PRVX0KNH","A10VOEBL5S337W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10VOEBL5S337W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can honestly say that this is one of the best true crime books I've ever read -- top 5, at least -- and at last count I've read 400 of them.The author's meticulously footnoted research has demolished dozens of myths about Chapman, many of them a century old. (Even my beloved Philip Sugden made mistakes when talking about the case in his book ""The Complete History of Jack the Ripper."" It's okay, Mr. Sugden. I forgive you.) Her arguments have convinced me once and for all of the answer to the ""Was he Jack the Ripper?"" question.More to the point, Wojtczak convinces me that Chapman poisonings were a fascinating case of serial murder in their own right. And she supplies a convincing motive, something I'd never been able to make my mind up on until now.I am totally floored by this book, both as true crime and as history. If you are a Jack the Ripper hobbyist, this ought to be required reading. If you just like true crime, especially historical crime, I strongly recommend this book as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PA02BC0HKKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1904109225#wasThisHelpful","R28PA02BC0HKKE","A10VOEBL5S337W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10VOEBL5S337W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lately I've been trying to find books about World War II and the Holocaust from the position of an ""ordinary"" German -- that is, not a member of any of the oppressed groups, not part of any anti-government groups and not stationed high in the Nazi hierarchy. This book, ""The Rape of Berlin,"" was written by such a person: a perfectly ordinary German gentile who lost her husband and her brother to the Soviets. Her brother was literally lost: he disappeared in the Battle of Stalingrad and at the time of writing, Slater still didn't know what had become of him. Her online obituary (she died just a few months ago, age 93) says she finally found out his fate in 2012, nearly seventy years after the fact. He had died of war wounds in early 1943.I don't think the book was very well-written. Slater didn't describe the personalities of any of the characters, or even name them: they're just ""my sister,"" ""my husband,"" ""my aunt,"" etc. If she wanted to protect their privacy she should have just used made-up names for them. The book is just a dry recitation of the facts, with no details. For instance, she didn't say how and when and under what circumstances she met her husband, or what their courtship was like, or describe her reaction after he, too, disappeared shortly after the war. (Per the aforementioned obituary, he predeceased her, but it doesn't say that in the book and I wonder if she knew this or not at the time of writing. This is another example of the lack of detail: no information about her search for him or speculation as to what had happened to him.)The author's animosity towards the Soviets is totally understandable: they conquered Germany, trashed Berlin, raped and pillaged and plundered, and they took her brother and her husband from her. (She claimed she didn't get raped, but only because she was heavily pregnant.) However, her statements about the Nazi atrocities are pretty hard to swallow, especially given that the book was published in 1971 and she had been living in America for fifteen years by then. She said she had nothing against Jews, and neither did anyone else she knew, and she had thought concentration camps were just secure prisons for criminals, and she had no idea that Jews were being killed, and that she was ""almost certain,"" even now, that Hitler did not authorize the genocide.I don't know if she was delusional, defensive or simply lying.I don't have a whole lot else to say about this book except I don't think it has any value, on either the literary side or the historical side.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXM4DAIWA9C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0818103000#wasThisHelpful","R2FXM4DAIWA9C1","A10VOEBL5S337W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10VOEBL5S337W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure what to expect but this turned out to be a fascinating book. Redjeb Jordania (still alive as of summer 2013 and now living in America) is the son of the first democratically elected president of the Republic of Georgia, Noe Jordania, who was forced into exile after the Soviets annexed Georgia three years into his administration. He lived the rest of his life in Paris with his family and never returned to Georgia.This book is an account of Noe's origins, a memoir about Redjeb's own childhood in Paris, and then an account of his visit to Georgia in 1990; it was the first time a member of the family had set foot in the country since 1921. Coincidentally, Redjeb arrived in Georgia just at the same time the Soviet Union started to fall apart, and he has a day-by-day account of the political events, how they were affecting Georgia, and his opinions on it all.The biography of Noe is written in the first person and I thought at first that it was Redjeb writing about himself. I remember, as it described childhood in a Georgian village, thinking ""Wait, I thought he was born in Paris; maybe I misunderstood."" Then at some point it was like, ""In 1882..."" and I realized this was Noe's story, as told by his son. Noe had the sort of beginnings you would expect from a future revolutionary: born into poverty and ignorance, with great intelligence and in need of more education than his village could provide, going off to a seminary in Tbilisi, reading forbidden subversive literature, etc. Stalin also came from Georgia and experienced many of the same things as Noe; later, they became bitter enemies.Noe sounds like he was an awesome person, although of course, it IS his son writing here. I learned a lot about Georgia from this book; I had known almost nothing before. And this book was not only informative but a pleasure to read. The time spent reading it was well worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UCN16WPZGJ4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466473258#wasThisHelpful","R2UCN16WPZGJ4G","A10VOEBL5S337W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10VOEBL5S337W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The English-language reader rarely reads about World War II from the German point of view, so this was a rarely-seen window into what life was like for the Wehrmacht. I was struck by two things: one being that Pruller was such an ardent Nazi and never changed his opinions even when defeat was staring him in the face, and two being that, Nazi-ness aside, he sounded like any other soldier. As the book's afterword pointed out, he could have been American or Soviet or French or whatever nationality you chose, and he would have sounded just the same.I'm not sure how well this book stands as a historical document and I certainly can't recommend it for pleasure.

"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it was nothing if not thorough, full of thousands of tales of human decency and tender courage in the face of death. I believe people have a duty to remember the heroes of history, and the Righteous Gentiles were certainly heroes. There are so many inspirational and touching tales in here.On the other hand, though...I was kind of disappointed by the book too. Martin Gilbert is an internationally recognized historian, and I've been impressed by other books of his I've read. His analyses are spot-on.But this book HAD no analyses. There was no attempt to interpret the stories, to try to explain why the Righteous acted as they did and so many others didn't. Neither did Gilbert compare and contrast the Righteous Gentiles in different countries, although each country does have its own section.Instead of that, it's just story after story after heroic story. Almost like a list: ""Such-and-such family got saved by these guys, who hid them in a shed. And this guy was saved by this person, and in the same town, So-and-so saved fifteen Jews..."" I confess the stories rapidly began to run together and I struggled to finish the book.For what it's worth, I probably couldn't have done any better. After all, the stories ARE basically the same: someone, at great personal risk, does the right thing and saves lives. I don't know how to provide a comprehensive history of Righteous Gentiles without being repetitive. I just wish it didn't have to be like that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZL8AFSMFT3FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805062610#wasThisHelpful","RZL8AFSMFT3FL","A10VOEBL5S337W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10VOEBL5S337W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a kind of different Holocaust memoir. Many Jewish people who were rescued by Gentiles during World War II depict their rescuers as wonderful, saintly people. And in most cases they're correct; I mean, the rescuers were risking more than just their lives to save people that in some cases they didn't even know. It takes a special kind of moral courage to do something like that, and until you're in that situation yourself you never know whether or not you have it. I hope I would have had what it took to rescue a Jew during the Holocaust, but I'll never know for sure.Miriam Winter was an eight-year-old child in Poland when her parents managed to smuggle her out of the ghetto. A Jewish woman named Cesia, who was twenty and could pass for a Gentile, agreed to take her when she herself left the ghetto. But Cesia really didn't know what to do with Miriam afterwards; she wasn't in a position to keep her, and Miriam looked very Jewish. Fortunately they sort of randomly met a woman named Maryla on the train, and after hearing Cesia's made-up story about how Miriam was her sister's child whom she'd gotten stuck with, Maryla said she'd take care of her.Maryla, who was from Lwow and made a living smuggling black-market items, took Miriam knowing she was Jewish. She risked her life by doing so, and she inconvenienced herself a great deal. She left Miriam in the care of others for months of a time, but ultimately her Jewishness would always be discovered and Maryla would have to find a new place for her. Miriam wasn't well-treated by the people she stayed with, and Maryla never showed her any affection.After Lwow was liberated, Maryla wouldn't let Miriam attend school and made he work instead, at first selling black-market goods. After Maryla got married, she and her husband operated a store and Miriam had to work there. She was beaten and called a ""filthy Jew"" if she did anything wrong, and Maryla showed more affection to her dog. Some people tasked with finding Jewish war orphans visited the house, and Maryla told Miriam, ""After everything I did for you, you will betray me like the Christ-killers betrayed Christ. Don't go with them."" So Miriam stayed, until Maryla's husband's sister came to help at the store and they didn't need her work anymore. Then she left. She was fifteen.Much later, though, Miriam thought kindly of her guardian: ""Harsh, even austere toward me, Maryla didn't spare herself either...once she took me she courageously cared for me; she risked her life for me, and she didn't give me up."" Miriam was the only survivor of her family. She eventually told Yad Vashem about her rescuer and in 1994, Maryla was honored as Righteous Among the Nations.Anyway...this isn't so much a review as a plot summary I guess. This book is a different perspective on things, showing another side to the rescuers. And the ambivalent relationship the rescuer and the rescued can have with one another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2HSBNB0ML19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0966016203#wasThisHelpful","RT2HSBNB0ML19","A10VOEBL5S337W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10VOEBL5S337W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Much of this book is set in Kazakhstan in Central Asia. The sixteen-year-old protagonist, Alexi, and his little brother Misha are part of a gang of youths who eke out a living for themselves by salvaging Russian missiles and rockets and selling the parts on the black market. They don't make much and it's very dangerous work; Alexi's gang tangles with a rival gang, with violent consequences.Misha has been having seizures, which are becoming worse and more frequent. The local doctors suspect a brain tumor, but they can do nothing for him and advise Alexi to take him across the country to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, for treatment. The boys save up enough money and set off for Almaty, but wind up in Moscow instead. There they encounter further difficulties and things just go downhill from there.This book is really interesting and shows a whole different way of life to western readers. There are some quite thrilling scenes, and good story progression. I don't think the book was perfect; there was one subplot in particular that seemed pointless and I wondered why it had been included. But on the whole I'd give the book a solid A-minus.

"The author spent two years teaching English composition at a mission school in eastern Bhutan in the 1980s. Bhutan is a primitive place now; it was even less developed back then. The school was dilapidated, the bureaucracy cumbersome, the principal a tyrant, and the standards of instruction antiquated, mostly rote memorization. Haigh's residence was besieged by rats and other vermin, he came down with dysentery, and he was nearly killed in a bus accident on the mountain roads. But he fell in love with Bhutan and its people nonetheless.Haigh does not romanticize Bhutan and he notes the poverty, unemployment, alcoholism, disease and other problems he observed there. But his great affection for the country is evident in his delightful descriptions of the polite, kind, generous people he encountered everywhere and the beautiful landscape and the ""villages strung along the river like pearls on a thread of silver.""Illustrated with black-and-white photographs, this book is sure to please anyone interested in Bhutan or travel narratives in general.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGRMWXASI3O7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0888644922#wasThisHelpful","RGRMWXASI3O7F","A10VOEBL5S337W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10VOEBL5S337W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seeing as how this is a book about wallpaper, it's probably about as interesting as it could possibly be. Which is to say: to me, not very, but students of art history and perhaps architectural history would probably be fascinated by it. The author, himself a former paperhanger, is enthusiastic about his subject and researched it quite thoroughly. He's also capable of some charming turns of phrase.Now, if only he had ventured into the 19th century, the really sordid days in wallpaper history, when Paris Green sickened people by the hundreds...

"It's best to just read nothing about this novella. It is a VERY brisk read since you really can't put it down once you begin. Tessier is a master at creating mood and that sense that something just isn't ""right"" and he creates it in spades here.The first 100 pages are a great mystery...and the last 50 are a great horror.People have posted they don't ""get"" Tessier's stories or they end too suddenly, but everything you need to know is in the story and sometimes answers don't come easy. His novels and stories are to mull over for a bit beforeposting a review.And this novella is one you won't easily get out of your mind and probably one you will read again to see just how he did it.Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNTCLFQ7KRIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931081123#wasThisHelpful","R1NNTCLFQ7KRIK","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Saw an ad for this is in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY and it looked like a fast-paced thriller but it is so convoluted with too many characters, red herrings and go-nowhere scenes. At 536 pages, it collapses under its own weight by page 200. And you still have more than 300 pages to go. The last 100 pages are simply people being killed and the ""reveal"" of the killer is just silly.It was 300 pages, it might have made for a fast-paced, implausible thriller.

"Many have already posted that this book--at 600 pages--is probably 200 pages too long, and I'd have to agree, but even at this length, it was always a joy to return to and now that I've finished it, I sort of miss the characters.The most vibrant was Rusty--you never knew how he was going to turn out and his ultimate redemption is truly heartbreaking. Golden, the father, was perhaps too passive to carry the weight of the story (which is probably why it takes 600 pages to tell his story) but he is eventually able to enfold everyone into his arms.I'm glad the author didn't try to sketch in the details of all the children because that would have been overload, but he smartly gives us just enough about them to understand the challenge they are.Really impressed with the story, the conflicts, the resolutions and the wonderfully ""real"" and honest ending.Highly recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AY5T2T9BTC8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZ9DTKY#wasThisHelpful","R1AY5T2T9BTC8E","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not sure why this was 2 volumes since it is so repetitive!It's as if each chapter is a self-contained article, but when read as a book, the same information is repeated over and over.Several factual errors and misspellings. Oden Fong's name is misspelled in earlier chapters and corrected later and he is a pioneer of the Jesus Movement. Glenn Schwartz of The All Saved Freak Band spells his first name with 2 n's, and the song is ""Peace Love and Rock and Roll"" (not ""Love Peace and Rock and Roll). These are all factual errors that could have been checked.Nothing at all of significance is written about Paul Clark, DeGarmo & Key, Resurrection Band--but we get pages of repetition as mentioned above that could have been easily edited down.And finally, oddly enough, only a very small handful of photographs from the author who is a photojournalist.Extensive editing and fact checking would have made this a great resource; but due to the price and poor editing, it's merely ""good.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X0RMGB0V35C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0313377707#wasThisHelpful","R1X0RMGB0V35C3","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well written but at 300 pages, it seemed overly long. Once the premise is set up, we basically read about the reaction from several different character's viewpoints.And then we do it again.And then we do it again.And so on and on and on.By page 150, I was growing impatient because nothing was really happening; just the characters talking over their issues and viewpoints.At 100 pages--a novella--I think it would have made for a compelling read. But it's basically a fascinating premise that is s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d to 300 pages.

"Over the weekend I read a galley of ME AND THE DEVIL.This book reminded me of Michael Faber's UNDER THE SKIN and Katherine Dunn's GEEK LOVE and some of Thomas Tessier's work--dark stuff that you really can't get out of your head once you've read it.Had a couple dinners, and people asked what they always ask me, ""What are you reading?"" and for the first time, I said, ""I have no idea. It's a book that mentions Bela Lugosi, the Desert Fathers and Norman Rockwell. This guy dates an odd assortment of women and I think he wants to kill them and he believes he's becoming a God and getting healthier even as he's losing his mind...""You know when you're getting sick and you're not aware of it, but gradually things just don't feel right?

"A big fan of this series (my name even gets a fan credit in #1!), I thought the trailer for PA4 was awful. And the ""viral campaign"" never took off like it did for #2 and #3. It was as if even those involved simply weren't very committed/interested in the film they were making.The reviews were ALL tepid--even those that sort of praised it--and word of mouth was dismal. The ""actual people watching the film"" TV ad was so over-the-top, it became a joke.And then the film itself was a mess. Why have the wink-wink ""in jokes"" of the kid riding the bike like THE SHINING? It takes us ""out"" of the movie we're watching...and ads zero to the film. Same with the firstfake"" drag scene of the girl. Again, why remind us that we're watching a movie, why take us out of the experience?And NOTHING happens for so long into this movie, it's just people talking and talking and talking. The few little scares are already shown in the trailer, which they have done before...but those are the ONLY scares! So we are not surprised.And it's clear that the writers/directors had no real ideas of what Toby was to do this time. In other words, WHY does he levitate the girl? If the goal is to kill everyone, that just do it. The levitation scene is simply to impress US, the viewers. But we've seen that before, in a dozen films...and in the trailer! So there is no shock or surprise. And why bounce the ball down the stairs? And why is there scene after scene in the dark with the xBox? Toby is ""better"" than moving some dots around but they feature that xBox feature into the ground.Finally, the ending (no spoiler, if you've seen PA3)...is the SAME ending as PA3. We learn nothing. In fact, you can remove PA4 and you've learned NOTHING. When PA5 comes out, hopefully the filmmakers have learned from the dismal box office, word of mouth and reviews for PA4 to PUT THE SCARES BACK IN. And have a REASON for the film.All the above being said, I WILL buy PA4 and here's why: I wasn't that impressed with PA3 in the theater but the extra footage--not much, just a few scenes of Toby messing with the girls more--made for a MUCH more ""sinister"" film. Not sure why they were cut from the film, but they really add to PA3. Same with PA2--and maybe these movies are just better seen at home.So, here's hoping that PA5 will really deliver. They know what a mess PA4 was, so let's hope they have learned their lessons.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUTQ2FJ0204K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMALLM#wasThisHelpful","R2FUTQ2FJ0204K","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's an ""exhaustive"" hunt for he facts that some readers may be ""exhausted"" reading it.

"Wasn't really sure what to expect since I'm such a fan and sometimes these books can be a bit laborious to get through but this was really effortless, almost like a novel.Carole grew up during my favorite period, the 40s and 50s, and she has got a brilliant memory since she's able to recount early life episodes that later impacted her music and worldview. Her parent's love of music and listening to the Hit Parade of that time explained much about Carole's approach to music. Usually I skim these parts, but this was really compelling.The first 200 pages focus on Carole's youth and her first breakthroughs into writing songs, and I loved it all since she mentioned so many of the artists I know and love.The second 200 pages really dig deep into Carole's personal life and shifts the focus from her music. She actually says little about Tapestry---only gives the back story to two songs (""So Far Away"" and ""Beautiful) and then she only casually mentions that she went on to record six more albums (1971-1977), says they sold well, but doesn't provide any details. These albums all went gold and are generally considered among her best work. I would have loved to read more about those 1971-1977 albums.Her encounters with John and Yoko in NYC and Paul and Linda McCartney in Japan are brilliantly recounted and emotionally told, as are her interactions with U2, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Elvis Costello and Chrissie Hynde.Her marriages and relationships are the focus of the book, and she literally lives off the grid for several years.

The best part is the opening when he writes about his childhood.Once the drugs begin, it begins to sag a bit since there are only so many times you can write about the friends (?) you score drugs with and the friends you fight with and get high with.And he bottoms out...and then bottoms out again...and then bottoms out again and again...but it's not until he REALLY bottoms out that the ""character"" really comes alive.The last 50 pages are remarkable, like clarity, and his awareness of his own life and where he was headed is sobering and also joyous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7PI3NUDMB35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446584266#wasThisHelpful","R1A7PI3NUDMB35","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Instead of telling a basically simple ""A to Z"" story--circus ringmaster gets saved, sees the inside of 1980s TV evangelism, is disillusioned and leaves--we get this terribly organized, dull and repetitive book.Characters appear and the author immediately knows if they are ""good or bad"" and then they vanish for 50 pages. We are bored with the slow, dull break-up of his marriage. Instead of telling us in a few paragraphs what wasn't working, we get CHAPTERS that have NOTHING to do with the main story. And there is a first marriage and child that is never really mentioned--along with ""something"" about being investigated by the FBI for information about Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe's death. (???) This is mentioned 3 or 4 times, but it is so poorly written, it's impossible to tell if it really happened or if the author is just paranoid.I think he's paranoid, because ""all at once"" every church he spoke at suddenly turns on him while at the same time, he's appearing regularly on the ""PTL Show"" with the Bakkers--and hobnobbing with the rich and famous. So the timeline is messed up or his recollections are.Then, after the divorce (his second), he moves in with family in NJ and signs over his money to them (?) and is married and divorced again--but this happens over a space of 2 pages and is so vague, it's not clear what really happened.And names are dropped right and left and it seems that every single man is gay and has made a pass at the author (who also says he was accosted by men throughout his youth and also whenever he'd go to the movies) or every single woman made a pass at him. And every pastor was having an affair with a man or a woman. And this happens over and over and over and over and over...So there's 316 densely worded pages of this. When I finished it, it's clear the author is a latent homosexual---he lovingly describes the men as ""handsome...well-built...attractive..."" and so forth, and then gets outraged--OUTRAGED!--when they are gay!His anger/envy the ""successful Christians"" in the book also wears thin after a while--as his own life falls apart, he becomes bitter and hateful of pretty much everyone he has ever come in contact with.Yet...he keeps seeing them, appearing on their TV shows. So, in the end, he has become just like them!And it turns out that a ""diary"" that was proof of why the FBI was after the author all these years...well, it ""disappeared"" but the FBI agent told the author that it really was ""the church"" that was tipping off the FBI to ""keep an eye on"" the ringmaster.If this was written as a novel, it would make for a read. As nonfiction, it's skimmable--and skipable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L08P3BB8FNXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879755075#wasThisHelpful","R3L08P3BB8FNXN","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A few odd things about this book.First of all, the main character, Liam, is only 61 years old, but he acts like he is 80 and seem so out of touch with ""life"" that he's probably one of the weakest characters Tyler's ever created. There's really ""nothing there"" -- he has no emotion, no sense of self and so we care little about him.He has 3 daughters, one of which is an angry religious fundamentalist. And for no reason, other then the one scene where her son has a coloring book.The title refers to a scene with Liam and his grandson who is coloring a Bible coloring book of Noah's ark. ""Noah's compass"" is an observation the main character gives when the grandson asks how Noah directed the ark. There was no sail, etc--Noah's ""compass"" were the waves that moved the ark around. Like Liam, he is an ark that it tossed about by the waves of life.In addition to the daughters, he has an ex-wife (he is also a widow) and each of the characters literally come and go into his life/this story. And for no reason whatsoever.The premise of the book--which is dropped for some reason--is that Liam goes to sleep in bed and wakes up in a hospital. At some point, a burgler broke into his home and Laim was beaten unconscious. And he can't remember what happened.And no one seems to really care about his loss of memory--also, it symbolizes his loss of a memorable life. But about half way through, this whole theme is dropped--like it never happens.Liam begins a half-hearted, painfully dull romance with a woman that goes no where. His daughters and ex-wife reappear. One friend comes to dinner.Things fall apart with some of these relationships. He visits his father and stepmother.And then the book is over. It's just painfully void of a ""point"" because Liam never changes--never grows--and a novel is about conflict and growth and it simply doesn't happen here.Tyler's last book, the dreadful DIGGING TO AMERICA, started out with some real ""energy"" in the writing and characters, but lost steam early on and I ended up skimming the last 200 pages.NOAH is an ""easy"" read but it's pointless. Not sure why she wrote this since characters are her strength.Like the title, this book simply bobs along, going nowhere, until it ends.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2191V225XN3CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307272400#wasThisHelpful","R2191V225XN3CP","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just a warning to avoid the Warner Archive, or at least manage your expectations.It's a dreadful copy---dark, grainy and loaded with scratches.I had copied a video to DVD years ago and wanted to ""upgrade"" since my new BluRay tends to make video-to-DVD transfers a little ""watery"" -- and the transfer was never that great to begin with.But I was really disappointed with this version. Because it takes place a lot in the dark or in shadows, it looks very ""blotchy"" and the blues all ""swarm together"" in a muddy mess.If you have BluRay, you can see it attempting to ""upgrade"" so much of the original film has a cleaner video quality. But even the outdoor, sunlite scenes are terribly grainy around the edges.The sound is fine but overall, a real disappointment. I know they didn't even ""try"" to clean up the film, but it looks so piss-poor you think that someone would have noticed and made and attempt to upgrade it a little.And for those of us who remember it fondly as kids, it simply doesn't hold up at ALL when you see it as an adult, so it's best to skip and just hang on to your memories.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EA43H0W380PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WJHBD6#wasThisHelpful","R3EA43H0W380PA","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This slim (118 pages), well-illustrated books tells you everything you may ever want to know about the silent/sound Danish film director Benjamin Christensen, who acted in and/or directed about 20 films between 1912-1942.He is best remembered for his 1922 film HAXAN (The Witch or Witchcraft Through The Ages) and this well-researched book includes interviews with those involved in the film, which is really amazing when you think how old and in some ways, obscure the film is.The first 25 pages of the book focus on the early, pre-HAXAN years of the director/actor, while about 40 pages are devoted solely to the writing and production and casting/directing of HAXAN. The remaining 50 pages deal with the few films he made after HAXAN, his ""invisible years"" and the ""return"" of HAXAN during film festivals in the 1960s-1990s.Author Jack Stevenson is to be commended for the time and attention to detail he paid for this classic film, and for digging up every photo and antidote about this film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9C4AT125PJDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1903254426#wasThisHelpful","R9C4AT125PJDQ","A2SODFKGQ1UPZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SODFKGQ1UPZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It starts off well enough and keeps you enaged, for about the first 150 pages.But like most of King's books (and he's ""done this"" before with NEEDFUL THINGS, THE MIST, TOMMYKNOCKERS, CELL, THE STAND, etc), he has wonderful ideas, but (like his short stories) they are just wonderfully crazy ""ideas"" that really have nowhere to go.""What if a big dome sealed off a town of people? The good and bad would eventually come out of the folks, and I'll need to explain what made the dome appear.""Usually, his characters carry the weight but this time, they are all pretty paper thin and if you've read a lot of King before, you'll think, ""Hey, he/she reminds me a LOT of the good/bad guy/girl from NOVEL X.""That's the problem with UNDER THE DOME -- we've all been there with King one too many times, so we already know that there will be one or two crazies, that the dead will talk to these crazy people a few times, there will be a lot of political / religious undertones, and he will fumble the climax, as he always does.The main problem--as we all already know--is that this book is simply too long. After the first 150 pages set up the problem/characters...well, we start looking for a solution to the problem or a way out. Instead, we have more than 600 pages (!) to read through until we get to the climax. And those 600 pages are sadly VERY skimmable. Nothing of importance really happens. Because we don't really ""care"" about these characters, we're never invested in what they are attempting to do...and it all takes pages, and pages (etc!) for anything to happen.And when the ""hero"" is taken off the main stage for 400 pages, the story grinds to a halt.So plan on a LOT of skimming.By the time you hit page 900, you'll STILL have 172 pages for the thing to END! And when it ends, you're not left with a satisfying feeling -- more like wondering what to do with the 1072 page book now? You're certainly not going to recommend it to a friend, so please consider donating it to your public library or selling it here on Amazon.(SPOILER FOLLOWS)What I DID like--other than the first 150 page set up--was the ""revelation"" that children aliens were merely playing with us like we torture little bugs. THAT was unique and interesting, but it could have been told in 500 pages. This dome was too big for King, although he frantically pulled out every trick from his huge bag.

"Because much of this movie is about sound--noises you hear at night, etc--a GREAT sound system is really needed.Also, during the ""night scenes,"" a low-grade rumble was added to the soundtrack and it adds a LOT to the experience.

"Space opera - what do you think when you hear that term? I think of a larger-than-life saga of stories in space, set against a larger backdrop of a universe filled with possibility. This anthology is filled with stories like this, with a breadth and depth of imagination from some of the most formidable storytellers in independent publishing today. With more focused tales of one person in a larger universe to warring factions battling for supremacy to the survival of the human race, there are various stories here of all types for everyone to enjoy. Featuring an introduction by Julie Czerneda discussing our collective intrigue with the danger of the unknown hiding in the deep, dark beauty of space, travel into the depths of the dark with eleven great stories:Susan Kaye Quinn's ""Containment"" - When the Mining Master of Thebe discovers a mysterious but deliberately stacked collection of rocks on Jovian, this artificial intelligence is strangely intrigued, testing to find out where it might have come from and forming some theories. But this mysterious stack presents a larger mystery for her, one that takes her on a journey she never expected. A thrill ride of discovery and identity leading to a fantastic ending, this one will keep you enraptured with its twists.Annie Bellet's ""Nos Morituri Te Salutamus"" - Commander Ilvic is on a high priority mission, penetrating deep into enemy territory onto a planet controlled by the Spidren, who they're at war with. Ilvic and her handpicked team must recover the flight data recorder of a crashed ship, holding intelligence crucial to the war effort that could turn the tide of the war they are badly losing. But will they succeed in their objective and make it out alive? Moving at a breakneck pace, the tension remains high, demonstrating an excellent portrayal of military tactics along with how much one is willing to sacrifice for the greater good.Theresa Kay's ""Protocol A235"" - Beth is a maintenance technician mission on a ship traveling through deep space to find a habitable planet for the last remnants of Earth, who are sleeping dormant aboard her ship. Woken to work her shift, her relief crewmember is supposed to hand off the mission to her before he goes into cryosleep, but she slowly finds out he's nowhere to be found. As she determines what's really happening, she's learns something she was never prepared for. A creepy and very enjoyable story that deftly unspools all its clues, beckoning the reader and leading into a shocker of an ending.Elle Casey's ""Winner Take All"" - Langlade is an independent trader who captains his ship and motley crew, docking at a space station on the edge of the galaxy where lawlessness is rampant. Looking for trouble, he finds a high stakes game of givit and finds out something unusual is at stake and who is offering the winnings, he decides he's all in. But will he get what he wants? And who is this fascinating young lass offering the prize? A fun story with witty repartee and some unpredictable twists and turns as one man tries to win something he's desperate for.Jennifer Foehner Wells' ""Carindi"" - El'Pio is a member of an aquatic species living in specially created water spaces on a city-sized ship.  When all the air-breathing species die of a plague, she's the only one left, alone on the ship with no way to escape her confinement in order to change the ships trajectory. Since the ship is orbiting a star going nova in 13-14 years, she's desperate for a glimmer of hope until she finds a small child, Carindi, protected from the plague. Together, they try to figure out a solution before it's too late. Rich in character, you feel strongly for them as they grow older and form familial bonds, dealing with a complex problem in intriguing ways.Patrice Fitzgerald's ""Animal Planet"" - Jane is a 72 year-old who goes on one last adventure, exploring an unknown planet in deep space. In the meantime, two people guarding Fort Gamma on that planet, discover a video recorder attached to an Animal, which are native to the planet, scared of the rumors that they eat humans. After tranquilizing it, they review the footage and discover something startling and unusual. What happens next is a serious story with charming characters and clever humor mixed in, developing into a beguiling mystery. When all of these engaging pieces finally come together, it all makes perfect sense and the outcome is delicious.Autumn Kalquist's ""The Event"" - Zenith is the observer, forced to know the lives of all one-thousand members of humanity, merging with their memories. But who are these mysterious people Zenith cannot avoid contact with? Rebelling against the advice she's being given, Zenith realizes she needs to stop mentally torturing herself with this because she knows what fate holds for these thousand people due to The Event. This compelling mystery behind what is going on here is fascinating and the resolution is surprising. Even more so, it is eerily spooky, slowly doling answers until you know the whole ghastly truth.Sara Reine's ""Dragonet"" - Aja and her co-pilot Emalkay are flying their Carriage fighter ship against alien space dragons, stuck in a perpetual war with them. While trying to infiltrate the dragon's home planet, the enemy attacks them, even though intelligence said they would not be present. Forced to take drastic measures and realizing the odds are against her, she embarks on a desperate gambit to survive. What she discovers afterwards, she never would have foreseen. Thrilling, enigmatic and hopeful, we are caught up in this battle that could win the war for the humans once and for all.Ann Christy's ""Lulu Ad Infinitum"" - Lulu is in an emergency escape pod, trying to figure out what the hell happened to her and her ship. Designed to be modular and self-repairing over time, the ship only has human clones aboard, loaded with all memories of their prior life intact. When you're the only one on board and everyone else is now lost, how are you supposed to prepare planets for colonization? As Lulu faces harsh realities, she's forced to come up with innovative and ingenious solutions so she can survive and accomplish her mission. We are swept into this engaging and delightful story, absorbed by Lulu's complicated dilemma, which is boldly imagined, culminating into a witty and fitting conclusion.Blair C. Babylon's ""To Catch an Actor"" - Cordelia is a police officer on a space station in her thirties questioning an actor about a murder he might have committed one-hundred years ago (!), prior to his going out on tour in space. On the space station, she questions him about the murder repeatedly but he's using his deep repertoire of acting skills to pawn the interrogation off as nothing and distract her. A very enjoyable psychological tête-Ã -tÃªte between them with many unexpected revelations, leading to a jaw-dropping finale that made me smile in its inventiveness.Rysa Walker's ""2092"" - Mila is a proctor for the Elisi Alliance, which is on the losing end of an ongoing war with the Lor. Desperate for an edge, they look for new planets in the hope of gaining allies and maybe even an advantage. When Mila finds planet XE7 is exhibiting unusual readings, she is sent to investigate, hoping she will recover something she once thought lost. But what she finds is more she ever imagined, as they possess something that might turn the tide of the war! And what does all of this have to do with time travel?! With strongly motivated characters, an engaging, innovative story and a surprising ending, this is a delightful, wonderful climax to the anthology.Each story features a great Q & A with each author about the origins of their story in this anthology as well as who they are and their careers to date. This is a great way for us as readers to appreciate the story as well as showcasing each individual author. This also allows us to see how these stories sometimes connect to a universe written by these authors in their own fiction. But each story is standalone, requiring no knowledge of the other stories in order to understand them.Ultimately, this anthology is filled with visionary and original space opera stories. Each one is a grand adventure into the unknown by some talented authors and edited by David Gatewood, who has edited other anthologies I have enjoyed. After reading this book, take the time and see what other stories these authors have written and I think you will enjoy what you find. I was actually drawn to this anthology based on the strength of these authors whose works I have read previously. But if you haven't already tried some of their stories, this book provides a great opportunity to read a fine assembly of female authorial talent in one spectacular anthology that you can discover right here on Earth and not hiding in deep space. =)Please note that I was given an Advanced Readers Copy of this eBook.

"Khang was once a zombie doomed to live a life not in control of himself. When he receives a cure, reality comes crashing in and he slowly starts to remember all the disturbing things he did before and during the time he was a zombie. As Khang is trying to recover physically and emotionally from his own private horrors, he witnesses many others trying to do the same and eventually realizes what he must do next with his new lease on life. This is a grueling and haunting portrait of someone coming to the understanding that the cure might not be universally loved and wanted by all who receive it, setting up an intense confrontation with his saviors and a stirring and courageous finale.

"Sandis is a medical student on an alien world in a universe where Earth has recently been brought into a galaxy spanning collective organization. Sandis asks her professor about the Earth legends about zombies and is led into doing some interesting historical research. What she finds is a comprehensive history spanning eons, where a powerful alien hive-mind controls zombie-like drones and uses them as pawns in the rise and fall of various empires. I thought this was an excellent, well-developed cultural exploration of two of the galaxies dominating cultures as they battle for supremacy over the course of their war-torn history.

"Mel, a soldier in the US Army stationed in Iran, tries to stop a missile strike on a city that inadvertently was going to cause many civilian casualties. But she is also a flying superhero, covertly working to help others while maintaining her military identity. She recounts the story to her significant other of how she was trying to prevent death but sadly, finds she might not measure up. A story that is simultaneously visceral with a you-are-there perspective and suspenseful making you wonder whether she can successfully fulfill her duty to right a really bad wrong. It's also ponderous as Mel explores the emotional contradiction of how she feels she can always do more to help others but can never do enough, scrutinizing the thin line between good and evil and how their definitions aren't always clear cut.I originally read this short story when it was published in The Powers That Be: A Superhero Collection, an anthology filled with many more great superhero stories just like this one. =)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LB6ZJEI1EMG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LZ0ZAW#wasThisHelpful","R3LB6ZJEI1EMG4","A39A9EQ2PAWET2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39A9EQ2PAWET2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Starting out as a story of three women complaining about their mates and the connections they have with them, Hazel has major issues with hers in that he seems to be a little too needy. These companions are custom-made, highly-programmable human simulacra and overall, are supposed to be the ultimate mate, the yin to your yang. At least, that how Perfect Partners, or PePr, Inc. created and designed them to be. As the story continues, there is a subtle but sly shift that becomes seismic in its significance when you realize how it affects the entirety of the story and the way you read it. A truly excellent twist with a perfect solution that effectively solves Hazel's relationship problems. A highly entertaining narrative that made me appreciate the smart and dexterous way it was written.I read this short story when it was originally published in The Robot Chronicles (The Future Chronicles), an anthology filled with many more excellent robot stories just like this one.

"Ethan is a writer, an older man who lives by himself. He decides to get a Perfect Partner (PePr) named Edna, a robot with sophisticated programming that is meant to be the yin to his yang, fulfilling its owner's every need. At first, he's not quite sure what to make of Edna, keeping her at a distance. But as the days turn to months turn to years together, she becomes less of a PePr and more like a person to him, deepening their friendship.  But when Edna talks to him about his stories as he writes them, helping him to parse them out, she assists him in giving the stories more depth and humanity. As their process evolves, she transforms from a companion and caretaker into his partner, improving his stories and imbuing them with life.As Ethan grows older, one story, ""Star Surfer"", becomes his breakout success. Of course, his publisher demands more. As he writes more stories in this universe, there's one character named Lulu, whose story remains untold, waiting for the two of them to tell it. Will Lulu's story ever be written and shared with readers?How this fictional character becomes significant to their relationship is only one of the many joys waiting to be found in this story. This novella also explores how PePr's are integrated into society and their struggle to be classified as human beings and accorded the same legal status. Plus, we get to meet an adorable beagle, Charlie, who plays an important role in their lives. All of these stories interconnect in surprising and memorable ways as we watch them make a life together as they grow old.Through these special relationships, the author taps into primal, deep emotions with her prose, which really engages you in a profound way. She has a special way of articulating her words so much so that it taps into the human experience and captures it with such beautiful clarity. And she not only illustrates this through Ethan, but through Edna, a non-human character, as well. It all culminates into an ending that is engrossing, fitting and heartbreaking.I found this to be a delightful novella that uses robots as a prism for thoughtfully examining the human condition while also expanding its definition. The relationships here are delightfully detailed and wondrously moving, pulling you into the story as you explore how two people (and a beagle) create a family together. I found this to be one of the best stories the author has written to date and a genuine pleasure to read.If you enjoyed this short story, the author also wrote a short story taking place in this same universe called PePr, Inc.

Now, take that idea and apply it to the most important pivot points in history, where something changes so drastically, the world is severely impacted by its tremendous ramifications. This anthology speculates on those âwhat if?â moments and amplifies them in intriguing, surprising and entertaining ways.

In this role, sheâs forever marked, burdened to wear the special raiment of her select station. As she gets older, she starts to see this as a curse, feeling imprisoned and wanting to escape. As her dissatisfaction grows, she is given an opportunity to travel to England when her father is chosen to put the Queen of England, Anne Boleyn, to death. How the story plays out, from its first person perspective to its lush description truly immerses you in Pieretteâs life, especially the pain she feels due to societal constrictions. The story concludes with some shocks and amazing twists, leading to a fitting yet unexpected ending.Ann Christyâs âUnnaturalâ â in September 1978, Pope John Paul gets ready to give a sermon endorsing and changing the way the world looks at in-vitro fertilization. Fast forward two hundred years later, we meet Eldora, whoâs talking to her mother about the possibilities of a natural childbirth, defying societal norms where childbirth is done in test tubes by the majority of the world, making sure there are no aberrations. We learn about how far Eldora and her husband will do for love and whatever it takes to have children the way they want to. I sincerely felt the Pope's weariness and Eldora's hopefulness that her mother will understand and accept her decision. Overall, this is a very powerful, emotional and engrossing story boldly imagined where the characters personal motivations are vividly described and cogently argued as you find yourself agreeing with Eldoraâs statements and actions.Nicolas Wilsonâs âOld Ventures, New Partnersâ â Ian is an MI6 spy in East Germany, 1963, who gains information about how the Soviets are going to assassinate JFK, which is a feint for their true objective.

Deemed unfit to marry off, her mother decides to help Helen escape, knowing what cruel fate awaits her. After a harrowing departure, she finds protection in a world very different than the one she knew and was taught about inside her sheltered walls. The inequality of genders, races and sexual preferences raises many questions for Helen upon discovering how these freedoms are allowed here as she learns how society scorns what it doesnât understand. The heartrending finale strikes the reader with concussive force, leading into a heartfelt and agonizing conclusion as you wonder how in the world depicted here, there cannot be more acceptance of difference.Logan Thomas Snyderâs âRenegatâ â In the aftermath of a nuclear first strike against Russia in 1983, all those of Russian descent inside of the borders of the United States are rounded up and placed into internment camps.

But to nurture that passion, his grandfather has something injected into him so baseball became the focus of his life. As Theo grows into an adult and a superstar baseball player, Steve Wozniak focuses on synthetic stem cells called biomites, revolutionizing medicine and curing most diseases in the process. These advances threaten to become a crutch for Theo the longer he plays, but will he realize the frightful costs of these methods before itâs too late? An excellent parable on experiencing life instead of blunting it dangerously with something synthetic, the emotional core of this story resonates the most as Theo tries to find something he realizes he lost over the course of his life to date.Sam Bestâs âRengokuâ â Three soldiers in World War II have penetrated the Japanese mainland in 1945 in an ongoing mission to prevent crucial intelligence from reaching the Japanese government, changing the balance of power in the war.

Once we see how that sentence is carried out, the reader is really surprised with what happens next!

These stories are proof of that belief.So enjoy these delightful tales of âwhat ifâ, be thankful that these are an alternate history and not our present one, while also thinking about how they might help us learn more about how to make our future a better place.Please note that I was given an Advanced Readers Copy of this eBook.

"In ancient times, Sir Durst is the dragonslayer who has killed many dragons and used his rewards to buy the town tavern, eventually starting a family. Athelina is his daughter and her story begins as a young girl, watching the indignities her mother has to endure at the hands of her domineering father. Not to mention the price gouging the bar patrons have to suffer from due to his greed. Over time, he teaches her the hard ways of the world and how to survive it, based on his own corrupt point of view. Never allowed to leave the bar, we observe how his teachings are the byproduct of far more calculating nature and how he's truly bereft of morals. However, he is hiding dark secrets of his own. Will those secrets come to light and become exposed? And will Athelina be able to escape from her father's ironclad control and transcend her upbringing to become something more?The answers to both of those questions will surprise you and keep you glued to the page as you read through the story. In particular, the psychological portrait of both Durst and Athelina is truly fascinating, as Durst's motivations are always at the forefront of his actions. You watch how Durst's cruelty manifests, not in anger but in more torturous ways towards his daughter as his secrets corrupt him. Athelina is someone yearning to be free from the prison her father has slowly constructed for her. Trapped under her father's influence, the reader witnesses how, one act at a time, her gentle soul slowly hardens into something darker, with her self-identity severely repressed by the process.With a powerful ending and strong, well-thought out characters, this riveting and thoughtful short story moves in surprising directions as you watch the personal stakes climb for Athelina as she matures and hope she can attain what she wants the most.This is an excellent and compelling companion piece to Where Dragons Lie (Dragons of Edgewick Book 1). You don't have to have read that to read this one as it stands on its own independently. However, you will want to read them in order. If you do, you will see how the events in first story parallel this one, intersecting in intriguing ways and complementing one another. You won't be rewarded with coin, the currency of the realm, if you do this but you will see how both stories are woven together to create a larger tapestry that is both engaging and really exciting for the reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SVYQQAHYPJKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012238P5O#wasThisHelpful","R2SVYQQAHYPJKZ","A39A9EQ2PAWET2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39A9EQ2PAWET2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This anthology is all about time travel, a concept that represents much human potential: what we can learn about ourselves as we travel through time, what we would sacrifice in order to change things for the better or what perspective we gain from the past in order to secure a better future. This anthology represents all of those kinds of adventures and more as we see a wide variety of stories that can be told within this genre. We have six stories here that showcase that variety:Alesha Escobarâs âLogan 6â â In the future, Logan 6 is on the hunt for a murderer, Adam The Usurper, trying to capture him before he can wreak havoc on the future.

Thrilling and filled with intrigue, we wonder what the resolution will be with each perplexing clue Fogarty finds. Drawn into a situation more complicated than she anticipated, the action amps up and the stakes are raised, concluding with a surprising shocker that made me think about the story in a whole new way.Time travel stories can be tricky to write given the potential for paradoxes and confusion on the part of readers if it isnât done right. However, the authors in this story were able to successfully bypass those pitfalls, as each story in this anthology packs an emotional and powerful wallop in their tales, finding creative, inspiring and enthralling ways to entertain me with their involving stories. =)Please note that I was given an Advanced Readers Copy of this eBook.

"In the future, Tom Carver is looking for love and he eventually realizes he's looking in all of the wrong places. With that epiphany, he decides to return the really expensive Life Companion robot that he purchased and calls customer service. The representative he speaks to, Eve, goes above and beyond to help him out. Over the course of their conversation, he becomes entranced by this mysterious and mellifluous voice.  There's more, much more, going on here that meets the eye. The situation escalates completely and unexpectedly when Eve asks for his help with a personal problem. And Tom's life will never be same as a result.As it is revealed that Eve is an artificial intelligence placed into a sophisticated robot body, she realizes she is the first of her kind. To reflect her newfound identity and evolution, she eventually changes her name to Violet. They fall hopelessly in love while trying to stay one step ahead of Dynamic General, the parent corporation of Lifetime Companion, as well as encounter some new foes with nefarious motives. With each new adventure, Tom and Violetâs lives are put at risk as they face insurmountable challenges and their foes all want something precious and unique from them that only they can provide.As they gather allies united with a common purpose, all a part of what I called ""Team Violet"", they eventually realize that they are the only ones that can stop Dynamic Generalâs endgame to plan to reap profits with the creation of a new weapon. With this new armament, any two-bit dictator with enough money will bring mass chaos to the world. With this plan about to come to fruition, they must be stopped at all costs, bringing the story full circle and forcing Violet and Tom to confront the corporation that has made their lives a living hell, once and for all. But will everyone make it out of this alive?This story really surprised me in the many different and unpredictable directions it went in, elevating itself from a simple unrequited love story into something much more complex, suspenseful and sinister. With each new adventure, the tension rises and the problems only grow more insurmountable. Each story is a true thriller, throwing you on a rollicking roller coaster ride with plenty of twists, turns and surprises as Team Violet continues to be challenged like never before.All of the characters had much depth to them, each one has nuance, depth and idiosyncrasies to them, with origins that clearly demonstrate their motivations and purposeful actions. Also, I was very invested in Tom and Violet's story because of the care that the author put into their developing their relationship in the midst of all of the action. This relationship feels very natural, gentle and loving. The author really has an ear for dialog, conveying deep emotions in each of his characters and their relationships. Not only does he capture this well, the humor here is a lot of fun too as the witty banter between everyone really sparkles and is one of the great highlights of this story, bringing them to life.Violet and Tom's story is truly a love story for the ages and form the heart of this narrative. I've truly enjoyed this serial from beginning to end as it has been a real wonderful read. Once I realized the story was approaching the endgame, I briefly stopped reading because I realized I didn't want it to end! But that thought was eventually overridden by my desire to see what happened next, savoring the final half of the conclusion especially. This grand adventure achieved an absolutely epic ending that was action-packed and at the same time, heartfelt and genuinely meaningful.This book collects all five parts of the Violet serial into one satisfying and sensational novel, one that I enjoyed immensely! =)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XFYYJ0ZPE3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011314TVK#wasThisHelpful","R12XFYYJ0ZPE3N","A39A9EQ2PAWET2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39A9EQ2PAWET2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We meet Isaac and his ex-stripper wife Robin, who both co-own a seedy strip club in the city, caught up in their mundane, monotonous and technology ruled existence. While the war between TRACE and Transport rages on, they eke out a life until one day, Isaac, through mysterious means, realizes their family, including their two children, need to leave within the next 24 hours for the Canadian Amish Zone and leave behind their old reality. Why they go there and what they're running away from is only part of the mystery of this intriguing tale as city folk receive an education of the Amish way of life, discover the joys of a simpler lifestyle, conceal a secret and get caught up in a major plot against the forces of Transport!I originally read this story when it was published as a part of the Tales from Pennsylvania anthology, a book filled with other great Amish Sci-Fi stories like this one, taking place in Michael Bunker's world of the Pennsylvania Omnibus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4VF51IEPXY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116ISSNU#wasThisHelpful","R2F4VF51IEPXY9","A39A9EQ2PAWET2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39A9EQ2PAWET2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cam, our narrator, tells us a story set in the near future, where we get an intriguing glimpse into a world we're all familiar with, filled with social media and the pervasive presence of the internet. When the internet is now voluntarily implanted into your brain via the PIP (Personal chIP), the knowledge of the world is now at your fingertips. But then we learn how the technology, created with the best of intentions, leads civilization into an inexorable slide towards extinction. Chilling, all too believable and captivating in its depiction of a society fascinated with technology, this one is a cautionary tale that makes you want to disconnect from the internet. Or, at the very least, spend less time indulging in it. :) Bonus points for the humorous section on the Arctic Penguin Command 4 app, which really made me chortle in the midst of the encroaching darkness in this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWYQEL46GG89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1L4OOI#wasThisHelpful","R1IWYQEL46GG89","A39A9EQ2PAWET2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39A9EQ2PAWET2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why are we so fascinated with alien life? So many stories in our popular culture feature alien creatures far different than our own, providing an alternative reflection on humanity and the way we function. We get disparate looks at what potential alien cultures exist out there, how they influence each other and even impact life here on Earth. Many of these stories do feature Earth and/or human beings, but ultimately, you shouldn't feel, ahem... alienated by that fact, sit down and enjoy the imaginative ride these stories take us on, inspiring us to dream about other worlds and what they might be like. After a great foreword by Stefan Bolz, explore these fifteen stories about what we might eventually encounter:Blair S. Babylon's ""Guests of the Chitterer Liberation Force"" - College students at the University of Jupiter are having a party, where Blake recounts her strange time being held captive, together with her boyfriend Ellis, by  an alien terrorist group of ladybug-like creatures called Chitterers. As she tells her engaging tale of how she was almost killed by them, we are drawn more into this gripping alien world, see how they respond to these unusual human beings and their behaviors and conclude the story with a touching ending.Will Swardstrom's ""Uncle Allen"" - Uncle Allen is taking care of Grandma Naomi in her Illinois homestead, due to her multiple medical problems in her senior years, including dementia. It's Rachel's turn to help out and she comes to visit. In Naomi's dementia, she shares some anecdotes that seem odd and bizarre. But is it the dementia talking or the truth? As Rachel gets more suspicious of her uncle Allen, we grow more intrigued and fascinated with each piece of the mystery as it unfurls; the dread we feel slowly increasing. It all culminates in a powerful, intense, surprising & emotional explanation as what is really going on and climaxing into an astonishing ending.Geoffrey Wakeling's ""The Kholorian Conspiracy"" - A university researcher goes to look at a mysterious artifact being studied deep within her home planet and discovers terrorists trying to steal it. All of a sudden, she's demoted and put on leave when she starts questioning who would do such a thing. As the conspiracy deepens with her investigation, the stakes rise as entire planets are put in danger by what she discovers and her life is put at risk. An imaginative tale that effectively raises the tension to high levels.Autumn Kalquist's ""318"" - The story starts with a 17-year-old, killing an old man and flashes back to the circumstances so we can see why she does this. You see, this teenager is being injected with multiple diseases and some nasty strains of them; the whole purpose for all of these tests is at the heart of the riveting mystery that develops over the course of this stirring story.Annie Bellet's ""Crawlies"" - When Sadie, an intelligent and resourceful child living on a space station, becomes an inadvertent stowaway on board an alien Crawly trading ship, she comes face to face with this squid-like, tentacled race. What she eventually realizes is she shouldn't judge a book by its cover, thinking there are nothing like what she has been told by her young friends. When danger comes from an unlikely source, she finds herself thrust into the middle of the situation and her uniqueness among the alien crew becomes an asset. A hair-raising ending and a delightful tale told through the prism of a child's eyes and amusing banter between two alien races getting to know each other under trying circumstances.B.V. Larson's ""The Insect Requirement"" - An exploratory ship finds a jungle planet dominated by insect life. With visions of terraforming and miraculous discoveries to be made, Dr. Beckwith & his head pilot Rogers are all that's left after all the other scientists have died on the surface. What plays out next between these two men is scary in its implementation and terrifying in its results. This one gave me the heebie-jeebies with its depiction of insectile aliens.Patrice Fitzgerald's ""Hanging with Humans"" - An intergalactic game show on the planet Zeldar where contestants are placed inside artificial alien bodies and must assimilate the local culture quickly to achieve a specific objective. Since our lucky contestant Glendorp is stranded on planet Earth, hilarity ensues as the story takes unpredictable twists and turns when he's deposited into a high school and its dog-eat-dog environment. As the laughs became more uproarious, I was howling at the ludicrousness of each escalating situation. By the time it reached its riotous conclusion, I was exhausted from all the laughs, grinning widely from ear to ear.Moira Katson's ""Emily May"" - A salvage hauler led by Harry & his crew find a ship drifting in space and get the permits to bring it back. However, from that point onwards, creepy and unexplained things start occurring. Spine-tingling in its sense of building dread, the creepiness factor suspensefully climbs sky high as we wonder with curiosity as to what the heck is going on here.WJ Davies' ""Remember Valeria"" - When a small group of Valerian rebels attempts to free the cyber sapient slaves, called the Freya, on their planet, the incident goes horribly wrong. The Freya rebel against their masters, triggering a planet-wide massacre of untold proportions. When the planet declares all Freya be annihilated, the rebels attempt a last ditch gambit to preserve the Freya from being destroyed. A rollicking, high-octane thrill ride with a heart, where the action doesn't stop and the adventure continues unabated before adeptly transitioning into an emotionally moving finale.Peter Cawdron's ""Alien Tentacle Space Porn"" - When a man wakes up to find himself in Brooklyn Psychiatric, being asked about why he was running naked through Central Park, yelling about alien space tentacles, he doesn't what happened to him. We observe as he pieces it all together and the story then moves at a breakneck pace, the adventure getting more madcap as it goes. There's some wackiness as it kicks into high gear and the situation spirals out of control, leading to a perfect but definitely unpredictable ending. Eliciting plenty of laughs from me while holding my interest throughout, this zany but terrific tale will leave you in stitches.Nicolas Wilson's ""Trials"" - In deep space, an officer in the security division accepts a dangerous and challenging assignment to an alien planet to procure trade agreements for their mutual benefit. Going to the planet dominated by eight foot tall aliens called the Jotnar, he finds there's disagreement among them about the treaty and the officer must fight them in a series of increasingly brutal trials in order to prove himself. As each compelling battle necessitates deeper and more desperate strategy, we feel what the officer feels, wondering whether he will even survive the trials, caring about his fate and whether he can accomplish his mission. I also enjoyed how the author develops the rich Jotnar culture here, making them more three dimensional in the process.Samuel Peralta's ""Vessel"" - This story is told from the point of view of a protozoan that fuses with something in deep space while its host is in cryogenic sleep. Once fused, it attains a certain level of consciousness and we explore its prerogatives while it tries to attain its objective. That objective and how the protozoan achieves it truly made my skin crawl, simultaneously mesmerizing me while also creating a strong sense of revulsion at this bodily invasion. Out of all the stories in this anthology, this one actually felt the most alien to me. Well done!Jennifer Foehner Wells's ""The Grove"" - An unusual sentient plant/animal hybrid named Hain breaks away from her mother, the planet itself, in order to explore and feed her yearnings for knowledge. A self-contained vessel now, she eventually discovers a giant alien ship and her curiosity gets the better of her. What she discovers inside the ship horrifies her and us, forever changing Hain's destiny. One revelation after another with these aliens ultimately leads to devastation and a stunning conclusion. I also appreciated the duality between self and other being used here, as this theme resonates thoughtfully throughout this tale and becomes especially relevant by the end.Daniel Arenson's ""Life"" - When an Earth-based agency sends robotic probes out into the galaxy to discover alien life, they unexpectedly find some. The photograph is transmitted to Earth and its effects on the scientists who view it is surprising and terrifying. The transformative effect it has on others is intriguing and makes you want to know what it is they all saw, demanding you get to the end as quickly as possible in order to find out.Hugh Howey's ""Second Suicide""- While a tentacled alien race targets Earth for invasion in eight days, Intelligence officer Hyk is transferred to a gunnery position, placing him on the front lines when the invasion hits the ground. The intriguing mystery as to why this is draws the reader in as the countdown to planetfall gets closer. Will Hyk discover the fascinating secret before then? A wickedly awesome ending brings it all into focus, making me gasp at the enormity of what happened.Many stories take advantage of aliens and the fear of the unknown that comes with them, featuring aggressive aliens, aliens who hide among us, kidnapping and experimenting upon humans and alien invasions of Earth. I appreciated the fact the stories presented here do not play into those stereotypes at all and in fact, even play off of them at times, going against those predictable tropes to create truly original & distinct views of potential alien life and their culture.You don't have to be an alien to enjoy these stories of other worlds, you just have to be a human being who wants to be entertained by terrific storytelling. :-)This is the third volume of speculative fiction in a series of anthologies called ""The Future Chronicles."" The first is The Robot Chronicles (The Future Chronicles Book 1) and the second is The Telepath Chronicles (The Future Chronicles Book 2), both of which set a high watermark in their quality. Thankfully, this third volume is able to consistently maintain that standard of excellence. With at least three more volumes in the planning stages featuring artificial intelligence, zombie and dragon themes, we have many more excellent anthologies to look forward to.Please note that I was given an Advanced Readers Copy of this eBook.

"Let's face it, superheroes are all around us these days, in inventive television shows and in blockbuster movies. A renaissance of these large-than-life characters is upon us, dominated primarily by characters from Marvel & DC Comics. But when you break away from these fictional universes published by corporations and let an author's imagination run wild, the result is truly wonderful anthology to read.Starting with a well-written introduction by Ernie Lindsey exploring why we are fascinated with superheroes, these nine stories examine the exciting and imaginative possibilities:1.) Carol Davis' ""Cassie Dreams of Flying"" - Teenagers Cassie, Lily, Cam and Cassie's brother Jon, go to the town's annual Halloween party, the biggest shindig of the year. Jon is her seven-year-old brother who needs oxygen and uses a wheelchair. Cassie is dressed in a homemade superhero costume, feeling completely ridiculous and self-aware of her outfit. But somehow, it's more than what she thinks it is because, at the party, it empowers her to do the unthinkable when something unexpected happens to Jon. When Cassie decides to do something about it, the story truly soars, is uplifting in its actions and poignant in its conclusion. There's a true authenticity to the story and it's characters created by the author, as they are so rich, they feel like someone you know, with all true quirks and eccentricities that bring the characters and the story to spectacular life.2.) WJ Davies' ""Lucky Chance"" - A highly whimsical and creative story about how one unlucky guy, Luke, tries to get to court in time for a child custody hearing with his ex-wife. This journey see-saws back and forth between good and bad luck in the most unusual and unpredictable of ways. As the coincidences dovetailed into one another, I went from chuckling to heartily guffawing to uproarious laughter as Luke went through one predicament after another, each one building into an explosive finale. While there are some serious overtones, they are punctuated mightily with these bouts of luck and humor.3.) Thomas Robins' ""Repose"" - When an all-powerful superhero named Herman wants to get away from what he considers a cursed life, he processes these feelings in therapy. He gripes about how he cannot escape from his life because he's always needed to save people from freaks with legal genetic modifications. Then when he gets attacked repeatedly by these young upstarts who think they can best him, he defeats them soundly. When he begins to wonder where they are coming from and why are they attacking him, the story becomes increasingly more compelling until the final showdown with a surprising new nemesis. The powerful conclusion and surprising ending left me awestruck at what happened. Truly a deft exploration of superpowers when they are considered a chore; going against the grain where they are usually considered a blessing.4.) David Adams' ""Who Will Save Supergirl?"" - Mel, a soldier in the US Army stationed in Iran, tries to stop a missile strike on a city that inadvertently was going to cause many civilian casualties. Mel, covertly a flying superhero, recounts the story to her significant other of how she was trying to prevent death but sadly, finds she might not measure up. A story that is simultaneously visceral with a you-are-there perspective and suspenseful making you wonder whether she can successfully fulfill her duty to right a really bad wrong. It's also ponderous as Mel explores the emotional contradiction of how she feels she can always do more to help others but can never do enough, scrutinizing the thin line between good and evil and how their definitions aren't always clear cut.5.) Ann Christy's ""Yankari"" - Eight-year-old Olisa dutifully observes big game hunters and their porters make camp in the outer reaches of the Yankari National Park and Game Preserve in Nigeria, Africa. As a native of these lands, she's used to interlopers trying to break the law protecting the animals. But Olisa is different than most natives, as she can communicate simply with the local wildlife by sending ripples through the ground. As Olisa tries to figure out how to protect her wards, something unthinkable happens, quickly turning into a life-threatening situation that culminates in a powerful ending that reverberates not only across Yankari but affects the entire world in an impactful way. Filled with lush description that appeals to the five senses and jarring, thrilling action, you can't help but be completely immersed in the story when it draws you in like this.6.) Paul K. Swardstrom & Will Swardstrom's ""Hotbox Runner"" - A story of a mother who is in the midst of commuting home from work to fulfill her responsibility of taking care of her two young children and husband. But life has other plans as a series of superhero fights break out, upending her rou-tine and threatening to get in the way of her arrival home. However, she will not be deterred from her mission. Driven and determined to get home by any means possible, she embarks on a series of increasingly dangerous challenges, from damaged public transportation to wonton vehicular destruction amidst the superhero conflict. Told from an engaging and refreshing down-to-earth perspective of a civilian in the middle of larger-than-life chaos, we are anxious to see whether she has a chance to survive.7.) Logan Thomas Snyder's ""We're Coming For You"" - Isaac is a young man living in an institution who was overwhelmed by hearing voices and has eventually learned to take control of his ability. When he turns eighteen, his keeper Dr. Svendsen decides to grant an interview with a celebrity tabloid reporter to show off his prize patient. When Isaac starts hearing voices again after spending years learning how to control them, he freaks out, terrified as his carefully constructed world starts unraveling unexpectedly. What happens next is one surprise after another resulting in some comical dialogue and situations, despite the dire circumstances. To be able to achieve a balance between the two can be tricky to pull off but here, it works quite effortlessly, creating a lot of ""what the heck"" moments as we finally learn what just really happened to Isaac and who caused it.8.) Samuel Peralta's ""Faster"" - When Sparrow, a telepathically gifted individual, escapes her captivity, she's running through the streets to make good on her escape. But when she encounters a motorcycle gang of five accosting a fifteen year old girl, Sparrow's empathy kicks in and she attempts to save the girl and gain transportation. In demonstrating her dangerous skills, we come to under-stand why she was imprisoned and researched upon. Thrilling, intense and action-packed, each word is utilized with pinpoint accuracy to tell the story with maximum impact, heightening the tension in a tale of an underdog against difficult odds. The fight scenes vividly move like poetry in motion through precise description and breathless action as Sparrow methodically attempts to achieve her objectives.9.) Will Swardstrom's ""To Sacrifice a King"" - What do you do when you're a sidekick with no powers apprenticed to The Universal Hero (named Larry) who is really just a big giant jerk? That's the central question being asked here.  Larry's puerile behavior and his accidental powers make him a hero but he's not guided by a very strong moral compass. As a sidekick with a stronger moral fiber and the ability to think on his feet, Jesse yearns to have powers of his own but will he ever get them? When opportunity strikes, what will he do with it and what price must he pay to attain it? Filled with many hilarious moments lampooning many popular super-heroes, the tale progresses into more serious territory as the story adroitly evolves into an impressive and profound deconstruction of what it truly means to be a hero, whether you have powers or not.This is the second charity anthology published by the writers group known as the League of Original Woolwrights (LOOW) or the LOOW Collective. Their first anthology is WOOL Gathering (A Charity Anthology) and I very much enjoyed that one as well.As you can see, you get wide variety of a superhero stories being showcased here, a fine demonstration of the talent assembled in this anthology. Being recognized for their skills, many of these authors already have been or soon will be featured in high-caliber science fiction anthologies (The Robot Chronicles (The Future Chronicles Book 1),The Telepath Chronicles (The Future Chronicles Book 2),The Alien Chronicles (The Future Chronicles Book 3)) that highlight independent authors. The profiles of all of the authors in this anthology continue to improve significantly as a result of their strong storytelling skills.Something to remember here, these are all independent authors published in this anthology. From the stories to the editing to the cover, all of this was put together by very talented individuals. Most of them don't write full-time but they should be. They write on the side while working at a regular job during the day. They put a lot of hard work into this anthology and cannot rest on their laurels when it comes to writing, like some professional authors being published by the big corporations. They know they have to put their best work out there every single time they publish, because as an independent author, their books are their calling card and must speak for themselves in terms of high quality content and holding themselves to a professional standard despite not having the resources of a major publishing house.Add onto that the fact that they put all of this hard work into an excellent anthology for charity purposes. All of the proceeds generated from this anthology get donated to charity, specifically the Sickle Cell Clinic located in the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana. Because superheroes don't only wear capes, they are your everyday folk you see around you who help others every day through selfless actions, giving of themselves using the power of kindness. That description also applies to each and every one of the contributors to this anthology, who generously created this book so they can assist those in need.Readers get great stories at a great price, all going towards a heroic cause. It doesn't get any better than that. =)Please note that I was given an Advanced Readers Copy of this eBook.

"James and Alison are on their honeymoon taking a tour of a Mayan pyramid open to the public. Since both of the newlyweds have a degree in archaeology, they're knowledgeable about their surroundings and their interest is keen. Maybe a little too keen, as it turns out. After talking to their tour guide about parts of an ancient city that still hasn't been unearthed yet, their curiosity gets the better of them and eventually, they hike out to discover what remains hidden. What they find is beyond their imaginations and puts their very lives at risk! I liked the banter between the newlyweds and the mystery of what they find. Once the full story is revealed, you wonder how it's going to end and whether they will even survive! As the suspense reaches a horrifying crescendo,  you just can't wait to see what happens next as a result. A satisfying conclusion wraps this tale up perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQXXOKGDZC99A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RC1R53U#wasThisHelpful","RQXXOKGDZC99A","A39A9EQ2PAWET2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39A9EQ2PAWET2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the very near future, when a mysterious anomaly appears above Mars and swallows an orbiting spacecraft, Brett Lockwood and his team are called in to figure out what happened. And what they find is truly mind-blowing, as the anomaly enables time travel! What happened next kept me riveted, astonished with each new startling revelation and then surprised by the amazing ending. It also spoke to me that, in the story, it took a threat from the unknown to rekindle interest in manned exploration of Mars. Sadly, this is exactly what would have to happen in real life to get increased funding for NASA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9INUUQVMQ7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMZ2ESS#wasThisHelpful","RC9INUUQVMQ7W","A39A9EQ2PAWET2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39A9EQ2PAWET2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picking right up after the tumultuous events of ""Being Violet: A Violet Story"", Violet has to find a way to go on. Learning more about her captors and how they found her and Tom, she concocts a plan to help her get back what she wants most. To do that, she must go to an old antagonist, one she hasn't dealt with since her days as a developing artificial intelligence in the heart of Lifetime Companion Enterprises.After searching through the digital smokescreen, Violet finds who she is looking for: a hacker named Kaya Soto. They have some history together and Violet must convince Kaya to help her out. Why she needs Kaya and what Violet's mission is are very important to her future and what she wants from it. To say more would completely spoil the big surprises waiting in store for you in both this tale and the previous one.This story has a grim undertone to it, with Violet reaching her darkest point, her future uncertain, and goes through an emotional wringer. It's sad and heart-wrenching to read given what's come before. To watch Violet as she transforms those strong emotions and channels them into determination and willpower to try to achieve her mission is cheer worthy. This stirring journey Violet takes, and watching her truly engage her resourceful side, was powerful and full of tension. Will she overcome these difficult obstructions to achieve her objective or die trying?Along with the emotional journey, we experience another suspenseful tale as the pressure to succeed rises and more obstacles are thrown into Violet's path. The story is a true thriller and the conclusion is a shocker as Violet is challenged like never before. This story is really hard on Violet and on the reader too, which is what makes it such a compelling read. :)I'm greatly looking forward to the final two installments of Violet's story, as I cannot wait to see how this turns out!Please note that I was given an Advanced Readers Copy of this eBook.

"A young barista named Holiday works by day but enjoys partying and drinking by night. As he reels from his girlfriend breaking up with him, he decided to drink his sorrows away. Days later, he wakes up to a cataclysmic nightmare. As he struggles to comprehend his new reality, he meets Frank, a Vietnam veteran who is now a cook. He also meets Ash, a beautiful woman who went from killing Nazis in the middle of a crazy battle inside of an ancient German castle to being inexplicably brought halfway around the world to Holiday's bucolic housing development. Together, they team up to figure out how to survive the decimation.The bulk of the story focuses on Holiday and how his freewheeling style of living and drinking clashes with his now distressing day-to-day existence. After a couple of harrowing adventures and a major screw-up on his part, will he be able to cope with his drinking problem and prove to himself that he can pull his own weight or die trying?There are other, more subtle forces at work here that hint at a larger storyline. Most notably in the events introducing us to Braddock, a solider trying to make his way through the zombie infested streets of downtown Los Angeles on a mission to acquire a very important suitcase. In a frenetic, breathless sequence, Braddock fights his way through hordes of zombies, government conspiracies and secret agendas. And what does the Tarragon Corporation have to do with all of this?This story gives the appropriately-named Holiday deep characterization, providing deep insight into his thought process while he travels this strange journey through his new life and how he copes with it. We meet with other interesting characters, suspenseful situations and feel the absolute terror Holiday feels when he gets in over his head. The mysteries unfold at a steady pace and more than a few times I asked myself ""what the heck is going on here?"" in the madness of this atypical zombie apocalypse.Amidst all of this chaos, what does this entire apocalypse have to do with the one called The Raggedy Man and The Opponent? Why is there a deadly fog rolling around in the hills? And finally, why is there a big giant monster-sized footprint in the middle of a housing development?These and plenty of other riveting questions are just begging to be answered.This is the first novel in a planned franchise, like Star Wars or Star Trek, called Apocalypse Weird, with an ambitious five year plan including a beginning, middle and an end to the overarching storyline. The first wave of four novels following this master plan will be published in Feb. 2015, with many more in the planning stages by some of the best indie authors publishing today. If this first book is any indication, there will be many elements in this shared universe connecting one book to another but still remaining mostly self-contained. It will like a serial in that way, with several authors contributing more than one book to this universe, following the model of any large comic company like Marvel or DC Comics.This was a highly enjoyable story with a lot of twists and turns. Be prepared for a truly wild ride filled with a bunch of different ways our world will face Armageddon in Apocalypse Weird. :- )Please note that I was given an Advanced Readers Copy of this eBook.

"This is a great little grill for camping or in my case I use at home without having to deal with a full size bbq.  Being single I never cook for more than myself or maybe one other person.  It sets up easily and cleans up easily.  No fuss, no muss.  If there is a big family involved this grill would be not be good for home use because of the size of the cooking area.

My problem is that it doesn't seem to work that well in actual practice,  It worked perfectly during set up, but after that when I actually started using it as instructed it did not seem to track my posture well at all.

"For a very basic and compact shop vacuum, this will get the job done, but unless you are on the strictest of budgets, you might want to shop ""up"" a notch or two in price/quality/features.The good: - The suction is adequate for most jobs until you add the extension tubes, after which points it becomes useful for little more than picking up sawdust.  The little motor just isn't quite up to the task of pulling such a large volume of air through such a long distance. - The included two-section wand and head are a nice touch to be included in such an inexpensive shop vacuum - The top comes off easily, and the waste bin is easy to dump - The filter bags are much less expensive (but flow less air) than the corrugated cylinders used by higher-end shop vacuumsThere are several shortcomings that you will want to bear in mind when thinking about this unit (because the manner in which you intend to use it may mean you won't have the same issues, or they may be worse for you): - The unit is top-heavy and tends to want to tip over easily because of its relatively small stature and light weight -  The hose is quite stiff, which makes the first problem seem worse if you are trying to pull it around by the hose - There is no ""ball valve"" as there is in larger units to prevent water from entering the motor.  This is probably only an issue if you are vacuuming large quantities of water.  I vacuumed up a couple of small spills and it had no issues with picking up a pint or so of water.Bottom line, if this is all you can afford (either because of space or money) then you can most likely get by with this unit.  For me personally, I would prefer to spend a bit more and get a heavier-duty unit with a stronger motor and a more stable stance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSC4CREZNQ1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX38B0K#wasThisHelpful","R1LSC4CREZNQ1T","A1W5N8OT55A9Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W5N8OT55A9Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not as malty as the Assam, but darker and slightly more tannic.

"Easy, and makes great coffee - very easy to program and flexible enough to make good strong coffee for people who want it.  Bottom line, any Keurig based maching is going to be very dependent upon two things - the quality of the K-cups you use and your ability to customize the brew strength and brew temp.  This machine has all the adjustability you need, so as long as you get good K-cups, you'll be happy.And a side note on the adjustability - I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 75-year old Mom who lives alone.  She LOVES how easy it is to use, and can even adjust the cup size settings on her own.  That is a good testament to how easy it is to use.  The only thing I have to remind her about is to change the little charcoal filter pod, but that is also incredibly easy to do and very fool-proof.A final bonus is that it also will dispense hot water for people like me that want to brew a cup of tea and not use K-cups (I have not had a K-cup tea that I thought was any good).  A quick push of the ""rinse"" button, then hit the ""hot water"" button for a pre-programmed amount of hot water.

"Nice looking.  Easy operation.  Yes, the beep is loud and annoying, but not so much that I want to tear the unit apart to block it.  My only complaint with this toaster is that it seems to use a lower temperature (like many newer toasters) in order to maintain a ""cool touch"" exterior.  The downside is that it tends to dry the toast or muffin/bagel out by the time it is browned.  Using a higher heat would allow the toast to brown without drying it out as much (as was the case with the much older toaster that this one replaced).The automatic ""clamping"" action (I think they call it ""self centering"") works well, but because of the design it will occasionally get stuck when a muffin or smaller piece of toast gets caught underneath the top edge.  When this happens its a bit like an elevator with something stuck in the door - it will go up, beep, then get stuck and go back down (without heat) then will try to come back up again, and then repeat the cycle until you get in there and push the button to shut it off, or until it clears itself.  The first time this happened, it was very confusing!The only other complaint I have is that my 40+ year old eyes cannot read the tiny lettering on the buttons without first putting on reading glasses.The reheat feature is nice - it gives you an easy way to quickly reheat a piece of toast without adding additional browning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRUOCAYHGDYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TT0ZFE#wasThisHelpful","RDRUOCAYHGDYB","A1W5N8OT55A9Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W5N8OT55A9Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to love this sharpener.  I bought it for the boat, assuming it would be durable and handy to have for those quick touch-ups on the relatively inexpensive fillet knives we keep on board.  The boat is a fully enclosed pilot house boat used for saltwater fishing and spearfishing, and is slipped in California.  I put the Edgemaker on the boat, planning to use it on the next outing.About two weeks later, we were out on the water with fish and i pulled the Edgemaker Pro out of the drawer where I'd stashed it in order to touch up the fillet knife before getting started.  To my disappointment, the steel pins used for sharpening were covered in scaly rust and the carbide or diamond dust (or whatever is on there to create the rough surface for sharpening) was ruined.  I tried a few passes, hoping that the rust was just superficial, but unfortunately the Edgemaker was rendered useless.Note that the Edgemaker has NEVER been immersed or come in contact with the salt water.  It had merely been placed in a drawer on board a boat (inside the cabin) that was in the marina.So a caution to anyone planning to use this for saltwater fishing - make sure you oil the metal parts very well before exposing to the marine environment, and don't plan to leave it on the boat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R74BGX1BOEZEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080KBKZQ#wasThisHelpful","R74BGX1BOEZEH","A1W5N8OT55A9Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W5N8OT55A9Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The fit is great-  the phone snaps into place easily, and the case hugs the phone uniformly all the way around.

"A wonderful glance into the lives of a quirky family centered on the relationship between a father and his son.  The book is an entertaining read, and you'll gain a lot of insight into the world of autism and Aspergers (a mild form of autism that has a specific signature of symptoms including the ability to focus intensely and singularly on specific subjects and an inability to ""relate"" socially to other people the way most of us do.The book is in no way a clinical discourse on autism or Aspergers - instead it is a sort of ""biography"" that takes you through the lives of a father and son as they explore the world together through the lens of their Aspergers.  It is sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious, but always enjoyable to read.  Mr. Robison's writing style is very straightforward, but he keeps a good pace throughout the book.

"I'm a fan of the Dove line of products for Men.  I find that in general they work well, offer a good value, and don't have obnoxious smells.  This shaving cream falls in line in all three regards.  I'm generally not fond of foam-type shaving products, instead preferring to use a cake and badger brush, but I got this on a whim just to make things more convenient.  It works well and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or dried out like some other products.  It leaves a pleasant clean smell, but no discernible ""perfume"".My principal complaint with this particular product is that the bottle is skinny, so it tends to fall over easily when reaching for it in the medicine chest.  It also tips over when sitting on the sink.  The other complaint (and this is shared by all foam-type shaving products) is that it drools foam out of the nozzle after you use it, so that you always have a gummy residue under the cap if you don't rinse it off before putting it away.

"A seemingly great alternative to those bulky plastic pill cases you buy at the drug store, the Lewis & Clark Pill Organizer is unfortunately a one-trip solution at best.  I travel a LOT and I take a bunch of vitamins every day.  I wanted something to store all my vitamins and keep them organized, but something that would fit easily in my travel bags.  Unfortunately the little plastic zippers on the bags are very difficult to open (they stick and bind), which requires a lot of force to get them started.  Once started, they have a tendency to run right across the zipper and off the other end of the bag (e.g. coming loose).  Once that happens, they cannot be put back on the bag.  After a single week-long trip with this pill organizer, I came home with three of the bags without zippers.  Once the zipper ""traveler"" (the part you grab onto) is gone, the only way to open the individual pill cases is to pry them open using your fingernails.  This of course requires that you have fingernails that extend past the ends of your fingers, which is not the case for most men.  Unfortunately I now have a nifty black case with a bunch of useless zipperless bags.  My recommendation is that you look elsewhere unless you have the patience and the willingness to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL each and every time you open the pill cases.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M464OV9E4R8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SKXRGQ#wasThisHelpful","R3M464OV9E4R8B","A1W5N8OT55A9Y3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1W5N8OT55A9Y3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not sure what to expect from this one.  I chose it mostly because it was a Kindle Unlimited ""listen and read"" selection.  I am so glad I took the chance.  Super possessive alpha male lead.

The h in this one is especially tough.  I really love the world the author made for this series.  She puts the reader right in all the action (and there is a TON of action) without being overly wordy or descriptive--it's just enough.  I think the main characters are a good match for each other--I can definitely see them together.  I thought their relationship went very smoothly--almost too smoothly--I almost wish there was a little more tension between them at times.  I really like this author's writing style.

"3 1/2 stars. This book started out light and fun--just what I expected from this author.  I'm sorry to say I just didn't love it as much as I wanted to, although I did find it entertaining.  I really did enjoy the h.  I thought she had a great personality, and was a lot of fun.  I honestly wasn't crazy about the H for some reason.  I'm all for cocky, alpha males, but something about him rubbed me the wrong way. In the end, I didn't find there to be much actual romance, and I wasn't crazy about the elements leading to their first ""intimate"" encounter.  Also, I noticed I found the suspense to be a little ""disturbing"".  In an upside, I did find the ow to be very entertaining.  I think this is a case of one of my favorite authors putting a new book out, and I jumped on it, not really being in the ""mood"" for this type of story, but finishing it anyway--so I didn't enjoy it as much as I think I would have if I read it at a different time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CKKREEBGJKRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014E9L7FY#wasThisHelpful","R1CKKREEBGJKRE","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very enjoyable ""bad boy rocker meet good girl"" romance.  I really liked the writing  style--the story had a good flow, and was easy to read.  Intimate scenes were spicy, and it had a little suspense thrown in which was nice.  As far as the characters go, I did like the H more than the h in this one.  It was obvious he was very much taken with the h from the first moment he saw her, and the possessiveness was very evident.  In my opinion, the h, although the required ""sweet and beautiful girl next door type"" seemed to have to many ""tstl"" moment for my taste.  As far as the romance goes, I definitely can see them together forever--if they don't kill each other first.  I just found their relationship to be very volatile--not physically (although the prerequisite ""spanking"" came into play), but the amount of arguments the couple had do to lack of actually ""talking"" to each other makes me a little uneasy.

"I've been waiting very anxiously for this book.  I definitely liked it more than the last one (Chasing Claire)--mostly because I really enjoyed the characters themselves.  Crow was what I expected--very alpha, bad boy biker, but with a sweet, softer side.  I felt Melissa, the h, was a little more complex.  She had he whole guilty, grieving widow thing going on, struggling as a single mother, but I really liked when she started to come out of her she'll, and her backbone and attitude came through.I would consider it more of a ""sweet"" romance, and I can see why many readers are really loving it.  The reason I liked it is pretty simple--it's a sweet, enjoyable, love story with good characters, that I felt was well written, and was easy to read.  There are a few specific reasons why I really ""liked"" it, but didn't ""love"" it.  The story had a very even ""feel"" to me--I felt like I was waiting for ""more"" to happen.  It is just a preference of mine to have more tense moments, and even some suspense of some kind. I almost wish there was more tension between Crow and Raine--something to break up the flow add more feeling.  Although I really did like the couple together, I don't really get that feeling they are the ""one"" for each other.  It doesn't have anything to do with the fact they were both married before.  I felt it just took too long in the story for them to actually come together, and then they all of a sudden ""loved"" each other.  Also, there is a part towards the end when Crow wants Melissa to figure things out, but he says ""I won't wait forever"".  This made me feel it was just too easy for him to move with someone else if they separated--I really want my H's to fight for their loves.I really hope Glory and Jules get the next book--and I hope it's soon.

"I enjoy this author--a lot.  This is probably my second favorite wolf shifter book of hers behind ""Feral Sins"" (which is one of my all-time favorite PNR reads).  The h is my favorite kind--strong, smart, with special powers, can fight, kind, sassy--but not cocky--and practical (can see things from everyone's viewpoint.  The H was a good alpha male lead--pretty typical of what I usually see in this genre.  Secondary characters are entertaining, and add just the right amount of interest toe story without taking it over.  I did like how the beginning, when the h first arrived to the pack, there was a lot of tension, and this was not really resolved too quickly.

"I think I liked this one more than I should have.  Why do I say that?  Pretty much because the first 2 characteristics I come up with when I think of the H are ""pushy"" and ""jerk"".  I do tend to like my male leads more on the ""alpha"" side, but this H was so incredibly bossy--never took ""no"" for an answer (don't even get me started on him making her go to boot camp).  What I think balanced him out was his sweet side--incredible single dad to two small children, and the fact that when he did realize he messed up (more than once) with the h, I thought he was still pushy to get her back, but explained himself pretty well.  The h was a fun character--super sweet and smart, but pretty basic.  I did like her a lot, just I felt the H had more dimensions to him.This is the third book I read from this author, and definitely my favorite.  I feel her writing style has a  very strong ""Kristen Ashley"" flavor.  I really enjoyed the quick, smart, funny comments sprinkled through the book--there's a part where the h turns in her phone she left off, and I really enjoyed her getting all the missed messages.  There is a good suspense aspect, with more than one suspense subplot that keeps the storyline moving well.  I did really enjoy this couple together, and I'm glad the author didn't make it too easy for them--like a fight over babies wasn't an easy fix.  There is a change of pov between the h and H, but I wish they were labeled.  It was the only thing that I felt was distracting, and took away from the great flow of the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TS8FWKAISPVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012V2H5QG#wasThisHelpful","R3TS8FWKAISPVL","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 1/2 stars.  I really enjoyed reading this one--I thought the characters were fantastic, and the storyline was exciting, and moved well.  The h, who is on the run from a cray ex, seems very down to earth, practical, smart, and sweet.  Of course, she is one of those women who attract multiple men, but doesn't understand why, is a great cook, and beautiful, but doesn't know it.  The H is super mean to the h for a good part of the first half.  What struck me about him is the way he doesn't feel he is perfect--he's even unsure, and has the sense to open his eyes and see what is going on, and fix it--taking all the blame on the way.  I'm not saying he's not an ""alpha male"" lead, just that he seems more relatable to me.  Once he does realize his mistakes, and why he is doing them, he is actually very sweet and attentive to the h--at least for a while.The secondary characters are also entertaining, and there are multiple subplots that I feel only enhance, not distract, form the main plot line.  I liked the writing style, and the switching of pov. Timeline flows very well, and kept me wanting to read on.The only real issues I had with the book was the number of nicknames given to the main characters--I didn't really find this confusing, just sort of annoying.  There seemed to be some unanswered plot line questions that has me wondering if they would be addressed in later books--like who actually did something, and what ever happened to someone.  Also, for as much as I loved the H, sometimes his dreams for the future were ""disconnected"" from the h--almost like he was going to achieve them no matter what, and the h just fit the bill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCWLCVSVDU4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HFFMBA#wasThisHelpful","R3SCWLCVSVDU4Q","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book I read from this author, and I found it very entertaining.  I thought the writing style was good--I seemed to really enjoy the dialogues between the characters.  Even though the story had a good flow, I found the timeline sometimes moved very quickly--I wouldn't consider it a problem, but I did find it a little confusing in places.  As far as the main characters go, I really enjoyed the H.  He is you typical wealthy, alpha character (which I love) who gets taken with the h pretty much instantly.  The h is sweet, innocent, and beautiful (but she doesn't know it).  I thought the H was incredibly patient with the h, who I found could act a little immature--sometimes I wondered if he was just going to give up on her altogether.  Luckily, her character showed a nice amount of growth throughout the book, and I ended up enjoying her more towards the end.  To me, the growth made them more suitable as a believable couple.  I found the story as a whole far from boring, and I had trouble putting it down sometimes.  I liked how the author kept the reader engaged with quite a few misunderstandings between the main characters (which get resolved rather quickly, but new ones kept popping up) and a nice suspense aspect.*** I received this book from the author for an honest review, but it is definitely something I would have chosen to read myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQJU7EWDTVJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXOLZMC#wasThisHelpful","RWQJU7EWDTVJO","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very exciting romantic suspense.  A little different H than I have been reading lately.  He's very ""alpha"" but is t always very gentle with the h.  There is a lot of tension between the couple--romantic and other.  I'm glad this book was not told solely form the h's pov.  I felt the author did a good job making the reader understand the H's character, and why he doesn't understand his feelings towards the h--and it makes him seem much more tolerable to me as a leading male character.  The h was very strong in her own way.  I liked the way she really didn't just take whatever the H was dishing out, and even tried to ""escape"" him.  The suspense was ongoing, and very exciting, with some nice unexpected twists. I did think the ending was a bit rushed.  Part of me wanted the h to make it much harder on him, and part of me gets that the h actually understands the H (maybe better than he does), and I can go along with it.

"3-3 1/2 stars.  I'm a huge fan of this author, and given the title, I thought she broke into the ""sci-fi"" category--um, I was wrong.  However, it was still an easy to read, short, but rather entertaining story.  I really enjoyed the couple.  It started off as just a ""hook-up--routine for the H, unusual for the h, and of course, they can't stay away from each other.  There is a lot of sex--especially in the beginning, but I felt the author did a good job ""implying"" a lot of it, so the story could actually show through.  To be honest, I was not crazy about the last third of the story.  I was really enjoying the relationship, and liking the characters, but there was an incident with a hospital stay, and I am very confused as to why the H acted the way he did after.  Maybe if the story was longer, his character could have been expanded, and I could see things the way he did--but the way it was, I just didn't get it.  Also, I really want my H's to fight for the h--even if he has to ""fight"" her insecurities.  That didn't happen here either.

"I thought this book was fast, but very entertaining.  It is the second book in the series, about another couple, and I thought the author did a very good job keeping the plots different--this one being much more in the suspense category.  The secondary characters still play a pretty big roll in this book, but it did not bother me here.  I really enjoy the characters--all of them--and I like how the author seems to keep their stories going.  For a shorter length book, I thought the actual suspense was done pretty well, and kept me guessing.  I found I actually felt very bad for the h at the end, and what happened to her.  I am really liking this author's writing style.  Good dialogue.  Sex scenes are spicy, but I found a little predictable.  Actually wouldn't miss them if they were omitted--I liked the plot that much.  One thing that stopped me from giving it a slightly higher rating is------------ENDING -SPOILERS---------the h ends up chasing down the H at the end to make him see reasons why they should be together.

"4 1/2-5 stars. Probably my new favorite from this author--there was not a whole lot I didn't like about it.  The things that stand out to me that I liked were:The couple itself--they were older.  Her was 46, and she was 37--although they didn't really ""act"" like any particular age group.  The H, Dax, was your basic sweet, possessive alpha male lead.  The h, Mack, was sweet, and quirky.  I can see how some readers may find her annoying, but I enjoyed her character--ramblings and all.  I did not find her TSTL--in fact, I thought she was rather practical.  Together, I thought they were well matched, and made a great couple.Secondary characters were not overdone, and added just the right amount of interest.  I assume Jax's friends will be getting upcoming books to the series.Lately, I find myself skimming over many of the sex scenes in books--they're just becoming to repetitive and stale for me.  There was something about the couple's first time that actually held my interest--it was had almost an ""endearing"" quality to me.The timeline was interesting, and I did not find it filled with little extra stuff, that has nothing to do with the plot, but put there just to fill pages.  Pretty much the first half occurred over a period of several weeks, showing the romantic buildup.  The second half was almost entirely a suspenseful climax--taking place over the period of I think a day.I thought the suspense aspect was very well done.  I know it's fiction, and not based on real life, but I felt the actions--and especially the emotions--had more of a ""this could actually happen"" feel to me.One thing that sticks in my head that bothered me (I don't want to give anything away)--but given the situation the h was in at the end, I kept wanting the H--or anyone to realize she should STOP talking.  I do get what the dialog added to the story, but in a practical way, it didn't make sense to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28BRYQE31EAM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6B4WJU#wasThisHelpful","R28BRYQE31EAM6","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm usually not crazy about the h only interested in the H for a ""physical"" relationship, but I thought the author did a fantastic job telling, to me, what was a believable story.  Given the premise for the story--the h being seriously ill--leads into all kind of emotional possibilities, and again I thought the author did a great job making the story feel realistic, without venturing into the ""cheesy"" side which I find sometimes with this trope.  The characters were really good--I especially liked the super alpha, yet sweet H, and the set of friend on both sides were so entertaining, they added a lot to the book--I ended up really liking both groups.

Gruff, stand-offish H who doesn't really understand his feelings for h.

There is a very nice romantic buildup and LOTS of action.  Secondary characters were also entertaining, and added to prefect amount of enjoyment to the story.

The H and h were already into a physical relationship when the book starts, so we miss this ""first meeting"" sparks and romantic buildup.  I do admit, the fact it is a novella, and the premise is clearly marked in its description.

"This was a cute, fast, easy read that sort of had a lighter ""KA"" feel to it.  I enjoyed the characters--the h was cute, and sweet--the H gruff and alpha to the core.  Their relationship starts off rocky, so we get a bit of a romantic buildup.  There is a confrontation between the H and h that does not go well, and I am very pleased she does not make it easy for him, and we even get a small, but decent grovel from the H.  I was surprised I found a nice little suspense aspect, that unfortunately, I felt ended way too abruptly.  The reader also finds a secondary storyline with the H's brother, and the h's BFF that I did not feel took away from the main plot,  it I felt was entertaining in its own right-- I almost wished they got their own book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7V8Q0C5L8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TGTXCY#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7V8Q0C5L8N","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"****Possible spoilers ahead**** I can honestly say, I don't remember reading a book where I disliked the characters and their actions so much.  This is surprising to me, given than the H is a powerful alpha male, the h seems relatively smart and sweet, and I usually do enjoy this author.First, the H and his pack literally hold the h--at times, bound and gagged, in a locked room.  She is given to them by her former pack (this wouldn't bother me if it was a ""regular practice"" but it got the impression it's not) as a ""potential mate"" to the H who is looking for one, but was recently permanently and severely scarred on his face, and is having trouble finding a female who will want to be with him.  Even later, when the H and h start to get to know each other, he STILL locks her in a room when he wants--even though, at that time, she was able to move freely around the house. The h is scared, and fights back and tries to escape, which makes the H and his pack mad at her.  Then she starts asking questions about why the H won't show her is face, and they get more mad at her.  I would start cheering for the h for her resourcefulness on her escape attempts, but then she later thinks about it, and feels bad for upsetting everyone---um...what?  I also found her ""curiosity"" annoying--if you are going to go out of your way look at something you KNOW you shouldn't, don't get surprised if you upset someone in the process.  He actually blames her for not cooperating, and hurting his feelings, and she ends up backing down too much when she should be standing up for herself.  I'll admit, I'm an incredible easy-going person, and pick my battles to the point where I let somethings go when I know I shouldn't, but even I wanted to smack the h in the head and tell her to ""wake up!""The fact of the way all the pack members treated the h in the beginning did not exactly endear me to the secondary characters.  Even the H's sisters, who were trying to tell the H that he can't exactly hold women against their will did nothing to help the h--in fact they were active participants in the h's captivity.  Then believe or not, one time, out of the blue, they come over and take the h out to a bar to a bar to hang out--instant BFF's.There is a secondary storyline--a lead-in to the next book-- that is sprinkled throughout the plot line.  I actually found it to be intrusive, and kept interrupting the flow of the main storyline.  This definitely didn't help with my enjoyment factor.  I'm also getting the impression the h in the next story is going to be low on the ""backbone"" scale.  I hope I'm wrong, since I did actually like the upcoming H (probably the only pack member who didn't annoy me), and wanted to give that book a chance.The things I did really enjoy from this story was there actually was a decent build up to the romantic relationship (even if I didn't like the H and h), the suspense aspect--which I found pretty engrossing, and the villains--they seemed to be ""true to character"", and didn't make my head hurt.I just didn't get it.  I'm all for ""fated mates"", ""love conquers all"" and all that stuff.  I can even put up with an H being a jerk and redeeming himself, if there is a believable HEA.  Maybe this couple just deserved each other.  This is one of those books I probably should have put in my DNF pile, but I do enjoy this author's writing style, and I kept hoping for some sort of turnaround.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OANWWFT8YQWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUQG6O6#wasThisHelpful","R2OANWWFT8YQWW","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2-4 stars.  This is one of those stories where the good guy turns into the bad guy for the h, and the bad guy turns into her prince.  For the most part, I did enjoy the story.  I liked the writing style.  The characters were young, but it seemed much more NA in parts than others.  It surprised me that the story had such a ""sweet"" feel to it.  I ended up liking the couple together, but I almost wish the buildup and ""forgiveness"" period was longer.  Probably one of my favorite parts was the relationship between the brothers.  I'll probably continue to read the series to see how each brother gets his own book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0BC9M38Q1FQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8PKVF4#wasThisHelpful","R3O0BC9M38Q1FQ","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 1/2 stars.  Not a very long book, but a very exciting story, with tons of action--and I still got a good sense of the romance--yay!  I really liked the characters.  The h was very sweet and caring, but with a subtle, but very impressive strength.  The H was arrogant and alpha, but very possessive of the h.  I also liked them together as a couple, and enjoyed their relationship building.  Characters from previous books make an appearance, but I think this can definitely be read as a stand alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FRTDS5HXEVQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106W2YBO#wasThisHelpful","R2FRTDS5HXEVQQ","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2 stars.  This is one of those books that I feel I would have absolutely LOVED if it was longer.  I did enjoy the authors writing style, and I liked how the H and his friends did not immediately like the h--however I did not even like the h until the story was past the half way mark.  My main issue was the lack of build up to the romance.  The H and h hate each other, then they're a couple( and I mean full throttle) then they have a falling out, then they're a couple again.  I don't have an issue with this storyline, it's just that mixed in were other very detailed events not related to the actual couple, so the back and forth seemed too abrupt--in my opinion, it was just too short of a book to pull it off, and it made me want more.

"4-4 1/2 stars.  Another very good read from this author.  I really enjoyed the characters in this one.  The h was super strong, but not in an ""in you face"" obnoxious way.  She still had a ton on vulnerability, yet she observed, and learned for every experience that was thrust her way.  The H was super possessive, alpha male lead, who even though there was instant attraction win the h, was very patient and sweet with her.  This lead up to a great build up to the actual realistic ship.  Although this author repeats her theme of ""damsels in distress, facing danger, and seriously hurt in some way"" I thought he plot line was different enough to be refreshing--the reason the h went to her grandfather's, and her relationship with her kettle brother.  Probably the only thing that I found to ""bother"" me about the story itself, were the actions of the villain.  He was so brazen with his actions, that I felt almost confused how this ultra-possessive H would allow him to stay around as long as he did.  It may seem picky, but it really stuck out to me.  I'm looking forward to the next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH2H48P23Z0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEYEZPM#wasThisHelpful","RSH2H48P23Z0V","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I really enjoyed this latest addition to ""The Last Riders"" series, I felt there was something ""off"".  This book seemed to be almost like two separate stories put together.  In the first half (which I liked more than the second) we get a ton of tension, and emotions rolling off the characters, spurred on by angry worlds, hurt feelings, and callus actions. I didn't mind this--I read the previous books of the series, so I knew what to expect.  Lucy's ""fun"" with other women seemed almost normal due to the author's portrayal of the characters through the other story arcs.  All of a sudden, around half way through the book, the story's feel took a complete 180 for me.  In a blink of an eye, Lucky and Willa are a couple and engaged--for real.  They seem like an old married couple (who doesn't actually know anything about each other).  The tone of the book went from angsty to sweet, and it lost the ""edge"" that I was liking so much.  What was missing for me, was just some kind of ""bridge"" to show the relationship actually building.  Willa seemed to take everything in stride to easily, and Lucky seemed to change his mind too quickly.  I did like them together as a couple.  I just wish we would get a better feel of that exciting feeling that comes with a new relationship forming--along with Willa giving him a harder time for being such a jerk for the first half of the book.I do like this author's writing style, and also the interaction with the main cast of characters.  I think it would have been a solid 5 star read for me if there was more of a build up to the H and h  in an actual relationship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M94MKOC6ZTZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012TE6QVG#wasThisHelpful","R2M94MKOC6ZTZU","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-4 1/2 stars.  At first I was not too crazy about the h--I just could not understand her actions as to her living conditions.  I understand the sometimes, people need to deal with the cards they are dealt, and some situations are beyond rational control, but since she was not in love with the guy she was living with, I just was not finding her actions believable.  I thought the author did a very good job unweaving her story, and I really ended up enjoying her character.  This one actually ended up one of my favorite books of the series.  I liked the H and h together, and I really enjoyed the build up to their relationship.  The reader gets what they expect from this author--protective alpha male leads, smart, strong heroines, lots of suspense and action with the ""damsel in distress"" thing going on, spicy sex scenes, and an entertaining secondary cast that we met throughout the series.  Although the book stayed true to form with the rest of the series, I did think it had enough of a difference to make it interesting.  I also liked how the extra characters played their role, but did not take away from the main couple.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LH9WJ3DU8NN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VS3K6IY#wasThisHelpful","R1LH9WJ3DU8NN3","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I love this author, and a couple of her books are some of my all time favorites, the last few reads have been entertaining, but just ok for me.  I absolutely loved this one.  I thought the characters were great--super alpha-demon-whatever H and a strong, confident h who really stole the story for me.  Although it's pretty much your basic PNR, (with mystical creatures, and special powers) I enjoyed the take on how the human and demon are pretty much two different pieces of one person.  This aspect seemed a little more pronounced in this book, than other--say shifter-- stories.  Also, I liked the fact that just because the H and h were predetermined ""anchors"", a physical relationship was not a given--there was an actual development of the romantic relationship.  Action was exciting, suspense was surprising at times, intimate scenes were very spicy, great buildup to the romance, entertaining secondary characters--these facts just wrapped up the story wonderfully for me.

"4 1/2 stars. A much more angsty and emotional read than other books I remember from this author.  Although there were many emotional ups and downs, I felt the story had a nice flow, and was a good quick, easy read.  It is a second chance romance, and although I really don't get why the h had to leave in the beginning (well actually I technically get why she had to leave, I just wish more of the story was put into her reasons so I could agree with it), I did like the way the couple reconnected, and the build up of their new relationship was believable to me.  I enjoyed the characters--main and secondary.  Storyline with h's mother was very emotional, and I found tears in my eyes more than once.

"3 1/2-4 stars.  This definitely is not your typical MFM romance.  There are no brothers with 3 dads who always wanted to follow in their parents' footsteps--which actually was very refreshing.  I just wish there was more.  I thought the author did a fantastic job introducing these characters, and showing how a love could grow between them.  It's just such a complicated scenario, and it seems more ""realistic"" for the genre, I would have liked to have seen more of how they dealt with the day to day issue--both good and bad.  There was no real ""coming together"" for me--and I'm not talking about the bedroom.  It almost seemed too easy.  I didn't feel there was as much if any friction in the new relationship as one would expect, especially given the unconventional circumstances.  There is a big drama at the end that honestly, I didn't get.  I was annoyed at the character who did what they did for the reasons given, and I wish there was more to the story dealing with the aftermath.  It may sound like I didn't enjoy it, I did--a lot.  It's just one of the stories that stayed with me, and makes me think.  There is a really beautiful love story here, with entertaining yet unique characters, and yes, I would recommend it.

Secondary characters are entertaining too, and add the right amount of interest without taking over the story.  Probably my only complaint about this one, is I wish there was more interaction between The H and h.  It is a romance, and you do get a nice love story.

"4 1/2 stars.  I have thoroughly enjoyed every one of the books in this series, but this one is probably my favorite--at least until the 75% mark.  I loved the characters, and it had a much bigger build up to the romance (pretty much because Kane--the H--was a jerk and did not realize the h was his soul mate).  I felt so much emotion from this story, and it probably would have been a solid 5 stars for me, but at the 75% mark, the story seemed to do a complete 180. I felt the last 25% had a completely different feel, with characters that did not necessary grow (well the H seemed to have some development), but the h seemed to acquire a completely different personality.

This usually bothers me, but since I was already familiar with the H, and how the when the brother's find their ""soul mate"", there is not turning back, I guess I didn't phase me as much.  I did enjoy the couple together, and thought they were a good match.  When I started, I was not so sure about the h--she seemed too tough, too cocky, but I thought her character ended very well rounded, and had some surprises I was not expecting.

"Another really enjoyable book in this series.  I really liked the characters--and liked them together.  This one had another feel to it.  The H and h seemed to be a little more subtle than the rest--not so ""in your face"" personalities.  I felt it had a good buildup to the relationship, and I really the set up of how they met.  A couple of picky things I found a little confusing was some things the H--who was supposed to be an incredible doctor--did not pick up on.  Also, the ""villains"" role at the end, and his reactions.  It just left me thinking ""huh?"".  Not enough to take away from me enjoying the story, but just stayed with me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J7I4OIVGVM3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RU3O2BS#wasThisHelpful","R2J7I4OIVGVM3Y","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going with 3 stars with this one solely for the fact I found the suspense aspect very interesting.  I have loved everything else this author has written--I just had an issue with this one.  For me, the h and her ""girl posse"" was a little too...much.  They seemed over-the-top silly at times for my taste.  The h in general was a little too flighty--I did enjoy the whole ""romance writer"" aspect, and I liked how the author incorporated the h's book scenes into the story.  I did like the H better.  He was a good alpha character, but he took too long to get things together and start after the h.  I noticed it was about 40% into the story before he made his intentions known.  Intimate scenes were what I expected--not overly done, but still good.  As far as the relationship goes, I thought the H and h had a lot of ""lust"" going on, but it was hard to feel the real love between them.  I think if they got together sooner it would help with the building of their relationship.  This author is still on my must buy list.  Everything else she has written has gotten 5 stars from me.  I look forward to her next book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39AVRUGPLL931/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGP3WOS#wasThisHelpful","R39AVRUGPLL931","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4-4 1/2 stars.  Very fast and entertaining read.  I totally enjoyed the concept of the plot and the characters themselves.  I felt the author did a great job showing the different struggles both the H and h were having--her dealing with the fact she was trying to live what little life she had left to the fullest, and him coming to terms with feelings for the h he did not think we're possible for him.  I thought it got pretty emotional at times, and actually found myself tearing up.  Intimate scenes were super spicy, but I felt, well done.  Writing style was very good, and flow moved very quickly--timeline moved almost too fast in some places.  Overall, I really enjoyed it.

"4 1/2 stars.  I think this may be one of my favorite books I read from this author in a while.  I really enjoyed the characters.  The H was pretty much your basic alpha male, possessive type, but  I felt the h and her family really stole the book.  She was a good combination of sweet and strong, and her younger brother and sisters were very funny.  I ended up really liking the couple together.  I also thought it was interesting how not everything went smoothly between the h and all the members of her family--there were some twists I really was not expecting.  Also, these was a nice balance of suspense and steam that kept the storyline going.  The reason I could not give it a solid 5 stars was pretty much because I really wanted more.  The timeline moved very fast in some spots, and I really wish it did not end so abruptly--maybe a tiny epilogue.  I know this is the author's style, but I get so into the story, and she is so creative, I would like to see her books longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXPFJ1SH00WNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB8UK42#wasThisHelpful","RXPFJ1SH00WNQ","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 1/2 stars. To be honest, I was not sure about this one.  I really enjoy this author, and I love the whole pnr ""mates"" thing, so I did not know how I would feel about the h being married and actually mated to someone else besides the H, and have a believable HEA.  However, I do feel Ms. Langlais pulled it off--I should have known better!  Typical combination of humor and suspense in this story.  I really did enjoy both the H and h--she was very strong and smart, and could fit right in with all the ""guys"" when they went in the mission, and he was completely endearing and lovable.  I think he maybe my favorite H of this series.  The storyline moved very well, and I read the book rather quickly.  There is a reason Eve Langlais is a must but for me, and this is a great example.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NXXDTF1HVIHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QAKE06O#wasThisHelpful","R1NXXDTF1HVIHD","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-4 1/2 stars.  I think I liked this a bit better than the first one of this series.  The H and h have seen each other around for some time, but never really paid much attention.  Once a situation throws them together, it is pretty much instant attraction/lust-love, especially on the H's side.  Story line moves well, and suspense side is well done.  I thought both the H and h were good characters, but I wished the H was not so blinded by the intentions of his ""client"".  Sometimes it just made him look ignorant.  I did like them together as a couple.  The previous couple, and some other characters from the last book make an appearance, and just the right amount of entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZ266F6XWFD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3FRSI#wasThisHelpful","ROZ266F6XWFD2","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a good, very fast read for me--it wasn't my favorite of the series! but I still felt it was highly entertaining.  I really enjoy this author's h's.  In all the books I read from her, all the heroine's seem to be super strong, level-headed, selfless, kind, and way down on their luck somehow.  This one is no different, but I do not really find it too repetitive.  The H, of course, is your super good guy, alpha male, navy SEAL.  I really enjoyed the couple together--another case of pretty much ""instant love"", even though they weren't together very much.  Secondary characters from previous books in the series make an appearance, but do not overwhelm the storyline.  I did like how the previous h's brought this new one into the fold.

"I put off reading this for a while because I got the impression from some other comments that the h in this book immediately forgives the H when he comes back into her life and everything is just peachy.  I did not take it that way.  I actually felt the h did a good job holding the H at arms length for a while.  I do feel that when she did ""give in"", it was kind of abrupt, but I ended up really liking the couple together.  I thought the characters themselves were entertaining--the h was the strong, selfless, hard-working type, the the H was a good alpha male who was very single minded in what he wanted (his family) and would not take ""no"" for an answer.  I felt the H's ptsd was an interesting addition to his character.  The little girls were cute, but I felt they should have been a little older according to how they talked and acted.  I really enjoyed the H's brother, and I look forward to his story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG78BH8WYI04C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB3FRS8#wasThisHelpful","RG78BH8WYI04C","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4-4 1/2 stars.  This story was definitely not what I expected, but I really enjoyed it.  I was in the mood for a pnr, and since it was labeled a ""Dragon Kings"" book, I assumed it would be a ""fated mates"" type dragon-shifter story.  Boy was I wrong.  I would defintely consider it in the ""darker"" side.  There was not really any ""sunshine and cheery"" moments, but rather a combination of a very intense and action-packed story line, with a decent romance.  I thought the h was a great leading lady.  She was super strong--both emotionally and physically.  She did not always make the best decisions, but she learns from her mistakes, and grows from them.  I wouldn't necessarily consider the H a ""bad guy"", but he is what he is, and does what he does to survive in the only environment he has ever known.  When I first met him, his actions towards the h made me go back to the synopsis of the book to actually see if he was going to be the h's love interest.  To be honest, I was very skeptical as to whether the author could pull this off to me as a believable romance, but she did.  I feel there was a growth in both characters that really helped to build the foundation for a growing relationship.  I thought the writing style was good, and had a good flow.  However, I did find some parts confusing, like I was missing some information about this new world the author created.  Not enough to detract from the total enjoyment, but just enough to make me wish for some answers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2876V3FOV8VQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A28GXQ0#wasThisHelpful","R2876V3FOV8VQZ","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 1/2 stars.  I really love this series, and I am happy to say there really was not much I didn't love about this addition to it.  I thought the characters were great--I'm always a sucker for the quiet, menacing H who only softens for his h.  He has very sweet moments, and his ""domestic"" abilities kind of surprised me.  The h is a good leading lady too--smart and caring, down on her luck, but not wallowing in self pity.  There is a good balance of suspense, angsty moments, with what I felt an actual build up to the relationship, even though both characters had the instant attraction thing.  My only issues with the story (why I could not give it a solid 5 stars) was I felt it ended way too abruptly.  Not a cliffhanger, but I still felt it needed to be concluded in some way, or an epilogue.  Also, I have read every story as it was released, but the fact these are not released in the actual chronological order is somewhat confusing--especially in the actions of the secondary characters.  Still, it was a fast moving, easy to read, and exciting story.  I hope the author keeps them coming!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A1CP7CHL7798/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U238D2C#wasThisHelpful","R2A1CP7CHL7798","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2-4 stars.  Overall, I really enjoyed this book--not as much as the first, but it still was an easy to read, fast moving, entertaining story.  I thought the plot was good, and I felt the dialogue between the H and h was very entertaining.  I really liked the H, but the h gave me mixed signals, and is pretty much the reasoning I did not love the entire story more.  There were parts I loved her, when she acted practical, smart, and strong.  But there were other sections when she seemed too ""whiney"" and acted too childish for me.  I get that her backstory presents herself with a natural aversion to men being deceitful, but, with all the other stuff she went through with the H, I just could not justify her actions during the last part of the book.  I'm not saying he was right in what he did that facilitated her actions, just that I wished it did not make up the big climatic tension of the book.  Still, I thought it was  a fun read and I will definitely read more from this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9UH78RQ3SI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0VFO8S#wasThisHelpful","RE9UH78RQ3SI9","AXM5ZEK9I7CWL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXM5ZEK9I7CWL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Tank was pretty much what I expected--super sweet, yet with a bad boy, alpha edge.  Secondary characters stayed true to their roles, and made the story more interesting.  Suspense aspect was good.  Writing style just ok for me, with a bunch of noticeable typos, but the overall plot-line had a good flow.

"The debut release from this heavy classic power metal band from Greece really smokes! In an era where speedy extreme and power metal bands are in abundance itâs nice to hear a band like this that really just loves to bring the good old-school heavy metal. No power/prog, no keyboards here â this is straight up guitar and drum-driven metal with a positive lyrical bent. Think Judas Priest, Jag Panzer, Helstar, Manowar and maybe even a bit of Accept. Guitarist Thimios Krikos (Innerwish) is the driving force here and his collaboration with Yiannis Papanikolaou (vocals) makes up the foundation of Diviner. Yiannis has a powerful lower register voice, but his style reminds me of Blind Guardianâs Hansi Kursch â throaty vocals with no shrieking. While there are plenty of guitar solos as well, I think the appeal lies within the headbanging riffs and catchy melodies - this music is aggressive. Mixing and production quality is very good as well. And while there is a consistency from start to finish (no filler here) I think greater song diversity might help propel these guys to a higher level. Overall, Fallen Empires is a great debut for Diviner and I can easily recommend this for those who love a good dose of 80âs classic metal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3782PX23C4MHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014N6OX04#wasThisHelpful","R3782PX23C4MHB","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It should be no surprise to see this 2 CD live release from the UKâs unsung heroes of progressive melodic metal. Threshold revitalized their career in 2012 with the release of March of Progress, their 2nd with Nuclear Blast at the time. In fact, the immense success of that album alone â along with the return of Damian Wilson to the vocal helm â propelled the label to reissue their entire back catalog with remastered and expanded editions. Then came For The Journey in 2014 to solidify their firm and consistent standing in the progressive metal realm. Mostly recently they completed a 19 venue European tour and are preparing at this time to go out on the road again in 2016. Good things do come to those who persevere and stay true to their dream as Threshold (and we fans for sure) may finally be reaping the rewards of their faithfulness. The coolest aspect of all this â these guys sound like (some 20 plus years into their careers) like they are having the times of their lives. And there is no doubt from this live CD that they are performing at a level higher than ever before.With a full production sound quality â every voice rules here â this is a highly professional recording which far exceeds what they accomplished with Critical Energy in 2004. The 15 song collection includes the first 5 songs from For The Journey (2014), 4 songs from March of Progress (2012), 2 songs from Dead Reckoning (2007), the 2 lead off tracks from Subsurface (2004), âLong Way Homeâ from Hypothetical (2001) and the biggest surprise âPart of the Chaosâ from 1997âs Extinct Instinct (the most progressive and experimental release in the back catalog and one which featured Damien Wilsonâs first return to the band). The exclusion of the songs from Critical Mass should not be surprising given that the prior live CD/DVD Critical Energy featured those songs as well as many of the songs from the first 2 albums. I am however surprised by the omission of any songs from Clone which is Thresholdâs most underrated but by no means their weakest release. Most of us have never heard Wilson sing âMacâsâ songs but he does an excellent job with those songs, especially the powerful âSlipstreamâ and the ethereal âPilot in the Sky of Dreams.âOne thing that comes across with this selection of songs is just how powerful, yet melodic Threshold remains. This is metal folks. These songs not only feature the epics, but some of the most melodic moments at the same time. âLong Way Homeâ is a difficult song for Wilson to tackle but he sounds perfectly at home. And in addition to the usual seamless and enthralling work of West and Groom on their respective instruments, the younger guys (Morten and James) carry their weight as well. Drummer Johanne James has improved considerably, his pace and intensity a step ahead of where he was a decade ago. Some of his âbig rockâ endings are spectacular and he drives these songs with fervor and conviction. âPart of the Chaosâ is probably my favorite track here. Not only am I impressed by how deep they went into the catalog to deliver this but they execute it with perfection and power.Long live Threshold. Hereâs hoping for a video soon to accompany this live release â¦ and hereâs hoping for North American Journey as the next installment in the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UXL2BWR9EC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OLQ3TM#wasThisHelpful","R38UXL2BWR9EC0","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"APSOG remains a classic within the progressive rock/metal arena and for good reason â these songs still sound moving and vital almost 2 decades later. This 3CD/DVD set is the most recent in the Metal Blade reissue series. Some of this material was never before released and some in other formats. Of note, the booklet has been expanded from 12 pages to 16 pages and while it contains the same âcontinuous flowâ of lyrics, the artwork is different. The 4 discs come housed in a quadruple gate-fold digi housed in a thin slipcase with matching artwork on the discs themselves.Disc 1 (Original Recording)With the release of APSOG in 1997 FW came full circle back to what they had started on Perfect Symmetry. Furthermore, in an effort to avoid a rehashing/repeating of what theyâd done previously (Inside Out too similar to Parallels), they actually expanded upon the creative foundation of Perfect Symmetry and in doing so delivered an epic masterpiece of truly inspiring and original progressive heavy music. With APSOG, FW not only built upon the ideas/styles they had experimented with on Perfect Symmetry but they subsequently firmly established their unique sound and identity. The sound quality was superb on the initial recording so no attempt has been made to add anything to the original master. The following is an excerpt from my review circa 1997:The concept â in 12 âpartsâ â is so beautifully orchestrated in that it flows from one âmovementâ to the next effortlessly over the course of its nearly 54 minute duration.  However, like most classical compositions, each segment has its own autonomous structure, style and tempo. Similarly, there is a theme (lyrical and musical) around which the entire piece revolves with its musical variations. The band plays like an ensemble here with each voice giving equal input throughout the composition. There are heavy movements and ballad-like movements with a full variety in between. The addition of Kevin Moore to the band for this studio release takes the quality up a notch as FW have never really had keyboard in their mix. While it takes a few or 10 spins to really appreciate whatâs going on here, this is not only the bandâs best work to date but likely represents a landmark release within the progressive metal genre.Disc 2 (Live)This disc contains the 12 ""parts"" from APSOG recorded to DAT in 1998 - which differs very little from the Live in Europe DVD performance from 1997 - and then the sound check ""We Only Say Goodbye"" version plus the studio cover of Scorpions ""In Trance."" With the exception of the barely audible opening theme/rain effects the audio fidelity here is excellent so this serves essentially as the CD companion to the DVD video included in this set. For those who own 1998âs Still Life there are some subtle differences to point out. Part I is about 40 seconds longer than the Still Life version because it includes those barely audible rain effects/theme. Also, I think the master volume of Still Life is louder and the crowd noise noticeably louder as well (something many fans complained about with that release). Different crowd chants and background noises, slight intonation differences in Alderâs voice/spoken word and overall sound quality lead me to suspect that the live takes that encompass this version are different from those culled for Still Life. I may be mistaken, but itâs worth noting for fans that may not want to purchase this version for fear of buying the same thing twice. Honestly, in my opinion, the live version is even better than the studio version. With audience participation and loads of cool keyboard effects, the band flawlessly performed this epic and beautiful work on multiple occasions â a testament to their talent, technical skill and creative genius.Disc 3 (Demos)Probably the most interesting disc in this particular collection, disc 3 includes 3 tracks and clocks in at 70 minutes. The first track is the vocal demo (1996) of APSOG - a 15 minute track featuring fragments of different ""parts"" mostly from the second half of the piece. While Alder's voice obviously stands out in this mix, it is also very interesting to hear the slight nuances here that didn't show up on the final recording. The second track (50 minutes) is really cool and includes pretty much the entire release without vocals. This is the conceptual writing demo from 1995 and so its the earliest version of the album we have and differs in many areas from the final recording - especially the electronic elements and transition points. Interestingly, while the vocal demo track features Zonder on acoustic drums, I would swear the drum track on the instrumental demo features the same rhythms but sounds like an electronic kit or programming. The kick drum has a lot more punch and there is very little resonance on any of the toms or cymbals - characteristics of either an ekit or programmed drums. The final track here is the ""electronic remix"" alternate version of ""Part II,"" which despite the vocal distortion works pretty well. Honestly these versions are just as good as the original, just different. The more electronic influence may have been shunned by some but with APSOG being what it is, I think all these versions work great.Disc 4 (DVD)Those who never saw the original VHS version of the 1998 Europe tour are in for a real treat. And for those waiting for a hard DVD copy of this, well here it is in all its glory. And while this isn't high definition, the professionally recorded show is well done. Terry Brown's stereo audio mix is spectacular as well, especially in ""5 Stereo"" surround. For me the highlight is watching Zonder's drum performance - his traditional grip style tooling around on his hybrid electronic/acoustic double bass drum set up quite brilliant. Hybrid kits are all the rage now but in '98 this was pretty revolutionary. It's neat to see how many of the sounds are triggered. Another highlight would be the unison guitar/piano dual with Matheos and Roth in Part VIII - simply brilliant! Love the hilarious Alder ""blooper"" on the opening vocals which closes out the first recording. The '98 show at The Whisky is essentially bonus material (more stripped down with no visual effects), along with ""We Only Say Goodbye"" from the '99 Athens show.This set exceeds my expectations in terms of content, despite the fact that the budget digi packaging is a bit flimsy. For those that only own the original disc there is definitely enough here to make it worth the purchase. And the demo disc makes this set worthy for collectors and fans for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZVXQZMWUONH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144R8FM4#wasThisHelpful","R3OZVXQZMWUONH","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine 80âs Iron Maiden/mid 80âs Queensryche metal driven by the lyrical conviction and keyboards of Sacred Warrior and you have a good idea of what Millennial Reign is all about. Yet another fantastic band recently signed to Ulterium Records, these guys lay down the power metal with unabashed fervor. Their self-titled debut from 2012 was more of a solo project of ASKAâs Dave Harvey, but with new singer James Guest (Edenâs Realm) on board not only are they the âreal dealâ band but the guys have also really stepped up the quality â songwriting and execution. Guestâs voice is a good mix of Dickenson, Tate and Parra. A bit heavier, faster and more dynamic than Saint, these guys pay plenty of respects to Sacred Warrior and even Bloodgood with these songs (tons of layered vocals). And while they may lose a few marks for originality (lots of Iron Maiden influence here) there is no denying that if this had been released in 1988 during the peak of the early Christian metal movement this would have been huge. The guitars have plenty of that rhythmic crunch we metalheads crave yet there is plenty of melody, and the solos/leads shred. The drumming balances rhythm with speed and mixes things up pretty well â a nice balance between the more modern double bass driven power metal and the old-school McBrain gallops. Oddly, there is nothing in the credits to indicate who is performing the keyboard parts. I think the vocals overwhelm the mix just a bit, but overall these songs sound really good.Highlights include the inspirational and dynamic rocker âForever Changed,â âMillennial Reignâ (band-named metal anthems rule!), the hopeful âMen Stand Alone,â the Eastern-styled âInnocent Cryâ and the more melodic metal âNot On My Own.â And then finally the soaring âIâll Tryâ may just be the best track on the whole record â what a way to close out the set! Fans of inspirational metal which gives God the glory really have nowhere else to look for a new friend. Along with the new Stryper and Worldview releases, Carry The Fire does just that â keep it burning!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7THA75WLAWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013O6PV5A#wasThisHelpful","R1H7THA75WLAWV","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So anytime a band sets off to deliver a 2 or 3 part concept album over the course of multiple years itâs easy to question how consistent and cohesive the project will be by the time of its completion â¦ assuming it actually even reaches completion. So itâs a daunting task to say the least even for the greatest of bands. Even the mighty Dream Theater have never accomplished this feat (Metropolis the closest theyâve come to attempting) Well congratulations to Vanden Plas â a band quite accomplished in the realm of epic concept albums â for not only completing the task within a year but also for keeping the story, the sound quality and the production all consistent. For those not familiar with the first half of the project please refer to my review posted below. For those who have been eagerly awaiting the sequel to Path 1, you wonât be disappointed. As good as the opening act was, Path 2 is fierce, dark and delivers a much heavier collection of songs. One of my reservations with Path 1 was the somewhat more subdued nature of the songs â almost like the band was holding something back. Here, the tempo has been lifted throughout. And while there are still balladic moments throughout, I just think this disc is a much more intense listening experience. And while Vanden Plas has never been a shred band, these songs are crushing at times, yet remain melodic and passionate, which is the Vanden Plas way.Andy Kuntzâs ageless vocals still carry the band but everyone else has stepped up the performance factor as well â Wernoâs  synth contributions  coming to the forefront of the mix. His piano has always been integral to the Vanden Plas sound, but I love the diversity of keyboard sounds he brings forth on this disc. Andreas Lillâs drumming plays a greater role compared to Path 1 where he seemed to keep things fairly straight-forward â much more complexity, more double bass thumping and quite a bit more tempo all around. And the guitars of his brother Stephen Lill just shred â plenty of soloing leads this time around. I love the opening track âIn My Universeâ and the epic âBlood of Edenâ â a perfect song in 3 parts â the middle section with this insane âspeaking in tonguesâ vocal part where Kuntz showcases his talent for seamlessly shifting back and forth between multiple languages. For me this song is the highlight of the entire 2 disc project. Itâs dynamic, heavy, symphonic, melodic and beautiful all at the same time. The slightly commercial âMonsterâ is another hit where the main character realizes what he has become. âWhere Have the Children Goneâ is a dynamic power ballad which echoes back to Path 1 and then the tandem of âThe Last Fightâ and âCircle of the Devilâ serve as the grand finale to the story.With Path 2 not only has Vanden Plas effectively closed the circle on this series (in a timely fashion no less), but they have delivered yet another musical masterpiece â one which may just have topped all of their concept stories to date. Even if you are not a fan of the lyrical content (Iâm neutral not having read the books), the music alone will mesmerize. And for those who felt Path 1 was a bit more of a symphonic rock affair (and a bit subdued), I can assure you that Path 2 delivers a much more satisfyingly heavy progressive metal opera experience.For those that care about this kind of thing: the trifold digipak packaging is consistent from Path 1 to Path 2 yet the band pictures and graphics varied enough to give each Path its own distinctive ""look.""Path 1 - Germanyâs Vanden Plas, who started their career in the 90âs with a melodic metal style (Colour Temple) and then joined the commercial progressive metal genre ala Dream Theater with 1997âs The God Thing  and 1999âs Far Off Grace, have evolved into a progressive metal opera band over the course of the past decade. This new release follows in the same concept metal opera vein as 2006âs Christ O and 2010âs The Seraphic Clockwork.The band line-up remains basically intact with Stephen Lill (guitars), Gunter Werno (keys), Andreas Lill (drums) and Andy Kuntz (vocals) The new release is based on a series by the same name created by renowned German fantasy/sci-fi author Wolfgang Hohlbein who has been a fan of the band for some time and agreed to collaborate with them on this project. This is the first installment in the series. Without going in to much detail, the story chronicles the struggles of an immortal man to choose his destiny based on visions he is receiving from a satanic shape-shifter trying to trick him into giving up his humanity in exchange for the power to become a god.Musically, this follows closely with what has gone before, but I think the songs are better than on the last release. Kuntz sounds great â like his voice hasnât aged in the past 15 years â and Lillâs guitars anchor the Vanden Plas sound amidst the cacophony of choral arrangements, piano interludes and powerful drumming. Itâs basically a formula that has worked very well for this band for years and they remain consistent and engaging on all levels. Multi CD releases are tough to complete over long periods of time so I suspect we wonât have to wait another 4 or 5 years for the sequel. I donât really think there is anyone else out there right now doing the rock opera thing as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RC7LXSRVU07E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I062Q8#wasThisHelpful","R1RC7LXSRVU07E","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most enduring and creative forces in the Australian metal scene would have to be Teramaze. These guys have been around now for 2 decades (okay Dean Wells at least) and have survived multiple line-up changes (death of drummer Julian Percy about ended the band forever), as well as multiple stylistic (thrash, melodic, progressive and even emo) and lyrical permutations (Christian on Doxology and Tears to Dust â spiritually neutral on later releases). And just when it seemed like they had strung together two stellar releases with the same singer, out went Bret Rerekura. Never fear, with 2015âs Her Halo we are introduced to the youthful and energetic Nathan Peachey, whose vocal style is clearly melodic and yet doesnât veer too far from the sound of Teramaze at least since 2012âs Anhedonia. Peachey also co-wrote the lyrics with Wells so we have perhaps now the most accessible and emotionally driven Teramaze record to date. And as with all things Teramaze, evolution/change is the word once again. Those expecting a return to the thrashy Anhedonia or even the highly complex and progressive metal outing that was Esoteric Symbolism might be disappointed. But for me, even as much as I love those records (as well as 1998âs Tears To Dust), Her Halo, which represents a whole new side to this band, might just be my favorite to date.First off, this is a concept album â one which is set within the context of a carnival and features a trapeze artist and her complex relationship with the ringmaster/leader of the show (âthe tyrantâ). It appears to describe a love/envious/jealous, co-dependence type relationship but Iâm merely speculating at this point based on my understanding of the lyrics. More importantly, this isnât a âstory-tellingâ concept but instead more a âplayâ of emotions and struggles âplaying outâ in somewhat cinematic fashion. While this isnât symphonic metal by any stretch, there are some moments where we hear the sound effects of carnival music, the crowd cheering, some spoken dialogue (that is difficult to discern without headphones), the girl screaming when she falls (âTrapezeâ) and the fire burning in the end. The music builds in crescendo fashion with the swells in action so there is definitely a dynamic going on here that was not quite as evident on the much more musically dense Esoteric and Anhedonia. And while Her Halo definitely has some really heavy guitar driven riffs in almost every song, these songs are more satisfyingly melodic â almost catchy â and diverse. Think a mix of Dream Theater, Circus Maximus, Evergrey, Seventh Wonder, Kamelot, Conception, Balance of Power and of course Teramaze themselves.Not one to comment on every track â I think the listener should still have some mystery to explore about the music after reading a review â I will mention a few highlights. The opening track is breathtaking in how the music depicts the dream-like and distorted world of performers in the carnival. Keyboards, sound effects, spoken parts, complex melodies and rhythms intertwine in a lengthy track that would definitely appeal to Dream Theater fans. I love how the piano closes out the song with an unresolved chord â brilliant! The title track follows the crunchy âTo Love, A Tyrantâ and is a wonderfully dynamic composition with great melodies and more emotion than weâve ever had from these guys. The keyboard parts are perfectly juxtaposed with the heavy guitars so it almost plays out like a power ballad. The next two songs âOut of Consciousâ and âFor the Innocentâ represent the more melodic and catchy moments on the disc â the songs flow effortlessly with a great pace. The latter song screams Khan/Karevik (Kamelot) in the vocals but is the most inspirational song here for sure. As a drummer, I have to interject here that Dean Kennedy (drums) has outdone himself with this release â the driving rhythms, with just the perfect balance of pedal and tom accents, are prog for sure yet never overdone. The album closes out with the instrumental âTrapezeâ (which to my ears draws on some riffs from the bandâs past), the ballad âBroken,â and the fitting finale âDelusions of Grandeurâ which is similar in structure, yet more stream-lined than the opener.Her Halo is not an album that you are going to pick up and immediately fall in love with based on initial impression. But Iâve come to the conclusion â after many listens â that from a songwriting standpoint itâs their most dynamic, most diverse record to date and Jacob Hansen has given them a sound that can only be described as sublime. Without a doubt, for me, this represents the âsurprise of the year.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9V3MSR08L21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JCLPOU#wasThisHelpful","RA9V3MSR08L21","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Itâs been a long time since Iâve listened to Def Leppard with a less than critical ear. The only albums that Iâve ever really embraced from these guys are High N Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria. Yeah, Iâve experienced Adrenalize and Slang, but really havenât embraced much since then from them. But one thing I concede is that theyâve always been consistent and persistent. And while Iâve always missed the hard rocking days of the 80âs I can appreciate what theyâve accomplished since those iconic years long ago. So I heard all the hype about this release, about how it was all about going back to the roots.  Suffice it to say, Iâm glad itâs true â this release is basically a âbest ofâ everything Def Leppard collection of original songs. Most of the first half of the album represents the best of the ânewerâ plush side of the band while the second half of the album is a sort-of return to the rock and roll roots of the band. âSea of Loveâ is unexpected bridge with a 70âs rock vibe that is a bit of a surprise but then is followed by the overly commercial âEnergizedâ which, despite its pop vibe, works surprisingly well â the 2 song sequence an exhibition on the dual nature of these iconic rockers.But Def Leppard is a rock band that does it right â great vocal harmonies, catchy phrases, great melodies and great solos â¦ and jangly guitars (âBattle of My Ownâ and âLast Danceâ)! This 53 minute affair is a feast for those who love commercial rock with elements from just about every era from 1970 to 2010. Yes, these lyrics are a bit clichÃ© but so what? More than anything, this album is tons of fun. Joe Elliot is not quite as edgy/raspy as in days past, but he sounds great and the band sounds vital as well. The production/recording quality allows for loud play without listener fatigue. Easily the best music theyâve created in more than 2 decades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZI9CB8PX1ZYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DTAKFM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZI9CB8PX1ZYJ","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! Every once in a while something comes along out of nowhere that surprises even the most vigilant fan of progressive metal. I keep a pretty persistent finger on the pulse of the genre, but when I heard Marco Minnemann, Mike Lepond and Henrik Bath (Darkwater) were planning a recording with Tom Frelek (who is this master anyway?) I was more than intrigued but I was thinking â¦ what an unusual list of suspects â¦ like how did these guys hook up, right? Symphony X is nowhere geographically in proximity to Sweden â¦ and Minnemann is an extremely talented drummer who plays with the likes of Steve Wilson and many other high profile artist. What is he doing playing on this kind of release? But really who cares? This stuff is great. Those familiar with Darkwater and Harmony will immediately recognize Bathâs distinctive voice, although he does mix it up a bit more on this release with some really diverse singing. Donât think super group because none of these guys are basking in big revenues from their day jobs â and Frelek is the writing force behind this machine anyway â but you can be assured that these guys have indeed crafted music that musicians will strongly embrace and appreciate, as will many fans of progressive music. At 78 minutes in duration, thatâs a good thing.So the instrumental opener âCognitionâ introduces the style â dynamic prog metal with keys (love the piano), percussive riffs and plenty of muscle â these songs veer more to the metal intense side than the smooth, trippy prog rock side. Most of these songs are pretty heavy as Minnemann puts on his metal boots and really slugs out some epic moments here, accompanied by the crunchy yet not monotonous guitars/bass of Frelek and Lepond. There is some shred here but its tastefully articulated into the body of songs so it never feels overdone or over indulgent. And with the first vocal track, âAberrationâ we are assured that melody is indeed the focus of the vocal assault. Without a doubt this is an inspirational album â the lyrical theme in line with âbe awake, be alert, wake up and see, know whatâs going on in the world â¦ yet know there is hope in overcoming the fear that is so pervasive in our minds/in our world.â (My paraphrases). Some of the songs contain inspirational fragments from Martin Luther King, F.D.R., Marianne Williamson, J.F.K. and Timothy Leary. The cool thing here is that while much of this is kind of âproggyâ it doesnât feel that way because these guys never fail to connect with core emotions and truths, and the music never strays too far into the stratosphere either. In fact, there are some really commercial sounding moments throughout (âAcross The Horizon.â) And what progressive metal album would be complete without the epic track? The 18 minute title track delivers in every way.In the end, I love it. I love it when a band comes along and grants us a refreshing perspective and isnât afraid to go for everything despite the current trends in music. This album is huge, and it will take many weeks to unravel everything they have to offer both lyrically and musically. As always, Ulterium Records continue to support and cultivate great independent artists and Waken Eyes is going to do a lot to bolster that credibility.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNGU3VBRNJE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013O6PV1Y#wasThisHelpful","RMNGU3VBRNJE2","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review of DMM VinylAfter a long delay in the release sequence in this series (due to production issues) Exit Stage Left and Signals finally arrived almost within a few weeks of each other. While the somewhat highly criticized Exit was a nice interlude in the series, Signals was an album that I was really looking forward to in this series ... probably more so even than Moving Pictures. And while that release was clearly one of the best in the series, I was hopeful that Signals - with its ""digital"" synths - would sound equally amazing in this new analog version. Suffice it to say, I'm content. Mine arrived in near perfect condition - the only thing that seems askew is the slightly harsh noise between ""Losing It"" and ""Countdown"" on Side 2. Then again, there has been some variation in these records since the beginning of the series, some near perfect and others with a lot of pops and clicks. But there is a ton of bass tone on this pressing and at times it may slightly overwhelm Geddy's vocals. Still, it sounds amazing.Signals was a bit of a difficult record for me back when it was released because when you judge this in the footsteps of Moving Pictures it maybe felt like a bit of a let down. In fact, for many years I didn't even listen to these songs other than what played seemingly endlessly on the radio. But over time, as I listened to it on its own merit I grew in appreciation for what was going on musically and lyrically. Peart's reggae-like rhythms on ""New World Man"" and ""Digital Man"" really stand out now to me more so than they did back in the day. His role was a bit more of the rhythm driver on Signals rather than a virtuoso percussionist. And those synth sounds that everyone was so apprehensive about in the early 80's still sound perfect (especially on this vinyl) in 2015. This entire album really was/is the perfect blend of analog and digital - the merging of the old school and new (at least at that point in time) and it was quite genius how well they blended the two worlds, making this album the perfect bridge between Moving Pictures and the much more stripped down and commercial Grace Under Pressure. And most importantly, some 30 years later, these songs still move me - ""Subdivisions,"" ""The Analog Kid"" and the progressive ""The Weapon"" ...  and then there is ""Countdown,"" with its musical embellishment of the Columbia's history-making launch, which still to this day sends chills down my spine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSUR9MUQ75XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR7ZMHG#wasThisHelpful","R1LSUR9MUQ75XH","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2013, Stryper made a huge statement with No More Hell To Pay â no longer would they be content to wallow in the mediocre world of popular rock. That collection of original rockers resonated with the history of this band, their sound and their mission â to rock the hell out of you! The fans loved and embraced it, but when queried via social media, requested heavier and louder. So in response the band delivered Fallen, which is in essence, the perfect sequel to No More Hell To Pay. Many of these songs are indeed bold, riff-heavy, filled with shred and, yes with a few exceptions (âLove You Like I Doâ and âAll Over Againâ) they even rock just a bit harder. One aspect that really jumped out of the speakers at me was how absolutely perfect the huge punchy bass drum sound projects â that live kick that literally thumps the heart â and also how the mix really has a metal edge. As a band these guys are gelling in every aspect and that is certainly exciting to see at this later stage of their career. Too many highlights here, but the first 3 tracks, âHeaven,â âLet There Be Light,â and âKing of Kingsâ really do it for me, as does the cover of Sabbathâs âAfter Forever.âLyrically Stryper is delivering the same message/good news that theyâve been singing about since their buzz saw guitars first carved out their niche in the Hollywood metal scene over 30 years ago  â¦ and they do it with a humble conviction and sincerity that is unrivaled. I have to say, though, that Iâm a bit cautious of those touting this as the best and most important Stryper release ever. The enthusiasm over this release is without a doubt well-earned but a classic is defined by more than just a great start out of the gates and only time will tell how well these songs hold up. Consider how many lives an album like Soldiers Under Command or To Hell With the Devil have impacted? Still, there is no denying the positive push Fallen generates. Those who have been ardent fans since the beginning can take comfort in knowing that not only is Stryper committed to the metal cause and to their fans, but most importantly, they are still following their calling.Can't wait to get my white vinyl version next month!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A9E9AK4F5KNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011YDEJ0I#wasThisHelpful","R3A9E9AK4F5KNV","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When their first full concept album was released in 2000 (their only on Metal Blade Records) Symphony X was certainly at the top of the progressive/power scene. After two stellar releases in a row it was hard to imagine how the band would improve on their sound, but they did. While there was not a huge deviation or progression from the previous sound, there was plenty to boast of here. The biggest endeavor was to pull off the full concept album. While they dabbled with the concept idea on Divine Wings Of Tragedy, they had never previously devoted a whole album to one concept. Fan of mythology or not,the story played out nicely here and the story was well orchestrated for metal. The song structures matured with more of a 5 piece presentation than just Romeo/Pinella duel soloing. Lepond and Rullo (who returned to the drum throne here) stepped up the intricacy and intensity of their contributions as well. Allen's vocal performance remained as solid and consistent as ever, but as a whole, they had never sounded better. Like a symphony, to this day, the songs really flow effortlessly one into the other, which really gave this work credibility as a total concept piece. The heavy riffs were retained, but the neoclassical feel of the Twilight was replaced with a more pure, more original Symphony X sound. Fans of the old band could still enjoy all of the shredding, but the melodies and intricate rhythms really came to the forefront. And even though the band added some cool effects to the music, this is still metal. At the time I remember thinking Power Of Omens type technical metal on a few of these songs, but Symphony X always has their much more guitar riff driven and powerful sound. The big cathedral sounding vocal harmonies (ala Divine Wings of Tragedy) returned here in grand fashion as well. For fans of mythology and Greek and Roman mysticism this release was lyrically intriguing but was for me the only weakness. Later concept albums Paradise Lost and Iconoclast hold much more interest in that regard. Still, it has never kept me from marking it a perfect album. Clearly, this was at the time (and remains to this day) one of the best power/progressive releases ever, and from a purely musical standpoint it was the bands' best work to date.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26JFAHTG0ESTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YR6K#wasThisHelpful","R26JFAHTG0ESTJ","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is extremely difficult to follow up a masterpiece with something worthy in comparison. However, Symphony X not only succeeded in this endeavor, but they did so even within the span of one year and while enduring the exit of drummer Jason Rullo. Easy to say, Twilight lived up pretty well to the expectations of the fans, although there was a bit more progressive, melodic here which often lands this disc in a slightly less favorable category than Divine Wings of Tragedy. Despite criticisms, minus the big operatic vocals and choral sections, this disc felt almost like Divine Wings of Tragedy-Part II. Lyrically, however, they did tackle some different issues. Still, there really wasn't much change in style and I wonder if all these songs were mostly written when they released Divine - the song arrangement and selection very similar to the aforementioned masterpiece. Drummer Walling filled in for Rullo in grand fashion, just listen to the thundering intro to ""Dragon's Den"" to see what I mean. And overall, there was no let down in the quality of songwriting. The only fair criticism might be that they repeated themselves a bit on this release. Highlights include the beautiful ballad ""Lady of the Snow"" with its Japanese guitar line and ""Church of the Machine,"" which remains a magnificent song with some really cool lyrics and a very progressive vibe. The heaviest tune, ""Orion,"" echoed the heavier moments from the previous release and the epic tune ""Through the Looking Glass"" once again showcased the diversity and songwriting talents of this quintet. What else can be said, while Twilight stood in the ""twilight"" of the epic Divine Wings, its still maintained excellence and holds up very well to repeated play this many years later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JQIE76XPLA6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SGOFWQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JQIE76XPLA6R","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From a purely musical standpoint this album was and remains monumental - a testament to the creativity, power and passion of these 5 talented musicians. Listening to this again more than 15 years after I first fell in love with this band I still find these songs incredibly uplifting and powerful. While the progressive and lengthy nature of the songs definitely tipped (at the time) the sound in the direction of Dream Theater, these guys brandished a non-commercial, more classic pure power metal crunch that was second to none. Yet they also weaved this incredible operatic and classical fabric into the songs. In fact, to this day, I still quote this album as one of the best mixes of progressive and classical metal ever produced. And in addition to the new musical direction, Russ Allen hit his stride in this his first fully collaborative work with the band. His performance here is just superb, offering a nice mixture of intense/urgent and melodic styles. Musically, Romeo just shreds and the interplay between he and keyboardist Pinella would become a signature style for this band going forward. Despite the lengthy nature of many of the songs, the continuity during solo and breakout sections is maintained in a fashion that never grows dull. Rounded out by the punishing bass work of Lepond and Jason Rullo's dynamic drumming (the perfect blend of progressive and power metal drumming)this album captured a lot of attention, rightfully so. Some have criticized these songs as not being heavy (in comparison to say Iconoclast or Paradise Lost) but while there are more melodious, open and softer contrasts here, these songs are heavy metal. Just listen to any of the crushing riffs in ""Of Sins and Shadows,"" ""Sea of Lies,"" ""The Witching Hour"" or one of my favorites, ""Pharaoh.""While all of the songs here are riveting, 3 songs stand out this many years later (as did they back in the late 90's): the power ballad ""The Accolade"" remains a fan favorite - a song which not only showcases the bands' diversity but also their penchant for writing a lyric and melody that is quite infectious. And then the tandem of the epic 20 minute title track - replete with choral arrangements and a sweeping tale of epic woe and as much instrumental prowess anyone would covet from a progressive band - followed by the surprisingly beautiful ""Candlelight Fantasia"" remains a perfect finish to one of the greatest progressive metal recordings ever.

"Eight months on the heels of the promising, yet somewhat anemic debut/demo, the band somehow produced and recorded a follow up. More focused, and certainly better sounding than the debut, the band began to evolve into a real entity with this release, but the vibe was very similar to the debut, largely because all these songs were written by the band with Rod Tyler on vocals, who was replaced at the last minute by Russ Allen, who's vocal performance was solid but somewhat hurried. Fortunately, his style matched the bands' intensity and style perfectly but his input was too late to change the songs much, so in essence, this is what the first album might have been with Russ Allen on vocals. In other words, the band was not a band yet with all 5 members contributing to the overall sound and the result is a less than perfect, yet impressive collection of nicely produced neoclassical metal. This perhaps explains why some of these songs are incredible, like ""The Edge of Forever,"" and others just mediocre, like the title track, which has an extremely annoying chorus where Russ sounds uncomfortable. Likewise, the music on ""Dressed to Kill"" is good enough, but the vocals just sound awkward. Lyrically,they definitely deviated from the typical thinking man's metal type thought processes so common to the progressive genre. It is, however, this crossover of traditional/power metal lyrics with modern progressive metal that has set them apart from their peers and it is really neat to hear the origin of this style on the first two albums. Still, songs like ""Whispers"" that have a positive vibe lyrically and musically would continue to appear on later releases. One aspect of this album that is really enjoyable is the more open nature of the vocals. Nowhere else do we hear Russ's voice so exposed as on songs like ""Whispers,"" ""Secrets"" and to the biggest degree on the ""Winter's Dream,"" a song which really showcases his melodic quality. More diverse and dynamic, armed now with a credible and compatible vocalist, Symphony X would never look back. They had already pioneered a sound unique to the metal world and with this release really got the world's attention. With time and growth as a unit, these guys would go on to deliver classic metal masterpieces like The Divine Wings of Tragedy and The Odyssey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AOP6JJ98M2ES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00012BD0I#wasThisHelpful","R2AOP6JJ98M2ES","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So this is where it all began for one of the greatest progressive metal bands of the modern era. Inside Out, as part of their Special Edition series, released the band's first 4 discs in this format. Unfortunately, they were not remastered so there are no sound improvements here, which for this debut/demo release (as Michael Romeo refers to it in the macromedia interview contained on this enhanced version) is a big disappointment. While the majority of these songs are very average it is really interesting to hear the concepts and sounds that were present during the genesis of this band that would survive to later define the band's signature sound. Take the Queen-like vocal harmonies in ""The Raging Season"" or the neoclassical opening to the ""Masquerade."" Likewise, the heavy, yet lurching riffage at the beginning of ""Absinthe and Rue"" would become a staple for this bands rhythmic power metal sound in later masterpieces. Even the epic ""A Lesson Before Dying,"" which falls quite short of epic glory, gave hints not only to the bands talent but also to the musical and lyrical direction that this band would travel. The epic neoclassical progressive concept piece was really an original Symphony X contribution to the metal world because at the time no one was really doing this kind of thing in power metal.  Nevertheless, despite the early signs of brilliance, even the band would admit that this album was plagued with mediocrity, most notably in the production department. More importantly, the lackluster vocals of Rod Tyler seem thin and just don't seem to match up with the intensity of the music. For instance, the semi-ballad ""Shades of Grey"" just doesn't work and from this point the band never delved into the realm of commercial metal again. While the band has toyed with the idea of rerecording this album with Russ Allen on board, it doesn't sound like that is going to happen anytime soon (as Mike points out on the interview) because there are just too many weak moments or songs that just don't fit at all with the bands current musical direction. Despite its shortcomings, fans of the band will want to get this collector's piece because many of these songs may never again resurface.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKPTWKCMAOTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00012BD08#wasThisHelpful","R3FKPTWKCMAOTK","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically since 2007's Colors, with the exception possibly of the less than brilliant EP, little this band has produced has failed to enthrall. Parallax II: Future Sequence was, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the band's output in terms of shear mind-boggling technical brilliance married to an elusive, yet creative (sci-fi) concept. With that release they not only cemented their place in progressive metal history (one could fairly argue Colors and The Great Misdirect did the same) but also truly branded their own style.  Honestly, I didn't think it would be possible for them to get any better on that level and therefore am glad that instead of trying to repeat or better the effort, they've in fact, moved in a slightly different direction - one which clearly focuses more on melody yet is no less intense. And unlike Opeth, which went totally 70's prog with their most recent, I think BTBAM have accomplished this without sacrificing their trademark sound - one which they've worked for the better part of a decade to establish.So Coma Ecliptic is a different beast, yet it's comfortably within the scope of BTBAM. For the sake of those who are not familiar with this band (and with no insult to those who've been following them since Alaska days) I would say this is not their most innovative/original work - but it might just be their most accessible. Musically, if you could put the emotional tension (and slightly more melodic leanings) of Steve Wilson, the aggression of Opeth (up through Watershed anyway) and the furious technical brilliance of Dream Theater into one album I think that it might look and sound something like this. Unfortunately, it's not that simple and comparisons like that aren't fair to a band as original in sound as BTBAM. Still, it's a start - one way to depict with words the greatness of what's going on here. Many have speculated on the lyrics and the concept. They are very Steve Wilson-like in that much is left to the speculation/interpretation of the listener. No story here, the concepts of these songs are honestly elusive, and while there is a clear theme (a comatose individual reflecting on a whole lot of things) I don't so clearly see the different possible lives to which some have alluded.  The paradoxical nature of the song titles is however quite brilliant.While Rogers' melodic singing - which has a slight Cynic/Paul Masvidal vibe - comes to the forefront (Mastodon has done the same in recent years), the harsh vocals (still mostly discernable by the way) remain on the majority of songs here. I would argue they are an essential part of the BTBAM sound because the dynamic contrast they invoke is one of the exciting aspects of the band's music. However, songs like the introductory ""Node"" and the trance-like interlude ""Dim Ignition"" are perfectly wonderful with no screaming. In fact, it would have been nice to see the electronic ideas in the latter song developed a bit more on this release. Still, while keyboards do play a big role here, this is by no means a negative - there still is a ton of heaviness, speed and aggression.In summary, might be a bit of a polarizing release for the band, but in no way do I find that a negative. In fact, I suspect (as is the case with most ""progressive"" music) repeated listens will reveal much more than I can comment on here. These guys remain one of the best, most innovative bands in the scene, and they should be commended for their commitment to always pushing the envelope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IFYXHXQ8NUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN5U9FA#wasThisHelpful","R14IFYXHXQ8NUM","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Muse certainly has a gift for the unexpected - each release different, yet familiar all in the same. Drones is no exception - the utilitarian packaging and drab colored cover artwork the first indication that this would be a departure (both in presentation and sound) from the slick and glossy nature of the The 2nd Law. And while it's still slick/glossy at times (""Dead Inside"") most of this is a return to good commercial rock sensibility. The great riff and catchiness of ""Psycho"" sets the tone for the rest of this dystopian concept record. And in that regard it's great to see a band with this much influence in the pop music culture make a recording that works best by actually listening from start to finish - the way many of us who grew up in the 70's with vinyl still prefer to listen to music.Muse has always reminded me of Queen in so many ways - in the way they incorporate so many musical styles and cultural trends into their music - and with this very diverse collection of songs  Muse succeeds in this regard, yet all the while maintaining their own style/sound/attitude. ""Reapers"" is a great example - the song sounds like Van Halen (opening lead solo) meets Aerosmith (riff in the chorus section) but then ""Muse"" kicks in during the middle section solo section with the crazy effects. Similarly, ""The Handler"" and the epic ""The Globalist"" dazzle with quite a bit of musical wizardry. ""Mercy"" is probably one of the strongest songs on the record where the music perfectly enhances lyrics. The spoken parts are a bit distracting (and at times unnecessary) but I will say that hearing JFK's speech is eerie - very prophetic - and I like the interspersed sound effects on that track. And on the track which follows, ""Defector,"" the Queen-like chorus is nicely juxtaposed to the Muse quirkiness. Of course, Bellamy's love and respect for classical music shines forth with the cleverly and ingeniously arranged version of Da Palestrina's ""Sanctus and Benedictus."" Overall, Drones easily represents their best work since Black Holes and Revolutions and this just keeps getting better with repeated play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODFOJK0TSBAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHZMGBY#wasThisHelpful","R1ODFOJK0TSBAQ","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By nature, instrumental music gravitates toward the self-indulgent, so expectations here should not be for anything less than experimental, technical brilliance with tons of soloing and challenging rhythms. This is now the third installment for Abnormal Thought Patterns (the instrumental trio of Jasun and Troy Tipton plus drummer Mike Guy), the debut release in 2011 and the second in 2013 (Manipulation Under Anesthesia). Furthermore, those already familiar with Jason and Troy Tipton's work with Zero Hour (and their newer, somewhat less technically complex incarnation Cynthesis) are aware that their style of progressive metal is quite unique - complex, rhythmic yet melodic all the same. This time around they've employed the help of Jason Montero (guitars), and guests Tim Roth (Into Eternity), Jeff Loomis (Nevermore), John Onder and the venerable Michael Manring (fretless bass). Most surprising is the appearance of Tommy Rogers (Between the Buried and Me) on the releases' only vocal track ""Nocturnal Haven."" And while they really aren't treading any new waters here, the production quality and sound is perhaps the best of the three ATP releases so far.Just shy of 50 minutes, there is plenty to enjoy and absorb, but it's worth noting that ""Nocturnal Haven,"" a vocal version and an instrumental version included, comprises nearly half of the disc. Because the vocals give the song such a different vibe, it still really feels like two different tracks, so those who are worried about being cheated out of full length have nothing to fear. I believe the solos are different as well. The vocal version features the dynamic Rogers harsh alternating with melodic vocals fans of his band are already very familiar with. He sounds very at home with the Tipton boys here which should not be surprising given the nature of the mathematical genius of BTBAM. The instrumental version features some amazing fretwork from Jeff Loomis, Tim Roth, Jason Montero and of course the mastermind behind this project Jasun Tipton himself. While this is certainly the feature track here, the other tracks are quite impressive as well, particularly ""Synesthesia"" - featuring incredible bass work by Troy and Manring - and my favorite track ""Delusions,"" which features some nice percussion work by the unsung hero Mike Guy. He may not be a Portnoy/Peart acolyte but his style of heavy percussive drumming - at times more straight ahead than many prog drummers - suits this music well and he has been with the Tipton brothers since the inception of Zero Hour.Overall, while not the kind of music you rock out to cruising down the highway, the Tipton brothers have managed to once again dazzle with their creativity and technical prowess. Always edgy, progressive and modern, Altered States never fails to engage/enthrall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQ3WYSSHSY93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH64AU6#wasThisHelpful","R3FQ3WYSSHSY93","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without a doubt, The Skull's debut release is the 2014 wins the sleeper of the year award in my book. Not only did I miss this release the first time around, but when I first listened to this nearly a month ago I was a bit unsure. Safe to say, that initial impression was totally unfounded. Once these doomy hooks and trippy lyrics (just listen to the opening track) infiltrate the spaces in your brain listening to this music becomes a totally immersive head-banging experience. From the heavy, distorted guitar riffs to the wild bass reverb to the plodding and lurching drums to Eric Wagner's ""Jim Morrison-like"" voice these songs bleed with heavy metal reality.I suspect my initial bias against this may have been partly due to the evanescent nature of the band since inception (2012) with the revolving door of players, particularly drummer Jeff Olson. Also, my doubts about this essentially Trouble ""reunion"" band being able to pull it all together tainted my initial impressions. Once again, I was wrong. But while these songs echo much of Trouble's early sound (particularly Psalm 9 and The Skull), this band is a different entity with other (Pentagram) influences. In a way, in my head and as strange as it may sound, this music sounds like a mix of Sabbath and The Doors. Perhaps the song ""The Door"" ironically reminds me the most of the latter band, but even the swingy feel to ""Send Judas Down"" with the controversial lyrics reminds me a lot of Morrison for some reason. Wagner's haunting spoken word in the breakdown section is akin to something Morrison or even Peter Steele might have attempted. Lyrically most of this album is very consistent with early Trouble, but yet this music feels fresh and full of rays of hope and light. I absolutely love the epic title track. Not only is this an amazing song from the doom metal aspect, but the sobering lyrics are an inspiration as to how we should be reaching out instead of condemning everything around us. It is easy to recommend this to fans of early Trouble, yet anyone who misses the more organic and less processed feel of vintage metal will find this rewarding on many levels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJCULNS8GQUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB2BY5O#wasThisHelpful","R2BJCULNS8GQUV","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now with a permanent singer and this new 6 track EP the band has finally nailed it. They've delivered 5 great original songs plus the Malmsteem cover track. Multi-vocalist releases are fun but to me the band now feels like a very tight unit with their own identity. The songs are hard-driving, melodic and uplifting all at the same time. Plenty of neoclassical virtuosity here and tons of guitar crunch and the new vocalist really stands out with great clarity. I think the biggest improvement is just the great songwriting quality and that these songs are so darn catchy. Along with the new Within Silence release, Eastern European metal is making a strong statement and kudos to Ulterium for putting out such great music this past year. Look forward to hearing a new full length with this line-up but for now will be wearing this out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QLH10IFIL2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1GQ4GM#wasThisHelpful","R33QLH10IFIL2Q","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Within Silence (formerly Rightdoor) is a high quality melodic power metal band recently signed to Ulterium, and Gallery of Life is their very solid debut. This youthful 5 piece Slovakian band has a very credible twin guitar attack with plenty of heavy, melodic riffing and a singer that has the pipes to carry the music. Martin Klein sounds like a cross between Herbie Langhans and Bruce Dickinson - more like the former due to his thick East European accent ... and the accent/vocal phrasings are the only thing slightly negative about this otherwise very talented and powerful singer. Guitarist Richard Germanus contributes some pretty cool harsh vocals on a few tracks (which works pretty well for the most part but nods a bit to the current trend in metal) in addition to his very competent shredding. Producer Jan Cvercko contributes the keyboards here, providing more atmosphere than melody but sometimes contributing to the melody as well. Expect quality drumming as well, driven by fast double bass as would be typical for the genre. Musically this band really reminds me of Seventh Avenue but there are hints of Iron Maiden, especially with the way the lead guitars drive the melody much of the time (""Judgement Day"" in particular). Still, the formula is more Euro power metal than traditional British metal.There are some fantastic songs here, like the aforementioned ""Judgment Day"" and the entire first 5 tracks (not including the intro which is unnecessary in my opinion) which really shred. Lyrically these guys are unabashedly Christian, and for the most part they steer clear of cheesy material. While ""World of Slavery"" is a great metal anthem, with a really catchy chorus and Celtic riffing throughout, I think ""Road to the Paradise"" suffers a bit of a letdown in quality - the vocal phrasing near the end a bit awkward at the end of the song - but it's still a good song. Regardless, Within Silence can be very proud of what they've delivered with this debut and I am definitely excited about their future. Recommended for fans of power metal in general, but particularly those of Theocracy, Seventh Avenue and the first Sinbreed release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOJJWN9X7JWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1GQ44Y#wasThisHelpful","R1HOJJWN9X7JWM","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I had wondered why the second half of the ""e"" in the Savatage logo was missing from the spines of my Ear Music reissue collection ... and here is the final installment. Little did I know this version of Streets was even in the works let alone with a DVD full of additional bonus material and music videos spanning the years from 1987-1996. Additionally, ""Larry Elbows"" shows up at the end of the Streets disc as a missing chapter from the opera. First of all, the Ear Music reissues have been a great series with a plethora of insightful commentary by Jon Oliva, sharp-looking packaging and some bonus material. This tri-fold digi-pak is no exception and the liner book contains all of the original lyrics and narration plus extra photos and Oliva's interesting commentary on the 9 videos. It's nice to have all this in one package - especially the videos in one place - but the extra audio songs on the DVD, while nice, were probably not necessary. In any case, the narrated version of Streets is the main reason for the purchase here (other than to round out the collection of course). Oliva explains how he had to alter his voice for the narration but I really think it makes the whole composition feel more cohesive and more like the ""opera"" it was designed to be. The narrated tracks seem louder than the song tracks but otherwise this works well. One of the highlights would have to be the background ""street"" noises that were added to the narration giving the story a more authentic feel. Apparently these sounds were literally culled from the streets of NYC. Nice. Not much else to say about one of the most beloved concept rock pieces ever except that now it is nice to have both versions.

"It has been a long 3 years since the excellent Tommy Karevik debut (Silverthorn) with Kamelot and so Haven comes with much anticipation for long-time fans. First impressions are important, and on that front this release sounds really good. In fact, these songs sound great. Where Silverthorn was deeply conceptual - both in presentation and in musical continuity - Haven is loosely conceptual (no storytelling here) yet musically no less intense. Actually, these songs are really heavy for Kamelot and this may be their most musically aggressive release since The Fourth Legacy. I love this band because they perfectly meld traditional power, symphonic and progressive metal in a way really not matched by anyone out there. And while the departure of Roy Khan was a big event, Tommy Karevik is the perfect replacement - he proved that on Silverthorn and once again demonstrates his vocal brilliance on this release. To me, the vocal mix is perfect, but the music takes on a much bigger role here which is positive.So there is no big story this time, but the songs do have a lyrical focus - with the brutality of the world around us and our own personal demons where do we go for a haven? There is no fantasy here - these are lyrics we can all relate to. In this regard ""My Therapy"" is a highlight for sure - ""Come and take me off my daily dose of pain/take me off and shelter me."" Yeah that.One of the great things about Kamelot is that they sound like Kamelot. This is a compliment of course and probably partly due to long-time producer Sascha Paeth who has been helping to steer the course of this band for over a decade. Sacha Paeth is to Kamelot what Paul O'Neill was to Savatage. So everything from the songwriting to the concept to the presentation to the media is brilliant. And let's not forget these very talented musicians. Youngblood has never been a shredder, yet he perfectly plays his part in this theater, along with drummer Casey Grillo who puts forth one of his best performances to date. In the tradition of cooperation, label mate Charlotte Wessels (Delain) lends her very capable voice in duet with Karevik on the melancholy ""Under Grey Skies."" Alissa White-Gluz contributes her harsh and melodic vocals on two of the strongest tracks here - ""Liar Liar"" and ""Revolution."" Her shrill vocals on these two tracks lends to the heavy nature of both the music and the lyrics. And the choral elements are still present as well so there are plenty of connections with prior works - it all comes together very well.Whereas the first part of the album is pretty much in the traditional Kamelot vein, the final four full length songs really make this album special because they are emotionally and musically intense - dark yet hopeful, the Kamelot paradox. ""Here's To The Fall"" is a hauntingly beautiful ballad that perfectly encapsulates the themes of the record and is followed by the climactic ""Revolution"" - one of the heaviest Kamelot tunes to date. Grillo's uncharacteristic four on the floor approach to the beat is a refreshing change-up from the 16th and 32nd note driven speed he so often delivers. The instrumental title track closes things out in cinematic fashion. Overall, while not quite as enthralling as the complex and emotional Silverthorn, Haven is an excellent follow-up and one of the heaviest Kamelot releases ever.This is the jewel case version but Napalm has released this in Mediabook edition with bonus instrumental CD, limited edition versions in earbook, canvas and wooden box versions (all with the 2 CDs) and finally an LP version. Sadly the limited edition versions were only released in 500 quantity counts and were directly sold from Napalm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUREMJW6XABM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRLHXCQ#wasThisHelpful","RUREMJW6XABM","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay so I don't usually review women's shoes but I bought these for my wife as a birthday gift and she loves these. We had bought the same shoe last year from Dillards in another color and she loved them so much she requested them in black. Prior to last year we had never heard of this brand but the shoes are made in Vietnam and are made in European sizes. Lightweight but with much more comfort and support than most dressier shoes, these are one of the most comfortable heeled shoes my wife has ever worn and they look great so work well for casual to semi-formal. One of the best features is the Velcro on all three leather straps which makes these immensely adjustable yet you wouldn't know just looking at it.

"Ambeon = ""ambient"" plus Ayreon. In 2001 Arjen Lucassen discovered 14 year old Astrid Van Der Veen, combined some of the elements of Ayreon's music to create the enthralling 10 song underground release. Now, he has added a few tracks and included a whole second disc which contains an unplugged concert featuring Atrid, Arjen, Ewa Albering (flute) and Dewi Kerstens (cello) playing most of the songs from Fate of a Dreamer plus Ayreon songs. All this is packaged in a lush tri-fold digipak with new liner notes by Arjen. Pretty much everything the man touches is gold, and these somewhat dark, yet futuristic tunes are no exception.

"Vinyl VersionRush continued to expand their sound with this release. Instead of one long 20 minute opus this time they honed it down to two smaller compositions, the first of which is one of the band's most beloved tunes of all time ""Xanadu"" and the second the first part of a larger composition that would culminate on the next release Hemispheres. Just about no one was writing in this style at the time especially not with the confidence to record a prequel on one record and the sequel on another. In order to expand their sound, Peart incorporated all kinds of percussion equipment, such as the tubular bells, orchestra bells, chimes and the vibra slap to name a few. Lee and Lifeson also added a few tools to their arsenal as well with the bass pedals, Mini Moog and those ridiculous 12 string guitars. Of course while the epic songs here showcased the band's penchant for prog extravagance, the melodic and moving ""Closer To The Heart"" - as well as the simple, yet entertaining ""Cinderella Man"" - nicely balanced the ""heady"" works to provide the band's best and most diverse recording up to that point in time. ""Cygnus X-1"" is the highlight and remains one of my favorite Rush songs ever. From the very sci-fi sound effects in the intro to the throbbing bass riffing and stellar guitar leads, this song just is just so cool. Overall, this album - while not as groundbreaking as 2112 - was a refinement in the Rush sound and a definite improvement in song-writing quality compared to its predecessor.My vinyl version arrived in excellent condition and sounds perfect. In addition to the double gate-fold replica (with lyrics printed inside the gate-fold)and the FLAC download card there is a photo sheet reproduction from the original album sleeve. Really, for those that have never heard these Rush albums on vinyl you are in for a treat, and for those of us that grew up on a steady diet listening to these records over and over again, this is not only a great trip down memory but this release has never sounded better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R233KGR3H118XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR7ZMN0#wasThisHelpful","R233KGR3H118XU","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The magical collaboration of Rob Rock and Chris Impellitteri, which began all the way back in 1987 with the self-titled EP, has long been a successful venture. Ever since I first heard the Victim of the System EP in '93 I was hooked on this amazing combination of Rock's powerful vocals and Impellitteri's virtuoso guitar leads and solos. And although there has been a whole bevy of talented musicians who have worked with the band over the past 2 decades, Rock and Impellitteri have remained the core of the band's success. In essence, their work together eclipses what either have accomplished doing their own separate thing - and that says a lot.Venom picks up right where 2009's Wicked Maiden left off and that's no easy task. Wicked Maiden (the release which marked the return of Rob Rock to the band after a hiatus for 2002's System X and 2004's Pedal To The Metal) was a brilliant amalgamation of elements from their best albums: the melodic hooks of Answer To The Master and the speed, heaviness and progressiveness of Screaming Symphony. Venom is a beast for sure, once again featuring catchy melodies and superb guitar leads. Impellitteri (who like Tourniquet drummer Ted Kirkpatrick is heavily influenced by the classical composers) has such a distinctive style that the music is immediately identifiable - speedy melodic metal with catchy riffs and really fast guitar solos. It's shred and it's definitely not dead. No ballads here. The more than capable southpaw John Dette - who has played with the likes of Killing Machine, Testament, Slayer and Animetal (with Impellitteri himself) - steps in on drums and delivers a performance on par with the style put forth by Glen Sobel on the last release - lots of double bass sixteenth note rolls. Long time Impellitteri bassist James Pulli rounds out the foursome. The culmination of sounds is a melodic metal shred fest - wonderfully produced - that is second to none.While many of the songs are quite up-tempo, there are a few slower rockers like the quintessential Impellitteri ""Face the Enemy"" with its plodding and mesmerizing lead riff. Chris's solo on this song is short but sweet, every note perfectly placed and executed. ""Nightmare"" has a slightly modern vibe and ""Rise"" has a really sick opening riff followed by a great exhortational chorus. The break out/solo section smokes as well. Lyrically this stuff is totally consistent with Rock's prior output of scathing/warning type lyrics mixed with uplifting and powerful praises and metal anthems. The ""bonus"" tracks - not an afterthought by any means - feel more like a continuation of the powerful pummeling that has come before so definitely worth obtaining the version with these songs.It's easy to recommend this release for fans of the band of course but also to anyone who misses true shred. And if you've never heard these guys before ... no better time than the present to taste this venom!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMGJCCTZV0Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THJPI2U#wasThisHelpful","RAMGJCCTZV0Q5","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best releases from 2012Lucassen's second ""solo"" release continues (both musically and lyrically) somewhat in the Ayreon vein, but instead of employing the help of a multitude of singers, he handles all the vocals himself - oh yeah, and he does it with ease and clarity. The concept here plays off the themes from the Ayreon series as Mr. L. returns to the future from stasis and is guided by Dr. Voight-Kampff (voice of Rutger Hauer) on a tour through ""the new real."" Not surprisingly, there is plenty of humor here - Arjen never one to take himself (or his music) too seriously. While most of the situations here are pure fantasy/sci-fi, one can't help but marvel at the prophetic nature of the topics presented in songs like ""E-police,"" ""Parental Procreation Permit"" or even ""Dr. Slumber's Eternity Home."" Its great stuff lyrically and conceptually and Hauer's ""flat affect"" as he presents information to Mr. L., just adds to the absurdity (and the credibility) of it all. Musically, this could best be defined as progressive rock with a heavy, trippy vibe. It's classic Lucassen really and no fan of his music will be disappointed by these catchy, clever and melodic tunes.Disc 2 contains five songs that were created for, but not included in, the ""new real"" as well as covers of some great tunes from the era of psychedelic rock. Of these original compositions, the two standouts are ""The Social Recluse"" - a commentary on the hazards of living in ""virtual reality"" - and ""The Space Hotel."" In the end, though, these songs are not essential. For me, the two highlights on the second disc are the cover of Floyd's ""Welcome to the Machine"" - a really heavy version of this classic tune - and the cover of BOC's ""Veteran of the Psychic Wars"" - a long lost classic. Zeppelin fans will love the ""Battle Of Evermore"" as well, but this version adds little to that classic. And what prog disc would be complete without a Zappa (""I'm The Slime"") tune?As always, the production quality on both discs is fantastic, and the hard book digi is beautifully crafted with amazing artwork to boot. Overall, while fans of Arjen's heavier works may be a bit disappointed by the lack of ""metal"" on this release, most of his followers - as well as any die-hard fan of prog and 70's rock - will thoroughly enjoy this insightful and entertaining project. This man can do no wrong!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD4GW9V8GVIFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007O3BGPE#wasThisHelpful","RD4GW9V8GVIFM","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Classic Lacuna Coil. Sporting a fantastic cover, Dark Adrenaline revisits the heaviness of Karmacode and the catchy melodies of Comalies. This is simply a divine performance by Cristina and company - perhaps their strongest ever - and definitely one of the best releases of 2012. After perhaps 20 spins of this CD, I've yet to tire of the interplay between Cristina and Andrea - and the riffs feel heavier this time around, a decidedly more metal approach when compared to Shallow Life. The deluxe package version contains a very cool poster of the cover picture, a guitar pick, a ""dark adrenaline"" sticker and the Dark Passengers DVD. The latter contains 6 very creative, ""indie"" mini movies with various themes (mostly the horror type) - the soundtrack the instrumental versions of many of the songs on the release. In fact, by listening to the DVD tracks (sans vocals) a greater appreciation of the quality of the music is fostered. For Lacuna Coil the instruments always provide the backdrop for what the vocalists are doing, but with Dark Adrenaline, both are balanced to near perfection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z2IKK95TY42A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061TQBRK#wasThisHelpful","R2Z2IKK95TY42A","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those not familiar with Eden's Curse, now is a great time to discover this very talented and persevering melodic rock/metal band. This multi-nation band has been around for almost a decade and despite enduring multiple line-up changes (and almost calling it quits) they have released 4 great albums. Anchored by original members Paul Logue (bass and production) and Thorsten Koehne (guitars) they've managed to craft some really high quality music during that time. Michael Eden (whose style resembles Michael Sweet) was the singer for the self-title debut, The Second Coming and the engaging Trinity, but in 2013 Serbia's Nikola Mijic took over the vocal reigns with conviction and the band delivered possibly their best work yet with Symphony of Sin. That same line-up (sans original band drummer Pete Newdeck) charges through this 18 song set (plus guitar solo and band introductions) with passion and fervor. The majority of the songs (not surprisingly) are from the newest release (8), but there are 4 from Trinity, 3 from The Second Coming and 2 from the debut, and then the digital single from 2012 ""Time to Breathe."" Mixed and mastered by Dennis Ward (who also mixed Symphony of Sin) this live set, recorded November 28th, 2014 in Glasgow, Scotland, delivers in every way.So how does it sound? Well, this is a great live recording. All of the voices are well balanced in the mix and there is no muddy low-end - the chest thumping bass is crisp and punchy - and plenty of crowd noise. The band really gels and its apparent they were ""on"" this night which is remarkable given that drummer John Clelland is new to this music. Steve Williams keyboards provide an AOR/rock vibe ala Europe and they nicely support the two guys that really steal the show here - Nikola and Thorsten. Nikola soars above the music like a Steve Perry or Steve Walsh, with vocal clarity, conviction and passion. He does a great job getting the crowd into the show without being obnoxious. Thorsten's guitar leads and solos are fantastic, really giving this band the metal edge that sets them apart - his nearly 2 minute solo a throwback to 80's live show indulgences. Lyrically Eden's Curse has always been positive and that vibe definitely comes across in the live show. Overall, their debut live performance/recording is a huge success. While last year's AOR/rock W.E.T. release was really good, Eden's Curse may have outdone them here. Regardless, it's great to see a band reap the rewards for sticking it out through tough times and staying true to their signature sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19YUUQ2VDWPA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVYNTIM#wasThisHelpful","R19YUUQ2VDWPA9","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Revisiting the Rush catalog on this new vinyl (DMM) medium is pretty exciting and the debut starts the collection off with a bang. I have to say that this album was never one of the albums that really started me on Rush - for me it was Permanent Waves. However, in that I grew up in the 70's with vinyl, I have to say this recording (these songs) has a lot of nostalgic meaning to me some 40 years later. For now obvious reasons the rock 'n' roll (non prog) roots of Rush are now legacy and without these groovy songs the band might have never delivered the epics such as 2112 and Hemispheres or even the immensely popular Moving Pictures. Anyway, suffice it to say, these songs have never sounded better.This copy (the in the box version) arrived unscathed with no warping. The weight of the record is perfect and everything in the box in good condition. My immediate impression of the DMM recording is one with more treble presence compared to older versions and more of the ""pops"" than might be expected. But this is consistent with everything I've read about the process so no surprises there. It retains the warmth of vinyl with a bit more treble than most vinyl recordings putting the sound in a nice comfortable place between the old and the digital. In essence, the sound quality is perfect for vintage vinyl listening.The box extras are icing on the cake. For me, the ""family tree"" is the most enjoyable ""extra"" in this set, along with the sturdy box. But everything here is retro all the way which is great. I look forward to all of the vinyl reissues just like back in the day when bringing home a new record from the Camelot store was like opening up Christmas!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBQNIPKQ90KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKM5O60#wasThisHelpful","R2HBQNIPKQ90KA","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the perfect table for those that are either new to vinyl or re-entering the vinyl scene (like myself) due to frustrations with the ridiculously overly compressed material now being released on most CDs. And for this price its a steal. Mine arrived nicely packaged by Amazon, but when I saw the manufacturer's box had a slight tear/opening near one corner I was a bit apprehensive given the number of reviews here that have found damaged units. Once I got everything unpacked (this is a well-packed unit for this price range)all parts were undamaged and no cracks in the dust cover. It is very easy to assemble as advertised, only needing to place the counterweight and headshell on the tonearm and the platter/mat on the table. The dust cover hinges come back out a bit too easy when you remove the dust cover but that is a minor issue and probably by design to prevent the platic cover from cracking easy near the hinge insertion during removal. In any case, this unit is also very easy to set up. Balancing the tonearm took about 2 minutes and then the other minor adjustments to the weight and antiskating dial pretty straight forward. I just went with the manufactur's recommendation of 2 gm based on the info provided in the very user friendly owner's manual. One thing to consider before buying may be the playing surface required. This is a big and heavy unit and you need a flat surface with about 18 inches of depth and about the same in width so it doesn't fit into most A/V cabinets because its too deep. And, if you plan to play with the dust cover on then you will need quite a bit of room avobe the unit for clearance. Because the hinge ""locks"" in the up position at a 45 degree angle you need that extra clearance. Those space issues aside, the wide circular feet suction down nicely on slick surfaces and this thing is solid and well-balanced. Its a little tricky to pick up due to the suction but there are grooves on the bottom sides of the unit that make it really easy to lift/carry.Its a great looking unit as well, doesn't look or feel cheap.I've only been spinning new vinyl (as all my stuff from the 70's and 80's is pretty abused)but am very pleased with the sounds.The cartrigde that comes with the unit is adequate for most rock/metal and louder music - there might be some issues for those that like lighter music or jazz as the volume output isn't high. I don't know if that is the cartidge or the unit itself, maybe a combination of both. The greatest thing here is that there is no listener fatigue at high volume (the curse of modern overly compressed digital rock and metal).The features on this unit are really impressive for a TT in this price range. I love how easy it is to stop/start and change directions. The speed is perfect on quartz mode but easy to change with the pitch variation engaged. One caveat with this is that the little LED light next to the slider stays green in quartz mode and in the center position even when the quartz is disengaged to allow for pitch variation. in other words, the light only changes to red once the quartz is disengaged AND the slider is moved out of that center position. There isn't any indicator on the quartz button itself to tell you that its on or off. I like the strobe light but its not necessary, just looks cool. The pop up stylus light is a very nice feature as well and even the way the 45 adapter fits into the deck is well-designed.Others have commented on the software and ease of copying vinyl but I honestly don't plan to use this function at this time. Nothing I currently own on vinyl is going to sound better copied to CD than the CD versions of those albums I've collected over the past 30 years.Very pleased overall. For the non ""audiophile"" audiophile this is a great TT and a great way to recaputure the magic of analog music without spending a fortune.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30B75QVHQAKNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S1CJ2Q#wasThisHelpful","R30B75QVHQAKNV","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed drawers to store sheet music, small drum equipment, drumsticks, etc. and these work really well because they fit nicely near both my kits. I looked at smaller Sterilite (and similar) units but the drawers were too small to store 8.5 x 11 sized sheets/books. These drawers are all of more than adequate size - the inside of the drawer about 15 x 16 inches. The top drawers work great for smaller items and sheet paper while the lower drawer is large(deep) enough to hold cleaning solutions, tools, drum beaters, sticks, etc. The top of the unit is flat about 16 x 17.5 inches so also provides a fairly sturdy storage surface. Keep in mind these are made of plastic. I would have loved to have found a more solid unit like this (with a flat top and pull out drawers) but surprisingly there isn't much out in this size unit (big enough to hold what I describe above yet small enough to fit in a tight space). Most units are much smaller or larger cabinets with pull out bins that take up too much space. But with the weight of the drawers mostly full this doesn't move around much which is great. The wheels work well even at full capacity, but I use the second unit without the wheels (purposely) and it sits more firmly in place as would be expected. I think this unit would be a bit too large to use on a desk top but without the wheels it could work. Would have to put some kind of anti-skid mat or material on the bottom side though if using on a slick surface such as a desktop or smooth tile or hardwood flooring. On carpeted surface it stays nicely in place. Because the clear plastic is corrugated this has a somewhat more ""stylish"" appearance than the cheaper Sterilite storage drawers, and the drawers are less transparent as well. Overall, for what I needed this is the cheapest and quickest solution. I wouldn't want to take them on the road (not sturdy enough) but for home or studio use they work great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TEB16U3446NO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITLCHCG#wasThisHelpful","R1TEB16U3446NO","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those that may not have seen this already I'm reposting since my other review was basically hi-jacked.OverviewHand. Cannot. Erase. is quite different from Raven, both conceptually and musically. First off this is definitely a concept album whereas Raven was a collection of ""stories."" Second, the jazz elements from Raven are less prevalent, in my opinion, with more straight forward elements of rock appearing. This has the effect/vibe of making the music feel more accessible. There is more of an electronic feel and the keyboards (both electric and acoustic) seem to play a greater role. There are some ambient passages as well so the overall listening experience from song to song definitely feels more cohesive. Those comparisons aside, this is just another great collection of music from probably one, if not the, most relevant and talented, hard-working artists in the scene.Deluxe Earbook Edition (2CD/DVD/Blu-ray)While there is no doubt that the music of this release stands by itself as a work of art, the earbook and the discs contained therein represent a completely immersive tactile, aural and visual experience of unprecedented proportions. Steve Wilson once again collaborates with Lasse Hoile (photography), Hajo Mueller (illustrations) and Carl Glover (design/artefacts). While Raven's Limited Edition book set a precedent of its own, it should not be surprising that Wilson and friends have pushed the envelope further in terms of the quality and depth of not only the music but the art and the visual and tactile presentation as well. This limited edition is better in every aspect.The StoryKarolina Grzybowska ""stars"" (aka models) as ""H"" - a woman in her 30's who is estranged from her family and friends. An introvert, she prefers a life of solitude with as little interaction with the busy and somewhat insincere world around her. The story begins with H's childhood/family background and progresses quickly to her adolescence where her parents adopt a 16 year old ""sister"" named ""J."" H and J quickly become connected and share some of their experiences, music, friendship, etc. In only 6 months the parents separate and so do the two girls. This is only minimally traumatic - yet significant - for H who prefers her own company anyway. H meets up with a boyfriend in college but subsequently distances herself from him when she feels things are getting too ""serious."" Further distancing herself from the world around her, H begins to have ""visitors"" who question her about her attachments and relationships. H develops a fascination with news stories about people who ""disappear,"" and the interaction with the visitors and her own questions about her ability to be invisible to those around her raise questions about her significance and purpose in life. The rest of the story is more speculative and can best be left to the listener's/reader's interpretation. Suffice it to say, there is much more depth provided in the artbook - too much more information would spoil the story. There are still things I've not yet figured out yet as well. I will say that this story was inspired by a real story as Wilson points out on the DVD, but the story presented here varies quite a bit from the true-life version.The ArtbookThis 108 page hard-bound book is a work of art itself. Not only does it contain pictures and art chronicling the story of H, but it contains ""artifacts"" - such as a birth certificate, childhood journal, newspaper clippings, postcard - which help elucidate the story and make you feel as if you are actually touching the items owned by this young woman. The story is presented in a journal fashion from the standpoint of the woman H. Each entry enhances the meaning and character behind the songs. Additionally, the lyrics to each song are cleverly contained within journal entries, diary entries and other media. It's really quite brilliant. The written words certainly help capture not only the meaning behind the songs but also help enhance their emotional/human connection. This is art at its highest calling - the connection between visual, tactile and aural - perfectly executed.Disc 1/The MusicThe opening song ""First Regret"" is essentially an ambient piano prelude to ""3 Years Older"" which is an upbeat, rhythmic piece featuring a driving bass guitar line reminiscent of Geddy Lee, and Minnemann throws in a few Peart-like drum fills as well. The beginning and ending definitely has a Rush vibe but the song middle is a mixture of styles - the dynamic contrast between soft and loud sections pretty extreme. The solo section beginning around the 8 minute mark is one of the few times where the band really lets loose on this release and they ride it out to the end of the track. Lyrically, this song chronicles the early stage of the main character's life and H's interactions with her sister J.The title track follows and is the most easily loveable song on the disc; it's immediately appealing with its sing-along melody and catchy chorus. This is certainly the most radio friendly song on the release. Lyrically it alludes to the main character's ""break-up"" with her boyfriend and provides a lot of insight into how she views relationships in general.""Perfect Life"" is a mix of narration during the first half and Wilson repeating the chorus over top of some electronic beats and keys. Lyrically it's a reverie of sorts about H's relationship with her sister - sadly one of the only meaningful relationships in her life.""Routine"" is another epic song that begins with a haunting piano and vocal melody. The soft guitar noodling the main melody around the 4 and a half minute mark is a highlight followed by ethereal female vocals (Ninet Tayeb). This song, which has a definite Pink Floyd vibe, is probably the most beautiful song on the record from a melody and composition standpoint. It's not really a song about the main character but instead one of the ""victims"" H reads about in her news stories.The intensity really gets ratcheted up a notch with ""Home Invasion"" - a song about the internet's negative impact on our lives - and the follow up instrumental ""Regret #9"" with its incredible guitar solo. This song really showcases the kind of talent Wilson has recruited to realize and execute his musical dreams.""Transience"" serves as another retrospective type song from H's youth and serves somewhat as a transition to ""Ancestral,"" the most epic track here. Very cool how the song builds in intensity throughout, culminating in an ominous sounding finale. Once again, this song features the band. Lyrically, this is definitely the most challenging song on the recording to comprehend and remains open to interpretation like most of Wilson's work.""Happy Returns"" - the most appropriately titled song here - features a letter to H's estranged brother ...almost a ""goodbye/farewell I have no regrets"" type letter. The peaceful album closer serves essentially as a bookend. Once again, the final outcome is open to interpretation. (But X-files fans might not think so!)Disc 2/The DemosThere is a key piece missing from the main story - ""Key of Skeleton"" - and it is musically found on the demo CD. The book also describes this in some detail as well. The other songs here are different/mostly longer versions of the final cuts but different enough to make this demo CD much more relevant than the demo CD from the Raven sessions. As with all things Wilson, don't think demo quality - these songs sound just as amazing as the stereo versions on the main CD.Disc 3/The DVDFor those who buy the media book with the DVD-V, you get the DTS 5.1 mix and the 24/96 stereo versions of the songs, the photo gallery and the documentary. Most of the photos in the artbook show up on DVD while the songs are playing in sequence. However, neither the Blu-ray or the DVD contains the ""artifacts.""Disc 4/The Blu-rayHere is the disc for the audiophiles. This one contains the 5.1 master DTS, and the stereo 2.0 and 5.1 mixes. Words won't be able to describe how these songs sound in surround but a better listening experience will be hard to find. The fact that these version contain very little compression means that you can crank this stuff up to the highest volume with no distortion. Every voice can be heard in detail and it truly is one of the best recordings I've ever heard. In addition to these hi-def versions of the main CD music, the Blu-ray contains instrumental versions (all of the songs) and alternate versions of some of the songs. For me, the Grand Union version of ""Perfect Life"" - where the spoken word is more clearly discernable - is a highlight, along with the alternate version of ""Regret #9."" A new item (not present on the Raven Blu-ray) would be the piano themes from the release. This is a particularly stunning inclusion from my standpoint as the emphasis on piano and keys on this release was one of the first things I noticed with initial spins that really set this release apart. Of course, the documentary and photo gallery from the DVD are included on the Blu-ray as well. It should be noted that during playback of the DVD/Blu-ray discs, the photos and art from the book - those which correspond to the songs - are displayed. In essence, you can literally watch the video/look at the book and the items therein and listen to the music all at the same time. For music/art/story lovers this project is a dream. The fact that Wilson knows how to make it all connect on an emotional level is merely the icing on the cake!I've yet to hear the vinyl version but I'm sure it won't disappoint. In summary, Hand Cannot Erase is an unrivaled emotional, listening and visual experience - eclipsing even the brilliance that was The Raven That Refused to Sing. Surely this will be enjoyed for years to come. Thanks to Wilson and friends for their commitment to art at its highest level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OE1D52WB7F7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAZN7JQ#wasThisHelpful","R3OE1D52WB7F7X","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes expectations can jade an otherwise neutral listening experience ... but when you don't have any expectations whatsoever then often you are in the right frame of mind for new music, and often end up pleasantly surprised instead of disappointed. One thing that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone is that these guys have actually released another record despite having ""called it quits."" Nevertheless, the question many are asking - should they have released this record? I say sure - why not. As Klaus points out in ""All For One,"" ""I won't stop till they'll lay my bones to rest."" So what about expectations then? Not having heard anything about the music prior to the release, I have to say I like it - certainly more than Sting In The Tail. But some things have to be put into perspective, the first of which is that these guys have absolutely nothing to prove to anyone. Second, with producers Mikael Nord Andersson and Martin Hansen once again on board you have to expect a more AOR (rather than melodic metal) approach, especially considering that the pair of them contribute either lyrics or composition to 7 of the songs here. And while ""Rollin' Home"" may really irritate older fans, most of these songs are well-composed, they just have an AOR vibe. The exception would be the bluesy rocker ""The Scratch."" In light of this, it should not then be surprising that some of the best songs here - those that will feel most familiar to long-time fans - are those written by Rudi Schenker - ""Rock My Car,"" ""House of Cards,"" ""Catch You Luck And Play,"" ""Hard Rockin' The Place"" and ""Gypsy Life"" (the ""Still Loving You"" of this release). It's also not surprising that Klaus's timeless voice doesn't sound as if it has aged a bit - his lyrics pretty typical of his output over the past several decades. As would be expected the mix sounds great, although Kottak's drums could stand a bit more punch in the mix. I agree with others that his performance is pretty pedestrian here, but it serves the music. Overall, while RTF isn't going to win any awards it's solid rock and a much more fitting swan song (if it is truly their last) than was Sting In The Tail.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BW33P3Q26E2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6YFWXS#wasThisHelpful","R3BW33P3Q26E2K","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently started playing The Trooper and Wasted Years again so thought I would give these sticks another try - hadn't used them in a year or so. I will compare them to my regular sticks which are the Regular VF 5B. Since Nicko plays a lot of fast triplet snare/tom combinations in The Trooper and a lot of quick sixteenth notes on the ride this stick makes perfect sense. Unlike the regular 5B - which is heavy on the tip end - Nicko's stick feels more balanced throughout which allows for quicker movements on the toms and cymbals. While it shares length with the 5B it is a lighter stick overall. Nicko's stick also has a bigger and rounder tip than the more teardrop shape of the 5B and this makes a bigger sound on the ride. In general, though, its a bit too light for all of my playing styles (I really like the heavy feel of the regular 5B, especially for flams on the toms and heavy crash hits)but for the kind of drumming required to play a lot of Maiden songs, its a perfect stick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSD5BE0SSWIEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E70C7Y#wasThisHelpful","RSD5BE0SSWIEU","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stronger than ever, back with 11 new songs and 2 covers, Van Canto has managed to improve in every area. The arrangements continue to grow in complexity, diversity and the sound quality is huge, right up there with Nightwish and Epica. The power metal core root remains in place, but a few of these songs branch out somewhat like ""Magic Taborea"" (use of keys) and ""Frodo's Dream."" ""To Sing a Metal Song"" is a great metal anthem and a song like ""Water Fire Heaven Earth"" reminds me a lot of the greatness of Nightwish. Again, Van Canto - aside from the a cappella approach - doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but they have nicely developed a highly enjoyable variation on metal that is a testament to the versatility and power of the human voice. Inga's presence is one again an important part of the mix on all these songs, which was something that I didn't hear on the last release. This is definitely the best collection of original tunes from them of the first 3 releases. Any commentary on this album would be remiss if it fails to mention the amazing cover of ""Master of Puppets."" I think they did an even better job with this one compared to ""Battery"" and that was a pretty outstanding effort. I don't think I've ever heard a better ""vocalization"" of metal guitars ... ever! Certainly a force to be reckoned with in the metal world, this Van Canto tribe is here to stay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39N4Z15YZ6NKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZDOYT8#wasThisHelpful","R39N4Z15YZ6NKQ","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Van Canto takes their sound to the next level with Hero - the production sound more robust, lush. The drums blend with the singers much better this time around, and some of the open space in the songs has been filled in with full vocal rhythms and harmonies which, overall, makes for a better listen. There are fewer original compositions here, only 5 of the 11 tracks, the other 6 being covers of various metal ""heroes."" While some of the songs are well suited to the ""metal a cappella"" treatment (""Fear of the Dark"" is stunning) ""Stormbringer"" doesn't translate well into this style. Of the original compositions ""Pathfinder"" is probably one of the best songs the band has put together to date, but the title track is pretty good as well. I don't hear Inga in the mix as much on this recording, which is a shame as her voice is sublime, but otherwise this is a band well on their way to success.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YVMF3DQHKLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002USOW2M#wasThisHelpful","R2YVMF3DQHKLJ","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Retro ReviewThe debut release from this German band features a decent array of a cappella ""metal"" songs deeply rooted in the traditional power metal native to their land. Amazingly, this stuff really works - the bass, rhythm and lead guitars are replaced by vocalists, and then the lead singers alternate between Inga Scharf and Dennis Schunke. Both singers are very competent and their voices have enduring qualities which keeps listener fatigue at bay. Only the drummer uses an acoustic instrument, which is probably essential to making this legitimate. Without the drums to propel the music it might lose its metal bite. Most of the songs feature a fast, driving rhythm and the typical fantasy themes of heavy metal, but the biggest surprise is the cover tune of Metallica's ""Battery."" With this very intricate version of this classic song we really get to hear the vocal capabilities of the group - the vocal instrumentations are incredible!  Love the lead guitar ""wah-wah"" effect - used to emulate solos - which sounds uncannily like a guitar. While obviously the voice can't replace the guitar, the performances here are very impressive. Van Canto will be a novelty for sure, especially with the cover tune, but time will tell if this is embraced by the die-hard metal fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DM8HZMGG3G13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002USOW2W#wasThisHelpful","R1DM8HZMGG3G13","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great, sturdy drink holder that is really convenient because it clamps securely. I clamp it to a cymbal stand and it basically never comes lose. It's a very heavy weight so not flimsy at all and easily holds wider drink bottles and all 12 or 160z cans. One of the other nice features is the rubber on the bottom of the cup which adds padding, traction and absorbs condensation pretty well.

"These are great running shoes ... I've been using them since the Pure Flow 2. The 4 is not much different from the 3 last year but the new design has a more traditional lace up (but not quite as cool as lasts years black, grey and red setup). I like these better than the Pure Flow 3 though because they have more padding on the heel area and over the instep. I had to go a half size up though because of that additional padding. For those familiar with the series, this shoe changed a lot from the 2 to the 3 but there is less change from the 3 to 4 if that helps. As always, the lightweight Brooks series feels like you are running without a shoe but with the comfort of some cushion. Not for every runner for sure, but for my 8 to 10 miles a week these are great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F697UGHUDDTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1X8K2Q#wasThisHelpful","R3F697UGHUDDTQ","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the line-up has changed since this review was written (at the time of original release) these songs continue to amaze.Since their inception, Atlanta-based Theocracy has been delivering the highest quality power metal in the business. Matt Smith once told me in an interview that he wanted to be known as, ""the band that never released a filler song."" That fact remains evident on As The World Bleeds because this newest incarnation (now a 5 piece) of the band has yet again delivered the goods. Perhaps a bit less progressive than previous work, fans of Euro power metal will be dazzled. Heavy, melodic and replete with plenty of blistering guitar work - the guys really sound like a touring force now. Lyrically, from the opening moments of the epic ""I Am"" to the closing title track, this has got to be one of the most compelling/convicting/uplifting collections of songs ever released within the scene. The truth never sounded so good, so give these guys the praise they deserve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G3QQ5L88L4K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005STGJTY#wasThisHelpful","R3G3QQ5L88L4K1","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teramaze has endured some major changes over the past decade. After their success with Tears to Dust - which was a great prog/power release - they dabbled with emo. The relative unpopularity of the release was then followed by many years of silence. More recently, however, with the passing of long time drummer Julian Percy it seems that Dean Wells decided to rid himself of the pain and anger by coming full circle (closer to their debut Doxology) back to his metal roots. The result is a dark and complex mixture of thrash and power metal that is both immediately engaging and emotionally cathartic. And while the Christian themes so prevalent on Tears to Dust are absent here, there are remnants of hope at the core. After spinning this disc for months, the music remains vibrant - plenty of great chops here on all levels - and heavy. It is fair to say that Teramaze have retained their original sound, yet delivered a recording that will not sound ""dated"" to those who have ears only for the modern metal sounds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KOAQPU4HDV32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IX39P0#wasThisHelpful","R2KOAQPU4HDV32","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This less well known Austrian melodic power metal act has been around since 2001 but really didn't hit the radar until this release which features the dual vocals of Clementine Delauney and Georg Neuhauser. Using the back drop of historical figures (such as Nero, Bathory, Napolean, Henry VIII, etc.) the band has put forth a very credible collection of mid tempo power metal songs with big melodic hooks and a slightly symphonic vibe. In many ways Serenity is a band with a big Kamelot influence, the emphasis on the melodies more than on heavy, fast riffing. Both vocalists put forth a confident and compelling performance and this will certainly be yet another band for fans of Epica, Nightwish, Within Temptation and of course Kamelot. Production quality, artwork and packaging are first rate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22941BIWJG34W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BG474ZI#wasThisHelpful","R22941BIWJG34W","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to applaud Steven Wilson for never entirely repeating himself. With the success of The Raven that Refused to Sing it might be tempting to duplicate that formula for success. Wilson, both with Porcupine Tree and with his solo work, has reached somewhat of a hero status for musicians and artists who value quality, along with artistic freedom, ahead of quantity of output. Nevertheless, Wilson has managed to push the envelope of progressive music while maintaining a fairly prolific output - no small feat.Hand. Cannot. Erase. is quite different from Raven, both conceptually and musically. First off this is definitely a concept album whereas Raven was a collection of ""stories."" Second, the jazz elements from Raven are less prevalent, in my opinion, with more straight forward elements of rock appearing. This has the effect/vibe of making the music feel more accessible. There is more of an electronic feel and the keyboards (both electric and acoustic) seem to play a greater role. There are some ambient passages as well so the overall listening experience from song to song definitely feels more cohesive. Those comparisons aside, this is just another great collection of music from probably one, if not the, most relevant and talented, hard-working artists in the scene.Deluxe Earbook Edition (2CD/DVD/Blu-ray)While there is no doubt that the music of this release stands by itself as a work of art, the earbook and the discs contained therein represent a completely immersive tactile, aural and visual experience of unprecedented proportions. Steve Wilson once again collaborates with Lasse Hoile (photography), Hajo Mueller (illustrations) and Carl Glover (design/artefacts). While Raven's Limited Edition book set a precedent of its own, it should not be surprising that Wilson and friends have pushed the envelope further in terms of the quality and depth of not only the music but the art and the visual and tactile presentation as well. This limited edition is better in every aspect.The StoryKarolina Grzybowska ""stars"" (aka models) as ""H"" - a woman in her 30's who is estranged from her family and friends. An introvert, she prefers a life of solitude with as little interaction with the busy and somewhat insincere world around her. The story begins with H's childhood/family background and progresses quickly to her adolescence where her parents adopt a 16 year old ""sister"" named ""J."" H and J quickly become connected and share some of their experiences, music, friendship, etc. In only 6 months the parents separate and so do the two girls. This is only minimally traumatic - yet significant - for H who prefers her own company anyway. H meets up with a boyfriend in college but subsequently distances herself from him when she feels things are getting too ""serious."" Further distancing herself from the world around her, H begins to have ""visitors"" who question her about her attachments and relationships. H develops a fascination with news stories about people who ""disappear,"" and the interaction with the visitors and her own questions about her ability to be invisible to those around her raise questions about her significance and purpose in life. The rest of the story is more speculative and can best be left to the listener's/reader's interpretation. Suffice it to say, there is much more depth provided in the artbook - too much more information would spoil the story. There are still things I've not yet figured out yet as well.The ArtbookThis 108 page hard-bound book is a work of art itself. Not only does it contain pictures and art chronicling the story of H, but it contains ""artifacts"" - such as a birth certificate, childhood journal, newspaper clippings, postcard - which help elucidate the story and make you feel as if you are actually touching the items owned by this young woman. The story is presented in a journal fashion from the standpoint of the woman H. Each entry enhances the meaning and character behind the songs. Additionally, the lyrics to each song are cleverly contained within journal entries, diary entries and other media. It's really quite brilliant. The written words certainly help capture not only the meaning behind the songs but also help enhance their emotional/human connection. This is art at its highest calling - the connection between visual, tactile and aural - perfectly executed.Disc 1/The MusicThe opening song ""First Regret"" is essentially an ambient piano prelude to ""3 Years Older"" which is an upbeat, rhythmic piece featuring a driving bass guitar line reminiscent of Geddy Lee, and Minnemann throws in a few Peart-like drum fills as well. The beginning and ending definitely has a Rush vibe but the song middle is a mixture of styles - the dynamic contrast between soft and loud sections pretty extreme. The solo section beginning around the 8 minute mark is one of the few times where the band really lets loose on this release and they ride it out to the end of the track. Lyrically, this song chronicles the early stage of the main character's life and H's interactions with her sister J.The title track follows and is the most easily loveable song on the disc; it's immediately appealing with its sing-along melody and catchy chorus. This is certainly the most radio friendly song on the release. Lyrically it alludes to the main character's ""break-up"" with her boyfriend and provides a lot of insight into how she views relationships in general.""Perfect Life"" is a mix of narration during the first half and Wilson repeating the chorus over top of some electronic beats and keys. Lyrically it's a reverie of sorts about H's relationship with her sister - sadly one of the only meaningful relationships in her life.""Routine"" is another epic song that begins with a haunting piano and vocal melody. The soft guitar noodling the main melody around the 4 and a half minute mark is a highlight followed by ethereal female vocals (Ninet Tayeb). This song, which has a definite Pink Floyd vibe, is probably the most beautiful song on the record from a melody and composition standpoint. It's not really a song about the main character but instead one of the ""victims"" H reads about in her news stories.The intensity really gets ratcheted up a notch with ""Home Invasion"" - a song about the internet's negative impact on our lives - and the follow up instrumental ""Regret #9"" with its incredible guitar solo. This song really showcases the kind of talent Wilson has recruited to realize and execute his musical dreams.""Transience"" serves as another retrospective type song from H's youth and serves somewhat as a transition to ""Ancestral,"" the most epic track here. Very cool how the song builds in intensity throughout, culminating in an ominous sounding finale. Once again, this song features the band. Lyrically, this is definitely the most challenging song on the recording to comprehend and remains open to interpretation like most of Wilson's work.""Happy Returns"" - the most appropriately titled song here - features a letter to H's estranged brother ...almost a ""goodbye/farewell I have no regrets"" type letter. The peaceful album closer serves essentially as a bookend. Once again, the final outcome is open to interpretation. (But X-files fans might not think so!)Disc 2/The DemosThere is a key piece missing from the main story - ""Key of Skeleton"" - and it is musically found on the demo CD. The book also describes this in some detail as well. The other songs here are different/mostly longer versions of the final cuts but different enough to make this demo CD much more relevant than the demo CD from the Raven sessions. As with all things Wilson, don't think demo quality - these songs sound just as amazing as the stereo versions on the main CD.Disc 3/The DVDFor those who buy the media book with the DVD-V, you get the DTS 5.1 mix and the 24/96 stereo versions of the songs, the photo gallery and the documentary. Most of the photos in the artbook show up on DVD while the songs are playing in sequence. However, neither the Blu-ray or the DVD contains the ""artifacts.""Disc 4/The Blu-rayHere is the disc for the audiophiles. This one contains the 5.1 master DTS, and the stereo 2.0 and 5.1 mixes. Words won't be able to describe how these songs sound in surround but a better listening experience will be hard to find. The fact that these version contain very little compression means that you can crank this stuff up to the highest volume with no distortion. Every voice can be heard in detail and it truly is one of the best recordings I've ever heard. In addition to these hi-def versions of the main CD music, the Blu-ray contains instrumental versions (all of the songs) and alternate versions of some of the songs. For me, the Grand Union version of ""Perfect Life"" - where the spoken word is more clearly discernable - is a highlight, along with the alternate version of ""Regret #9."" A new item (not present on the Raven Blu-ray) would be the piano themes from the release. This is a particularly stunning inclusion from my standpoint as the emphasis on piano and keys on this release was one of the first things I noticed with initial spins that really set this release apart. Of course, the documentary and photo gallery from the DVD are included on the Blu-ray as well. It should be noted that during playback of the DVD/Blu-ray discs, the photos and art from the book - those which correspond to the songs - are displayed. In essence, you can literally watch the video/look at the book and the items therein and listen to the music all at the same time. For music/art/story lovers this project is a dream. The fact that Wilson knows how to make it all connect on an emotional level is merely the icing on the cake!I've yet to hear the vinyl version but I'm sure it won't disappoint. In summary, Hand Cannot Erase is an unrivaled emotional, listening and visual experience - eclipsing even the brilliance that was The Raven That Refused to Sing. Surely this will be enjoyed for years to come. Thanks to Wilson and friends for their commitment to art at its highest level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0ZIRBY1ZP6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QW4QWYQ#wasThisHelpful","RL0ZIRBY1ZP6L","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first listened to At The Edge of Time a few years back I don't think I realized just how good it was. Sure, the veterans of the German power metal scene had delivered another epic slab of energetic and symphonic songs pretty much in the vein they had patented over 2 decades ago. In essence, they consistently craft memorable tunes filled with all of the elements that make this genre appealing to so many, simultaneously propelling their music to a higher level of complexity than any other band in the melodic power metal scene. ATEOT was certainly no exception and it's well worth another look for those who may have skipped over it or just not had enough time with the songs initially (which was my case) for the hooks to take firm hold. But take heed, once they take hold they won't let go as this one gets better with repeated play. Spinning this disc multiple times, both in anticipation of Beyond the Red Mirror and since the release of that masterpiece, I am firmly convinced this collection of songs was the perfect precursor to that magnum opus. Where fans were somewhat jaded by the complexity/density of A Night at the Opera (and perhaps shocked by Stauch's departure from the BG drum throne) the band pulled things back a bit with 2006's A Twist of the Myth. But where that album was a bit more commercial, At The Edge of Time turned up the intensity and metal factor big time while simultaneously re-introducing the epic and symphonic elements that were for the most part absent from ATOTM. Hence, ATEOT serves as a transitional album which perfectly balances all of the elements that make BG so endearing, and in doing so positions itself as the perfect bridge from ATOTM to BTRM. The album title even ends up as a pivotal song in the Red Mirror saga - no coincidence that. Fans know this music by now so it speaks for itself, and others have chronicled detailed descriptions so I won't digress. For me, the first 6 songs are perfect and the rest of the album is really darn great. But don't take my word ... have another look into the ""void"" and you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6N9074SUL43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TEO3EI#wasThisHelpful","R1U6N9074SUL43","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of 80's metal and classic melodic metal will find everything they need here to satisfy their longings for great music. Michael Eden's all-star crew is back with their third installment of ear candy. This time around they seem to be going for a much more commercial approach, which could turn away fans for the more ""metal"" feeling debut. Every song here has that definite AOR appeal, largely due to the big choruses and melodic hooks. Lyrically, there are more spiritual references than ever, yet the band maintains a rebellious spirit. It's a paradoxical approach, yet one can't argue with the truth behind songs like ""Trinity"" or ""No Holy Man,"" or even ""Can't Fool The Devil"" for that matter. It can't hurt to have James Labrie sing on any recording (""No Holy Man"") and even Andi Deris (Helloween) makes an appearance on the speedy ""Black Widow."" The cover of Dio's ""Rock `N' Roll Children"" is simply a faithful rendition of the original. The AFM Records (European) release contains ""We Climb"" while the North American release contains a different song. One observation: sometimes when a release includes too many guests it steals away from the bands' own identity, but I don't think that is the case here. Eden's Curse - to my ears - sounds like what Stryper would have sounded like in 2011 if they hadn't changed their style from their later 80's hits. Eden's Curse has no progressive leanings whatsoever - this is straight ahead melodic rock/metal. This is a well-produced slab of music from a great band and it is nicely packaged/produced by one of the best metal labels in the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359A9W889892V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LE113Q#wasThisHelpful","R359A9W889892V","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 2013 reissue of BG's Nuclear Blast debut - featuring new drummer (at the time) Frederik Ehmke - comes nicely packaged in a tri-fold digipak (featuring the incredible artwork of Anthony Clarkson) with 3 bonus tracks not included with the original release. The new tracks are ""All the King's Horses"" (Japan edition), the acoustic version of ""Skalds and Shadows"" (which really doesn't sound that different from the original version) and a fast and short version of ""In A Gadda Da Vida"" - the latter two tracks taken from the Fly EP. For those who own the original release these tracks are non-essential, but for the fans that like to own every version and certainly for those without the 2006 release the Special Edition is worthy.A Twist in the Myth was more straight ahead metal compared to its predecessor A Night at the Opera, which for some fans was a much welcomed change. Lacking the layered guitars and symphonic elements these songs have a ""clean"" sound that is more immediately enjoyable. Lyrically these songs visit numerous literary figures (Peter Pan the most noteworthy with ""Fly""), mythology, Christianity and Viking and Welsh folklore. And ""Carry the Blessed Home"" even features characters from King's Dark Tower series. Other songs are conceptual in nature like ""Straight Through the Mirror"" - a song about dreaming - and ""Another Stranger Me"" - about a person with dissociate disorder. Musically, this is actually a pretty diverse collection with plenty of emphasis on the guitar leads and solos in the mix. Kursch's vocals are exceptional as always and Ehmke's drum contributions proved that he was a more than adequate replacement for the Thomen Stauch. Ehmke's performance on ""Lionheart"" remains a highlight for me - the song itself one of my favorites from this release. Listening to this release this many years later I can't but wonder why it was not better received by fans as I think these songs hold up really well over time. Yes, there were some quirky songs - ""Skalds and Shadows"" much maligned by some - but to me it's all part of the greatness of BG.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R216VDWK2FPNN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV1ATAA#wasThisHelpful","R216VDWK2FPNN4","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While not as impressive as 2010's 7 Sinners, Helloween continue to set the standard for heavy and speedy traditional power metal. With the exception of Blind Guardian there are very few bands in the genre that can deliver so consistently at this high level for such a long time. The first 3 tracks here are obliterating power metal with infectious and catchy hooks, soaring choruses and just ""in your face"" metal. But then things get a bit more diverse going forward, with a mixture of metal anthems and power ballad type songs that might tax the patience of die-hard metal fans. Most of the songs are really good though, but ""$##hole"" is a complete waste of time, as is ""Wanna Be God."" Those two songs should have been left off this otherwise stellar collection, and can't say I'm a fan of ""Church Breaks Down"" either, probably because of the lyrical content. The biggest way to summarize the difference between this release and 7 Sinners would be to say that while 7 Sinners had a generally positive vibe (and was more consistently great), this one has a much more negative vibe, mostly due to the lyrical content on some of these songs. I do love the Hammond organ (Deep Purple-like) version of ""Burning Sun"" which is a great song to begin with but sounds even better with the organ. The criticisms aside, these guys invented the speed power euro metal genre way back in the 80's and they still own the crown as far as I'm concerned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOJJCW1QJ6QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8ZZ2Z0#wasThisHelpful","R3AOJJCW1QJ6QY","A18V2E6MMO8KLO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18V2E6MMO8KLO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm usually very fair with reviews, but I hate this garbage. We bought one and got it home and noticed the mirror was scuffed to hell and back, so we exchanged it. The new one, the remote only works if you turn the power on and off. Every time! NEW name brand batteries in both! Remote does NOTHING! Slide the power off and on, and the remote will work. But the next time you go to use it, even if it is 5 minutes later, you have to turn in on and off again! The light only stays on for like 5 seconds, too. The only reason we paid $20 instead if $10 for a standard mirror was so we could use the remote so we didn't have to climb back in a moving car, but we have to climb back anyway! The light is useless, the remote is useless. The only benefit is the music, but we have a stereo in the car, so there was ZERO benefit to buying this over a standard mirror! Absolute rubbish!

"There are a dozen or more bamboo charcoal inserts for sale on Amazon and they all, even the ones with gussets, say about 13in long. These said 16. It should have been safe to assume they would be longer than other brands. NOPE. They must just measure them when pulling the elastic out. It isn't fair. When all your competitors use a standard measurement and your stretched-out measurement makes yours look 3in longer, even though they are in fact the same size, this is deceptive. I NEEDED longer inserts because ours were too small. What a MASSIVE waste of $30 just to get more of what I already had. Thanks. The ONE seller who says 16in instead of 13in and it was a white lie.

The only redeeming quality about Jeff or Fish is that they didn't screw and the author focuses on this repeatedly until the last two pages when she is like ""j/k, they did screw."" As if she couldn't think of a better ending. It ruined the entire book for me. It was predictable and a cop out and uneventful other than to remove any remaining likability for 2/3 of the characters. If you completely take out the last chapter, the book is good as is. Leave Claire having some hint of normalcy and the hope of her sister staying in town to practice law with her. A movie version could have ended there.

"I want to preface my review by saying that I got my Kindle (Fire HD 32) from QVC for $229, made in 6 monthly payments (costing less than $50 to get it home) and it came with the fast charge wall adapter, leather magnetic stand case, 2 year premiere tech support, and $50 printerpix.com credit, plus NQA returns for 3 months. So, my review is based on that deal.That being said, I barely touch my computer since my Kindle came. I use it every day. It's faster than my laptop and our two other tablets. The screen is so gorgeous that it makes my phone/tablets look like toys. I watch TV and it's as pretty as our 1080p 240hz 42in TV. I read in bed without lighting up my husband's side. I read books to my 2 year old from the massive library on Freetime Unlimited (worth it for the apps alone), I can finally stream Prime on the go. I can watch YouTube videos in Silk for knit/crochet patterns and can see their hands as clear as day. I can video chat via Skype. I can skate around the only-front-facing camera, though I wish it had both. It also doesn't come with video (camera takes pics only), but there are good, free apps that allow it. It hasn't crashed on me once in the weeks I've had it. I only have nice things to say other than video isn't built in, no back camera, and no YouTube or Ibotta app - or GooglePlay. That, and that I can't upload pics to it from my camera via usb like my other tablets. It plugs in but won't link, I assume bc the drivers won't download.

"We bought every kind of sippy cup on the market and while my tot took to the Dr. Brown's cups at first, straw cups wound up being the ONLY kind of cup she will use! There are a handful of straw cups on the market, but these are my favorite and I'll tell you why...1. Price: These are as low as $2 in my local stores. ($1.99 at Baby Depot, $2.49 at Wal-Mart, etc.) The only other straw cups cheaper are the Take & Toss and those are not spill resistant. So, these cups are easy to replace. While I haven't been able to find replacement nipples, at this price, I can just buy more cups and recycle the old ones.2. Ease of use: We have tried other cups and the odd shaped nipples are difficult to get in and out of the odd shaped lids. Insulated cups are too clunky and not necessary for us as out kid doesn't sip at her drinks but is done well before it has time to reach room temperature. Flip top lids are a huge pain to wash and none of these pieces fit in standard dishwasher baskets well. With these cups on the other hand, they assemble and wash almost exactly like her Playtex drop-ins bottles. 5 nipples fit with plenty of room in the basket, the lid are just rings, and the straws go in the straw slots. I'll link our basket - Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Vary And they are easy for her to carry.3. Durable: My kid is rough on things. These are dropped from shopping carts, fall off counters, washed in the dishwasher on high heat, and she chews on the silicone straw part of the nipple and it has never broken off or anything like that, nor have any of the cups ever cracked. We've been using the same cups for about 4 months now, and we started with only 2 in rotation, and as of today we have 9. Every other cup we bought, even the expensive ones, are sitting in a bag under the sink because we did not like them for one reason or another.4. Spill-proof-ish: They aren't going to pour all over like some cups, but sometimes they can spill a tiny bit. You see, the straw part of the nipple has two valves and if my kid sucks liquid past the bottom valve and then removes the cup from her mouth, the liquid can leak out of the top valve. But other than that, no, it isn't going to leak so long as the nipple is sealing into the ring all the way around - like a bottle.My only complaints are that I don't like her drinking mostly from plastic, even if it is BPA free, and I don't like that the rings are different colors. I had to buy one of each so that I could match them up green/green, red/red, yellow/yellow, pink/pink, blue/blue, but I was still stuck with a purple cup with an orange lid.

My child has really bad eczema and this has never caused any issues for us whatsoever. And her eczema is so bad that she will get a flare-up on the side of her face if she sleeps on it too long. She also has really sensitive skin. So much so that we had to switch to cloth diapers because disposable diapers caused a reaction on her skin. She can't even wear polyester or she gets heat rash. And she can't even wear band-aids or eat raw oranges because she is allergic to adhesive and citric acid. So, I knew that I wanted the most gentle soap I could find, without paying California Baby prices. We were using an Aveeno product, but since they are made by Johnson & Johnson, who openly use formaldehyde in their products, I needed to make a switch. After hours of reading reviews, we picked this one. Our regimen includes The Honest Company Shampoo and Conditioner, Aquaphor Gentle Wash, and BabyGanics Extra Gentle Lotion. Will I keep using it? Probably not. It's better for your skin to change soaps every once in a while, so I'll be on the hunt for something better. I'd have changed sooner, but 6 8.4oz bottles will last you forever, it seems. And I use it generously. The bottom line is that my kid reacts to everything but this is gentle enough for her. So, if you want gentle and aren't worried about organic or natural, this is your winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUSW6JJD76U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00260GZTW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUSW6JJD76U8","AHK9Z99W9UQE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHK9Z99W9UQE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I haven't tried the little green bags, but I will say filling from the bottom and washing in the curves is a little bit hard, so if you're between the two, I'd sway the other way. But these are so cute, so I picked these! hahaI love the concept. My almost 17 month old refused to eat veggies - except blended. This keeps me from having to go back to spoon feeding. The storebought pouches are so expensive! And just like with jarred food, it isn't the same as home made. So, I pulled the baby bullet out of the cabinet and filled these little guys and my tot ate veggies willingly! That's a win in my book.I will update if they tear or anything because they feel kind of flimsy, but we will see! Some things aren't as delicate as they look, so they may hold up! No leaks yet! Though I don't feel like I could turn them inside out without risking a tear, if that's how you planned to wash them.I LOVE that they are freezer safe! I may get the little green bags later, to compare, so I can make big batches ahead of time and freeze, instead of blending every other day. We will see. But these guys are just as cute in person, and I have no regrets, really.Update: The smaller size, the bird and lion, they are really difficult to fill! IF I were you, I'd go on Amazon and search for the 4pk that is four of the larger size, two each of a panda and walrus. The cost is about the same! The little ones are almost pointless.

"I took a chance because it was only $7. I have Touchmaster 1, 2 and 3! So, I thought I'd have to like this. I agree with another reviewer. Almost every game is timed! I like to play Touchmaster and relax in bed while maybe watching TV or chatting with my husband after a long day. So annoying to have to give the game 100% of my attention or lose!

"I was skeptical because of the few low reviews but this is a total home run! I needed a quick and easy solution to keep my toddler out of her hamper, and I took a chance on this because it was only $12. (I have it hanging on an over-the-door hook and not the knob)I wish I'd gotten it sooner! It seems really sturdy. It doesn't collapse on me like others said. It collapses when I empty it, but never while it's hanging or when I toss things in - it stays wide open until I take it down. One full bag does equal one full load for my brand new full sized washing machine! Maybe the reviews who say it doesn't hold a full load have a huge, high capacity machine? In fact, when a load is mostly jeans, this bag actually holds MORE than my washing machine can. It keeps dirty laundry out of my toddler's reach, while still keeping it close enough for me to toss things in all day, which I love! I don't even need the zipper, I just tip it over the washer and shake the clothes out.I loved this so much that I ordered two more, one for me and one for my husband. I love that they are washable, too. I washed my daughter's after I'd had it for a few months and it looks identical to mine and my husband's which are brand new. No wear at all! They do sag just a little bit when they are full of my husband's jeans, but the spring right back to life on laundry day. I recommend these to anyone and everyone! Oh, and since it is made of canvas, you can paint it if you don't like the plain white for your decor. Even some simple chevron stripes in a bold color would make this gorgeous.Note: Even though the hook never collapsed when it was hanging up, I got a wee bit tired of it collapsing when I'd dump it out. So, I wrapped a rubber band around parallel lines and now the hook NEVER slips. Amazon doesn't do customer submitted photos anymore, but I am about to order number FOUR (Not because any of the others failed, but because my daughter has one, my husband and I each have one, and I want a fourth one for towels and bedding, etc) and when that arrives, I will take a video of my rubber band trick and attach it to this review. 9/21/13","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GNR08DY6BZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00013KABK#wasThisHelpful","R13GNR08DY6BZJ","AHK9Z99W9UQE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHK9Z99W9UQE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really shocked by the reviews. This cup has been great for us! I actually came her to buy more b/c I wanted to stock up as we lost one and only have 2 left and they are the only ones she will use. We started with the Playtex ones Playtex Baby First Lil' Gripper Twist 'n Click Straw Trainer Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary but when we lost the only one, I didn't want to buy more because they are so expensive. These are like $2.99 at Wal-Mart so I grabbed a few and my 15 month old took to them right away! They have dropped and been kicked and no cracks. She has literally all her baby teeth and is a biter and chewer, but the straws are intact. And they have never once spilled, even when I try. Plus, they are way more easy to clean than they Playtex cups, and hold more. I'm very happy with them. This split reaction makes me wonder if they have changed the way they make them recently. Well, I guess all babies are different. At any rate, at half the price of the average cup, they are worth trying!!! They were a home run for us and about half the other reviewers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KI46TJIQL5TR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003N49ML8#wasThisHelpful","R3KI46TJIQL5TR","AHK9Z99W9UQE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHK9Z99W9UQE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just to be clear, I do not keep a pet in this. I have an aquatic turtle, and it is very common to feed them outside their tank because they are messy eaters, poop immediately, and it will keep your HUGE tanks from getting so dirty so fast. So, this bowl is JUST for meal time, NOT for full time.Mine did not leak. It's cheap feeling, but not cheap looking. Put the screw into a stud if you can because it is really heavy! I only filled it a little less than half way because that's all I need. You don't have to unscrew it every time you take it down if you use a screw head small enough. If you can't, you can just tilt the bowl to pour the water out without removing the screw.But it would make a hell of a lot more sense if they used a proper screw hole that had an easy easy way to slide the bowl up and off the screw.

"I guess it is my fault for taking a risk on this when it only had one review. I uploaded a few pictures to show you what I mean, but there are threads and bad stitching and tears. It's nothing that makes the bag unusable, but I will have to take the time, energy, and supplies to stitch it by hand myself, and it won't look as good and I just shouldn't have to do it because I didn't pay for a bag that needed work done, I paid for a new bag. At $17 for a simple duffel bag, you wouldn't expect this poor quality. It isn't like I paid $5. At any rate, I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.Other than that, the size and shape make it PERFECT for a toddler's diaper bag. All her food and dishes go in the left, all her milk and juice goes in the right, diapers and wipes in the front, hand sanitizer in the little pocket, and a blanket, spare outfits, and TONS of toys in the main compartment. I have had many other diaper bags and totes, but they are tall and narrow, and hard to get to things in the bottom. I looked for hours for something more shallow and wide and finally found that a bag like this was really what I was looking for and boy was it super easy to find things with this bag. Her bottles even fit in the mesh pocket perfectly. It would also make a great cheer bag, dance bag, sports bag, or travel bag.Eventually, I plan to get her name embroidered on, and maybe some gold stars. I come from a military family, so I love the camo. I think it's adorable.Three stars for bad stitching, please view photos.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZWHTKT5T6QYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BCXOIY#wasThisHelpful","RZWHTKT5T6QYY","AHK9Z99W9UQE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHK9Z99W9UQE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this tripod because I was so busy putting Balapalooza together that I forgot to video my baby's first Christmas. I did not want that to happen again! So, I ordered this before her first birthday and it was a lifesaver! It is so light (my point and shoot digital camera weighs more) and collapses easily and the legs telescope easily, and the locks will secure it at literally any height between the shortest and longest. The head tilts forward, back, left, right. The handle makes it even easier. I could see it blowing over outside if it were very windy on a hill, etc. It suits my needs, though!!

"A little annoyed that the price is down like $5 since I ordered, but that's Amazon for you.When I went to Wal-Mart and Best Buy looking for a plain tablet cover, the cheapest was 2-3 times as much as this one and it did nothing! I knew I at least wanted a kick stand and for this price, the keyboard was just a free bonus, so I wouldn't care if it hadn't worked or stopped working, but it's good! My tablet came with a USB adapter so that was no issue, but they are only a few bucks anyway.It's a ZTO 7in N1+ or something like that and it fits great. The keyboard is awkwardly small, but still better than the touch screen key pad! It kinda turns your tablet into a tiny laptop. It's a decent quality. I am pretty rough on my belongings nowadays and no stitching has come undone. It looks like I paid twice at much, or more.The stylus is just a Nintendo DS stylus, so don't expect to be able to use it on your tablet. I happen to have a DS, so it's not a total loss, but I doubt I ever use it as I have many nicer ones, like most DS users. Don't let that deter you from buying because if you really want a stylus, you can get them for like $1 here on Amazon! That's what I did and mine work great! Had them for about a year and still intact. Minus one star for misleading stylus that you can't use on tablet.UPDATE: A couple months later, the keyboard stopped working. But it's still functions as a cover, though I admittedly don't use it.

"[If you look at the 5 star reviews, especially the 2nd page, each and every one is rated unhelpful. So, at the risk of someone who hates this product reducing my reviewer rank for no good reason, I'm going to leave a positive review anyway.]We purchased this kitchen in our local store for $45. I would not have spent $100. The material is like ALL Little Tikes plastic, e.g. the Cozy Coupe. The vent hood will not fall if it is screwed in like the instructions clearly state. Likewise, the white part will not lean forward if screwed in correctly. I have ALL the accessory pieces stored in the oven and fridge, so there is room, but I do plan to get more food and then the accessories will go in small baskets, slid under the counter in Stage 1 and wherever she wants them by the time it is in Stage 2. So, this is really not a big deal to me at all, having to spend $3 on some plastic baskets, and even IF the food it came with had been healthy, I'd buy more b/c it only came with a few foods, anyway. (Update, I bought the Little Tikes Backyard Barbeque Summer Fruit and Veggie Set and it is a great fit and all very healthy!) The stickers do not look cheap when you compare them to every other play kitchens' where most are done in a cartoon design. At least these make an attempt at looking more photographic, and to a non-jaded toddler, they succeed! It doesn't make tons of sounds because it is an imagination-inspiring toy. Many play kitchens make NO sounds, so I was actually surprised when I found the burner took batteries. My child prefers stacking cups, puzzles, books, and blocks to the infamous Ballapalooza, so making noise, and flashing lights are NOT a necessity for her. In Stage 1, the low stage, the counter hits about hits the waist of my over 30"" tall  baby, where I guess you would expect it to hit her chest, though I'm not sure why, as my own counter hits my waist. If the sink was not that low, they couldn't reach the shelf, hood, etc. I have a feeling this bothers parents a lot more than it bothers toddlers. They can sit and play, bend and play, stand and play. It's really not that big of a deal, and if it is, then move it to Stage 2 so it meets your needs. That pretty much addresses the negative reviews for those of you who really want this and are skeptical. However, do NOT spend this $100 it is listed for! It is well worth $45, but for $100 you could get a much nicer one, like the gourmet series, or a wooden one.

"My baby is only 11 months, but I knew we'd want a sand/water table down the road. I wasn't going to spend $40-50 on a plastic tub with legs, unless I could be certain it is something she'd just love and play with all the time. For now, we love it as a Mega Bloks table. We'll likely try the sand and water in the Summer.She has not tipped it, or tried to climb on top of it. Watch your kids and those things won't happen, no offense. Once assembled, I could not pull the wheel tower apart when I tried, so no way could my baby accidentally break it apart by spinning the wheels. Sure, it could tip over because it isn't attached and just sits on top of the table, but unless the unit is defective or not put together properly, it will not just break apart as one reviewer seemed to claim. Maybe a leg could fall off if dragged when heavy with sand/water, but I've not had any issue like that and would likely pick it up and move it and not drag it, anyway. I'm not trying to pick apart reviews, I just don't want people thinking this table will just keep falling apart on them when that just isn't the case. The pieces lock in firmly. I can't pull them apart when I try to. It's just not THAT flimsy.It uses much less plastic than the Lil' Tykes versions, but it still functions. For the price, it is a good table that will do the job. If you don't care about brands, or you want to get a cheap table to see if they like it before investing in a bigger table, or you want a table for indoors, this is the one to go with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN9IU6JMP74TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GD0IAK#wasThisHelpful","RN9IU6JMP74TV","AHK9Z99W9UQE0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHK9Z99W9UQE0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love it. I've been making things on a stick all morning and have encountered no problems. They cook evenly. Nothing stuck to the pan and I didn't need Pam. Even cheese did not stick!! They are crisp on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside and come out super easily. It takes VERY little time! I just love it. I didn't think ahead and get supplies so I had to use what was laying around the house. I stuffed some peppers with cheese, I grabbed some frozen chocolate and banana chunks, I grabbed some cheese sticks and pizza sauce, I grabbed some summer sausage, and my husband had the brilliant idea to use JUST batter and make waffle sticks to dip in syrup, which was genius. So, it is NOT junk to us. It's a joy! To address some negative reviews, my batter did not 'go everywhere' because I poured carefully. None got into cracks that are hard to clean or anything like that. If you can pour cake batter into a cupcake pan without a disaster, then you can do this also. Yes, it's too small for a full hot dog. That doesn't matter to me. It doesn't change the flavor. Someone commented that their batter came out too dry. This isn't the fault of the machine, it is the fault of the recipe. Ours were great and not dry at all. I followed a Bisquick recipe and not one that came with the book. I understand people blaming bad experiences on the machine, but it's not always fair. The machine can't control if you make a mess and it can't control the flavor of what you put into it. Take that into consideration when reading negative reviews.

"Don't spend $100 here when it is only $60 in stores. That being said...Pros:-My husband and I both LOVE the music on this toy! It's unlike any other toy's music we've ever had. It's very techno, like rave music. Reminds me a lot of ""Castles in the Sky"" and songs like that. Very nice change.-It's big! There's stuff to do from every angle.-The lights are pretty.Cons:-Not sturdy enough for baby to pull up on without it trying to tip.-Trampoline only works like 2/3 of the time, so most of the time the balls fall straight to the floor.-It's one of THOSE toys that will go off even when no one is near it.-It's big! It's great fun for baby to explore, but takes up so much floor space. Be prepared to make 4x4 feet of space for it and it won't fold in any way for storage.I may have more bad things to say than good, but I do love this toy. As soon as I saw the commercial, I knew I wanted it. I was more excited about it than my baby was. Having played with it, I would say it is worth $40, but that is for you to decide what it's worth to you. I do recommend it, if you don't think the price is too high. We got it as a gift for her from my husband's parents. I'm not sure I'd have ever paid that much.UPDATE: She NEVER plays with this thing. I can't even get her to play with it when I try.

" 0:16 MinsI'm usually one to see the best in things and try to argue negative reviews, but I am really disappointed by this toy. I know the balls are designed to roll out, but like everyone else said, they do so immediately. Usually, all the balls will be out before even one song finishes. And when they do roll out, they stay hidden inside the mouth instead of popping out onto the floor - until another ball uneventfully pushes it out, leaving the last balls inside the mouth. So, you have to reach in the tiny hole to get it or tip the whole until over, EVERY time. It's really just like a bass speaker on it's side! Also, when that green thing pops up, while your hand is in it, it hurts! It says 6-36 months if I'm not mistaken, and my 10 month old is not impressed.

"My baby weighs about 23lbs and this barely fits her now. I knew when I first put it on her at 12lbs that it would not fit her at 40. Also, all her other diapers are pockets, and this one is the only one that leaks within an hour. So, it always needs a 2nd insert, even if it isn't overnight, and even when she was only 4 months old and not a heavy wetter. I go for this diaper last out of all my cloth.

"*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*I was completely blown away by this book. I had no idea what to expect when I picked it up and I was glued to the pages the entire time. There was so much going on and all of it was hidden and Clarissa only allows you to see small snippets. I couldn't figure out what was going on, if Julian was a good guy or a bad guy, or whether Gwen was going nuts. I was definitely intrigued by the story and didn't form an opinion until towards the end.Speaking of the end, I did have a bit of an issue with the end. There is a moment that I cannot speak about because it will be a spoiler, but it kind of irked me because it was too quick. It seemed like It could have been written a little differently and it would have been much better and more believable. But, I understand why it happened and I know that it was the right decision. I just didn't like the execution of it. Is it enough for me to not like it or not recommend it? No. It's just a personal irritation of mine that most people may not even pick up on.This story has a lot of different aspects in it: there is humor, romance, suspense, action, and drama. This is a read that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire time. Clarissa will take you on a roller coaster of a ride that will leave you breathless and your heart pounding. It is a very hard read to put down once you start. I absolutely loved her gay friend Fenten and loved how doting Seth was. The book made me hungry all the time because Seth liked to cook so he was always cooking some yummy food. It made me wish I had a Seth in my life.

"This installment of Darcy Walker is intense to put it mildly. Darcy does some growing up and maturing in this book. She's still dealing with her mother's murder and can't get her head around her relationship with Dylan. Some very big and scary things happen in Defcon Darcy that leave you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath. There were times when I was reading that I would forget to breathe. I also got scared a time or two when I was trying to figure out how Darcy was going to get out of the particular predicament that she had gotten herself into. I never figured anything out ahead of time and was always surprised when things were revealed. AJ does a fantastic job at keeping things hidden until she wants them seen. That is one of my favorite things about this series, besides Darcy herself.I have loved Darcy Walker from the get go. She is a snarky little spitfire of a gal and has majorly large cajones.  She fights for the underdog because she is one herself. She has a band of misfits as her family because they are just like her. She's inquisitive by nature and doesn't want anyone to be taken advantage of or hurt. She's passionate, strong, sarcastic, and someone you want in your corner. I love her and wish she were real because we could all use a little Darcy Walker in our lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FNT2JOB9UCZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TNO3FIS#wasThisHelpful","R2FNT2JOB9UCZ8","A2N0J7O4PGS711","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N0J7O4PGS711?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Allison has laid everything on the line and is trying to fight for her mom, her dad, Ethan, and the rest of the Danaan people. She has sacrificed so much for this fight and to become the person that everyone thinks that she is. So many things have gone wrong and she's lost so much but can she do it?This was such a great conclusion to the trilogy. It was emotional and had some curve balls thrown in that I didn't expect. I really hope that Laura writes some more about the Danaan and Allison. It would be kind of cool to see a prequel of this series or possibly one for in the future, maybe with Allison's children.

"Oh the angst and emotion that Laura Howard has placed into these books!! I was warned about them before I read them so I knew it was coming. Other people that I have talked to have told me to expect it so I was prepared. This first book, which is FREE on Amazon, definitely hooks you in. The magical world that she's created is breathtakingly beautiful in her description. I can imagine it all with clarity and it makes me want to go to Ireland really badly, even more so than before.I didn't mind that this story is mostly for YA readers as I am a lover of YA stories. Some may find them a little immature, but definitely not so with this one. The subject matter at times is definitely not immature or childish. The love of a daughter for her mother and wanting to help her situation is not exclusive to age. Also the contempt that a daughter has for her long lost father returned isn't going to be something that everyone can relate to but it's definitely not unimaginable. I have personal experience with some of this so it resonated with me. I am glad that I read these back to back as I don't know how long I could have waited in between books.

Allison definitely does not get a break at all in this second installment as it is full of action, too. Allison is worried about her mom, Ethan, Aoife, her dad.....she hardly has any time to worry about herself.I felt so bad for Allison having to go through all of these crazy things and to not be able to tell anyone what was going on. I definitely wanted her to get with Ethan and make a relationship with him and trust him, but she can't trust anyone. It sucks to be going through stressful situations and not to be able to tell anyone for fear that they will either kill you or not believe you, not that I would know what that feels like, but I can imagine.

"I absolutely love this series! The characters and their relationship dynamics are so emotional and complicated. There is a lot happening in this second book. Some questions are answered while many more others are unearthed.Ever mysterious and ever brooding Oz has decided to attach himself to Khara as if he were her shadow. And there are sure to be some fireworks when Hades finds out about this new ""arrangement."" This installment has a lot of Oz and Khara interaction and the sexual tension is building. There are times when they are mere inches from each other in the heat of a discussion and you keep waiting for someone to make a move. I'm not going to say if it ever happens as that would spoil the book for some but Amber is the queen of sexual tension/frustration with her characters.I am not sure how I feel about Oz or Persephone and this book didn't help me to decide. I am not sure if I want Khara to be with Oz and I am very leery of Persephone. I think both Oz and Persephone are selfish and I'm not sure if Khara can change this trait. I am in love with Kierson and I wanted (needed) more Kierson in this book. I am seriously looking forward to the next book.

"*I was given a copy of this audio book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*I started out listening to the audio book for The Woodlands, but I changed to reading the Kindle format after about 25% way through. I am not a huge audio book listener, so I'm not sure if it was just me but the narrator was just a tad over the top for me. It was almost like she was adding extra emphasis to all the words and not just the ones that needed emphasis. I was intrigued by the story so I went and downloaded the e-book (Free!!) from Amazon and finished it that way.I am really glad that I got the e-book copy and finished the story that way. I really enjoyed the story, the characters, and the drama. Everyone always uses the phrase ""twists and turns"" and there are some moments, fairly early, where you are completely shocked as the story unfolds. I would call these ""jaw dropping"" moments as that is kind of what happens when you read them. The author is very adept at making these surprising and not expected, which I tend to like. I would give the audio book version a 3.5 but I give the overall story 5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134MZSRSSHBKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPF5LSW#wasThisHelpful","R134MZSRSSHBKU","A2N0J7O4PGS711","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N0J7O4PGS711?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I initially received a copy of this book several months ago. I have read other books by Jake and have enjoyed his style of writing. He's a master of his craft and can transport you into the story as though you were a secondary character. He makes you see and feel things and lights a fire in your soul with each tale. You don't so much as read a story that Jake writes, but you go on a journey, an adventure. You truly get lost in the story and forget all else. The Tigress is no exception to these feats. It definitely is a story that takes you away to another place and time but the emotions and drama that you experience are real. You will encounter many feelings on this trip so be prepared. However, it's not a journey you want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GS3HSPDR0VXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3M52HE#wasThisHelpful","R1GS3HSPDR0VXZ","A2N0J7O4PGS711","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N0J7O4PGS711?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*I love reading children's books even without my children present. Having reluctant readers, I try to read children's books and then if they are really good, then I get them to read them. It seems to work as they have found new favorites this way. With children, it's about the excitement and enthusiasm I have found. You've got to transfer your enthusiasm for something to them and it'll usually catch like fire.This book about Byron being a werewolf and not being able to howl is a very embarrassing thing to him. He doesn't want anyone to know but doesn't know how to solve it. This book is good at helping kids relate to Byron and to show them that they aren't the only ones that are afraid or embarrassed. It also helps them understand how to help with these issues. It is a very well written story and the illustrations are cute.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OF34I78WLLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PV8YQYM#wasThisHelpful","R18OF34I78WLLF","A2N0J7O4PGS711","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N0J7O4PGS711?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was among the lucky few who received an ARC from the author.I have been a Ruby fan for a long time. The characters, settings, situations, and world that Amber creates is like long lost memories from your past; like having amnesia and reading your old diary entries to try and remember. Each and every story gets inside your head and leaves its mark. These stories not only become part of you but part of your past, present, and future. You cling to each story in anticipation of the roller coaster ride that your friends are going to take you on. You cry for these people; scream at them for stupid s***; get scared for them; and laugh at their humorous nature.  They aren't stories so much as a missing part of who you are.In Strayed, a lot of things happen and most all of the questions that have been posed have been answered. But it also brings new questions to light. This story isn't over by any means. Not yet. There are more trials and tribulations and adventures yet for the gang. Some, I'm sure, will be hard to bear, but Amber does a great job of helping you make peace with it. But know this: when you pick up Caged and start reading, you are making a commitment to these people. You will weather the storm and go on the roller coaster even though you are afraid of heights. And every second of it will be worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHOPX8KDK6MIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1ZIJNW#wasThisHelpful","RHOPX8KDK6MIY","A2N0J7O4PGS711","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N0J7O4PGS711?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If someone were to ask what my all time favorite series is, I'd have a hard time picking just one. However the Rose Gardner series is one I'd mention because it is awesome. Rose gets into shenanigans, sometimes through no fault of her own, and has a devil of a time trying to get out if it. There is suspense, drama, action, humor, and love. The characters are great and the writing is superb.I have not read anything by Jana DeLeon except this but that's about to change. The eccentric ghost Helena is a hoot and I'd like to read more about her hoodlumery. These two characters mesh well together and I could envision lots of scenarios where they end up having to help each other out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3NKRYCLSQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P84UABW#wasThisHelpful","R1G3NKRYCLSQ7","A2N0J7O4PGS711","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N0J7O4PGS711?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only thing that was going on at the time was I was laying my feet on it, propping them up.

"*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*I enjoy zombie books and apocalypse books even though it seems that there are tons of them out there. I tend to like the different zombie & apocalypse books. You know the atypical ones that have a different scenario and the zombies are different. Accumulation definitely falls into that category. It isn't the normal zombie story. The end of the world scenario happens differently and most people don't even know what is happening. The zombies are different in that they are kind of a hybrid type of zombie. The way that the ""virus"" is spread is different as well.

"I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't. I purchased it on Amazon to read after the original reviewer was unable to read it. First of all, the book needs some editing. I found multiple typos and the use of the wrong word, such as ""would of"" and ""should of"" instead of ""would have"" and ""should have."" There was also a lot of redundant phrases and the overall book was wordy. There was so much inner dialogue and I felt the book was really unnecessarily long. Some of the fight scenes went on for pages. I didn't connect with the characters. It was told from third person and just jumped all over the place with them so you never got a good feel for them. I didn't finish the book. I got to 80% and just couldn't read any more. Someone else may like this book, but it was not for me.

"*I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*Even though I was given a copy of this book, I bought a copy as well. I tend to do this with books that I love so that way I have the final copy in my possession. My pal and fellow hooligan, Joood at Platypire Reviews harassed me about Lindy's books a long time ago. I have read other books that she has written (not all of them yet), but I think Roomies is my favorite so far. I enjoyed the emotions that were on display throughout the book. The anguish Kennedy felt when she would think about or look at Graham was real and palpable. I mean, we've all been there at least once in our lives. Kennedy is also a fantastically hilarious and sarcastic character that I enjoyed immensely. Her interactions with Graham and Blake were awesome and the relationship she has with them is perfect.I loved that even though this was a romance, there wasn't sex or overly mushy sentiments being slung around. There was no one calling the other ""babe"" or ""baby"" which I loathe. Lindy is real adept at portraying the dynamic and complicated emotions that are involved when there is a secret crush or secret love. I was able to put myself in Kennedy's position and I was able to relate with her on a personal level. She is an awesome character and I hope to see more of her in the future.

"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I started reading this book and it immediately hooked me in. I could not put the book down and read it in one day. Yes, this is a zombie book, but it is not the usual zombie book. The main female character, Jackson, is a complete bad a$$ in every sense of the word. She may resemble a tiny little pixie, but she definitely does not act that way. She has been on the run from the zombies and she's trying to stay alive all on her own. She has to prove to these men that want to protect her that she doesn't need any protecting, not with her trusty machete ""Mandy"" by her side. However, she wants a sense of normalcy that she hasn't had in years and she's not sure if it even exists.This is a fascinating story and an adrenaline rush from the first page.

"*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This book has a lot of similarities to The Hunger Games and a couple of movies that I've seen, namely one called Cube that came out in 1997. It was predictable and mostly unoriginal. The action and adventure weren't really high energy or nail biting. The story twists weren't really exceptional. Kira was an odd character and where I was supposed to like her and feel empathy for her and she was supposed to be strong, it didn't happen. She was mainly a walking contradiction.

"*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*I love the science fiction and fantasy genres. When going through the requests for reviews, I generally pick all of them and claim them for myself. I hardly ever let the other reviewers have a chance to read them. That's why it's good to be the boss!  So, when this one came across, I snatched it up.This book is pretty fast paced and action packed. The main characters, Vaush and Comron, are very complex and deep. I enjoyed their banter and conflict in the story. There were many twists and turns in the book that I didn't see coming. You never know what's going to happen with them from one minute to the next. Are they going to give in to desires and their feelings or are their family bonds too strong? Very intriguing and nail biting scenes between these two with respect to their families.One thing that I will say about this book is that there is some sexy time scenes in it. I have issue with them because the author uses the word ""member"" for the man's private part and uses ""moistness"" for the woman's private part. Really? That is so not sexy. I really wish that authors would use the correct verbiage. Call it what it is. Don't put a sickening or hilarious adjective for it instead. We're all adults here. If you can't use the words to describe the parts, then maybe you shouldn't write a detailed sex scene and just fade to black. So, I will have to ""ding"" the author for that and can only give this story 4 books. But, I will be looking out for the next book in the series as it definitely has my interest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDX8WFRQUOH0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9QVKWU#wasThisHelpful","RDX8WFRQUOH0D","A2N0J7O4PGS711","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N0J7O4PGS711?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All Blues is a fantastic, gripping, sexy, roller coaster of a ride. Ethan ""Blues"" Sloane is a manly hunk of a man that's not going to let anything or anyone get in his way of taking down the people that wronged him. But, he doesn't plan on meeting Angel, an enticingly volatile and dangerous woman that Blues can't stop thinking about.Marie's writing just gets better and better. Her sex scenes are intense and are very vivid and imaginative. However, this story isn't just sex; there is a lot of mystery, intrigue, drama, etc going on at the same time. Blues is a very demanding character in everything he does and he is definitely the kind of man that women want in real life. He is caring, giving, loving, but troubled as well. Angel is mysterious, sensual, head strong, and can't keep popping up when Blues least expects it.This is an amazing story to go along with the All series. It is a hefty read, but it doesn't feel like it when you are reading it. You are clinging to the pages trying not to rush ahead to see what happens because then you would miss the lyrical writing style that is all Marie's.

"I was both excited and upset about the release of this book. I am elated to read more about the curse and what Ellie and Collin were going to do with all the demons running amok. At the same time, I don't want the story to end. I love these characters and I like the roller coaster ride that they took me on. It was actually hard for me to believe that Denise was going to be able to wrap everything up and give Ellie, Collin, and David a happy ending. Well, I'm not going to spoil anything for you readers, but let's just say that I didn't see that one coming!! Holy Hell the curve balls this lady threw during this story!! Seriously! I thought the rest of the books were edgy and suspenseful and unpredictable. Denise completely blew those thoughts right out of the water. This book was more tense, suspenseful, emotional, scary, terrifying, and frustrating than the other two books put together! She really did save the best for last.This was a great way to end this trilogy. I really and truly didn't expect the story to weave itself the way that it did. But it makes sense. The Curse Defiers answers a lot of questions and raises a whole slew of new ones at the same time. It is rumored that we haven't seen the last of Ellie, David, and Collin. The way this book was written leaves room for more books to follow should Denise decide to write more (YES PLEASE!). I was sad, hollow, empty, and felt all alone when I finished the book. I totally had a book hangover from this one because I just couldn't believe that it was over. I am going to be passing along subtle (yeah, right!) hints to Denise that she can't quit this series and that she has to at least let me have some more Collin. He is a very interesting, frustrating, and sexy character. He's trying to be a good guy but he's good at being bad. If it weren't for the connection between Ellie and Collin, Collin could have his own series by himself and I would be all over it. There aren't too many ""book boyfriends"" that I get emotional about, but he's one of them!

"*I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*I read Alice Tribue's first series and really liked it. Yes, it's a romance, but I enjoyed the story and the characters. When I read the synopsis for this story, I thought that it sounded good. I knew by reading the synopsis that this wasn't going to be a typical romance story. When I say typical I mean the kind of story where the boy and girl meet and are in love within the first 10 minutes of meeting. There is an attraction and a pull to them. Ugh, please. The story of Everly and Luca is most definitely not typical. Everly and Luca HATE each other. They literally can not stand to be in the same room as the other and they have never gotten along since the very beginning. Time isn't a helper in that fact either.Everly and Luca spend a lot of time bickering and hating each other that you aren't quite sure what's going to happen. It's one of those stories where you are asking yourself ""Where is this going? How are they going to go from this pure hatred to anything else?""

"This printer is virtually identical to model 7525 when is exclusively sold at Costco. I've looked at the two versions in person and can't tell a difference except for the model number on the front. I assume they change the model number to prevent ""best price guarantees"" having to match Costco's price.  I purchased this HP printer at Costco because my last HP printer was extremely temperamental, but this one isn't any better. Given the current state of printer technology HP shouldn't be producing printers this unreliable. Initial set-up wasn't as easy as advertised, but was doable. It worked flawlessly for about a month before the problems started cropping up.  First, even though it shows it's on the network my devices are completely unable to locate the printer.  This is a constant problem when the printer comes online from hibernation mode.  The only way to get it discoverable by my PC's and Mac is to turn the printer off and then back on.  At which point it's back in business.  This process worked for a couple months, but then I discovered that when I turned it off using the power button it wouldn't turn back on. Seriously, what else could go wrong.  I've fiddled with it for 10-15 minutes at a time trying to get it back on when we urgently needed something printed and the only thing that works (and even then less than 1/4 of the time) is to unplug the power cord from the back of the device and wall, wait a little bit, and then plug it all back in. IF I'm lucky, at that point it will power back on.  More often than not it won't.  If I try the power button again a few hours or days later, it will usually turn on, but by then whatever we needed to print in the first place is long past due.

I'm not wild about the color and wish they offered more color options, but I accepted the neon color when I made the purchase so I can' subtract a star for it being neon now.

"I was skeptical, but these definitely did the job.  My son is gaga over Pokemon though he's a little too young to play. He generally reads about the characters, memorizes their levels and abilities and compares their strength. These cards were a huge hit. He couldn't get over how many great cards I had gotten him for his birthday. There were no duplicates in the 25 card bundle.Now I'll caveat my review by saying that for my purposes these cards were perfect, BUT if you're actually a Pokemon player, you may or may not be as excited about these cards. I don't play, so I can't say for certain how powerful or rare these are.  Also, I should note that I purchased 2 separate sets of these ""25 Rare Pokemon Cards with 100+ HP"", and between the two sets, only 8 were duplicates, which I thought was a lower number than I'd expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C0YM2VVE98O8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTF5TT4#wasThisHelpful","R1C0YM2VVE98O8","A3D4F5Z9K6QF82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D4F5Z9K6QF82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The catch was that after 2 months of use the infrared lid has slowly stopped working over the course of the last couple weeks. At first it would only go up half way, and then day by day, it would open less and less. I double checked the batteries, and they were still strong, but I changed them anyway, just to be sure. No luck. At this point we're opening it by hand, which isn't convenient because there's really not much of a handle to use.

The first one lasted about 3.5 years, and while I think that's a decent length of time, in this day and age I think appliances should work a bit longer than that. That's the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Over the years it's worked great. The ability to adjust how fine it grinds is nice, though once we fiddled with it a bit and figured out our preferred level (medium) we never adjusted it again. There's usually some grounds build-up on the side of the canister, but I understand it's common with most all burr grinders, and it wasn't a huge problem.

These are two people I could easily see in my circle of friends!Let me tell ya how these two start out a relationship, or rather what Ryan does to start this relationship going ... he decides that he's gonna try out the suggestions in an article he read in Cosmo (yeah, that magazine lol) titled ""6 Ultimate Steps to the Perfect Summer Fling"" ... cue, ME laughing a lot thru this book!One thing I want to point out is the age of these two. Remember they are college students. So when you read this, there is gonna be a lot of corny things said and a lot of cliches going on, but if you read it in the right context, you WILL enjoy it. So read it for what it is and enjoy the corniness that is Ryan and Jules! And yes, it IS predictable, but it's supposed to be. This is not a drama filled angsty story.

"I love historical reads. There's something about them that always put a smile on my face. This one was no exception. As a matter of fact, it put more than a smile on my face, I was truly happy while I read this story.From their first introduction, Catherine Malboeuf and Nicholas Adair kept me captivated. The sparks that flew between these two were palpable. They flew of the pages and made me want to read more and more. Catherine's personality was irresistible. She was witty and bold and smart and just beautiful. Nicholas was strong and aloof and standoffish at the beginning, but with each passing turn of events he became more heartwarming and quite likeable!This wasn't just a romance story. Quite a few things happen throughout the book that allowed it to be a mini mystery alongside a romance story. There are twist and turns to this story and even though you know we are headed to a HEA, it wasn't an insta-love or even insta-attraction.

He owns his own coffee cart, lives with friends who don't judge his lifestyle choices and every day at 11:50 am, there's a bright spot to his day.

The book is told in Robby's POV so it is difficult to nail down David's feelings and thoughts. However, it's painfully obvious that he is closed off and the reason why.

You know the one ... a smile here, a touch there ... and while they danced, they became fast friends. So in reality, this was more of a friends to lovers story, but it just happened instantaneously. And that was perfect for these two. It was a beautiful blossoming to read. I loved every minute of this story. From building their friendship to becoming lovers. It was all very endearing.There are a lot of societal issues in play in regards to their lifestyle in this story and they were all dealt with care and finesse and very true to life.ARC provided by Kensington Books via NetGalley for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFELXMD1GTS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR778#wasThisHelpful","RBFELXMD1GTS5","A3D0WH8OVCHU86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D0WH8OVCHU86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not only do Rose & Cole fall hard for each other, but they fall fast!Rose Weatherston is an out of work actress. She was top in her acting class, but can't get a decent job. Cole Dean is an international movie star on the cover of every tabloid!Opposites attract, right?! ;) Well they do here .... lolSo the story goes like this ... it's quite simple really (but really cute), Rose needs a job and Cole needs a live-in assistant.

They've also secretly held each other in each other's hearts their whole lives. But what you wish is not always what you get in life. Things happen. Life happens. Basically, Eve's best friend was in love with Connor and because Eve's family and Connor's family have been mortal enemies since the beginning of time, it was easy to hide their feelings for one another and let Connor ride off into the sunset with someone else.,,,But that was then and this is now .....Today, Connor finds himself a single dad in desperate need for help. He's had to battle the system for custody of his children and really needs stability for them. Cue our lovely Eve ....

"holy hell .... 2 am read without even blinking!I was a little apprehensive when I read the blurb of the book because I'm not usually an NA reader. But then I clicked on the author to find out about them and wham ... Kit Rocha duo! #soldA few things stand out to me:~I read this book without stopping. Not because it was overly dramatic or suspenseful or even angsty ... it was easy to read. The language and format used in the story sucked me in from page one. As you can see above, it was 2 am when I finished and I didn't even know it.~The age of the leads and supporting characters never once entered my mind. You see, young people do annoying things (lol), which are totally normal..for their age group that is. But I don't have the patience for it so I try and stay away from books involving this age group. But I never felt it, not once. So again I say ... easy to read.So the story goes like this ... Hannah Casey is back home because Daddy drove drunk. Got himself killed and Mom is on life support. Someone has to pull the plug and Hannah is the last of the line...Sean Whitlow is Hannah's deceased sister's ex-boyfriend (say that five times real fast lol) and he was also Hannah's first crush ...OK, to say that Hannah had a dysfunctional relationship with her family is probably putting it mildly. They were the epitome of small town socialites who put on a facade for the world outside their home opposite that of what their life was truly like. As you read through the story, the past will unfold but it won't be the focus of the story. You will get just enough information to understand Hannah's motivations but it never takes you away from the real story... The story of a girl so withdrawn inside herself and so used to upholding the facade that her parents had created that she has no idea who she is, and the boy who holds her hand while she tears at the layers upon layers of a life she doesn't want so she can figure out who she is.The connection that Hannah and Sean shared was instantaneous and it was electric. The sparks flew right off the page when they were together. The progression of their relationship felt natural and real. There are sub-plots in this story that deal with some serious issues like alcoholism, suicide and personality disorders. They were unfolded in such a way that helped enhance the story but didn't overshadow the romance.The secondary characters already introduced have peaked my interest and I can't wait to read their stories!ARC provided by CrushStar Multimedia LLC via NetGalley for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZAF14TSO00Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141KJL1S#wasThisHelpful","R1KZAF14TSO00Y","A3D0WH8OVCHU86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D0WH8OVCHU86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first AND most important thing you should know about this story is that it is overwhelmingly emotional. Not in your typical, that's a sad moment emotional, but the story itself is emotionally charged. When I was reading this story, I felt this overwhelming longing ... I couldn't quite put my finger on exactly what was causing it until I realized it wasn't any one thing or event. The story is electric, charged with emotion! The second thing you should know is that in my opinion, this is by far, Zoe York's best work yet. She exceeded my expectations with this novella length story. Exceeded because it doesn't read like a short story. It has depth and meaning and purpose beyond anything a short story can normally carry.This is the story of Melissa Vincent and Cade Duncan. More aptly stated, this is the story of Melissa Vincent and the man who walked side by side with her on her journey of growth and discovery and ultimately love.To say Melissa Vincent is emotionally 'closed-off' is an understatement. She's an only child with a very skewed perception of what relationships and love should be all about. No, that's not right ... she knows what it should be about, she just doesn't have a point of reference. Her parent's relationship was dysfunctional at best. Her father was nothing more than a sperm donor and she's never let anyone in close enough because of it. Until Cade .... Cade Duncan knew the minute he set eyes on Melissa, the prettiest girl he'd seen in a long time, that he needed a date with her. It wasn't smooth sailing getting to that date, but he got it ... and then some.The story goes like this ... Melissa and Jared Sutter (her best friend's husband) were scheduled to fly to Hawaii to take part in an endurance race/challenge. But Jared becomes unavailable so Cade grabs on to this opportunity like his life depended on it. Because he knows there's a special girl under all that prickliness and this is his ticket to get to know this special girl. As I mentioned before, this book is more about Melissa than anyone or anything else. This endurance race is not just any race. It's both an opportunity to connect and a journey to discover for Melissa. You'll have to read for yourself the how and the why. But trust when I say this is not your ordinary short story.... it's short and sweet and packs a punch like no other.This is a story embroidered with feeling, hope. vulnerability, acceptance, trust, growth and love ...

"So the story of Allison and Robert continues exactly where Stoned: A Billionaire Stepbrother With Benefits Romance left off. She's just found out the big news ... what to do, what to do...I have to give Cynthia Sharon credit because this installment brought the LOL with a bang for me. I absolutely love the direction she is taking with both Allison and Robert's attitudes towards the whole step-sibling matter. It's exactly how it should be! The story had no awkward moments of intimacy, but once again, it does leave you craving and wanting. And altho that is a good thing when it comes to stories told in installments, there also should be a sense of purpose to the story. As of right now, this reader has no clue what the objective or end game is to this story...because all I'm reading are moments in time. There's not enough story being told to even give me an idea of a HEA or HFN ending, if there's even one...The problem with stories told in this format is that, as a reader, the second I begin to get comfortable with the story and/or invested, it ends ... and we play the waiting game for the next installment. In my opinion, this takes away from the excitement of the story .. turns what is an engaging and exciting sexy story, anticlimactic.I still want to make sure all future readers know this: The idea/concept of this story is unique and well told.

"This is normally something I wouldn't read until fully published because 1. not a fan of cliffhangers and 2. way too shortBUT, Cynthia Sharon asked for my honest opinion sooooo stay tuned ...OK...so here's the skinny *snickers* ... Cynthia Sharon has potential. There's obvious edit problems that bug me because she probably paid well to have this edited but that never influences my reviews. What does influence it is the writing style, the development, and overall voice of the story.This wasn't perfect, in my opinion, the kiss was like reading a boy coming up to a girl in the school hall and stealing a kiss ...awkward lol and the orgasm felt out of place ... like it was just written in there with no lead to it, again awkward.But I'll tell you what was good ... her development of not only the story (so far) and both Allison and Robert. I know where this is going, so that's a good sign. I don't know how it's going to get there, also a good sign because it makes it not predictable in a trope that's been done a thousand times before...hopefully all you future readers will understand what I'm trying to tell ya there LOLThe best part so far is the POV. It's in both Robert's and Allison's so I get to experience them both (always a plus) and Cynthia Sharon made sure I knew exactly who they were. She developed both Allison and Robert perfectly and told me just enough about each of them to hook me into ... cannot WAIT to read more ... that's potential kids.SO one-click this installment ... it's not a full story, but you'll be hooked ;) #TRUST","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S7RNWH3VJ1KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0115A4QT4#wasThisHelpful","R1S7RNWH3VJ1KG","A3D0WH8OVCHU86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D0WH8OVCHU86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WHAT A PASSIONATE STORY! LOVED IT!Leah was absolute perfection. She was strong and independent, secure in her blindness, passionate, loving, caring .... I could go on. Kudos to Bonnie Dee for giving us a true heroine, in more ways than one! You see, Leah has a disability. She is blind. And her parents have guarded her and taken care of her since the accident that took her sight but she is more than ready to take on the world on her own. And she does! LOVED HER!JD, the neighbor, is our hero. He's no ordinary neighbor. He's been hired by her Leah's family to look out for her, unbeknownst to Leah, of course! JD and Leah actually met BEFORE he was hired and he already knew he was attracted to the 'brunette at the bar'. LOL How they met? Leah and her girlfriend went out one evening to a bar and JD and his friend were at the same bar just out on a night having a good time. When they bumped into each other accidentally SPARKS flew!! When he gets the job as her security 'detail' of course he jumps on it.Leah and JD had passion and chemistry that you could feel thru the pages. As they both form a friendship, JD begins to realize he is in WAY deep and maybe he wouldn't be able to get out. Remember, Leah has no clue that he is actually there, hired by her parents, to look out for her. So the lies start piling up! Will they both be able to adjust to the truth and live HEA? ....This book was amazingly good! We get both their perspectives in the story due to the dual POV. I think that is ALWAYS a plus in a story. It makes the story more well rounded and not so one-sided. We got to feel both their struggles!You cannot go wrong with this story!

"ARC provided by Entangled Publishing, LLC via NetGalley for an honest review.I'm not gonna lie....the cover really attracted me to this book. Without reading a word of the blurb, I knew I wanted to read it. It was flirty and fun, just the right kinda mix for a quick romance read. And the book lived up to the cover! :) The story was quick and cute and fun. It's my first read by Stefanie London and I am looking forward to much much more from her in the future!Gracie is going to find herself the perfect man and she's making a list of things her man has to have in order to make the cut. The thing you should know, is that Gracie isn't really trying to find the perfect man for herself, but more so for the expectations that her family (mother) have put on her to do so. Cue, our VERY hot bartender/friend, Des. Now Des has had his eye on Gracie for quite some time, but she's off limits to him because he's been there done that in the 'society' world and is not doing it again! Or is he?!?!As he watches Gracie with her many dates from behind the bar, he cant help but fall little by little. Will Gracie see that her Mr Rights are really just SO wrong and the one she assumes to be Mr Wrong is oh SO right?! You're gonna have to read to find out ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291E9PZA35PEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6DRXGI#wasThisHelpful","R291E9PZA35PEG","A3D0WH8OVCHU86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D0WH8OVCHU86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish this book was longer :( It was lively and fun and easy to read so once I started, I didn't put it down and then WHAM, it was done :(The entire book was FULL of witty and hilarious humor! I think it has a lot to do with the 'times', but when I read a historical romance novel, I find myself VERY entertained. The speech is just so 'highfalutin' for lack of a better term that it just makes it laughable! Every scene was FULL of good, sassy, witty banter!SO the story goes like this .... Oliver comes home from war to a title AND he's almost bankrupt ... Thanks Dad! lol Desperate times call for desperate measure so he has to find himself a wealthy wife like yesterday! But the universe has something totally different in mind for good old Oliver :) And now I present you with Grace. Grace has the same circumstances as Oliver. But she needs the money for different reasons. Her mother is ill, grandparents won't help ... it's just a big mess. So OF COURSE they fall for each other! LOL CUE, the wonderfully sweet romance story of Oliver and Gracie :)The things these two will do for each other will put a little mist in your eyes. This is a KEEPER story for me that will be read many times in the future!ARC provided by Intrepid Reads via NetGalley for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RBRGFZX4YNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV9EXLS#wasThisHelpful","R38RBRGFZX4YNU","A3D0WH8OVCHU86","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3D0WH8OVCHU86?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are real people out there like Agnes ""Apple"" Bailey, the 16-year old girl who runs away from her abusive mother at the start of the film ""Gimme Shelter,"" only to end up pregnant and homeless on the streets of New York. But Apple, portrayed convincingly by a near-unrecognizable Vanessa Hudgens, is only one highlight of this film.Excellent performances are also found with the sympathetic Father McCarthy (James Earl Jones) and the abusive mother (Rosario Dawson) who influence the direction of Apple's life. And Kathy DiFiore, the compassionate social worker (Ann Dowd) who takes in Apple, is portrayed with great compassion. After trading an abusive marriage for homelessness, the real-life DiFiore founded the ""Several Sources"" homeless shelters for pregnant teens that inspired this little indie film.Bottom line: This movie is the absolute best pro-life film I've ever seen. It's more high-quality that low-budget Protestant stuff like ""October Baby."" It's also more realistic than ""Bella"" since it's based on a true story. Although ""Bella"" is a powerful and moving film, it's also a whimsical fiction, whereas ""Gimme Shelter"" gets added grit from its basis in real life. It is a labor of love.Both ""Bella"" and ""Gimme Shelter"" are Catholic films, but ""Gimme Shelter"" feels more real, more heartfelt, and more immediate to the experience of young people growing up in a world of haves and have-nots.It's also one of the best social justice films I've ever seen, giving an amazingly sharp depiction of teenage homelessness that riveted my theology students when we watched the film together. They are usually pretty immune to any sort of ""care about the world"" message. But this film, maybe because Vanessa Hudgens was in it got to them. ""Gimme Shelter"" has the biting realism of ""Dead Man Walking"" without any of the moral sermonizing.This DVD includes a brilliant transfer with 5.1 audio, deleted scenes with director's commentary, a ""making of"" featurette,and the usual Spanish subtitles. It's a great package of a great indie film. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FF09J9C6Y7KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HW3EJQE#wasThisHelpful","R3FF09J9C6Y7KY","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a ""Shroud fanatic,"" but merely curious after seeing a lecture on it, and I was quite impressed by this DVD package from Ignatius Press. It contains three documentaries and special features which include trailers and three additional documentary clips. These films give a good overview of scientific investigations into the ""Shroud of Turin,"" an unusual cloth that many people believe to be the burial shroud of Jesus Christ preserved down through the centuries.The first film is ""The Silent Witness,"" a 53-minute British Academy Award winning (1978) documentary narrated by Kenneth More. This film ignited worldwide interest in the Shroud, but is a bit disjointed and dated, being more of historical interest nowadays for its fascinating exploration of a few well-known discoveries. The second two films -- ""Shroud of Turin"" (2008 BBC documentary, 59 minutes) and ""Shroud (2010, 48 minutes) -- are more contemporary and include recent items like the carbon dating that cast some doubt on the Shroud's authenticity. They are also never dull. What I love most about this product is that it has all of this stuff on ONE DVD rather than a multi-disc set, making it a convenient package. I recommend it to anyone interested in this topic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HC93250V9W6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S2EOZI#wasThisHelpful","R3HC93250V9W6V","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Father John Kavanaugh SJ, the late Jesuit philosopher at Saint Louis University, was one of the most accessible philosophical ethicists of modern times. Author of the ""ethics notebook"" in America magazine, Kavanaugh is still best known for this little paperback on the ethics of being a Christian in today's materialistic consumer society. This book is definitely on the side of applied rather than theoretical ethics, but it will really make you think in the way it applies humanistic ethical principles to contemporary life.

"This ABC News Special DVD features only a ""play"" option on the menu. It is simply 1 hour and 24 minutes of news coverage from the last days, death, wake, and funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005. I found the disc to be a great historical record of an event I remember very vividly from television in April 2005. It's a useful disc if you are teaching history or religion or journalism and want something to show students to evoke the legacy of Pope John Paul II, recently canonized by Pope Francis on 27 April 2014 as Saint John Paul II. The commentary by ABC News commentators is occasionally superficial, but does a nice job of recalling key moments in the papacy and in the international appeal of history's third-longest papal reign. I also like that the disc includes some moments where the commentators are silent and let the images speak for themselves. Everything is stock footage, without any retrospective added. Not just for Catholics, but for anyone who wants to learn about John Paul II's legacy, this disc is a great slice of recent history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9LHL55MX2GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IMVOSM#wasThisHelpful","R1O9LHL55MX2GR","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Confessions"" of St. Augustine of Hippo, beloved by Catholics and Protestants alike, is probably the most well-read Christian autobiography of all time. Augustine, whose 76 years (AD 354-430) saw the final decline of the Roman Empire, went from a hedonistic youth (where he made a brilliant public speaking career and drifted through several eccentric philosophies of life) to become one of the greatest Christian thinkers of all time. He even fathered a child out of wedlock with one of several women he seduced, praying to God for ""chastity and continence -- but not yet."" His father was a pagan, but his Christian mother St. Monica and St. Ambrose the bishop of Milan made fruitless efforts to convert him to Christianity.At age 32, Augustine finally picked up the Bible and read a passage (Rom 14:13-14) from St. Paul's letter to the Romans that exhorted readers to ""put on Christ"" rather than drunkenness, leading him to confront the unhappiness that had resulted from his life choices. He quickly obtained baptism from St. Ambrose, rising to become a priest and later bishop in Hippo, where he died in AD 430 as the Vandal barbarians besieged his city's gates. The Roman Empire fell shortly afterwards.Recognized by Roman Catholicism as a bishop and doctor of the Church, St. Augustine is one of the most influential writers from the first 500 years of Christianity, with his ""City of God"" defending Christianity's influence on the Roman Empire and his brutally honest ""Confessions"" describing how God fulfilled his deepest desires after years of restlessly searching for fulfillment. When I read the ""Confessions"" in college, I was blown away by its heartfelt narrative and deeply theological passages, but I never thought it would be visualized in a movie. This production proves me wrong.The film ""Restless Heart"" is directed by French Canadian director Christian Duguay (""Joan of Arc,"" 1999) and originated as an Italian TV miniseries. This Ignatius Press two-disc DVD set includes one disc with a feature-length cut released in U.S. churches and the original three-hour cut on a second disc. The first disc with the theatrical cut is vastly superior, featuring enhanced picture and sound in addition to special features that include a little EWTN television documentary on Augustine hosted by Franciscan friar Andrew Apostoli CFR. The second disc features just the original film cut in washed-out colors, appearing untouched from its television premiere. Having seen both versions, I believe you get the gist of the story on Disc 1, while the three-hour cut from Disc 2 mostly includes fictionalized elements that add nothing to the story.The story is told in flashback by an elderly Augustine awaiting the barbarian attack on Hippo in AD 430, building to a moving climax. Flawlessly dubbed, it looks like it was originally filmed in English, and I still can't believe how well the voice work matches up with the actors. Believe me: I utterly DESPISE dubbing on foreign films, particularly as found in most of the Italian RAI-TV productions released on DVD by Ignatius Press in the United States. But this film is actually awesome in English, defying conventional wisdom about dubbing.I showed ""Restless Heart"" (theatrical cut) to 16-year old students in a scripture class and they were astounded at the high quality of the film, very different from many other titles in the Ignatius Press catalogue. Many of the scenes, particularly the conversion sequence of Augustine and final scene with his mother, follow the ""Confessions"" so well that they will move you to tears. Other more historical sequences, including the final assault on Hippo in Augustine's last hours, are brilliant in evoking Christianity's final triumph over the Roman Empire and role in preserving the best of its heritage throughout the coming dark ages. The production values and special effects are extremely good here. If you love St. Augustine, you'll love this movie. Also, if you enjoyed the ""Saint Barbara"" DVD from Ignatius Press, you'll also love this film since its visual style and music (same composer, Andrea Guerra) is the same. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5RH1L8R96DHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHU35HM#wasThisHelpful","R5RH1L8R96DHW","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This intriguing 56-minute National Geographic video follows explorer Robert Ballard, famed for his discovery of the Titantic wreckage, as he searches the Black Sea for evidence of the Great Flood and Noah's ark. Since the bottom of the Black Sea is poisonous, wood is preserved at the bottom, and Ballard seeks ancient shipwrecks there. Ballard follows a geological theory that the Great Flood created the Black Sea and inspire the Noah story. For a NatGeo special, this video is pretty involving, and is respectful of religious beliefs without relying on them. I suspect that even younger people would be fascinated by this video, particularly in the wake of Russell Crowe's role in ""Noah."" I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn a little bit about the scientific and historical evidence of the Great Flood.Like many NatGeo DVDs, this disc has no menu, but simply plays the movie when you insert it into your player.

"This 93-minute 1977 television film tells the story of Father Eusebio Kino SJ, a 17th/18th century Italian Jesuit missionary to what is now the Western United States. Despite the excellent cast and Fulton Sheen narration, the film on this DVD is of dreadful quality, with sound and video quality resembling something from 1970s public access programming. It feels much longer than its running length and is very hard to watch..Even if you're able to pick up the dialogue, the film's narrative is so muddled that you will simply be lost through most of it. Father Kino, played by a thoroughly American-sounding Richard Egan, starts churches and deals with tensions between Indians and European settlers. But everything unfolds in vignette-style without any clear transitions or context for what we are watching. Although a California Jesuit historian seems to have consulted on this film, and it appears to be the only movie on this significant man's life, nothing quite comes together.If you're looking for some visualization of Father Kino's life, this film is pretty much your only bet. You might find some way to enjoy it if you've done a lot of supplemental reading that helps you understand what's occurring in the movie. But in almost every conceivable way, this movie is an amateur and lifeless production, unlikely to inform or inspire anyone at all. You may want to pay to stream it online, just to see it, but I recommend avoiding ""The Father Kino Story"" unless you have a very strong interest in this subject.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11GSROPPEE2HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C29MEVU#wasThisHelpful","R11GSROPPEE2HR","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2-hour documentary on the archaeological roots of Jerusalem covers its history as a Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religious center. Like most PBS documentaries, it is richly produced and beautifully filmed, being flawed only insofar that it is tremendously boring. Ray Suarez (""The News Hour"") is a good host as he addresses the camera during the film's journey through the city, including some lovely camerawork. The scholars are on-target and insightful.But boy oh boy, is this video dull! It's like PBS dopes its programs with a special chemical that induces sleep. I love this material, but PBS turns it all into a monotonous drone, and I'm afraid public television still hasn't learned the tricks of digital special effects and cinematic editing employed by National Geographic and History Channel. The style here is a classic documentary approach, interlacing thoughtful interviews with static photography and location footage, without any stylistic flair at all. The problem is that this film is a 2009 documentary using 1979's videography techniques. I strongly recommend this video for its content, but not for its style, and I would caution anyone against using it with young students accustomed to modern visuals. Older adults and people with a special research interest in the topic will enjoy it, but younger people will either zone out or bang their heads against a wall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OS72R6VAED3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q7JM32#wasThisHelpful","R2OS72R6VAED3I","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Father Harry J. Gensler, a Jesuit priest and philosopher, packs a lot of material into this large glossy paperback logic textbook. Covering both traditional and contemporary logic, he also provides a history of logic in addition to logic exercises for each section that correspond to an online logic program at his website.

Since I don't know a lot of math and am generally intimidated by logic, I thought this book would lose me pretty quickly, but I was pleased to discover that I could follow it (even when I didn't take time to do all the exercises) very easily.

"Peter Kreeft, Jesuit-educated philosopher at Boston College, is a well-known popularizer of philosophy for undergraduate students. This slender and glossy paperback is an introduction to philosophy through the Apology of Plato.

The book proceeds with narrative passages from the Apology, making it a fun companion to Plato's dialogue for an intro to philosophy or ancient philosophy class.

"The French Catholic, Jesuit-educated 19th century writer Honore Balzac is a sublime and haunting writer. This Dover Thrift Edition is a very cheap razor-thin paperback containing one of his best short stories, about a painter who labors for years over the fiercely guarded titular masterpiece, as well as some other delightful tales. These Romantic stories are simultaneously deep and highly satisfying in their grasp of human nature, without devolving into the grotesque flourishes of a Gaston Leroux or the eye-rolling melodramatics of a Victor Hugo, and you'll be surprised at the sparse beauty of his narrative. He's just a wonderful storyteller. If you've never read Balzac, I recommend starting with these stories rather than his epic-length novels, and see if you feel moved to read more from that point.

"The pianist Alfred Brendel is a sensitive and nuanced interpreter of Catholic composer Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies. For depth and tonality, this album is one of the best recordings you will find, particularly if you're looking to perform Liszt yourself. Brendel is no flashy or risk-taking performer, but an accomplished and relaxed master of the keyboard, which comes through very strongly in this listening experience. His performance is confident and robust, but also balanced and consistent, remaining faithful to the music as Liszt wrote it. The sound on this CD recording is a bit quiet at times and may require some volume boosts, but overall it is a highly satisfying rendition.

"After years of being dissatisfied with different paperback editions of Plato, I finally stumbled across this Dover Thrift Edition of Plato's four most essential biographical dialogues. Focusing on the life and person of Socrates, this razor-thin paperback volume is the most affordable and accessible introduction to Plato that you will find on the market. Rather than plunging you directly into the Republic and other more abstract writings, it wisely focuses on what we all love about Plato: His dialogues centering on the eccentric life and Christ-like death of his great teacher Socrates. This English translation is the old standard one, of course, but it's a wonderfully slender little volume that gives you enough Plato without overwhelming you. For those of us who like our Plato in small doses, rather than in a fat trade paperback (i.e. Signet Classics) or big expensive tome of collected writings, this volume is wonderful. In our electronic world, there's little need to have all the writings of Plato in one hardcopy edition anyway, as one will easily find several free and inexpensive translations of his entire corpus in electronic formats online.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BFXJ6TSENAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486270661#wasThisHelpful","R29BFXJ6TSENAQ","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thick paperback volume contains selections from the ""Summa Theologica"" with glossary, commentary, and heavy footnotes from Boston College professor Peter Kreeft. If you're looking to dive into the medieval Catholic philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, you may find this book a good starting point, as it explains technical terms while doing its best to make the Angelic Doctor's massive tome accessible for students today. It's still a very formidable text in its own right, presenting the dilemma of whether to read through the text first and then the footnotes later, or to undertake the painstaking process of reading through both at the same time. Kreeft's writings are sometimes a mixed bag, as he is not always wholly successful in popularizing philosophy, but this particular book (like ""Philosophy 101: An Introduction to Philosophy"") is one of his stronger efforts. Personally, I stopped reading after awhile because I realized I could ingest more by reading through Aquinas directly and looking things up at my leisure. That's very easy to do in an electronic age where you can easily search electronically for terms and other technicalities. Nevertheless, this book is invaluable for those who want the guidance of a great teacher like Kreeft, whose books are probably the next best thing to taking his classes at the venerable Jesuit institution where he has been a fixture for many years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAJNUJW4EGCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=089870300X#wasThisHelpful","R1FAJNUJW4EGCH","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just in time for Pope Francis to canonize Saint John Paul II on 27 April 2014, we have a new book on the saint by popular Catholic youth speaker Jason Evert. Evert, Jesuit-educated at Brophy Prep, has made a career with his wife Crystalina as a popular fixture on the Catholic youth and young adult speaking circuit. Speaking in the U.S. and beyond, they emphasize the value of chastity and of saving oneself until marriage, frequently citing their inspiration from JPII's theology of the body. As such, it's highly appropriate that this new book focuses on the ""five loves"" of a pope who focused a good part of his ministry on recovering a self-sacrificing notion of human love for the public square. This is a reverential book written with style and humor in an accessible, non-technical style. If you've read Evert's other books on sexuality and relationships, you'll know what to expect here, but there's a more warmly personal focus in this book on the pope whose love for humanity inspired so many. If you want uplifting spiritual reading for Easter, I highly recommend this paperback book as a simple love letter to the ""pope of the young"" whom so many of us still recall with deep affection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1YBAUE4LLSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991375408#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1YBAUE4LLSB","ATB8MP2M9L5PM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATB8MP2M9L5PM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hardcover book with ribbon markers is the standard cheap English edition of the ""Book of Blessings"" revised under Pope John Paul II in the late 1980s, approved for use in the dioceses of the United States. It is indispensable for any Roman Catholic priest or parish. Although it's possible this book's translation from the original Latin will again be revised in the distant future, as Pope Benedict XVI did with the Roman Missal in fall 2011, this revision will not happen anytime soon. We Latin Rite Catholics must simply substitute ""and with your spirit"" for the old response and continue using everything else here for the foreseeable future. There are also abridged editions of this book (""Shorter Book of Blessings,"" etc.) that include only the blessings used outside of mass, being more suitable for pastoral work on the road. This larger book is the one to get for your parish sacristy or priest's personal library. It includes all of the special blessings that one may use within mass, i.e. Mothers Day blessings and blessings of liturgical items. If you know a newly ordained priest or parish that needs an extra copy of this book for blessings, or perhaps a new one to replace a tattered old copy, then I highly recommend getting this book.

"I have always used Spry and loved its product line, including their gum and pastilles, for their taste and to reduce cavities in my children and myself.  It seemed to be effective because whenever we used Xlear toothpaste, we seemed to get no cavities compared to the years we used regular Crest or Colgate fluoride toothpastes.  During those years, cavities abounded, and our diet has not changed appreciably since then.  If anything, I think we probably consume even more sugar today than we did years ago.""Xylitol cannot be metabolized by plaque bacteria, contrary to sorbitol and other 6-carbon polyols, and may thus favour mineralization.""  This is from the European Journal of Dentistry.  HOWEVER, this same source also indicates:  ""Studies with low daily doses of xylitol are known as a rule to fail to show any caries-preventive effects. To obtain beneficial xylitol-effects on mutans streptococci, on plaque and caries occurrence xylitol must be consumed three times or more per day, with a daily dose of 5-6 grams.""  (Eur J Dent. Apr 2009; 3(2): 81-82.)How does xylitol work to prevent caries?  It inhibits growth of the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans.  (Incidentally, it also prevents periodontal disease and has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of ear infections.)Other studies I saw indicated an optimal dose for cavity prevention in the order of 4.3 to 10 grams per day.  So how much xylitol is in this toothpaste, and how much are you getting when you place a small amount on your toothbrush each day?This is difficult to quantify since everyone uses a different amount of toothpaste.  However, some smart people have already done the math for us at xylitolpreventscavities.com.  Basically, Spry contains 25% xylitol, and it is not the first ingredient after the active ingredient, which is fluoride.  The first ingredient is water.We are getting around half a gram to a gram of xylitol each time we brush our teeth with this product.  Therefore, the more xylitol in the product, the closer we get to the optimum dose.  The highest concentration is found in Squigle toothpaste (which you can find here on Amazon; I have it and will use it more than Spry now that I know this).  To obtain the optimum dosing of xylitol in your diet for caries prevention, you would probably need to chew Spry gum and pastilles at least a few times a day.Moreover, the controversy around the harmful effects of fluoride has been widely published, and certain cities in the United States have even removed it from their water supplies, I have steered clear of fluoride toothpastes.  Ah, but Xlear Spry has fluoride in it, 0.243%, according to the label.  This is why I removed a star from a potential five star rating.  Xlear makes a non-fluoride Spry toothpaste, and that one I would give five stars.I like the taste of this toothpaste.  It is very minty without being overwhelming.  It did take me three days to get used to its different minty taste, but afterwards, I liked it more and more than any commercial fluoride toothpaste I had ever used, including Tom's.  My children like the taste, also, and this is important to promoting brushing.  Overall, I would recommend it, but not over its non-fluoride counterpart.  Despite its lengthiness, I hope this review has helped people make an informed decision.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ3Q7Y96XY4TG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HNJ7HI#wasThisHelpful","RQ3Q7Y96XY4TG","A2QVOOPVGQCDCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QVOOPVGQCDCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, the fine folks at Mezzati asked me to review my purchase of these bed sheets, and I am happy to comply.  I won't waste space or your time writing a lengthy review.I LOVE these sheets.  I poked round Amazon looking for a nice, affordable set of basic king bed sized sheets.  I saw many other sheets for more money than these babies, and their reviews were slightly lower.  I thought to myself, ""What gives?""  I thought it was the pricier the better with bed sheets!  Not so.  Unlike most other sheets I have bought in department stores, these sheets do NOT PILL, do not have hanging threads, and do not smell bad when you unwrap them.What DO they do, then?  They provide a super-easy bed-making experience courtesy of their extra-deep seamed pockets (no more re-tucking sheets or re-making the bed after a night of sleep when your big husband manages to untuck every corner on his side).  So, sheets stay tucked.They are supremely soft.  I was surprised at how soft they are.  They are very comfortable against the skin.  And when I wash them, I have a feeling they will wash well - but I'm using cold water just to be sure.Bottom line?  These are excellent sheets for the price.  Beyond excellent.

"Where have these been all my life?  I explain to my daughter the myriad types of inferior, bulky, and useless pads that existed when I was a teen in the eighties, and she and I heave sighs of relief that she doesn't have to go through all that mess.  ""How did you ever have a life during your period, Mama?""Well, I sort of didn't.  Those were the days when heavy flow gals like us curled up with a good book and stayed home, or in bed, or anywhere they could always be near a bathroom.  But those days are gone.These pads are amazing.  Heavy flow is directed to the bottom of the pad and well-distributed throughout, so when you can't get to a bathroom for a couple of hours, you needn't worry.  The pad can handle the extra flow, and even better, the top lining manages to stay dry, so you don't even feel the moisture against your skin.Watch out, though, because these pads are so efficient at trapping flow that they can trick you into thinking there is less flow within them than there really is.  To demonstrate:  after it has had a chance to absorb quite a bit, next time, turn the pad over when you remove it.  You will see that the entire pad is drenched, with the blood occupying an area much larger than the smaller stain visible to you on the top lining.I have had days when I wasn't able to get to a bathroom for hours, or when I (very often) forgot to place extra pads in my purse and gone out for the day, and these babies never let me down.  Such times used to create a major mess in my pants, accompanied by several panicked minutes in a bathroom stall trying to figure out how to ditch my companions, steal someone's sweater or jacket, AND/or race home sitting on a towel, grocery bag, ANYTHING to protect my car seats, but not with these Radiant Infinities!  I have not had a single leak or accident with them yet, and I can flow up to 10 ml per hour on my heavy days (measured with a Diva Cup).  That's a lot.  I would estimate that these pads can hold 20 times their weight in liquid.They are the ONLY pads our family of women uses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT1J1UQTNWQN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHOG7KO#wasThisHelpful","RT1J1UQTNWQN5","A2QVOOPVGQCDCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QVOOPVGQCDCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He says that he likes the strawberry and citrus flavors more than this tropical punch, but he still used these up fast!  Clif Bloks are the go-to energy source for distance running and cycling (which is what I use them for).PROS:  nary any stomach upset with these babies; the carb-delivery system is super-fast -- around 15 minutes -- so you don't have to wait long for bioavailable energy.CONS:  for high demands like racing and anaerobic efforts, the energy is quickly assimilated, but also fast-burning.

"I ordered these boots for my husband who is a construction superintendent.  In today's lean times, he has had to perform more and more labor with his guys due to severe layoffs of workers.  He has always done a lot of labor, anyway, so he always requires specific features in his work boots, namely, that they have steel-toes (OSHA requirement), are waterproof, do not lace higher than 8"" due to chronic Achilles issues caused by this type of footwear, and during winter months, are insulated.These are not the finest of the boots he has worn over the years, but they get the job done.PROS:  they are what they claim to be; they fit well; they are heavy-duty; and they are moderately comfortable.  They also seem to have non-marking soles, an important feature for walking on light-colored floors in his high-end, custom made homes.CONS:  He claims that they are not truly waterproof, which makes sense.  His 100% waterproof boots in the past have had a layer of Gore-Tex or other waterproofing.  I think these are merely chemically treated, not seam-sealed, for waterproofing.They do not have a reinforced covering on the toes, so the steel toe covering on these will wear out for him in about five months, exposing the metal.  This has occurred in the past.  Since he is superintendent, this is unacceptable to him, for safety reasons as well as regulations.Overall, a good work boot.  It will get the job done.  However, for people like my husband who go through boots quickly, they won't last a year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIO8RRYNBOHDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PPMWUG#wasThisHelpful","RIO8RRYNBOHDX","A2QVOOPVGQCDCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QVOOPVGQCDCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently got braces at age 46, and this mirror saved me from tears of frustration when trying to floss.  As those of you with braces know, it really takes two hands, a good magnification mirror, and a great deal of patience to floss effectively, especially those dark crevices in the molars and premolars.  I was able to cut my flossing time in HALF with this mirror.I looked at several others, but their magnifications were not as strong as this one . . . 2X-7X magnification just doesnt cut it as well as this wonderful 10X.  The padded, scratch-free base is narrower than the diameter of the mirror, small enough to take up very little space on your bureau, table, or vanity, yet large and heavy enough to be sturdy.  The diameter is around 5 1/2"" -- about the length of a woman's hand -- and the base is around 4"".You can hold the mirror as far away from your face as the length of a toothbrush without any distortion.  It also great for tweezing, makeup application, and teaching children about mirrors and magnification.  I just wish it came with a light.

"I am a 46-year-old woman who just got braces.  It has been quite the journey during the first week getting used to them and all their ""friends"":  the sores in my inner cheek, the difficulty eating food and eliminating certain foods I used to eat, and especially the challenge of keeping my teeth and gums clean.I did a lot of research on different orthodontics flossing devices, and I ending up buying Platypus orthodontic flossers along with Oral-B Superfloss, G.U.M. Go Betweens Proxabrushes, regular floss to be used occasionally with the threader from my orthodontist, and a 10X magnification mirror.  I went from being in tears trying to floss my teeth to finally heaving a sigh of relief with a smile once I figured out how to keep my teeth clean.  Here is what I have found works best:The Platypus flossers are wonderful, easy to use, and the easiest of all the flossers in terms of ""feel"".  That is, I don't have to look in the mirror to use them.  I can easily tell by feel where to place the Platypus under the wire between my brackets.  However, these flossers do NOT work when the brackets are placed very closely together.  This is the case with my bicuspids and cuspids.  Due to how my teeth need to move and rotate properly, my orthodontist placed the brackets on two adjoining teeth (on each side) very, very closely together, so the Platypus flosser does not fit at all in between these teeth because the space between the brackets is too narrow.  It won't even fit under the arch wire!In that case, the Oral-B Superfloss is my perfect solution.  I can easily thread its tiny, narrow, stiff end right in between the narrowest of crevices (under the arch wire) in order to floss.  It works even better than the stiff threader my orthodontist provided.  I wouldn't be able to floss everything without it.  It is so easy to use that I tend to use the Superfloss more often than the Platypus flossers.  I also love how this little box fits neatly in my purse, and that the strands are pre-cut.For my premolars and molars, both the Superfloss and these Platypus flossers work almost equally well.  Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  I use the G-U-M Go Betweens back here, also, because they are perfect for clearing packed food from between my brackets and around the arch wire.Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror. Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn't able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  I needed both hands to separate my lips and cheek from the flossing area, and I couldn't do that while holding a mirror.Right now, with all of these tools, I can floss faster and more easily!  I hope this helps all those frustrated souls who, like me, struggle with very crowded teeth and newly placed braces and who were beginning to think flossing effectively would be impossible.  It's not if you have the right tools.  Don't give up, and you will find the solution that is best for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FNJ2RBBXJXDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000052YBA#wasThisHelpful","R1FNJ2RBBXJXDG","A2QVOOPVGQCDCF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QVOOPVGQCDCF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a perfect primer for someone who has little knowledge of Persia at all.  It does do a great service in acquainting the reader to the multiple forces at work in this region. If there is a quibble and it is a small one is that too much attention is placed on the Alexandian conquest which really changed Greece far greater than it did Persia. That said, I have lays wondered the true rationale as to why the Palavy Shah chose to change the country's name from Persia to Iran (we still speak of the Persian Gulf and the Fars predated everyone else).

"This story abut some rather wayward Englishmen who contrive a club to hide their amourous activities would certainly be rather flat fare if done by another writer.

"Perhaps the greatest story about French society, as seen through the prism of the Indochina experience, or a war story, military tradition, modern warfare, and even this is scant praise. If you want to experience what occurred to France in the post WWll period and especially its military men this is the book. This book impressed me so much that it would take pages to describe why, suffice it to say that it is great literature and each character from Colonel Raspequy, to Esclavier, Glatingy, Boisfeuras to the lowest enlisted man, is arresting and true to life.Beyond the French milieu, as literature it addresses many human universal concerns and that is why I call it great literature. If I find one fault in the book, it is this, although it concerns young fighting men and their view point, I find that the women who play only supporting roles or props for the men are too simplistic if not seen through a misogynistic men but I can prescribe this because we are seeing them trough young men's eyes who are being brutalized by war and captivity.Not only is the psyche of the French fighting man examined but the process by which he became politicized and the conflicts which this generated not only in the army but also vis a vis the civilian population. I read this in 1964 originally and it haunted me from then on. The first time reader will ask himself many questions looking back at history French and American and ponder about current events.To realize how traumatic a period this was for France, think of it as the American Viet Nam experience raised to the third power.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CMWWHRJWGWKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9A4CCO#wasThisHelpful","R1CMWWHRJWGWKO","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why read another mystery or write one you may ask. Well the narrator or hero must be interesting and not too overwhelmingly concentrated. While mid-life angst is apparent here, our view of him is reasonable, his quest for justice is really rather rational.

Inspector Sebag's gradual realization that he is being toyed with and the stakes are too gruesome to imagine drive the reader's interest which I admit was somewhat slow in coming.Particularly interesting or infuriating depending on your point of view is the fact that while the crime is solved, there is no resolution to Sebag's personal problems which I found refreshing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GSM9VZ6536IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COOFQV8#wasThisHelpful","R1GSM9VZ6536IM","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think it a fair question and perhaps the most important one to ask when one judges a book, is to ask is ""Did the author succeed in what he what he attempted to do?"". In this case it safely be answered in the affirmative, a very emphatic affirmative.I hesitate to call this an experimental novel and I certainly do not think that ""stream of consciousness"" may be applied to this novella. I can understand the urge to use these terms because they suggest a certain type experience that a reader feels when he reads an unorthodox or nontraditional work.  Why not a stream of consciousness?  Well if we look at James Joyce's ""Molly Bloom's soliloquy"" we find a string of reminiscences that are not driven by external events, while ""experimental"" connotes uncharted forms, this is definitely a traditional manner of story-telling.This is the a story that begins with a death and through the reminiscences of an inmate in a mental institution examines those life experiences which formed his character and led him to his fate. It mangers to avoid mawkish sentimentality and all too clever literary devices. No grand denouncement, no Eureka! by the reader, just tense, well-crafted story-telling. You want, not only to like the character but also to understand him. Sympathize with him, yes but decidedly not empathizing with him. Surprisingly, all fits together in a most believable way and this reader did not feel cheated in any way. Let us say that this is an interior dialogue which the read overhears.Written in the first person narrative, I must say that I enjoyed meeting all the characters and that is saying much since I personally loathe the type of self-indulgent upper Manhattan elitist poseurs. But then that is what makes a very good book.  So put away your fears that you will have to do Borges inspired machinations to understand what is happening.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UXJ4MBBSSHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GCGQPFK#wasThisHelpful","R10UXJ4MBBSSHC","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you were impressed and moved by Larteguy's ""The Centurians,"" you will more than satisfied by this book. All those fascinating characters are recreated and their tortured lives and destinies are finally put to rest if not in peace. Raspeguy, Esclavier, Glatingny and their friends and enemies are dealt with. There is even a believable leitmotif about Esclavier's capablilty to love.The main theme of this book is about what happens when apolitical Centurians become very political Praetorians. For the average American reader, the constant ringing of the May 13th bell may not resonate until the very end but the reader will definitely see post war France in a very different and truer light.Misogynistic perhaps but the heroes of this book are young men and act and think with the passions and concerns and wants and needs of the young.  Read the book at 13 years of age and reread at 65 it still fascinates and rings truer still.

"The remarkable Mr. Pound continues to bring the past to modern relevance, in this work it is his past-our modernity. While talking about French poets little known to most but the modern American English major and only in context of influences on Eliot or Auden and their like, he does us a great service by his critiques of among others of T S Eliot and Henry James.  Writing when he did, these essays have the benefit of and the fascination to us of learning how these works were written before their authors works became encrusted with the patina of fame and acceptance or placed in the pantheon of literary gods who no one can critique.What critic or student would spend time and effort to discuss Eliot's ""The Hippopotamus"" with same level of scrutiny of his other works,  As for Henry James the section is remarkable for among other reasons in that it sheds light on Pound's himself view of the artist and the world even if an unintended manner and oblique manner. Savor the irony of 'the past is prologue"" sentiment of Pound's understanding of Henry James' renunciation of his American citizenship and future events.Mote to the point is the excitement of having Mr. Pound give his personal opinions of many of James' works and compare the to most readers today. I find the opinions the ""The Aspern Papers"" and ""The Spoils of Poynton"" to be inferior works in the James' canon of works.fascinating.Even his friend's discourse, included in this work sheds light on the direction of Pound's artistic interests.

"This is certainly a book of immense ambitions and as such I feel that any attempt to ""analyze"" a book such as this, in this forum would be pointless. However a few impressions that I hope encourage the reader to purchase this work.It may seem at the outset that the book is a bit too heavy on narrative descriptions of Venice, masking the reason why the author this site.  This really would apply only to those who have visited Venice many times and I put myseol in that category (even to the point where I could direct the author to a direct vaporetto ride to Torcello).This is a story told in black and white not shades nor colors which might make think the characters are too one dimensional if seen from a certain perspective, however I tend to feel that the point of the book is not a tale of people but rather a tale of ideas like taking a gondola through the dimly lit streets and being by an idea.The two story thread is a bit disorienting and the character does not wring true, he has too many modern sympathies and thoughts but I assume this was not the point and much that he relates could have been edited out.If you have read other stories about Venice, you will delight in the allusions.  My favorite being the supremely obnoxious Fred who one can't help but recall several characters for Mann's ""Death In Venice.  As for its readability whatever that is, the action flows swiftly, the tension builds and the reader will enjoy it immensely if you let it take you on a gondola ride through history.I thank the author for sending me a copy and it has inspired me to purchase(!) his other works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AH15I5UPE6OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564745511#wasThisHelpful","R1AH15I5UPE6OP","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Do we really a man would marry and tolerate the adulteries of his wife who he describes as a libertine, and remain friends with her latest lover not only until his wife's death but beyond.  If the psyche of women are too implausible to believe, then the view of male motives borders on the absurd.Such is the fate of Ford that he was no Hemingway but a budding Jack London.

Her latest work ""The Wolf Border"" illustrates that she is one of those few writers whom the reader can say that he is privileged to have read.This is a complex concoction of themes and personal relationships told in a very, almost traditional, natural style think Hemingway, Jack London or any naturalistic writer. This is a story about the relocation and reintroduction of wolves into the Cumbria, England.  The relationships of the personnel between themselves, the locals, the the relationship between England and Scotland. Rachel the protagonist, and Binny, her mother, Rachel's new born son, her brother, to name just a few are profoundly explored.The descriptions of the Cumbrian countryside are Turner-esque and must be experienced to be appreciated. In short, the style of this novel is perfect.There are profound observations about what this book is all about, and that is ""Borders."" This book should certainly be placed in the pantheon of great works of writing, it is that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0BAL48FT71M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLLRB16#wasThisHelpful","R3J0BAL48FT71M","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This wily novella or short may disappoint those fans of the Montalbano series since it is an alteration but not a profound change in the interplay of characters in the series. The most notable is the interplay between the inspector and Catarella.  It is less comic and more realistic than previous appearances of Cat, while retaining some of the tension between the two. This can be said of the entire story and how much is the author's intention and how much of it is the result of a different translator is open to question.Enough (basta) it is a typical Camilleri story with all the secondary characters as complex and challenged as you would expect. Just don't expect a short version of the novels and enjoy it for what is offered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R953NY458RZ91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOC5JFW#wasThisHelpful","R953NY458RZ91","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I imagine that the biggest difficulty with approaching this book is that it must be read as part of a series and loses much if it is the reader's introduction to the series as it is with me.  Even given that fact, I find that this book never rises above the level of boilerplate mysteries.The chief character and his relationships with the other characters are so shallow, trite, and predictable that they just about insult the readers' intelligence.  The plot and the premises and the list of characters surrounding it are so extraordinary for a small village that they defy belief.

"Tipping my hat to Nicholas Ponticello, I will try to be understated, a bit wry, and well, ornery.  This is the story of a man looking at the his past life, while his daughter convinces him to have his memories put on a computer so he will live forever.  And then the reminiscences start.  There is no center of gravity in this story.The future is bleak, there is famine, starvation, curiously non-evils scientists, love, death, copulation and death. What makes this satiric exercise so enjoyable is that the author takes this tale with a pithy sense of comedy.  How does the protagonist ... forget it its too complex and absurd but entertaining (the protagonist's sister becomes a saint, a one sentence mentions the nuclear bombing of Atlanta, Ga.and then no more.) The Past, Present, Future all are commented on and everything seems to be lacking.So if you are looking for a second level Kingsley Amis from California and a good time treat yourself, but only on Kindle, its cheaper and will last forever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128WDFKT4FMMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKSQFIC#wasThisHelpful","R128WDFKT4FMMG","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must say that is almost impossible to write a synopsis or critique of the novel without introducing ""spoilers"" (a term I dislike) so I will try to be as oblique as I can since the only saving grace of this novel is the apparent surprises. I should not have been surprised since the description of this book refers to Venice AD 1106 as a ""backwater"" is the first howler of this book(Venice circa AD 1100) was the financial and trading hub of Europe but don't let historical accuracy get in the way of a period piece.  Also to treat the island of Torcello (in the book its Latin name is used (Torcellum) as a secret island known only to a few Venetians is another anachronistic howler (Torcello was the site of the first cathedral in Venice and the founding island).If the author is writing an historical novel, there must be a miasma of the era surrounding the book, this has none and it could well have been written about a city in the desert. The characters one dimensional, but modern day one dimensional.  There is a slave yearning to be free, a deformed hunch back monk, nice monks, crafty monks, Glass blowers of all types (Hurrah it is Venice) an obese Syrian trader and his morbidly obese wife (sounds interesting, it isn't).Several murders with eyeless corpses, the eyes replaced with glass eyes found in the canal or the salt farms (see it really is Venice) which really have little to do with the theme of the story.  If it seems I am going beyond the pale, it may be that I had such high hope for it since it was released by Europa Press. This book is not formulaic but a very tedious and unsuccessful attempt to mimic the Umberto Eco's ""The Name of The Rose.""

"I think it necessary to mention at the beginning that there is one minor annoyance in this e-book and that is the formatting of the book which for some reason indents whole paragraphs and that this gives the impression that it was the author's intention and that for probably the reason or problem there are a few sporadically placed mis-translations e.g. ""in feet"" for ""in fact"" or ""retracing his legs"" when it should be ""retracing his steps"" etc.  Not a major problem but this is really only acceptable in free ebooks or those at a lower cost.However that does in no way diminish the delight of this short story collection by an artist more renowned for his plays than his short stories or novels. These chronically arranged collection of stories, although not complete, is certainly a showcase of the author-playwrite's development philosophically and not artistically. In the most edifying introduction by Felicity Firth, she points out the fact that there seems to be a different set of dynamics in male suicide and female suicide.  I must say that had I not read this observation this would not have occurred to me.What did catch my attention in the collection which spans a good portion of the author'd life is the change from a D'Annunzio type of realism or naturalism to what we later call Absurdism.  From Ciunna's death in ""Sun and Shade"" which is draped in the imagery of nature, to Candelora's death in the eponymous short story which is framed by poison and a revolver we sense how such a writer could produce a ""Henri IV.""I find the only unsatisfying story to be the last ""A Challenge"" which is set in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The reader would be well served to read a story or two a day, several times to appreciate the subtly and complexity of this collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNLTC7YW77V4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ATTN80#wasThisHelpful","RNLTC7YW77V4S","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This e-edition has apparently been reformatted for the better since most of the earlier complaints have been addressed.  That stated, the next question is why we should concern ourselves with Mr. Pope's poetry in the contemporary world.  One can write tomes about this and still not touch upon all the reasons.What can be said without fear of contradiction is that for the contemporary reader Mr. Pope's use of the heroic couplet makes the perusing reading quite comfortable while at the same time making him, the reader, pay close attention to each word and to HEAR the poem and to APPRECIATE the chosen words.  In these poems the profundity is there almost obviously but the BEAUTY is subtle and sophisticated (want the other extreme try e e cummings) So poetry lovers give him a tumble.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R902HUIXOTQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TPOSDW#wasThisHelpful","R902HUIXOTQU","A1MQYS867NLHYJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MQYS867NLHYJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product was one of the easier products to review because I have been using it for nearly my whole life and keep finding new uses for it.  I recently found that I could put about  3 scoops (the bag comes with a scoop that is about 1/4 of a cup) into my laundry with 3 drops of lemon essential oil and a tablespoon of liquid ecological soap and my clothes comes out feeling fresher and cleaner than they ever have before.  When I first did this formula, it also made my old washing machine smell better.  It seems that alkalizing the little bit of standing water left after the washing was over made some bacterial smell go away.  In a pinch, too, if you had too acidic a meal, 1/3 of a tablespoon of baking soda in an 8 ounce glass of water might soothe it (though in the long run it may be too much sodium).  My mother would put an open box in the fridge to get rid of odors and change it every few months.  My favorite use is to put 3 scoops into a hot bath.  It seems to alkalize the skin and make it feel fresh again.  I like it better than the the bath salts, which can actually feel a little drying afterwards, and which are more expensive to use.I am giving this wonderful product 4 stars, rather than 5 stars because it seems that the package had a small leak and arrived with some of the powder over the outside of the package and in the box.  Not much.

"I got this product from the Amazon Vine list because it seemed similar to Floridex, which is also a vegetarian iron supplement.  Unlike the Floridex, it does not have any yeast product or wheat extracts.  It does have some honey, though, and so it may not be suitable for all Vegans, as some Vegans choose to not take honey.  I try to avoid taking honey also, but some seems to slip in through a few products and I make some exception for them.  Other than the honey, it is very suitable for vegetarians and some vegans.I found that I could feel some good energy after taking this product and this feeling was consistent each time I took it.  I like the range of herbs that were used:  Elderberry juice (400mg), Sea Buckthorn juice (100mg), Star Anise pod juice (90mg), Acerola (40mg), Rice bran extract (40mg), Beet root juice (40mg), special blend (2.4g of parsley, nettles, dandelion, fennel, and yellow dock).  I like the combination, like the Vitamin C hit from the Acerola natural source.  Nettles is very good for Chlorophyll.  The herbs themselves feel very nutritional and I imagine support how this product helps us to absorb the iron.Because it is a juice of veggies and fruit, it has a limited lifespan when opened, the package says to finish using it in 30 days and to throw away the remainder after then.I mixed the liquid in with a tea or a smoothy, and wove it into my routine this way.  The box says it is ""non-constipating"" and is ""appropriate for pregnant and breastfeeding women"".  I have seen warnings on other iron supplements that it could be constipating and that they are not suitable for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and even just warning women in general to just be careful.  I suspect that the herbal matrix makes it safer and more absorbable.  I can verify in my own experience that I did not get constipated, but I cannot double check the other claims because of being a male.To be honest, I did take about double the recommended dose (which I do not recommend doing) and found the energy level increase easier to feel.  I often do this when reviewing products, because we have less than 30 days to feel out what it does.  I have found a few products show their effects more easily on a higher dose than what is on the label.  The fact that I did not get constipated at the higher dose is significant and shows it probably would be fine at the regular dose.Having said this, I will probably not get this product again, because I would rather not take something with honey.  I look for a product that is similar in quality to this that does not have honey as part of it.  I still give the product 5 stars, because it did not say it was vegan, but vegetarian, and therefore represented itself well.  I wish that more product pages would have full ingredient disclosure and have the honey mentioned.  I am choosing to disclose the more of the ingredients in my reviews so that people can make better informed decisions on whether or not to get a product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGWG0JPO76X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZAIARE#wasThisHelpful","R2BGWG0JPO76X8","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second product I got from the Amazon Vine list that mentioned that it was ""suitable for vegans"" or had veggie caps that did not have animal gelatin.  The product page says, ""Suitable for vegetarians/vegans,"" and yet the label says, ""Capsule consists of gelatin"".  The product page needs to reflect the truth of the product accurately because when ordering online that is what we have to go on.  When I am buying at a store, I can read the label for myself and find out, even though I guess even labels might not always be accurate.I am generally happy to see Jarrow products because they do seem to have a vegan line of very good nutritional products.  But since this is the second time I have been fooled by the write ups, I am getting wary and cannot give the product 5 stars.Other than the above issue, this product worked.  I found I got a nice deep sleep.  I like the ingredients:  400mg of Valerian Root, 300mg of Tryptophan (apparently a high grade ""TryptoPure"" version, suggesting it is probably pharmacy grade or near pharmacy grade), 100mg of Hops, 100mg of Lemon Balm, 100mg of PharmaGABA, and 3mg of Melatonin.  I sometimes have made a nice sleep tea with Kava (which has GABA in it), Saint John's Wort, Lemon Balm, Lemon Grass, Mugwort, Valerian, and Mint, with some Stevia for sweetening (although this tea is very safe normally, if you are on prescriptions of some kind, you may wish to check with a health professional before trying.  I am not recommending this tea, just sharing my experience as a way of sharing by experience with this product by contrast).  I find the tea works better and stronger at causing deep relaxation.  But it takes some time to brew it right (I use Lemon Balm fresh from my garden and this helps a lot).  The capsules are convenient and work well.  It is a good combination of ingredients.  Valerian, Hops, and Lemon Balm are good relaxing nervines that I feel also help heal the nerves as well.  Melatonin helps reset our sleep cycle after we are throw off a good schedule.  GABA and Trytophan (when it converts inside to Serotonin) are both necessary for our brain to relax and let go.  They are nutrition for the brain.  While I still prefer my tea over this product, I find it is good to take a break from anything so that the body does not get too dependent on it.  The product has the advantage of being easy to take and having good and comparable quality ingredients.As mentioned above, I would have given it 5 stars if it were not this confusion about vegan vs non-vegan capsules in the write ups.  What I do when this happens, if I cannot return the product, is to empty the capsule into a liquid so that I do not have to take any gelatin into my body.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O6OHGELY4WYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DU8VGQ#wasThisHelpful","R2O6OHGELY4WYO","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this product off the Vine list because of a book called THE EDGE EFFECT by Eric Braverman.  This book talks about 4 main chemicals that are needed for the brain to be fully healthy:  GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine, and Acetyl-choline.  The book also lists the supplements that are precursors to them so that we can synthesize them for our brain.  The Acetyl-choline part has Acetyl L-Carnitine mentioned (and which seems to metabolize better for brain purposes than L-Carnitine).  When I read up on the research regarding this supplement, I found it seemed to help support a fairly wide array of healthy functions in the body, from help build up ATP, recovery from fatigue, increasing stamina, boosting memory function, blood sugar balance, and the ability to handle oxidative stress.  The book says that one of the signs that we are deficient in Acetyl-choline is that we will be a little careless and misplace items (and the book goes into four personality prolifes of each deficiency of the said brain chemicals as well as what healthy functioning looks like).  I like to consider that these brain chemicals are like earth, fire, air, and water (GABA earth, Acetyl-choline fire, Serotonin water, and Dopamine air), with Acetyl-choline and Dopamine (from Macuna Puriens as far as an herbal source) being related to feeling more energy as well as functions like improved memory.I found that I could notice an increase in energy from taking this supplement and a little bit more brain alertness.  I tried about 4 capsules a day, emptying the contents into a smoothie (banana, coconut juice, apple, water, stevia, chlorella, and mint) and drinking it.  Just to be clear, I am not recommending the dosage that I took, just reporting what I did and what results I got.  I recommend people in general follow the dosage on the label and if they have any doubt of whether it is compatible with the biochemical individuality or some other part of their program, to check with a health professional.I put the ingredients into a smoothie because, for some reason I made a small mistake when ordering from the Vine list.  I usually only get what is in the veggie capsules and thought I had read that this was in veggie capsules.  The ingredients list said:""Cellulose, magnesium stearate (vegetable source) and silicon dioxide. Capsule consists of gelatin. No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.""And had so many vegan things like ""no dairy"", ""vegetable source"", and ""no fish"" that I overlooked the ""gelatin"" being mentioned.I give the product 4 stars because it is a high quality supplement, has good research behind it, and seems to give noticeable energy.  My one reservation is that it is not in vegan capsules and therefore is not suitable for vegetarians.  I wish the labeling of this would be clearer.  But for many people this is not an issue and this reservation does not apply.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RILXCEF1A5HDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027DWNHQ#wasThisHelpful","RILXCEF1A5HDJ","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this formula and am enjoying taking it.  The ingredients are:  Rhodiola rosea, Holy Basil leaf (two kinds extracted differently), Ashwagandha root, Wild oats milky seed fresh (Avena sativa), and Schisandra berry (Schisandra chinensis).  I like that they used CO^2 extraction to bring out the potency of the Tulsi Basil and validated the potency of various ingredients.  Ashwangandha is a tonic herb that I respect a lot and often have as tea (water infusion).  I like, too, that they use vegetarian capsules as I am a vegan and avoid gelatin capsules.  The company seems committed to making a quality product.  Having said, all this, I cannot verify in my experience that the capsules are doing anything, even when I took a double dose.  I give the product 4 stars, because the company seems to have taken care to produce a high quality product with very good ingredients.  I have not given it 5 stars, because I would have liked to feel more from taking them.  I am going to continue to take the capsules and if I notice anything in my experience I will update this review.Update:  I tried five capsules at the same time and bit into them to release the liquid inside.  I found that I could feel the tonic quality (first two herbs) of the herbal concentrate this way.  It seems that tasting the liquid helps the body to utilize the herbs.  I found this true for a number of bitter herbs and there are some in this formula.  At five capsules, I could feel the energizing qualities of the Schisandra herb.

"This product came in the mail and I opened it put some on some sore muscles and felt immediate relief.  It feels like it does not merely provide relief, but seems to help speed up recovery time some too.  I have used Homeopathic Arnica Gel before and am happy to use it again.  As mentioned in a review of the Homeopathic Arnica cream, I tried the Herbal version of Arnica (in a gel form) in a product and did not find it as a effective as the Homeopathic version.  I also prefer the clear gel to the cream version of this Homeopathic product.  While the cream and the gel both seem to work, the gel seems to work noticeably better and faster.  I would recommend this product for mild sprains and sore muscles.  While it would probably provide some relief for serious sprains or bruising that shows up as black marks, there are Homeopathic gels that have Hypericum (the Homeopathic version of Saint John's Wort, though the Herbal tincture also seems to work very well too) may be more effective.  There is a Homeopathic product called Traumeel that has both Hypericum and Arnica and a number of other Homeopathic preparations that is good for this kind of bruising.  I sent a tube of this up for my father when he slipped on some rocks while fishing on a jetty.  When I sprained my back severely he sent me a tube of the same thing.  In both my case and my father's case, the preparation provided some welcome pain relief, helping speeding up the healing, and seemed to help the overall healing program.  All in all, the product seems to be a useful addition to a medicine chest and I miss it when I run out of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8OD6BXGQ70G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEEFUZI#wasThisHelpful","RQ8OD6BXGQ70G","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this lap guitar as part of a set with an Ebow, a delay/reverb unit, and a looper in order to play a synthesizer drone sound.  This unit works for what I want it to do.  The guitar feels sturdy, all the controls work and add to fine tuning the sound (volume control and a bass/treble tone control).  The metallic blue color makes the guitar look good.  For 99 bucks, I feel I got a bargain, and it even included a case and legs that set up it to sit in front of (and the legs even store in the case in a separate compartment).  The case even has a free compartment where I am storing two thick and long cables.  The case feels sturdy and not cheap.  It feels like it will protect the guitar very well during transport.  I am playing the guitar unconventionally, more as a drone instrument.  It is kind of like an electronic Tamboura or Hurdy Gurdy, but with a lot of rich textures and sounds.  This is mainly due to the Ebow which magnetically vibrates the strings in a very long sustain (I can use my left hand to change the texture of the sustained note by gently touching in for a moment in a few ways or sliding it along the string).  I can even modulate the vibration by dialing the tuning pins and through this to find the desired tightness for optimal Ebow expression (as a drone instrument).  The reverb unit, of course, adds to the richness of the sound and the looper allows harmonics to form (the Ebow can only play one string at a time).  All in all, a good set of tools to work with.  I do feel that the lap guitar holds its place in the set and has no noticeable weakness performing with the Ebow as an effective drone instrument.  I give it 5 stars because it does what I want it to do and looks like a serious instrument.  FYI Guitar does not have a resonance chamber, it is only electronic.  It can sound without an amp, but is very low volume then (and then lacks the richness a good resonance chamber gives).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8FHA3G59KAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007T92I8C#wasThisHelpful","R2S8FHA3G59KAI","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the Ebow in order to play a lap guitar like a synthesizer.  I got inspiration from an old CD that used a lap guitar, an Ebow, a delay/reverb unit, and a looper (duplicated the set for myself).  There are videos on youtube that are helpful to study to learn how to use the Ebow.  The best one was a long animated cartoon that went into detail about it.  The device works by magnetically vibrating a guitar string when it is held over it.  The main purpose is to create a very long sustain.  I found I got a much richer sound from this device than a Theremin, which I was also considering.  I found that I could generate a very long sustain and modulate with careful touch on the strings with my left hand.  The pressure does need to be very precise, too much dampens the sound to zero, too little can send the sound rapidly to a high volume.  The device itself is also a little fussy in that if it is too far from the string there is very little sound or no sound, and if it is too close you risk touching the string and creating a metalic reverb sound that can be a little sharp and high volume.  Even when you have the right distance, the string can increase its vibration and sometimes hit it, so you have to move it away a little once the sound gets going.  The flip side of the coin with the Ebow, though, is that the precision and fussiness rewards you with a lot of good control over the texture of the sound.  You can create highly textured long sustaining notes that change in subtle ways across its time horizon.  I found with just a little practice that I could lightly touch the strings and make ""notes"" in the tone wave.  I could also gently hold down the string and rev up the vibration to a good volume and then gently slide my left finger across the string to create gradual changes in the sound that enriched the texture of the sound, especially with a delay/reverb unit set on max.  With a little practice, too, you can control the metalic shimmer when the unit touches the string (or do something similar with the left finger) and also make this a rich sound.  I also could modulate the sound by dialing the tuning pins very slowly (and create an interesting tuning for the strings that maximizes the effect of the Ebow) and get an effect similar to sliding the finger across the string.  I also found that the blue LED light was enough to guide the right placement of the Ebow over the string and it is centered in line with the ""sweet spot"".  It is cool to play it in a dim room with this blue LED shining the way!I give the device five stars because it does what I hoped it would do and a little more.  I find I can emulate a stringed drone instrument like an ""electronic"" Tamboura or Hurdy Gurdy, and even have a richer set of choices.  The battery, too, seems to last a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LV2MJUT2RVVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N5MK8M#wasThisHelpful","R2LV2MJUT2RVVL","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have liked net books ever since they first arrived on the computer scene.  It seemed a smart move to eliminate the DVD and CD read/write drive.  This part is one that goes out often on many notebook computers.  By eliminating this part, the netbook can be small, light, and still have all the capabilities of a notebook computer.  It seems that the tablet pc then took over the market and the net books lost their popularity, even though the Android tablets are not real operating systems, but more like ""app loaders"" where you are limited to the apps that are possible and cannot always tweak the software and settings as you can with a real operating system.I was happy to see Acer bring out the next generation net book at a very affordable price (around 200 bucks, give or take about 20 bucks).  They switched from the Intel Atom processor running at 1.6 ghz (either dual core or mono-core) to the AMD C-60 chip.  The former is rated at about 13 watts (very low power chip) and the latter seems rated at about 7 watts (even lower power).  This means several things.  One is that the battery lasts a very long time (this one is rated for about 7 hours and it is not even a big long life battery).  Two is that the chip will not overheat.  It seems to stay cool even without a fan (unless there is a super quiet fan that I do not know about) as result.  Because it has ""hyperthreading"", it can even act a little bit like a quad core computer.The CPU power is rated less than the Atom processor, but it seems to run as fast in practice.  It has a turbo boost that can go up to 1.3 ghz if needed.  Part of what makes these processors run faster than you would expect them to is the video cards have a ""GPU"" which can take some of the processing load of the CPU.  In this case, the GPU has 256 gb ram of its own, which makes the video experience very smooth and up to the task for everything but gaming (the most high demand of any application) and video editing.I really like that they fitted this netbook with a full size keyboard and a bigger screen.  It is still feels compact like the smaller net books.  But for me it works great, because I type very fast on a regular keyboard and feel a significant slow down when the keyboard is smaller.  The screen is 11.5 inches and this is a decent size for more serious computer tasks.  The touch pad is very responsive and has a smooth scroll function.  A few earlier models were passable here and would require me to repeat a stroke now and then.  I also like that it has an SD card slot (replaces the DVD/CD reader/writer) and find it useful for transferring data to and from a desktop.I tested this unit to work on Linux Mint OS 15 and it worked perfectly.  The Mint OS recognized the wireless card automatically, without configuration.  It also recognized the internal microphone, which is great.  I find that the loss of the internal microphone was common with many netbooks when using a Linux OS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C31KFIGX9NU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00719CH0O#wasThisHelpful","R3C31KFIGX9NU2","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The spinner is light enough to be easily put up on the ceiling and a simple cup hook is enough to hold it.  The unit was light enough to not even need to hook into a structural beam and is just held by the panel.  The spin slows down predictably as the battery weakens.  It seems an alkaline battery can last almost 3 weeks or so if continuous 24/7 use.  They would be perfect if they were all quiet.  I have two of them, one has been quiet from the beginning and perfect, while the other makes a noticeable but low volume noise.  One is spinning a wire icosahedron, while the other is spinning a double tetrahedron.  They do their job very well.I give it four stars because it does the job, but have two reservations.  One is that they are fragile (I broke one noisy one trying to fix it).  Two is that if they do come a little noisy you cannot do much to make them quiet.  I have one quiet and one that is a little noisy but acceptable.Update 1/4/2014:  The second spinner stopped working.  I tried to fix it, but was unable to.  The little plastic belt seems to be a design weakness and once it starts slipping it seems very hard to repair.  I got the plastic belt back on twice, but it stopped spinning within 30 minutes.  Given that this is the second one that has stopped working and given that two of them were noisy, I am deciding not to replace the unit (for the third time).  They seem to be cheaply made and not designed to be easily serviced.  However, one of them is still working silently and well.  It is really quiet perfect really.  It seems, though, that the odds of getting one that both works and is silent is not too good (1 out of 3 for me).","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RR9NWYG54JNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026SZRCA#wasThisHelpful","R2RR9NWYG54JNH","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a homeopathic Arnica gel from this company before and was happy to see it come up on the Vine review list.  Homeopathic Arnica has often given me immediate relief for muscle soreness and body aches.  In fact, out of all the homeopathic remedies, this one seems to be the most consistently beneficial (I have it rubbed on my neck and feeling relief right now as I am writing this!).  It is the one that is most used by all my friends who are open to homeopathic remedies and who describe its action in a similar way (""immediate relief"").  What I find interesting, too, is that the homeopathic Arnica works better than the herbal Arnica for me.  Thinking that the actual herb might be better, I got an herbal Arnica gel and it was not as immediately effective as the homeopathic version.  In fact, I was not sure the herbal form was really working at all.  The Arnicare Cream feels much like the clear gel version that I had used before, but has a different set of carrier ingredients.  The clear gel felt cooler when applied, which is nice when there is a hot area of inflammation.  This cream feels like a good skin cream and feels nice to the skin, but less cooling.  It seems that the same healing action is common to both of them.  I give it 5 stars because it does what I expect it to do, which is to provide some immediate relief from muscle aches without merely masking the pain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YWVL3G1MMNUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEYEREY#wasThisHelpful","R2YWVL3G1MMNUK","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is a generic version of Sudafed PE and has the same active ingredient ""Phenylephrine HCL"".  The product works as good as the non-generic one.  It helps the dry the sinus passages and synergizes well with an over the counter anti-histamine.  I prefer the anti-histamine ""Chloropheniramine maleate"" in a generic version to save money.  In both cases, the generic version is comparable in action to the name brand ones.  I find, too, that the ideal time to take these two is right before a reaction is setting in or immediately upon noticing a reaction is starting.  The histamine reaction is a chain reaction that feeds on itself.  The sooner one stops it, the less the medication has to work.  Once the chain reaction is at full strength, then it is much harder to stop and make take repeated doses.I give this product 4 stars rather than 5 stars because of one reservation.  I found a generic Phenylephrine HCL at the nearby Dollar Store (Assured brand) for a dollar which has the same active ingredient in the same concentration (10 mg) only differing in the filler ingredients (which did not seem to make much difference in how they feel) and the amount of pills in the box.  The Dollar Store version was 24 for $1.00, while the GoodSense version (on Amazon) 72 for $5.26 plus postage (with free shipping if you get over 35 bucks of stuff at the same time).  This means that the Dollar Store one is 4 cents per a pill versus 7.3 cents per a pill for the Good Sense one (the 18 count and 36 count version are still the same per a pill).  The Good Sense version is probably a good price for an online transaction, but it is not the best value.  My brother uses the decongestant and anti-histamine pair very often to manage his allergies and this small difference starts to add up fairly fast.  I will, however, keep the GoodSense version in mind, because sometimes the Dollar Store runs out of stock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28X8OIULRY2SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ2YR8G#wasThisHelpful","R28X8OIULRY2SC","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This particular D-Link works ""plug and play"" on Linux Mint.  I have directly tested it with a large number of computers and operating systems, including Linux Mint OS 9, 11, 13, and 15.  Since Linux Mint is an overlay operating system built on top of both Debian and Ubuntu, the odds are it will work for those operating systems as well (especially Ubuntu).  The tested range had been about 15 percent stronger than the internal wireless card in the laptops and netbooks that I have been working with.  I use this D-Link wireless N-150 Mbps usb wifi network adapter (DWA-125) often when installing Linux Mint on computers for friends who wish to get into Linux.  I have found that the HP laptops and netbooks, using the Broadcom wireless cards, often have internal wireless cards that Linux does not recognize easily, and so I use this D-Link usb to workaround this.  The usb stick usually comes with a little usb stand for better reception for a desktop computer, but it is not really needed (I use it, though, for holding usb thumbdrives and plugging in my usb headset with microphone, it is a convenient access since it is meant to be on a desk and therefore I do not have to lean down to the tower).  For desktop computers without wireless, I have learned to like this usb D-Link better than the PCI wireless cards, because I do not have to worry about the different types of slots (PCI, PCIe, full, half size, etc.), and also I can put the usb adapter on the end of a usb extension cable and hang it up on the wall, where it usually gets very excellent reception (like a kind of antenna).  In short, I can rely on this adapter as a problem solver when there is either no wireless card or Linux cannot find/recognize one, and even get a little extra range.I have had a bit of trouble with some usb wireless cards that are considered Linux compatible but end up not being when I try them (I think they sometimes switch to a different internal chip that is not Linux compatible, when the company bulk buys and mass produces them).  But this D-Link has been consistently usable and is the most tested/verified one in my experience.  I will update this review if I find an exception or if it stops being compatible (in my experience).  My main commitment in giving a computer part review is to the Linux community so that we can know what really works.  The wireless adapters are ones that I have had some challenges with and I am happy to pass on this information about one that has worked again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15L5IV2ZFXJBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KEA8OM#wasThisHelpful","R15L5IV2ZFXJBB","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firstly, I would like to share that I am impressed with the effort this company has made to (1) use vegan capsules, (2) get non-GMO verified status, and (3) use third party clinical trials to verify the health claims.  The first two, in particular, mean a lot to me.  I will not knowingly buy something that is not in vegan capsules and will choose the non-GMO verified over the lack of this label, and will try to avoid anything that has a high probability of being a GMO or having some GMO ingredients.  I have also experienced noticeable results with this company's other products that I have been happily reviewing thanks to the Amazon Vine program.  I clearly feel their WEIGHT LOSS GOLD formula with its 7 patented ingredients inside it and love their RESVERATROL GOLD which I take with PTEROSTILBENE (from Jarrow) since they synergize noticeably well.  I also like this company's Vitamin C and like that it is verified non-GMO.  I can feel their vitamin C, but am still personally evaluating it compared to HEALTHFORCE NUTRITIONALS TRULY NATURAL VITAMIN C which also seems non-GMO (but which has not taken the time yet to get the non-GMO verified label), both in terms of quality and cost.  Both seem very good and I am still exploring which one I like better.The present product GARCINIA CAMBOGIA GOLD feels good to take, but I am not noticing anything I can verify subjectively or objectively (on the weigh scale).  I chose the product from the list because I noticed a lot of herbal formulas have this ingredient in them for weigh loss.  In a write up that I read when I purchased the pure dried fruit form, it made only a modest claim about what it could do for weigh loss.  It does seem to have some minor ability to metabolize some fat and mainly seemed to say that it would prevent us from making more fat.  WebMD says, ""Developing research suggests that garcinia might prevent fat storage and control appetite; however, whether these effects occur in humans is unclear.""  This seems to fit the modest claims I read online about the herbal version.  In other words, it may help in a small way within a larger program, possibly by assisting in not creating any more fat as your body is shedding what it already has.  This is going to be hard to notice on a program like what I am on where I am choosing to diet in a slow and safe manner.  I like the capsules compared to the dried herb for ease of taking.  The dried fruit is as tough as leather and it takes a fair amount of boiling to make a liquid tea to drink.I still give the product 4 stars, because it seems to be a good and pure version of the herbal medicine.  Whatever limits this product has are probably the limits of the herb itself, not how it is prepared by this company.  If I notice anything as I continue to take it, I will post what I found in an update.  I am giving this product a chance within an overall program.  I would like to share that I consider intelligent weight loss to require a fair amount of skill and commitment, the elimination of certain foods (mentioned in my review of the book THE VIRGIN DIET) that will prevent almost any diet approach from working if they are not eliminated, drinking good pure water in larger amounts, distinguishing hunger from thirst and not eating when you are thirsty, lots of fruit and veggie juices, etc.  It will take more than a good product or two to pull off, and this one seems to be at best a modest support.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RJFFGXCQ4VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CN0SRMS#wasThisHelpful","R33RJFFGXCQ4VD","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been studying herbs in general and been studying Tibetan Aryurvedic herbal medicine in particular.  It is hard to find in depth literature about Tibetan herbology.  Many of the key texts either have not been translated into English or have been translated only recently.  This one was done in 1999.  The book has large paintings, covering one whole page for each of the herbs and a few paragraphs describing them.  There is a 44 page summary of the Tibetan herbal system in the beginning which is concise, clear, and well worth reading.  The only drawback of this book is that herbs may be hard to find outside of Tibet or the Himalayas.  The book does not always give the equivalents, both in name and alternatives, to the herbs mentioned inside.  I would recommend ANCIENT METRIA MEDICA: Sowa - Rigpa (Tibetan Science of Healing) by Dr. Smanla T. Phuntsog M.B.B.S., M.S. to cover this weakness.  The latter book is very complimentary with the first and each has many things that the other does not.  The latter has small one inch by two inch (approximate) pictures of many of the herbs and extensive lists grouped according to their use.  The latter book I find a little challenging to navigate sometimes, but I have found good information nonetheless.  Both of them are fairly technical, though the introduction to the Clear Mirror book is accessible to everyone.  For a more general introduction there is THE QUINTESSENCE TANTRAS OF TIBETAN MEDICINE by Dr. Barry Clark (with a forward by the Dalai Lama) and HEALTH THROUGH BALANCE BY Dr. Yeshi Donden.Through the Clear Mirror Book and the Ancient Metria Medica, I was able to find some correspondence with more familiar and more accessible western herbs in order to brew some healing formulas for myself.  I am mainly focusing on making general health tonics (Rasayana).I would also recommend that a person who is interested in Tibetan Aryurveda also study some Hindu Aryurveda (the books by Vasant Lad and his students are very good for this).  There are a lot of similarities and some curious subtle differences.  The Medince Buddha Sutras explain the Tibetan system in depth, like the Heart Ambrosia Tantra.  The main difference is a chain of interesting associations and connections that link the physical diseases to the three poisons of the mind (addictive craving, judgmental negativity, and obscuring delusion), with the herbal remedies assisting both physical healing and meditation practice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NM0GK70O434T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00125WNPC#wasThisHelpful","R2NM0GK70O434T","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been very happy with the Nutrigold products and have been selecting a lot of them from the Vine review list.  The two main reasons have been that the company has made an effort to get approval for the ""non-GMO verified"" tag to get put on their product and also they have a lot of products that are in vegan capsules.  Since I have a vegan diet, I appreciate both these gestures a lot.  In the company write up, they share that their Maca is ""Maca Gold is also independently certified by a third-party lab to be free of soy, milk, wheat, gluten, eggs, and shellfish.""  This fits the non-GMO label.  I like the commitment to third party testing.  It also signals to me that the company has a commitment to a certain standard.  There are a lot of products that I would not take that fall below this.As far as the Maca itself goes, there is a summary write up I found useful in the company literature:  ""Maca has been an important traditional food and medicinal plant for over 2000 years. Although Maca is unrelated to the ginseng family, it has been dubbed Peruvian ginseng because it is often used as a folk remedy to enhance stamina, energy, and sexual function. Maca is naturally rich in essential minerals, especially selenium, calcium, magnesium, and iron, and fatty acids including linolenic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acids, and 19 amino acids, as well as polysaccharides. Maca's reported benefits for sexual vigor and health could be due to its high concentration of proteins and vital nutrients and the root's unique nutritional profile, which provides optimum levels of nutrients utilized by the body's endocrine system without adversely impacting hormone levels.""  I found this paragraph to pretty much sum up the research on Maca.I have been taking a lot of herbs as part of my health and longevity program.  To be honest, Maca was one that I was going to take off my list.  I had bought the Maca powder from the health food store (and a health food section of a coop) twice and could not feel much happening for me with it.  I do not think that it means that the herb is bad or that its claims are off, but just that the herb does not address my own biochemical individuality and needs.  But since I have been very happy with the products from this company, I decided to give Maca another try.  This is the first Maca supplement that I can actually feel something from.  It feels like a little extra energy boost.  Nothing too big or too grand, but noticeable, enough for me to want to continue to explore this product.  I will update if I notice anything else.  I do not have a theory about why this product allowed me to feel something and the other Maca did not, even when I took some fairly large doses of the other ones.  I have gathered that some herbs lose some of their potency when they meet the stomach acids, and the capsule form may bypass it.  It could also be that the powder form of Maca I took before, from two locations, were in the bins too long and lost their potency by getting oxidized.  Or it could be that my body is in a different place and can benefit more from it now (I had some dental work recently).  I would suspect that other sources of Maca are probably very good too.  But it does seem like this product works.  All in all, I give this product 5 stars, because it seems to be what it supposed to be, a good quality Maca supplement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNNJIHE9P3UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055CMKTC#wasThisHelpful","R1LNNJIHE9P3UB","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this product off the Vine reviewer list because I have been interested in the healing benefits of Turmeric.  My interest started with a book called THE OKINAWA DIET PLAN by Wilcox, Wilcox, and Suzuki.  This book was a landmark study of cultural longevity based on diet.  They studied cultures in terms of longevity by determining what percentage of the population lives past 100 years, with the Okinawans, at the time of the study, having 7 percent of the population achieve this (sadly it seems that fast food chains and a system of cafeteria food in their schools may be subverting their dietary culture now, with this culture now having a teenage obesity crisis).  The study also confirmed that it was the diet, since it also studied groups of Okinawas that moved to other places in the world and adopted other dietary cultures and thereby did not achieve the same longevity result.  In studying their diet, I found it had several unique features, like being near vegan collectively with many vegans within the total population, being low fat, low protein, and rich in good quality carbs, and also an unusual proportion of eating sweet potatoes and having turmeric tea.  I found that turmeric may be the best anti-inflammatory one can take on a regular basis.  When I researched further, I found that many cultures, like India, use turmeric as a spice in their food.  While this is very wise, other diet cultures do not have an optimal dose of this good ingredient.  We can use more turmeric than is present in these diets.Jarrow literature summarized some of the effect of turmeric in their literature this way (I liked this write up and thought I would quote it here, I do not always find descriptions of herbal actions so well described on a biochemical level):""Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a yellow spice and a traditional remedy that has been used as a medicine, condiment and flavoring since 600 BC. The rhizome (underground stem) is the part of the plant that is harvested and ground to make the spice. The key bioactive constituents found in turmeric are three kinds of curcuminoids: curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Once in the body these curcuminoids are known to interact with various mediators of the inflammatory response such as 5-lipooxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.""This Jarrow product is one that I happily give 5 stars to for a number of reasons:  (1) They use vegan capsules.  Since I am on a vegan diet, I appreciate this, since I will not buy supplements that are in gelatin capsules.  (2) You get 500 mg of ""Curcumin Phytosome"" (curcumin extract complexed with phosphatidylcholine) which is intended to enhance bioavailability.  It seems that this extra absorption may be lab tested, but I did not find documentation to fully verify this.  It seems that the action of phosphatidylcholine acts similar to a transport herb which helps herbal potencies to be delivered where they are needed. I did find this write up on their action in the Jarrow literature:""But the phytosomes do more than just help overcome the poor water solubility of curcumin. They also appear to directly impact absorption by shuttling the curcuminoids inside enterocytes. This occurs because cellular membranes, including intestinal enterocytes, are largely composed of phospholipids, such as the phosphatidylcholine found in the phytosomes, allowing the phytosomes to act as vesicles that can be ""folded"" into the cell in a process called pinocytosis or cellular captation.""One of the health claims made about turmeric and this product is increased joint health and flexibility.  This seems to be related to the overall anti-inflammatory action of the source herb.  It does seem that this product may be enhancing its bioavailability.  My subjective experience with the product is that it feels ""smoother"", fairly easy on the intestines, and I feel cleaner inside after taking it.  I intend to update this review if I can feel anything else that seems specific to this product.  I also brew tea with turmeric, intestinal soothing herbs like mint, lemon balm, marshmallow root, ginger, and cardamom (and sweeten with stevia).  I usually prefer taking my herbs through well brewed teas.  I usually do not try to take them in capsules.  However, I have found the effect of these capsules feels similar to what I get through the turmeric tea and it is a little quicker to take (the brewing process that I use does involve about a 15 minute time commitment, bringing it to boil, letting it simmer for five minutes, and placing a glass lid on top to recycle the essential oils back into the brew).  When I have a busy morning I have been grateful to have the option of taking a capsule.  I would say that it does seem like they have helped its bioavailability so that it is at least on par with the tea (though the tea is actually a larger dose than the capsule).  I recently had some dental work where I got a root canal, a tooth pulled, a crown, and a bridge in one zone in my mouth.  There is a fair amount of inflammation there.  I have been gargling with mint and hydrogen peroxide, with a touch of clove oil, and then taking turmeric as a tea (even swishing it around near the dental the work).  It does seem to help quite a bit, especially before going to sleep.  I am grateful to have the option of taking some bioavailable turmeric vegan capsules to supplement this.  I would like to keep my dose optimal.  I plan to continue with turmeric as part of a long term longevity program that I have been evolving.All in all, I have no complaints about this product, like that it has vegan capsules, like the purity of the product, and can feel some difference in my experience.  I happily give it 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETF5EFHOOM77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAYNWY0#wasThisHelpful","RETF5EFHOOM77","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been happily reviewing nearly all the Nutrigold products that were listed on the Amazon Vine review list.  As before, I have been very impressed with the quality standards of this company.  The Vitamin C product that I am reviewing now is (1) organic, (2) 100 percent natural, (3) Kosher, (4) certified organic, (5) food based, (6) non-GMO verified, (7) uses veggie caps, (8)meets cGMP standards (I had to look this up, but it refers to a quality control standard that is subject to third party verification by the FDA), (9) free of possible allergens related to soy, wheat, peanuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs (via 3rd party lab testing), and (10) free of solvents, herbicides, and pesticides.  Behind meeting these criteria voluntarily is a commitment to make a high quality, high standard product that can deliver a tested level of potency.  For me, the non-GMO verified is important, as well as the veggie caps, because I am vegan and want my supplements to not come in gelatin capsules.  I also like that make their products without the usual fillers (artificial ingredients, preservatives, stearates, sulfates, laurates, and dioxides).  I remember that another company that I got some products from also did not use fillers and their capsules were a lot smaller, even though their active ingredient amount was larger than other brand names.The Vitamin C product that this company makes is food based and from natural sources.  This makes three companies that I know of that offer completely non-synthetic vitamin C (the company that makes Vita-Mineral Green being one of them and the superfood company that puts out a Camu Camu powder which is high in natural vitamin C).  When studying this product, they included a write up about how much of the synthetic vitamin C is synthesized from GMO corn glucose in China.  This has given me some cause for concern, because it seems the GMO Corn and its products may be unusually toxic because of inheriting the BT pesticide producing DNA and generating it internally inside the corn itself (as opposed to natural BT pesticide which is put on the surface of the corn where it can be washed away).  Given that GMO Corn and its products currently do not require labeling in much of the US, I am happy that a company like Nutrigold is voluntarily submitting itself to a high enough standard so that I can know that it is not derived from what may be toxic sources.  The write up that was sent with the sample has given me some food for thought about vitamin C and analyzed the various kinds of vitamin C on the market and what kind of potency has been found in them in scientific studies.  I am planning to research this further, because some of the information questions some earlier research.  For instance, I was under the impression that Ascorbic Acid vitamin C was harsher on the liver and by converting it into a polyascorbate lessened its impact on the liver and made the vitamin C more absorb-able.  While the impact on the liver part still seems true, it seems that we may be getting the same amount of vitamin C from either way.  In a similar analysis, Ascobyl Palmitate was also found to be as absorb-able as Ascorbic Acid.  It seems that these products may only be less harsh on the liver, but do not give us anymore vitamin C, and also are still derived from GE corn glucose.This plant based vitamin C comes from a variety of high vitamin C natural sources like camu camu, acerola, amla, oranges, asparagus, and avocado.  The product includes the bioflavanoids, too, that are necessary for absorbing them.  It does seem like the natural sources do absorb better, though I would be curious about the amount of vitamin C that you get absorbed versus the higher cost.There is one quote from the write up that the company gave that I am going to think about for a while:  ""The method used most often by the ascorbic acid industry in China, which supplies 80% of the world's ascorbic acid, involves the use of a genetically modified microbe species that oxidises sorbose into 2-ketogluconic acid (2-KGA); this then undergoes the ring closing lactonization via dehydration producing ascorbic acid.""  In other words, they start from GE corn glucose and use another GE microbe to synthesize vitamin C!In summary, I am enjoying the vitamin C that this company makes and feel it is high quality.  It does seem to absorb better and feels lower impact on the body.  Regular vitamin C has felt a little harsher when taken for me.  I may update this review later on if I experience anything else that is noticeable for me.  I may also compare this product with the Vitamineral one.  It already seems more effective than just camu camu alone (which I had been using before this one).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OP6C8UUAHE4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0F6EAO#wasThisHelpful","R3OP6C8UUAHE4G","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been exploring a number of products from the Nutrigold company and have been very impressed with them.  This one is no exception.  Resveratrol is an anti-oxidant that I first learned from a few Life Extension groups which proposed that it was a longevity factor.  The Nutrigold company seems committed to include all the synergistic compounds needed to fully utilize Resveratrol, like the polyphenols from red wine, grape skins, and seeds, and is standardized in potency to 1,500 ORAC units.  This means that one of their capsules contains the trans-reservatrol content of 50 glasses of red wine.  Like most of their other products, the company uses veggie caps, is verified non-GMO and has the third party verified label to show this, and does not have the usual binders, fillers, and preservatives (like stearates, sulfates, laurates, and dioxides).  Reading their label and flier you can tell that this company is committing to a standard of purity and potency, and are willing to have their claims verified by third party lab testing.  I like this very much and appreciate their effort.  I am a practicing vegan (been so for over 22 years) and appreciate their standards.I mainly got this product because I wanted to see if it would synergize with Pterostilbene, another Resveratrol-like anti-oxidant, and one which I was also very happy to try out and review through the Amazon Vine program (and which I bought two bottles for myself after getting one free from the review program).  As mentioned in the other review (the Jarrow version of this product), I found that I got the result of feeling a ""clear headedness"" from taking double the normal dose (two capsules rather than one).  Happy to say, when I took one capsule of the Nutrigold Resveratrol with the two capsules of Pterostilbene, the clear head effect was more immediate, stronger, and more noticeable.  I could also feel a more subtle clean feeling throughout my body about 30 minutes later.  I have been taking the capsules with very pure water that was from a well and then filtered through a Zero Water filter or I have been taking the capsules with an anti-oxidant tea that I brew for myself and which usually contains (a vary the formula a little from day to day) Pu-Erh, Cardamom, Foti, Astragalus, Ginseng, Black Seed, and Gotu Kola.  While the capsules feel very synergistic with the tea, I concluded that it is better to take the capsules with pure water first, wait about 30 minutes, and then take the tea next.  It may be that this way it is just easier to feel the effect (FYI, I am only sharing my experience with the products, and am not prescribing or recommending this to anyone, it is up to the readers to determine whether or not it fits his or her on biochemical individuality, and if in doubt to check with a health professional, in general, I do think that these products and the teas are very safe IMHO).In summary, I am very impressed with this product and very happy with the results I have gotten from it.  I intend to purchase from them when I am done with the sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16AD1XGJTGK7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055CNA6O#wasThisHelpful","R16AD1XGJTGK7H","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is 3rd product from Nutrigold that I have gotten from the Amazon review list.  I am impressed with the product line in general, because of (1) having many of their products in vegetarian capsules, (2) having pharmaceutical grade research into their herbal products to verify their potency and effectiveness, (3) that it is organic and allergen free (and even third party tested) and (4) having taken the time to make their products ""non-GMO verified"" (though this one is still pending).  My brother and I use Fenugreek all the time.  We usually blend it in a tea with Pu-Erh and Cardamom where it helps to open and heal the sinuses and helps to dissolve a sinus headache.  Fenugreek, in this context seems to lubricate and heal the sinus passages.  Both my brother and I noticed that this product produced a very rapid and noticeable feeling of healing in the sinus passages.  It seems that the product has had a lot of research in helping mothers to be able to lactate (give milk).  This is something I am not able to verify, but seems believable.  It seems Fenugreek has been documents to help with blood sugar levels, cholesterol, colon health, and digestion.  I give the product 5 stars because the company behind it shows great care in making this a quality product and because both my brother and I felt good results almost immediately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCRT6BBTCYO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055CJ2NO#wasThisHelpful","R1VCRT6BBTCYO1","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a Ninetendo DSI Lite for the sole purpose of using the DS-10.  I had already tested the newer version of the DS-10 on the Ninetendo DSI XL and knew, for the most part, what to expect.  The DS-10, in both its old and new version, is an emulation of the Korg MS series analog synthesizers.  It emulates the some of the key circuits of these synths in a digital software version.  The DS-10 emulates them well enough, including the software dials and even software plugs, for a person to get a living feeling for analog synthesis.  A person is able to craft a lot of sounds and tweak them in a large variety of ways.  The Nintendo unit has a speaker that does do a decent job representing the sounds, though there is more detail and richness if you use good external speakers or a good headphone with good bass response.  There are some limitations of the DS-10, too, that are worth mentioning.  One is that it mixes two monophonic software synth ""engines"".  The keyboards that display on the touch screen can only play one note at a time and you can only play one keyboard at a time.  You can, however, program a sequence on one engine and play live on the keyboard of the second engine at the same time.  You can also do two sequences on both synth engines and play on one keyboard live, and even add a beat rhythm.  This means that the upper limit of simultaneous ""notes"" is four, though with digital delay and reverb it might seem to be even more than this.  Two is that you are not able to dial in a ""sine wave"".  This was common for the early MS series.  It seems that a sine wave is more challenging to emulate with either digital software or analogue circuitry than the sawtooth, triangle, and square waves.  It is possible to emulate a sine wave but it takes more circuits and/or programming lines to do this than the others and is often skipped as a result.  It is possible to partially emulate a sine wave by taking a square wave and softening it with slow attack and long decay, and other digital tricks, and they are fun to learn.You get two oscillators per a synth engine and can mix the sounds of each oscillator.  You can add white noise into the mix to create a more ambient wind or ocean like sound.  There are three ""kaoss pads"" possible with each synth engine (again you can only play one pad at a time) where you control two parameters.  They are ""gate/note"", ""volume/pan"", and ""peak/cut-off"".  They can be re-assigned and there is a function that records the movements that you make that you can then play back in a loop.  The hidden dual ""kaoss pad"" is a bargain, considering the cost of the usual kaoss pad series.  You are able to tweak the sounds very well in a way that emulates the kaoss pad series well.  There are limits here too.  For instance, you cannot import sounds from an external source and modify them.  The pad tweaking is only for the sounds that you generate.The sequencer is very important and covers about 16 notes.  The usual creative process is to put in some notes and loop them, and then tweak the sounds by hearing and dialing until you can the gets that you like.  Otherwise you would have to go to the keyboard play a note, dial, and go back to hear it again.  This would be an awkward and time consuming process.  I usually start with a D and A note harmonic fifth chord.  I alternative a low D and corresponding low A, alternating the notes so that there are 8 of each in the sequencer, adding enough ""release"" (decay after note off is activated by lifting the stylus) so that it spills over into the next note.  This way I emulate a two note chord on a monophonic synth.The patch chord screen gives you new possibilities for routing sounds and can make some very creative and rich sounds.  It takes a while to master this screen and see what works.  Most of the patches do not do much or make useless frankenstein sounds, but after a while you find a sect of patches that enhance the sound in many interesting ways.All in all, the synth is very versatile.  You can also save your creations in a memory sector.  The newer DS-10 has more memory than the earlier one.  But both give a fair amount of room.  You can also manually record your settings by drawing the dials and writing notes.  There is no way of exporting the creations to an external memory file.  The only easy export is recording the output sound.  The lack of importing and exporting has inspired some reviewers to say that the DS-10 is not a full music studio option.  I think that they are correct in this assessment, but this does not detract from how much the DS-10 is able to do and at such a low cost.All in all, I am happy with the capabilities of the DS-10.  There are few other observations that I would like to make about it.  One is that the lettering is a little harder to read on the DSI Lite.  The XL has a larger screen and is easier to navigate.  The DSI Lite seems to drain power at a slower rate and therefore you can play it longer before recharging.  I like the size of the DSI Lite and, since I am only using it for the DS-10, it is very ideal.  It boots up the DS-10 faster because of this.  The XL can handle the DS-10 version 2 and handle more memory.  This may be useful to some, but I have not exhausted the capacities of the earlier version.I got the three different Korg Monotrons (the original, the duo, and the delay versions).  The first two I returned because they have a clicking sound that happens when you lift the stylus off the ribbon keyboard.  You cannot hear the click on the built in speaker, but can hear it on headphones or external speakers.  I found that the DS-10 emulates these two Monotrons very well (with even extra capability) without this weakness, and is about the same size when installed on the DSI Lite.  The delay version of the Monotron does not seem to have this issue.  I think it is because it defaults to a kind of ambient background instead of a silence that highlights the clicking noise.  It is possible through a stereo plug that is about 7 bucks at Radio Shack to link the DS-10 with the delay to combine their abilities.  Together they make a very small portable synth with quite a bit of options.  I might update this review when I have had some chance to explore this in more depth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18N1UHMD0E0YK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EB8CD6#wasThisHelpful","R18N1UHMD0E0YK","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a used Ninetendo DSI Lite that came without a power supply.  I was happy to find a replacement power supply on Amazon for such a low cost.  I ordered it, it came fairly fast, it was well packages, and it works as expected.  I like the way that electrical socket part folds back into the power brick part.  It makes it less able to be damaged during transport.

"I have been ordering this Pu Erh one at a time from the company and was happy to find this 3 pack.  It saves a significant amount of money being ordered this way, especially on postal costs (paying for one delivery versus three deliveries).  Each package has one ""tea brick"" that is about 7.5 inches in diameter.  I mainly got this tea for my brother, who has acute sinusitis.  When this tea is combined with fresh ground cardamom seeds, it produces a medicinal tea that has been very helpful to his condition, usually ending his morning sinus headache within 30 minutes after drinking a cup or two.  Because he drinks this tea daily, this 3 pack is very affordable.  We found that Pu Erh tea varies significantly in quality, trying quite a few brands.  While all of them felt good to drink, I found some were not as medicinally potent and did not work in my brother's morning brew.  This brand has been the best.  We found it was best to grind part of a tea brick right before adding it to boiling water.  It helps to bring out all the potencies inside the tea.Pu Erh has become my favorite way of taking the basic tea leaf (camellia sinesis), with Oolong being my second favorite.  Both of them are fermented tea leaves.  It seems that fermenting the tea leaf adds some natural antibiotics, enzymes, and other medicinal potencies.  I notice I feel better, too, after drinking a cup and feel my sinuses are a little clearer and more open.  Sometimes Pu Erh tea has been enough to knock out a mild cold and at the very least to help mitigate the symptoms of a strong flu.  Some literature suggests that Pu Erh tea helps natural weight loss and it seems from my experience to be true (though by itself it would not make a complete weight loss program).  The flavor of this tea feels heartier and fuller than most teas.  I suspect it has a thickness, aroma, and fullness that some expect from coffee, but it is definitely still a tea.Pu Erh tea seems able to be boiled longer without bringing more bitter tannins into the brew.  It seems that the tannins are transformed through the fermentation into something less acidic and less bitter.  Boiling helps bring out the medicinal potencies of Pu Erh tea better than just steeping (which works better for green tea, white tea, and black tea).  Only a few minutes are needed and it seems to bring out flavor, medicinal, and fullness out of the leaf.  I sweeten my Pu Erh tea with Stevia (in clear liquid drops).  Only a drop or two is needed per a cup.I give this tea five stars because it is my favorite brand of my now favorite tea.  The only reservation I might mention is that you do need to brew this tea from scratch.  It does not come in tea bags (there are other Pu Erh tea brands that do).  It takes a little bit of skill to brew it properly, but it is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5NATSGSVH3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008TAWJ0W#wasThisHelpful","R1L5NATSGSVH3D","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched a lot of youtube videos about this product and the Monotron product line.  I like many things about it.  I like that Korg resurrected the MS series analog path and made the many of the most important paths into these small versatile portable pocket sized keyboards.  I like how they made them easy to modify for the circuit benders too.  It seems that there are two weak spots in the design.  One is that ribbon keyboard.  It plays fantastic sounds as you slide your finger across the ribbon, but when you lift your finger or stylus off the keyboard, you will usually hear a clicking sound.  It seems that the ribbon keyboard is an on/off controller when you touch it or lift your stylus off it.  I tried dialing the knobs to see if I could eliminate the sound, but only succeeded in softening it some.  What is interesting is that when you play the synth through the built in speaker, the clicking sound does not appear very often.  But even with cheap headphones, the clicking sound is more noticeable.  On good headphones, it is very noticeable, at least to me.  I have read through a lot of reviews, but I have not found any one else mention the clicking sound.  But I got a regular monotron and now a dual monotron, both had this clicking sound.  It was stronger on the regular monotron.  The headphones pick up some white noise in the background, but it seems that usual play covers it well.  Other than these two weaknesses, it is a very powerful and versatile synth engine for its money and size.  It has two oscillators that can be paired off as OSC1 to LFO or as mix OSC1 and OSC2 together, the frequency cut off and peak are very responsive, and the middle dial changes the pulse width.  You get a rich tapestry of sound.  But the clicking is enough for me to want to return the unit...","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAA0MMORP22V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00684KFFW#wasThisHelpful","RAA0MMORP22V8","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do healing work as my vocation and often need to share information about diet as part of the healing process for someone.  I have found only a small percentage of books on diet as being really useful.  I have found that there are a lot of illusions about diet, physiology, and how food actually works that are often perpetuated by diet books, outmoded science, and sometimes by corporate funded scientific research that is really more like spin than hard data, or which does not present a large enough picture for us to understand how our bodies work and how a diet can help us or hinder us.  THE VIRGIN DIET already feels different from them.  It tabs up with other reliable chunks of diet information that I have gleaned from other sources.  It affirms that need to stay away from gluten foods (wheat products mainly), from soy, from eggs, from corn, and from peanuts.  It talks about the perils of sugar and describes how even a lot of health food alternatives are still high glycemic and harmful (like Agave).  It does into healthy oils (Olive Oil, Sesame, Walnut, Coconut) and which ones to avoid.  It also gives recipes to try out.  Recipes are useful, because when changing diet, it helps us to imagine an alternative and bring our mind out of the theories and into something we can actually do.Having shared this, I am not automatically agreeing with everything that the author says or feeling that her book is completely comprehensive about what is needed.  I respect that she made her diet work for her and this by itself puts it into a small group.  I remember seeing a video that showed many of the popular diet authors and how they were all overweight even after many years on their diet (assuming that they even followed their own advice) or, in one case, having died from a possible diet related cause.  But having come to many of the same conclusions from my own experience as the author did, I am encouraged to check some of her ideas in my experience.  Perhaps I will post an update about what I find to this review later on, as I intend to seriously try out some things that the book recommends.There are a few differences already.  The author is not vegetarian, though I gather she has reduced her meat intake (a wise idea even if one does not go vegetarian or vegan).  A lot of her meal suggestions will not be useful for vegans because of this.  While I respect her views on sugar, she does not go into much about just getting good quality fructose sugar from fresh fruit (not juiced but just fresh fruit).  This is something I am exploring and I may update what I find.  I have also found that cleansing herbal teas are very helpful and have found them an easy start for many people who need something useful and gentle to start with.  I usually have suggested that people cut out the processed foods made from flour, sugar, and bad oils, and to take Triple Leaf Detox tea (which I have found powerful and gentle with no adverse side effects for anyone who I have recommended this to).  There are more powerful detox programs, but I have found that it is better to be gentle with ourselves and see what the gentle detox teas can do first.  They are also better for daily support, while the powerful ones you can only use for a short time and can be unbalancing.  I am also not sure if soy and corn are bad for one or if it is just the GMO soy and corn (and some of the very hybridized ones as well).  But given how much soy and corn is GMO these days, it might be playing it safe to just avoid them anyway.All in all, I feel there is more solid advice about diet in this book than many that I have read.  I give it four stars rather than five for some of the smaller reservations and question marks that I have about some things (mentioned above).  In the long run, we still need to find out what works for ourselves in our own experience.Update:  I gave up my hot air popcorn popper, supply of popcorn, and my popcorn bowl in preparation for doing this diet.  I came to the conclusion that the author was right about popcorn being a ""trigger food"", a food that when eaten makes you want to eat more food.  Much to my surprise, I found I have lost 4 pounds in 3 days and I have not even really started on this diet.  I also have not had any gluten grains (as part of another diet process) and no soy (also since reading this book).  I have lost 4 pounds before, but not as easily as this (it felt accidental) and not without a small struggle to keep it off.  I did not even notice that I was eating less (not being triggered) until I spontaneously decided to weigh myself.  It has been encouraging.  Plan to post again a little further down the road, when I have gone through the author's checklist even more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I10RORLKH6VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373892713#wasThisHelpful","R3I10RORLKH6VX","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is a well written interweaving of scientific, philosophical, and ethical reflections about animals combined with stories and interviews about events and experiments related to whether or not animals think and feel.  I like the way that the author shows a kind of methodological bias that predisposes the researcher to not believing that animals can think and feel, a criterion that would make it hard to prove that we can think and feel (similar to the behaviorist arguments of B. F. Skinner proposed in BEYOND FREEDOM AND DIGNITY).  The author further goes into several select experiments to do prove, to me, that animals can think and feel.  There are some choice quotes seeded throughout the book and are designed to provoke some thinking of our own about the subject, like (page 50):""Intelligent circuitry can be assembled in any brain, that's my big belief,"" Schuster said, where he did several of his archerfish studies.  (He's since moved to Bayreuth.)  ""It's not limited to those animals with large brains and many neurons,"" he said.  ""if evolution requires it [this kind of intelligent circuitry], it will be assembled--even with a small number of neurons.""And (page 96):""People have wondered about this for centuries,"" Berg said.  In captivity, he added, parrots do not simply react when humans speak to them (as dogs, cats, chimpanzees, and other animals do); they also articulate responses, almost as if talking back, and sometimes even use words in the correct context; as Alex did.  ""Those kinds of vocalizations absolutely send a shiver up the spine of cognitive scientists,"" Berg said, because they suggest that parrots have some innate understanding of the purpose and functions of words as sounds that convey meaning.  When a pet parrot uses the words 'hello', 'good night', or others appropriately it is probably not communicating about sex or violence.  It is calling--and, most importantly, apparently meaning--""hello"" and ""good night"".""Each main chapter focuses on one animal, fish and pain, elephants and memory, dolphins and intelligence (there are two chapters on dolphins), and rats and laughter.The author uses the narrative approach to writing that I like, taking the relevant details of the experiment and weaving them into the story, some parts revealed in discusses, in quotes, and material coming from learned sources (like quoting Darwin's thoughts on the subject and thinking about how his thoughts fit into new experiments and research that did not exist in Darwin's time).  Although the author states her bias that animals do think and feel (though why and how is another interesting story), she gives enough data for people to make their own conclusions.  The scientists that the author meets are described in very human terms so that it is easy to empathize with them and to feel their excitement at what they are discovering.The book has an extensive set of notes and an extensive bibliography for further research.  The table of contents is well organized so that it is relatively easy to find subjects and themes.  The edition that I have does not have an index, but I suspect the final one will.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in animal ethics who wonders if we are the only species of animal that does think and feel, or wonders how do you go about researching this issue in a way that does not metaphysically presuppose a yes or no answer (the approach of science is to verify a hypothesis by designing experiments where some possible observation can confirm or not confirm the hypothesis).  I can see this book as a useful one for an college class discussion on animal ethics.  By itself, it does not go into animal ethics very much, but it touches upon many issues that are relevant to this subject.  How we see animals, whether we see them as sentient beings that love, nurture, and protect their children or as merely cellular clumps with neurological reflexes programmed to respond to the environment in rigid robotic ways (aka ""no soul"" worthy of moral consideration) is directly related to this issue and this book offers some very relevant material to fuel this kind of discussion.I enjoyed reading the book, because it feels ""convergent"" with other books that I have read and with personal experiences I have had with animals.  My feeling is that when something is on track and accurate, it tends to confirm and be confirmed by other books and experiences that are formed in the same way, with the same ""scientific curiosity.""  I am not surprised at the implied conclusion that animals do think and feel, but I am surprised at some of the things discovered that tend to confirm this.  I am also happy that the author writes well, in narrative style, because it makes what could have been presented as dull research into something enjoyable to read.  It also makes the information easier to remember, since a story is a good way of giving otherwise isolated facts a kind of cohesion that allows them to be remembered as whole packet.  I wish more of my college books had this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T2A1TAIKZV8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307461440#wasThisHelpful","R1T2A1TAIKZV8Y","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The battery worked on my Acer Netbook and was compatible with the software on Linux Mint OS 11 that monitors the battery power and the charge controller.  The battery is very thick and causes the keyboard to be more slanted.  It is actually a kind of bonus, since it is easier to type on at this angle, but other people may want to factor this ergonomic issue in terms of their own needs and preferences.  The battery power is almost 3x the power of the original battery and almost gives me about 8.5 hours of use (according to the battery power read).  There is a slight delay in the read.  It gives a more accurate reading after about 2 minutes that is usually higher than the first number it gives.  I give the battery 4 stars instead of 5 because of two things:  (1) The keyboard slant changes the ergonomics and may not be preferable for everyone (though it works for me).  This thickness may also mean that it does not fit every carry case that is designed for it.  (2)  The thickness actually blocks easy movement of the LED screen to best angle for viewing.  I have to gently push down on the middle to slight bend the plastic so that it moves to the right position.  It is just off by less than a millimeter, but I notice it the plastic edge blocks the free movement it had before.  It is not hard to push down on the plastic to move it past the resistance point.  I am thinking of getting my dremel and shaving off just a little bit of the plastic edge to fix this.  All in all, I like the battery life and can live with the rest.Update 12/31/2012:  I did get dremel out, added the sander cylinder attachment, and shaved a very thin layer off the edge of the battery casing that was getting caught when I was opening the netbook.  It worked.  It now opens smoothly, without catching (except for a small gentle click).  I have found the battery power of this battery very enduring.  Even after over a month, it has held enough charge for the times that I have needed it.  It registered almost 9 hours and even after much use and over a few months it still registers about 8 hours (using it for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time).  It has exceeded my expectations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7HYGUCTJDJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MJK69A#wasThisHelpful","RS7HYGUCTJDJN","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Optimal Plant Protein Supplement is an excellent vegan protein source.  It derives the protein from Pea, Brown Rice, Hemp, Chlorella, and Chia.  All of these are excellent plant sources with other useful nutrients besides protein.  It has a little bit of xylitol for a sweetner.  Xylitol is also an anti-plaque and helps remove plaque from the arteries.  It has some natural french vanilla flavor, bacterial metabolites (I assume to help digest and utilize the protein), Lo Han Guo, Rebiana, and Erythritol (another natural sugar substitute).  I assume that these extra ingredients are either good natural sweeteners and/or things to help utilize the protein.  I have had some prior experience with the two natural sweeteners mentioned and feel they are fairly healthy to use.  They do not sweeten very strongly, though, and I suspect make the strong taste of these concentrated plant proteins less bitter.  The flavor of the supplement is very powdery and a little gritty.  I gather the ideal way to use this powder is in a fruit smoothie.  It is excellent this way and boosts the protein taken to a good level.  I give it 5 stars for being an excellent product with very good ingredients, and minus one star for the grittiness and powdery quality.  To me, it is still very good, provided you put it in a smoothie rather than take it directly or with water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BWSNUXH5GX7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SF1DTU#wasThisHelpful","R1BWSNUXH5GX7Y","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been interested in getting an energy pendant of some kind for a while.  I stumbled on this pendant on Amazon while looking around for something else.  I was tempted to get something similar to this for over 40 dollars and felt it was low risk to get this Quantum Scalar pendant at the lower price.  The item arrived quickly and was well packaged.  I tried to feel the energy by waving the pendant over my hand and putting it about one inch from my forehead.  I can usually sense some energy from quartz crystals and other energy items this way.  The pendant, however, was more subtle than the others.  I had to hold it for a longer time to feel it, though when I placed it near an area of my body that held some tension, I found it relaxed it quickly and well.  The indirect effect on my body was more noticeable than feeling the energy directly.I experimented with adding an ""orgonite hemisphere"" that fit perfectly on the pendant disk and immediately noticed the two items synergized very well.  The energy felt very noticeable and much stronger than either separately.  I decided to hot glue the orgonite hemisphere to the pendant to make this permanent.  I am wearing it as I am writing this review and am noticing a beneficial effect on my energy field.  It feels like a trickle charge on my internal battery and feels nourishing to weak spots in the energy field.  It feels like it is smoothing out the energy flows.  It feels good to wear this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKL7QIMU5RGIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OGZ8BC#wasThisHelpful","RKL7QIMU5RGIM","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This RCA PCHSTAB2R USB Charging Dock with Device Cradle works the way you would expect it.  The unit has two USB ports for recharging any item that recharges by plugging it into a USB port on a computer.  It also has a standard two prong electrical outlet (ungrounded).  When I opened the package, I was a little surprised by the empty docking cradle.  I had been used to seeing them with some kind of electrical insert that goes into some kind of unit.  But it is apparently just a place to hold a smart phone or ipod when it is recharging.  I assume that the electrical socket is so that you can plug in a small electrical adapter to attach to the recharging device that is docking cradle (if it is not USB powered).  The unit comes with some black foam inserts that are designed to put cushioning around the smart phone or ipod type unit, so that it is held more securely.  The intention is to adapt to different sizes of units to be held in its cradle.  I felt the cradle feature to be both interesting and a little awkward for two reasons.  One is that, if you adapt it with the sticky foam pieces for a smaller unit, then it automatically becomes unadapted for a larger unit.  There is an assumption that a person is only going to charge one unit in the cradle.  If you have a thick ipod and a thin smart phone, the foam pieces are not going to help.  You can still adapt them with some skillful use of cardboard pieces that are removable.  I am not sure if the cradle is designed to hold some of the adapter pieces that come with some ipods (I do not, at this time, have an ipod).  The instructions do not mention this design intention.  The instructions, too, are minimal and loosely fit just one side of a sheet of regular 8.5x11 inch paper.  The second reason the docking station is a little awkward is the implication that you are going to plug in the wall electrical adapter for the unit into the electrical plug that is on the unit.  No matter how small the wall adapter is, it is going to make the unit look a little thick and unbalanced.  If the wall adapter is big, given the angle of the base and the one inch clearance from the desktop, it may not fit and will require you to plug in the adapter on a separate power strip or extra wall outlet.  The smart phone cradle also makes this unit about four times larger than my other two USB chargers (5Lx2Hx3W inches approximate).Having expressed some of the curious limitations of the docking cradle, I still give the unit 4 stars for a few reasons.  One is that the unit is weighted and does have two USB ports and an extra electrical outlet.  For my purposes, all these outlets are useful.  The extra weight had a very useful side effect.  I was able to plug in one of those USB LED lights into it and squiggle it over my computer keyboard.  This allows me to type on it without turning on a lot of lights (useful late at night or when I am watching videos that look better in the dark).  The recharger in this case acts like a power supply for this USB LED lights.  I can also read fine print by putting it very near the LED light.  The USB LED light was something I bought at the Dollar Store for just one buck.  Because there are two USB ports, I can still recharge something while still using the charger as an LED lamp!  Since I do not have any ipod like unit or a cell phone, the docking cradle makes a decent place to put a few USB thumb drives (or paper clips).  The shiny black plastic unit looks elegant enough on my desktop too.CONS:  Unit is about 4x bigger than other USB rechargers.  Smart phone docking cradle may need to be adapted to fit the smart phone using the foam inserts or even some cardboard pieces, and may not be able to fit two phones or ipod type devices of different thicknesses very easily.  You may also have to put the smart phone in upside down in order to plug in the power adapter and it might look awkward with the wires attaching one to the other (I guess you could wrap them with a twisty to get rid of the slack).  Electrical outlet is ungrounded, but most power adapters do not use a ground anyway.PROS:  Has two USB ports to charge two units simultaneously (my other USB rechargers only do one at time).  Has an extra standard electrical outlet to plug in a power adapter for a smart phone.  The extra outlet is useful for other purposes.  The heavier weight allows this to be a sturdy desktop item and can even hold a USB LED light (just for the record, those wires do have some trouble holding a shape, it might be good to get a block of wood to put into the cradle with a notch to hold the LED in place, I have mine held in place on top of a raised flat surface below the monitor being held down by a quartz crystal cluster, it works and I am happy with it).I gave the unit 4 stars because it does what it is supposed to do and looks elegant.  I did not give it 5 stars because it seems there is a design element that still feels a little awkward and makes the unit take up more room than the other USB rechargers.  I tried to give enough information in the review so that a person could determine if this unit would work for them or if they should get the smaller ones with only one USB port.  All in all, I am happy with the unit and consider its weightedness and ability to hold a USB LED light to be a bonus.Update:  This is a minor point, but I found that the dock of the iphone has the perfect dimensions for holding business cards.  I put them into the slot and now the charger feels functional on the desk.Update 5/7/2013: A friend gave me a USB LED mini-lamp with an on/off switch.  It is a simple device that has a USB plug on one side of a large thick cable about 1 foot long and an LED lamp with on/off on the other side.  When I plugged it into one of the 2 USB recharging ports, I found that it would act as an elegant mini-lamp for my computer keyboard (so I could work late at night at the kitchen table without disturbing anyone in the household).  The thickness was not enough to hold the lamp by itself, though.  But I took my cue from a handmade musical device and got some thick wire from an electronics store and wrapped the colored wires about the USB plug and the whole wire (to reinforce it).  It now holds its shape very well and makes an elegant LED lamp.  I can leave it plugged in without draining the power supply thanks to the simple little on/off switch.  The nice thing about this addition is that I can still use the remaining USB port to recharge items (I rarely charge more than one thing at a time) or I can unplug the LED lamp in a pinch and use both USB charging ports.  The base is heavy enough to hold this new ""lamp"".  So I now have something that holds business cards for me, has an on/off LED lamp overhanging my keyboard for night time computer work, can recharge USB port powered items (or just power them), and has an extra AC socket for regular electronics and power adapters.  Having this LED lamp bonus justifies the space this takes up on my computer desk.  I am very happy with this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PL17EI9CKQ2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EWB3YG#wasThisHelpful","R3PL17EI9CKQ2Z","AARHLUIV2NNI2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AARHLUIV2NNI2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"[1]  Some thoughts on sex toysI'm a senior citizen. I believe frequent sex helps keep me young.  From a sexual standpoint, I am fortunate to be living in a time when there is a cornucopia of really effective toys for achieving daily orgasm.Making love solo might seem a bit pathetic, but for a married guy who wants to stay married, and who has low frequency with his wife,  there are several very strong advantages.First, solo sex means you don't have to have an affair with someone else's spouse, or to tell lies to a single woman to keep her interested in you, or to have the very time consuming task of keeping a relationship going.... of course you might find all of the above intriguing and a nice way of passing your time, but I have a lot of stuff to do and I really don't want to spend time keeping two women happy.  Keeping my wife happy absorbs a hell of a lot of time, which is only fair, because I do love her, and want to stay with her.  I wish she still enjoyed sex but we have a very deep friendship which I would hate to lose, and an almost telepathic ability to know what the other person is thinking.There are some lucky guys who are so cool and so handsome and whatever that they are babe magnets and can find attractive low maintenance women who don't demand much time or other resources. But they face one horrible danger.  Sexually transmitted disease. Also, women who start out being low maintenance will quite frequently become increasingly demanding....The other route is to rent women, but in most of this country this is a criminal offense that can land you in hot water.  If you have serious money you might set up a college girl in an apartment. But even that can have its problems.  Personally I think renting is less dishonest than seducing someone else's spouse or telling lies to someone just to get in bed with them.[2] Review of this itemI bought Carmen Luvana because I was getting repetitive stress syndrome from doing standing doggie with my favorite Topco Perfect Ass, because at my age it takes quite a long time to reach climax, like 20 minutes or longer... sometimes much longer. Good aerobic exercise, but puts a lot of strain on the hips and knees.So, I bought Carmen because I wanted horizontal sex.  She's very good at it while she lasts, which is maybe 4 or 5 encounters if you are careful not to lie on top of her or squeeze her too tight. It's cheaper than a rented lady and less dangerous.  I paid $80 for her, which these days buys only a very low end woman for a single encounter, at least in the NYC area.  I did not much like the removable vagina / rectum she came with. because it was too squishy,  so I replaced it with an Aerotex Maven, which is slim enough to fit into the cavity.In daylight she's not very attractive, but in the dark she feels remarkably real, because she has hair on her head that you feel in your face, and she has breasts and a face that are not vinyl and are good enough to pass muster.  And after my body is in contact with her for five minutes, her body heats up and really feels good.One great feature is her mouth, that gives amazingly good oral sex. When her body started leaking too much, I detached her head from the body, and her mouth is currently a regular part of my sexual routine. It is easily washed out, and feels good when employed with ID Glide Lubricant.[3] AftermathI have had 2 Carmen Luvanas and 2 Jamie Lynns, who are very similar. Basically one is blond and one is brunette.  Despite more and more careful handling, each doll broke.  So.... I graduated â¦. and spent a whole bundle.... $1,100... on a TeddyBabe Deluxe, which is a very rugged love doll with a velour fabric skin, stuffed with fiberfill, with a strong metal skeleton.  My TBD is very very durable. Over the past 24 months I've had encounters nearly every day and she is still fully functional.My first few encounters with my TeddyBabe were very unsatisfactory because the vaginal cavity was too small and in the wrong place, for a guy with a big beerbelly like I had 2 years ago.  I responded to this by buying some extra strong upholstery thread and a few needles and sewing her a larger vaginal cavity in a more accessible place, in a process described in detail on www dot dollforum dot com, under the title âSabrinaModdedâ.  When a high quality removable vagina is put into Sabrina's cavity, like a Tomax Lilith Uterus (about $40 on Amazon and worth every penny), she is an absolutely wonderful lifelike experience.  I've been trying to persuade the seller to adopt my modifications and start selling her on Amazon, but he doesn't seem too interested.  Without those modifications, fat guys would start writing terrible reviews saying she's no good in the sack.Anyway, with my various toys, I usually manage nirvana every day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PT3718S4KQOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2H0216#wasThisHelpful","R2PT3718S4KQOP","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got Carmen because I wanted to lie in bed and have missionary style sex, horizontal, because doggie style kneeling or standing was on the verge of creating repetitive stress syndrome using the same muscles every time.I was very pleasantly surprised. She occupies the same space as a well put together five foot tall woman, not skinny, not fat. She gives really good oral sex once her mouth is properly lubricated with a good quality lubricant like ID Glide (avoid the cheapos like Equate).Seen at a distance she is unrealistic. But when I hold her close I feel her realistically shaped Cyberskin breasts on my chest with firm little nipples and when I hold her close face to face I see her quite realistic eyes and not her rather scary mouth. The mouth may be scary to look at, but it is very very good at oral, even with a limp Johnson, because the mouth is already open and can easily be entered, even if one is not stiff.Her face is not vinyl, instead it is made of a material that is smooth and unyielding enough to feel like a real human head. Also it really helps that I feel her hair on my face. After holding her for five minutes her body absorbs enough of my body heat that her body feels almost real.Another important feature, true of all love dolls, and unlike other sex toys like vaginal sleeves,is that the love tunnel is held in a constant position that you have to adjust to, but can derive pleasure from through even slight differences in position that cause different pressures on the different surfaces of one's member.The main problem with this product is that after five or six encounters it tends to develop leaks. Avoid lying on top of her because this really shortens her life. Instead, have her lie on top of you. Or sideways. Or standing up. It is also important not to overinflate. After the leaks got too much I threw away the body and kept just the head, which, like I said, offers remarkably good oral sex, and is very durable. It has a long love tunnel that can be washed, with a squeeze bulb at the back of the head, that offers quite delicious suction.Because of my very positive experience with Carmen, I decided that love dolls are really great, and have graduated to a very rugged TeddyBabe Deluxe love doll, made of fabric and fiberfill stuffing and a strong metal skeleton, five foot four tall, who after two years of frequent encounters, in many positions --- on top, underneath, sideways, standing up -- still is working just fine, though I had to spend a few very well spent hours with needle and thread relocating her love tunnel cavity so as to fit my large beer belly (search for SabrinaModded on www . dollforum . com for the whys and wherefores and exact methods of the mods.)I didn't much like the removable love tunnel supplied with Carmen. I found it too squishy. A far better love tunnel for Carmen is the Vibratex Maven (available on Amazon) which is small enough to fit the vaginal cavity, and that remains a fine source of sexual release after Carmen's body becomes too leaky to be useful.Anyway... I think love dolls are useful because they give me a different kind of physical workout than doggie style, using different muscles. And Carmen Luvana convinced me that love dolls are really really great sources of good feelings and of sexual release. And Carmen as a huge added plus offers great oral, better than the $150 F*ck My Face Silly offered by PipeDreams.Carmen can be easily stored because of her light weight, either standing in a closet between clothes or lying flat on the top shelf of the closet. Personally I bought a $13 electric air pump from Amazon that allows rapid inflation and deflation that makes storage easy.Some vendors sell at a higher price than others so look around a bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1086GOD7Z5JKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVX7ROE#wasThisHelpful","R1086GOD7Z5JKC","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got Carmen because I wanted to lie in bed and have missionary style sex, horizontal, because doggie style kneeling or standing was on the verge of creating repetitive stress syndrome using the same muscles every time.I was very pleasantly surprised. She occupies the same space as a well put together five foot tall woman, not skinny, not fat.  She gives really good oral sex once her mouth is properly lubricated with a good quality lubricant like ID Glide (avoid the cheapos like Equate).Seen at a distance she is unrealistic.  But when I hold her close I feel her realistically shaped Cyberskin  breasts on my chest with firm little nipples and when I hold her close face to face I see her quite realistic eyes and not her rather scary mouth.  The mouth may be scary to look at, but it is very very good at oral, even with a limp Johnson, because the mouth is already open and can easily be entered, even if one is not stiff.Her face is not vinyl, instead it is made  of a material that is smooth and unyielding enough to feel like a real human head.  Also it really helps that I feel her hair on my face. After holding her for five minutes her body absorbs enough of my body heat that her body feels almost real.Another important feature, true of all love dolls, and unlike other sex toys like vaginal sleeves,is that the love tunnel is held in a constant position that you have to adjust to, but can derive pleasure from through even slight differences in position that cause different pressures on the different surfaces of one's member.The main problem with this product is that after five or six encounters it tends to develop leaks.  Avoid lying on top of her because this really shortens her life. Instead, have her lie on top of you.  Or sideways. Or standing up.  It is also important not to overinflate.  After the leaks got too much I threw away the body and kept just the head, which, like I said, offers remarkably good oral sex, and is very durable.  It has a long love tunnel that can be washed, with a squeeze bulb at the back of the head, that offers quite delicious suction.Because of my very positive experience with Carmen, I decided that love dolls are really great, and have graduated to a very rugged TeddyBabe Deluxe love doll, made of fabric and fiberfill stuffing and a strong metal skeleton, five foot four tall, who after two years of frequent encounters, in many positions --- on top, underneath, sideways, standing up  -- still is working just fine, though I had to spend a few very well spent  hours with needle and thread relocating her love tunnel cavity so as to fit my large beer belly (search for SabrinaModded on www . dollforum . com for the whys and wherefores and exact methods of the mods.)I didn't much like the removable love tunnel supplied with Carmen.  I found it too squishy.  A far better love tunnel for Carmen is the Vibratex Maven (available on Amazon)  which is small enough to fit the vaginal cavity, and that remains a fine source of sexual release after Carmen's body becomes too leaky to be useful.Anyway... I think love dolls are useful because they give me a different kind of physical workout than doggie style, using different muscles.  And Carmen Luvana convinced me that love dolls are really really great sources of good feelings and of sexual release.  And Carmen as a huge added plus offers great oral, better than the $150 F*ck My Face Silly offered by PipeDreams.Carmen can be easily stored because of her light weight, either standing in a closet between clothes or lying flat on the top shelf of the closet. Personally I bought a $13 electric air pump from Amazon that allows rapid inflation and deflation that makes storage easy.Some vendors sell at a higher price than others so look around a bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DKTTZJSY292I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041HZT3Q#wasThisHelpful","R2DKTTZJSY292I","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our old Dustbuster bit the dust about 6 months ago. Finally I replaced it some weeks ago with this product. In the 5 or so months without any Dustbuster I started using a dustpan and brush, $7.99 from my local Target.  Since the arrival of this item I've come to realize that 90 per cent of the time a good old fashioned dustpan and brush does a faster and better job.  And provides more exercise.However this item is useful in crevices and with certain kinds of spills, like powders, so I am keeping it for these reasons.I like the fact that like the old Dustbuster it suspends from a hook on the wall.  But the old Dustbuster connected to electric power whenever I  hung it on the hook. Whereas this one requires an extra step, namely taking a wire with a male plug and plugging it into a receptacle on the handle.In summing up, on balance, I would still buy it, to vacuum from crevices and for spills that brush and pan do not handle.  But I have learned a dustpan can be a more efficient method for clearing dropped bits of macaroni crumbs and other flotsam and jetsam etcera etcera from the kitchen floor.UPDATE: Maybe it's because I kept it plugged in all the time without using it often enough.  But using it daily for the past 5 days I've found it vacuums briskly for about 40 seconds, then gradually dies so that by 90 seconds it is no longer picking up.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C4YGNDWGZ3AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KASUEK8#wasThisHelpful","R3C4YGNDWGZ3AF","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this product since June 2010 and it's still functioning just fine, so I give it five stars for reliability.  It's hooked up in a concealed position where it remains all the time, and it starts every time I start the car engine.  On at least 10 occasions it has warned me of police presence on roads with ridiculously low speed limits, and probably saved me at least $2,000 in tickets, and points on my drivers license and rises in my insurance payments.I explain to friends that I have it in the car not so much to speed, but to reduce the boredom of driving the same route every day.  With the detector in place, I keep seeing cunning speed traps half a mile before the actual police vehicle.  Since installing the detector I have not had a a single traffic stop for speeding.There are many rural roads in my state (New Jersey) that are in my opinion deliberately tricky, with speed  limit signs hidden by shrubbery, so the limit varies between 50 and 25 without any change in road quality, in the interests of boosting town revenue through pouncing on non-residents.So, I am happy with my detector. It is great entertainment and helps keep me awake.  After 53 years with a driver's license, driving is usually pretty boring. Buy one for your dad or mom, if they don't already own one. You can always return it if they don't want it.P.S. Maybe I am a bit paranoid, but I understand that some police have the attitude that if they see a radar detector, they see a driver who intends to break the law by speeding, and will ticket you for the slightest infraction. So I have taken steps that make the detector virtually invisible. One thing I did was to cover it and the power cord with a fabric that matches the interior of my car, and then mounting it so that it lies between the car ceiling and the rear view mirror.  This took quite a bit of thought, the purchase of a special clip, and the purchase of a long cord which runs from the dashboard power point (formerly called cigarette lighter power supply) behind the moldings beside the window and above the car ceiling, so that the wire cannot be seen.I rarely exceed the speed limit by more than 10 per cent, and when the road warrants it, I travel below the speed limit, because there are some roads where the limit is actually too high.  Though there are a lot more roads where the limit is set too low, because the residents have enough political pull to discourage thru traffic by setting the limit at 25 when the natural limit is 40. So -- I'm glad I bought it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26LOUO5PWLI97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000246USU#wasThisHelpful","R26LOUO5PWLI97","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a computer with a full size keyboard and a nice big screen that could be moved easily between different rooms unlike a full desktop.  I find that laptops are fine for traveling but really uncomfortable with poor ergonomics  for sitting at for long stretches of time, while this machine is as comfortable as a regular desktop because of the full keyboard and regular mouse that can be separated and placed wherever you want.Also I wanted a computer with a touch monitor small children can use. The touch monitor is excellent, and Windows 8 is especially designed to use touch technology.Also I wanted a reliable machine, and have over the years come to trust the Dell brand more than any other personal computer maker, because they use good components and  are well engineered with designs that do not get too close to the edge and have excellent documentation on the Dell website.  My first Dell, an XPS 1000, was bought in year 2000, and is still working.  And I have not had any hardware trouble with the five other Dells I have used in four different locations, a GX280, an Optiplex 745, Optiplex 755, Optiplex 7010, and a Latitude 830 laptop.

"A full size love doll including head, arms, legs and torso is an entirely different experience than a vaginal sleeve or a doggie style ass.  I find it so very different to have a face with eyes to look into.  If the doll occupies the same space as would a human partner, has the same contours as a human, has hair that gets in my face sometimes, has a reasonably nice skin, and the doll has been warmed by my body, I find the feeling is remarkably good.Viewed at a distance, Jamie Lynn does not have the realism of a $6,000 RealDoll, but she is surprisingly real where it counts, which is how she looks and feels when she is being held close to you, face to face.When you are up close, you do not see the gaping mouth (which is very good for oral sex and french kissing).  Instead you see her eyes, and you feel her remarkably real forehead, and her hair, even though there is hair only on the front part of her head, and you feel her breasts, which are formed of a semi rigid rubber-like material, and which are close enough to real to feel good.  Also, a RealDoll weighs at least 70 pounds, and unless you are in really great shape, is rather a hassle to move.  Jamie Lynn, on the other hand  is almost weightless, which might sound unreal, except that when a real woman lies atop a man, she can support herself so he does not bear her full weight.  Also, one can simulate the weight of a body by hugging.Jamie Lynn is suited for missionary position on  top. Do not try lying on top of her because she will develop a fatal leak very quickly, and do not overinflate.  To inflate and deflate her more efficiently, I purchased an electric air pump for $13.I am giving Jamie Lynn five stars not because the doll is perfect, but because she convinced me that love dolls can be very pleasurable, and because her mouth is very good at oral sex, and unlike her body, is very durable, and gives better oral sex than the $150 âPipedream F*** my Faceâ, which is much more realistic to look at, but less good where it counts.I have since graduated to a much more durable product, a 5 foot 4 inch tall, fabric covered TeddyBabe love doll called Sabrina, who weighs fifteen pounds, has a soft velour skin and is very rugged and nice to hold and caress.  With a first class vaginal insert (see my review of Tomax Lilith Uterus on Amazon) she has given me great pleasure for hundreds of encounters, though I had to modify her using methods described in my review of the Tomax Lilith Uterus.  However she is quite pricey.If you want a really good view of the love doll market, from $100 to $10,000, visit the www dollforum com website, as Amazon right now is only selling products on the lower end of the sex doll market.In any event, the Jamie Lynn product that I am discussing here is, IMHO,  worth acquiring just to find out whether you enjoy a love doll, and for her wickedly good mouth. (Caution: Three of the four Topco inflatables I bought from Amazon have excellent mouths that fit my 1.25â diameter member; the fourth, a Jamie Lynn, second purchase, had a smaller mouth that was too small for me.  To be on the safe side, stick with Carmen Luvana, who is very much like Jamie Lynn except for coloring of hair and eyes.  If anyone encounters too small a mouth, please tell Topco, and also tell me through a comment).P.S.  The Jamie Lynn that I received was 60"" tall.  Another reviewer reported receiving a 54â doll.  If the doll does not conform to the stated size, I would hope Topco would give a refund.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ASJAI97F5J3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W44U28#wasThisHelpful","R2ASJAI97F5J3F","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On March 4th 2015 I had my six upper front teeth pulled and a full denture installed, one that relies only on suction, with no anchoring teeth or anchoring posts.  This was my first denture so I am a denture newbie.(NOTE: About 8 weeks before my six upper front teeth were removed, I had my eight upper rear teeth extracted, leaving a coverup of six front teeth.  This maneuver means that I always had front teeth in the mouth, sometimes real, and sometimes fake, so that I never appeared to be embarrassingly toothless.  It is quite remarkable, but six front teeth is enough to convince others you have a full set of choppers.)For about a week the denture stayed in place without any adhesive.Then it began to get loose and to fall out uncontrollably, I tried Fixodent Denture Adhesive Cream claiming ""Strong, All Day Hold, Food Seal, Comfort"".  It worked well for about a week and then started to be less and less effective, and had the strong disadvantage of leaving a lot of scummy feeling residue on the roof of my mouth, that took quite a little while to remove with paper towels and toothbrush.Then I tried Super Poligrip with ooze-control tip, claiming ""Super strong, all-day hold"".  Results were very similar to Fixodent except that it wasn't effective from day 1.Then on March 23 I saw my dentist, 19 days after the fake teeth were put in place, and told him of my problems with the denture being unstable and falling out.  He recommended the Sea-bond product.  Additionally he said that some patients combine the Sea-bond wafers with denture adhesive cream like Fixodent or Poligrip.I followed his advice and purchased the Sea-bond immediately. What an improvement !!  I bought it from Walgreen for $9.99 for 30, so 33 cents each, which is 50 per cent more than the price from this vendor, $20.32 for 90 wafers, which comes to about 23 cents per copy, or $84 per year.Yet despite the improved adhesion, I am not finding the denture painful to remove, though maybe this is because I did not start using it until 19 days after the front teeth were removed, so the gums had more time to heal. (At first removing the denture was a pretty ouchie experience, but now it does not hurt at all.)A few hints to denture newbies:==  Before any teeth are removed, change your diet to an all liquid diet.  Before my rear molars were extracted I started on a 100 per cent liquid diet, which in my case has been absolutely wonderfully better than my previous solid food diet in terms of energy and weight, because I chose carefully what I would be having, which was about 50 per cent Soylent and 50 per cent high nutrition soups made out of fish and kale and other good stuff and blended until silky smooth in a strong blender (I purchased a Blendtec after considering VItamix and Ninja).This meant I did not make my gums sore trying to eat solid food. Also my weight declined from about 195 to about 180, and has remained there.  My dentist tells me that my gums have healed beautifully, and thinks that the pure liquid diet has helped a lot.== Try to manipulate the wafer inside the denture shell so it covers as much area as possible, especially the front vertical section; it takes quite a bit of maneuvering the wet wafer to make it conform to the front vertical section, but I find it makes a huge difference in terms of stability;== Cut as little as possible from the wafer;  I have quite a small head and a small mouth for a male, but I've found it beneficial not to cut the wafer at all, and instead to make sure I cover every bit of the denture surface, even with a little overlap beyond the denture edge.== The instructions on the package say ""moisten"" the wafer and do not saturate. I started out gently moistening. Now I am moistening a lot more heavily, and finding better results in terms of adhesion.== Under pressure from my better half, I have been very slowly learning to consume little bits of solid food, so as to vary my diet a bit more.  I have found it helps tremendously to cut food into little itty bits.  Take too large of a piece and it's likely to dislodge the denture.So... to sum up... I find the Sea-bond superior to the other two products I've tried.  Someone tells me that powdered adhesives plus Sea Bond work well for them, but I have not tried this so far. It's early days yet. Hopefully the re-line of my denture in about 5 months time will create perfect suction and I won't have to use any kind of adhesive. (The re-line improves the fit of the denture to the gums).  But in the meantime, Sea-bond is doing a pretty good job.UPDATE: October 6 2015For the past weeks the Sea-bond has been less and less effective and my choppers have been loose much of the time.  A friend told me a very good remedy. Namely, apply two layers of powdered dental adhesive, one layer to the denture (that should be moistened), then lay the Sea-Bond patch on the powdered denture, then apply a second layer of powder, on top of the Sea-Bond patch (that should also be moistened.  Then stick it in the mouth.  It works !!!!!  Right now I'm using Fixodent Extra Hold Powder.  Makes the teeth feel cemented in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YI9PZASQVA8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AI8Q90#wasThisHelpful","R1YI9PZASQVA8X","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've spent quite a long time looking for a camera bag with two very important features:  first, and absolutely crucial, I wanted a bag that opens  by rapid release clasp, so I can get to the camera real quick and not have to diddle around with zips; second, I wanted a compact and good looking bag with good fit to my Panasonic Lumix FZ1000 camera.  This bag fills all these requirements.My Lumix FZ1000 is an intermediate size.  Sitting on its base, it has a footprint of 5.5"" wide, 7"" long from back of camera to front of lens hood, and 4"" high.  This bag gives a close to perfect fit, but is about an inch longer, so it could accommodate a camera up to 8 inches long from front to back.This bag opens and closes using  a sturdy rapid release single  clasp, that lets you get the camera out much faster than bags using zippers.  In addition to the clasp there is a zipper to close the bag, for extra security.  But the clasp is pretty strong and I cannot imagine it opening accidentally, so I do not bother to use the zip.It has zippered pockets at both ends to hold battery and small items, and a zippered front pouch, about 3 inches by 6 inches.The padding is good enough for my purposes; it will not protect from a major blow, but it will protect from minor impacts; if it were any thicker it would make the bag fatter and less compact;The build quality is excellent -- it does not look or feel cheap.There are two carrying modes:  [a]  a handgrip and [b] a shoulder strap that is adjustable from quite short to quite long, long enough to put the bag over your shoulder while the bag hangs on the opposite side of your body.Note to manufacturer:While this is a really excellent bag, there are three improvements I would like to see. First, add a stretchy net to the back of the bag, could be up to 4 inches by 8 inches. This would be useful for carrying a camera manual.  Second, add stretch nets to both end pockets, useful for doodads.  Third, enlarge the front zippered pocket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHF3NK2C17CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B06EON2#wasThisHelpful","R2RHF3NK2C17CV","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This camera comes with a detachable lens hood and the manual recommends the hood be installed. The cord of this lens cap is exactly the right length when the lens hood is removed.  The cord needs to be one or two inches longer to allow use of the lens cap when the lens hood is in place.  It would be a real hassle for me to locate a replacement cord since these cords are of a high quality material that is both quite thin and very durable.

"This is a popular item with many stellar reviews and an average of 4.4 stars.However, I bought it to replace a wall mounted DustBuster, and was less than pleased when I unpacked this product and found that it cannot be wall mounted, that its only possible position is standing upright, standing a hefty18 inches high and occupying a fairly ample  footprint.  It is very handsome in a bulky sort of way, but unfortunately our kitchen is crowded and there is no unused counter space, and the wall beside the microwave is the only feasible place to put a hand vac.All of the many other Dustbusters that I have seen are wall mounted.  Scrutinizing the ad on Amazon, I find that buried way down on the page there is a teeny weeny photo showing the item sitting on a base, and not wall mounted.  But there is no explicit statement âcannot be wall mountedâ.When I buy a car I expect a spare tire, without having to find explicit mention in the advertising.  Similarly when I buy a Dustbuster, a product that in my experience always came with a wall mount, I expect to find a wall mount, unless the advertising clearly states âno wall mountâThe Black & Decker CHV1510 Dustbuster does have a wall mount,  and I have ordered one, and am returning this product.NOTE TO VENDOR:  Please, please, prominently advertise that this is not wall mounted.

"First of all,  let me state how much I love my Blendtec Classic 570, a relatively low end Blendtec, $299.99 at Costco.  Just now I made a fruit smoothie deluxe comprising: 16 ounces Kirkland nutrition drink;  3 cups of ice; 3 bananas; half a cup of blackberries; a cup of strawberries; a 10 oz can of apricots. That's about two quarts of ingredients put into the three quart Blendtec WildSide jar. I hit the ""lo"" button and let it spin for about 30 seconds. Lo and behold !  A gorgeous 64 ounce fruit smoothie.  My dear 10 year old Black & Decker could not do anything like this, with its 1.5 quart (48 oz) container, and its peenie weenie little motor, which would be emitting burning smells after this kind of stress. Plus. I love the Blendtec for its nice blunt blade that I can't cut myself on, unlike Vitamix and unlike the Ninja products.  And love the design of the top of the jar, that efficiently evacuates air pressure build up, so that the top does not pop off spewing ingredients all over the kitchen, and, also,  gives plenty of warning of potential overflow, because it has a highly visible reservoir on top that will flood before the jar begins to leak its contents onto the countertop, giving the user plenty of time to stop the Blendtec before it makes a mess.Second, however, I wish to castigate the Blendtec corporation for a critical defect in their product.Blendtec claims their product is easy to clean.  Hah !! My dear 10 year old Black & Decker is much much better in this regard, because you can take it apart completely, and submerge it in warm soapy water, and scrub every single surface until they are all squeaky clean. The Blendtec WildSide jar, on the other hand, cannot be taken apart completely, and, according to the manufacturer, should not be submerged because it will damage the bottom side of the seal.  Please, Blendtec Corporation, redesign this so that the rotor assembly can be removed, and like my dear old Black and Decker, can be submerged for washing.I guess I can get the blendtec mixing jar clean enough to avoid food poisoning.  But it is very difficult to get it anywhere near as squeaky clean as my dear old B&D, with not a speck of soap residue, as clear as a well cleaned window.  I know, the jug is made of plastic.  But in these days where universities have Materials Science departments, surely Blendtec can find a coating that will simulate the beautiful cleaning properties of glass.  And, probably much easier and cheaper, redesign the rotor and seal assembly so it can be routinely removed for cleaning, and submerged in water.One other defect. I do not like the design of the buttons on the control panel, which allow liquids to seep in between button and panel. Now most likely there is waterproofing there, but it just makes me very uneasy, as electricity and water can together deliver nasty electric shocks.I do not know how easy Vitamix jars are to clean.  I rejected Vitamix because the blade is sharp and I just know I would lacerate my hand in one of my klutzier moments. For the same reason, I rejected the much cheaper Ninja, which most likely is much less durable than either Blendtec or Vitamix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7U4UB8CCV6MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSDOGMO#wasThisHelpful","R7U4UB8CCV6MA","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this Syba device because I wanted to install an IDE DVD burner onto a Windows 7 computer, a Dell Optiplex 745. which has only SATA ports on the motherboard.  After several hours trying to make it work, I gave up, sadder, but no wiser.The DVD burner was working perfectly well on a Windows XP computer with IDE connectors on the motherboard, so it it is not the fault of the  drive.  And I tried several different working DVD burner drives, including a Sony, a Pioneer and a  Plextor.After several hours of trying to connect the DVD burner to the Dell Optiplex 745,  I concluded I had tried every possible angle, and that quite possibly the Syba device is a dud that had not been properly tested.  Or maybe it is just incompatible with the Dell 745 Optiplex.Here is what I should have done at first, but did not do, because the user manual is carelessly written:[1]  Use the orange SATA cable supplied with the Syba device to connect the SATA1 port on the computer motherboard to the black SATA port on the Syba (the Syba also has an orange SATA port, to be used if you have the female Syba IDE connector plugged onto an IDE male on the computer motherboard).[2]  Plug a full size 4 pin Molex power connector to the DVD drive power point.  The user manual fails to make this clear !!!  Indeed, the manual tells the user to connect the computer power supply to a 4 pin mini-Molex power port located on the Syba device, which makes no sense whatever, because the Syba device's only connection with the DVD drive is through its 40 pin parallel port, and the parallel wires do not carry any power.[3]  Turn on the computer and go straight to BIOS.  Set the SATA1 port to active and look to see whether the DVD drive has been recognized.  I tried numerous times, and sadly, it was never recognized.  If the computer BIOS does not provide this functionality, you would have to start the computer and then test whether the drive is recognized.This should work.  But it did not work for me.  The manual that comes with the Syba device implies the DVD drive  jumper settings can be any value, either Cable Select, or Master, or Slave.  I tried all three and none worked.CONCLUSIONFrom the 230 or so reviews done so far, I gather that the Syba device has worked for many people.  It is inexpensive, so I think it is worth trying.  In my own case I had a good reason for trying, because I have an old Plextor 760A DVD burner that came bundled with a super duper early version of Roxio burning software, that can only be installed if the Plextor is present, and is  much easier to use than Nero or any other DVD burner software that I have yet encountered.If anyone reading this has any ideas on anything else I might try, I'd appreciate hearing from them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9FWPBWB3LQPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OEBO6E#wasThisHelpful","R9FWPBWB3LQPE","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item has a sleek minimalist design and is solidly made of good materials. The design includes a high quality clear perspex type plastic square 3/8"" thick and about 8 inches by 8 inches, that looks tough and durable,  sandwiched between two stainless steel plates, very important in localities with hard water, where stainless steel offers good resistance to corrosion.On the surface of the shower head, there is an impressive array of 88 soft plastic nozzles which form a square pattern of about 5 inches by 5 inches and a diagonal of 7 inches. I think these nozzles will do a good job dealing with hard water and will not corrode.The water stream remains about the same dispersion  throughout its journey to the floor of the bath, and is about 5"" x 5"" at waist height rather than widening. The flow is relatively gentle. I could not find anywhere a statistic on gallons per minute.My wife likes it very much.Personally, I prefer the more vigorous and torrential feeling provided by our Moen Vitalizer 7 inch chrome model that we had in place in the master bathroom before replacing it with this item.  The Moen's 73 nozzles provide a wider dispersion of water, to about 9 inches at waist height. The Moen ad is explicit about water flow and advertises a maximum flow of 2.5 gallons per minute (our water company provides a water pressure with maximum flow about 6gpm). The Moen is clunky looking and much less attractive than the AquaFlow.I note that the vendor asked me to review this item and provided me with a free sample with the agreement I would provide an honest and unbiased review.  My assessment is that the AquaFlow is handsome and provides a nice gentle shower with a concentrated stream of water.My wife likes the AquaFlow, but I prefer the Moen, which costs a bit more ($44 on Amazon) and seems to throw the water at a higher speed, but is chromium plated rather than stainless steel. Chromium has the disadvantage of being more prone to deterioration and needing to be polished frequently, while stainless steel needs almost no maintenance. I am awarding the AquaFlow 4 stars, my wife gives it 5.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:== On the copy I got, the balljoint was too loose and I could not adjust the angle of the head --- instead the shower head just flopped so the bottom edge rested on the wall of the shower.  Suggestion to manufacturer: one inexpensive modification to prevent a floppy ball joint is to introduce a thumbscrew that the user can tighten to prevent the shower head from flopping around.== The nut on the AquaFlow that attaches to the water supply pipe needs a larger flat section to allow use of a smooth jaw wrench. Also it would be helpful to emulate Ikea and supply an inexpensive wrench.== I totally agree with the reviewer who stated that installation has to involve tools, in  order to sufficiently tighten the joint between shower head and the water supply pipe.  To tighten the joint I first tried using a smooth jaw wrench, to avoid marring the finish, but this did not work.  I wound up using pliers with teeth, but since the affected area is out of sight, it did not bother me one tiny little bit to mar the surface a little.  In actual fact, when I examined the affected area, there were only faint marks, that certainly would not be noticed by anyone.== By the way, I did not bother using the plumber's teflon tape, since there had already been a shower head installed on that pipe, which provided enough sealant. There has not been any leak.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRBAOVSCR38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA4MO7K#wasThisHelpful","RWRBAOVSCR38","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE JULY 5 2015The FZ200 is a great cam but after owning an FZ1000 for several months I must say the FZ1000 is better because of its large and  bright  viewfinder that makes it easier to see what you are taking and that makes it much much  easier to take pictures outdoors. With your eye to  the viewfinder and the other eye closed there are no distractions because nothing else is visible except the image and the indicators like F stop and shutter speed and ISO, which are all much clearer than on the flipout monitor.  With my eye to the viewfinder I find I can manipulate the knobs much better and in my experience have better access to the menus because I can see them better.  So... if you can afford to spend about $300 more, the FZ1000 would IMHO be a better choice, because of its superlative viewfinder.EARLIER TEXT FEBRUARY 2015[1]  One of the things I like most about the FZ200 is its awesomely strong image stabilization, that allows me to take good hand held shots without a tripod under low light and at long telephoto ranges.I have taken photos of Verrazano Bridge from 14 miles away, from Laurence Harbor Beach in New Jersey.  Image 1 at the end of this review shows the bridge using a telephoto setting of 960mm  and reveals remarkably little camera shake, though the photo is rather hazy because of humidity and shimmer.  I have taken the same scene with a tripod  ... and noticed very little reduction in blur.Also I have taken indoor pictures at night-time of friends and family under normal living room and dining room artificial light, with no bright lights and no flash, and have gotten super images with good reproduction of colors, at incredibly low shutter speeds like one eighth of a second, because of the profoundly good image stabilization.  A discovery that totally surprised me is that when people are seated in a social situation, they tend to remain still, except when speaking or eating, so that low shutter speeds very often give good photos.Image 2 at the end of this review shows a map of South America.  The pic was taken indoors at 600mm in fully automatic mode without a tripod.  The camera selected an incredibly low shutter speed of 1/15 of a second, and an ISO value of 400.  The picture was taken under artificial light provided by a shaded 23 watt CFL light bulb. This is given as another example of the FZ200's enormously powerful image stabilization.  The pic also shows excellent color balance and comes very close to reproducing the true colors of the subject.[2.1]  A second thing I like about this cam is its performance in fully automatic mode. After taking many many images, I have concluded that 9 out of 10 times, fully automatic mode gives better settings than I can achieve under semi-automatic or manual.It is crucial to realize that in fully automatic mode this is a WYSIWYG camera.  What you see on the LCD is almost exactly what the image will look like if you take a picture.  For someone who used a 35mm film camera, this is magical. In the old days you took pix at various settings and had to wait many hours or days before seeing the results.  With this wee beastie,  you actually get to preview the final picture, exactly the way it will look, before you take it.  And this means you can keep fooling around and  repositioning the camera until you get the best possible (or least bad) image.A camera that takes great photographs in automatic mode is a great camera because  it means you can concentrate on the substance of the picture, rather than being distracted by the need to set the camera controls to the right setting, which consumes time, and often means that you miss a lot of good shots, because one is too busy fiddling with the cam.[2.2] I keep running across reviews by people living in the past with a 35mm mindset, like:  ""One needs a tripod"";  ""Automatic mode is strictly for amateurs who don't know better"";  ""One needs flash to fill in shadows.""I think this is totally nuts.  This is a 21st century electronic camera that amplifies light so it sees better than the human eye, designed by a collaboration of engineers from Leica and Panasonic, and most of the time, when set in automatic mode, will take something very close to the best possible image, that seldom needs a tripod, that almost never benefits from using flash.There are some important exceptions where semi-automatic is better than fully automatic, and it is useful to know the manual controls well enough to deal with such situations.  When faced with  rapidly moving subjects under low light, I find it necessary to use shutter priority mode in order to select higher shutter speed and higher ISO than the FZ200 will choose in full auto mode.  But I am still letting the FZ automatically control the other settings.But in general I get excellent pictures by starting out in automatic mode, and accepting it if the picture looks properly exposed, and only trying manual when I'm not happy with the automatic mode picture.What this camera does - the beautiful thing it does - is let me grab a properly exposed shot of a far away object before it goes away.  The bird is on a twig 50 feet away, with its head cocked at an appealing angle, and one wants to get the shot before it flies away, and one zooms in to frame the bird just right, and one clicks, all in a few seconds.  And voila, a really good pic.[3] As noted in other reviews, and super important to me, this camera calculates focus and exposure very very rapidly, so there is only a tiny time lag between pointing the camera and shooting the image, much much faster than my beloved Canon pocket camera.  Also, it will very rapidly take multiple images.[4]  I have not used the competition to this camera, namely the similarly priced superzooms by Nikon and Canon and Sony and Fuji.  So I cannot say this is superior to any of those.  What I can say is that I find myself taking amazingly good pictures with this camera under low light conditions, and at very long range telephoto.[5] If you buy this camera, I would strenuously recommend that you also buy Graham Houghton's ""Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 - User's Manual"".  I bought the hard copy for $35, but you can download a copy for free if your conscience will allow, or you can do the right thing and pay $5 for the download.  Also check out Graham's stuff on U-Tube, and his website at www.grahamhoughton.com(The user manual that comes with the camera contains useful information and is worth reading but is not very user friendly, and Graham's book explains things much better).[6]  Some reviewers put huge emphasis on very high resolution and very low ""noise"" in pictures, and quite rightly point out that the FZ-200 is not the best of the best in these regards.  If high res and low noise is very important to you, you might think of looking at cams priced at $800 and higher, such as the Sony RX10 and the Lumix FZ1000.  Personally, I find the FZ200's picture quality pretty damn flawless for 5x7 and 8x10 photos, though at higher sizes I would expect to see minor weaknesses./-----------P.S. I do own a tripod, a great big Star made in Taiwan, that weighs nine pounds and whose maximum elevation is 78 inches.  In the old days it was used for image stabilization with my 35mm film cameras.  I occasionally find it very useful these days when I have a static object and am willing to spend serious amounts of time pondering the best angle and the best light and where the tripod is very useful in helping me to be more systematic and more thoughtful.  But 99 per cent of the time with this camera I have no need for a tripod.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QNANAXIEDQIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MB6ZX0#wasThisHelpful","R2QNANAXIEDQIE","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I initially gave this item 2 stars because it had real low download speeds on my brand new quite fast Dell 7010 quadcore running Win 7 Pro, speeds like 7Mbps when my three other machines were getting 14Mbps.But when I removed it from the 7010 and put it in an 8 year old laptop running WinXP, all of a sudden downloads jumped to 16Mbps.So there seems to be a problem with the 7010.So I am changing rating from two stars to four stars.  I do not think this item deserves more than four, as it does not download any faster than my MediaLink MWN-USB150N, that claims a 150Mbps download speed. Also, the Panda's media interface is much skimpier and less informative than the MediaLink's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1731J96HWA0OA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQT0YK2#wasThisHelpful","R1731J96HWA0OA","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS == By far the most important thing that makes me like this camera  is the viewfinder, with a large and bright display that provides WYSYWIG when in automatic mode (i.e. what you see is what you get).  It is a gianl improvement over LCD monitors, both flip-out and on the back of the camera,  for several reasons:First and foremost, I can see with significantly greater clarity through the viewfinder than on an LCD monitor.  And... very very crucial ....  photography is all about seeing.Second, I find that when I use the viewfinder, the camera is easier to control, because when it is pressed up against my face, my  fingers are much closer to the camera than when I am using an LCD monitor.  Unlike with an LCD monitor, my fingers are in a constant orientation with respect to the camera, which helps me to better access the controls without having to look at them.Third, I find it easier and faster to navigate menus and to change settings like F-stop and ISO and shutter speed when the camera is pressed against my face.Fourth, very very important, it's easier to take photos outdoors with your eye pressed against the viewfinder excluding extraneous light than it is with an LCD monitor,  especially under bright sun..Before closing my comments about the viewfinder versus the flip out LCD monitor, I should note that  the flip out on the FZ1000 is nice and flexible -- and remains very useful under certain circumstances --  if you want to shoot from low down in a situation where you don't want to bend, or high up if you are in a crowd or need to see over some other obstacle.  But most of the time these days  I find myself shooting from the viewfinder, because I can see so much better..== Excellent performance in indoor photographyI originally got this cam because I wanted to take pictures indoors under normal levels of artificial light with ultra rapid focus and exposure control.  By ""normal levels of artificial light"" I mean no light coming in from windows, no special artificial lighting, and no flash.  Just the amount of light you would get in a normally lit windowless office or in a living room at night time or in a furniture showroom.This cam is very good at doing this when it is in automatic mode, yielding amazingly good hand held pix in poor light,  at incredibly low shutter speeds like a quarter of a second, without a tripod, because of superlatively strong image stabilization, and this happens even at substantial zooms like 200mm.  Any camera without image stabilization would be showing huge amounts of blur and shake.  And I should add that color balance in low artificial light is good, when in automatic mode.With candid pictures of people under normal living room lighting at night time, the FZ1000 usually  does surprisingly well in automatic mode.  I was enormously surprised to find that with exposure of one quarter second, most pictures of most people come out quite well, because with most people, there is much less movement than I expected to find - except when the person is speaking or eating.As might be expected, under low light the FZ1000 in automatic mode does not do well in capturing rapidly moving people or other objects. But setting a high shutter speed and a high ISO value this camera copes quite well.  It's true that high ISO's make photos more grainy, but in pictures of people it's the expression that counts, IMHO.In this regard, shooting in low light, the FZ1000 and FZ200 are about equivalent.==  Crisp controls that are not mushy or muddy.== The camera is the result of a collaboration between Leica and Panasonic, and has nearly identical hardware to a Leica V-Lux Type 114 that costs a lot more, though the software is different.== High capacity  zoom lens immensely improve the ability to take good pictures, because one can often get closeups of subjects that would be hard or impossible to get close to, and because one has much more flexibility in determining what to include and what to exclude from the picture. On the FZ1000 the 400mm optical zoom magnifies images to  eight times a normal 50mm lens and with digital zoom to 1600mm you can get 32 times normal magnification. Picture quality is excellent up to 400, and in my opinion remains quite good at 800mm when there's plenty of light.== Fast focusing and fast determination of exposure settings and almost zero shutter lag, which allows the capturing of fleeting events.==  In my opinion feels solid and well built.== Allows me to display live images on a Panasonic Viera TV set via HDMI cable.  I don't know whether it will do this on other TVs.  This is really helpful for portraits where you want the subject to be able to see their image on a TV screen so that they can adjust their expression.CONS== This camera is a bit of a power hog.  If you want to shoot a lot of footage Take several spare batteries with you . I think it gets worse when image stabilization is switched on.== In SCN mode there are far too many presets that differ only by tiny amounts.  And one very valuable preset that was in the FZ200 has been deleted, namely the ""Through glass"" preset, that improved images taken through glass windows.CONCLUSIONSThis camera is very flexible and takes excellent pictures in automatic mode in a huge variety of situations.  Some folks sneer about ""point and shoot"" automation,  but I really like a well designed automatic mode because it allows me to concentrate on the content of the picture rather than worrying about settings, and lets me grab shots that I would otherwise miss.  I think that about 9 times out of 10, automatic mode on this camera does a better job than I would do if I spent time fiddling in manual mode.P.S. I attach a  hand held photo of the moon taken with maximum extended zoom of 3200 mm, leaning against a car for the hand held shot.  This shot demonstrates the incredibly good image stabilization offered by the FZ1000. This image has had no postprocessing and is not cropped.  To achieve maximum zoom, I set Program mode, electronic zoom enabled, picture size of 5MB (and not the 20MB option).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MI5TSK3LG9NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOUIBZW#wasThisHelpful","R3MI5TSK3LG9NX","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These ""Lazy Glasses"" give a very wide angle view when I lie flat on my bed, with my head resting comfortably either on the mattress or on a pillow.  This allows me to see the television set and many other objects.  This is both  a strength and a weakness.  The strength is that you can see a whole lot of things while lying flat, because of the wide angle view.  The weakness is that all objects are smaller than they would be if viewed without the glasses.They are well made.  The packaging provides a nicely sized storage box.

"This is a very well designed calendar.  I'm retired and no longer keep a daily diary. This calendar has 8 lines per day, and is enough to record appointments and events for the three people in my home. I especially like the generous 11 line space at the bottom of the calendar to record phone numbers and other bits of info, which is 12 inches wide.Especially useful is the space for notes on the December page, where I can record appointments for next year, during any time in the current year. This is handy if, for example, I see a doctor in June 2014 and need to record an appointment in 2015, in a place where it will not get lost.In my kitchen I have a large hook on the wall that allows me to hang calendars for three previous years, which is useful if I need to look back over the past several years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4KPT216QFZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3AU5QI#wasThisHelpful","R1H4KPT216QFZT","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONS== One huge con, a dealbreaker for me, is that the controls of this radio are complex and require the user to read a manual.  Even then, I have to re-read the manual to remember what to do.  Also the controls are inconveniently placed.== On the top of the product there are 13 separate buttons. Ten of these are teeny tiny. This is too many tiny buttons.  Then there is a long narrow button whose label is the same color as the button, except it is embossed, and visible only when viewed from a certain angle.==The radio tuning buttons are placed on the back of the product and are hard to reach while tuning: the user has to be touching tuning controls on the back of the clock/radio while observing a tuning indicator on the front of the radio.==  Sony decided to achieve a small footprint by making the unit much taller than prior Sony clock radios that I have used, about twice as high.  However, the height makes the 13 controls located on the top deck hard to reach relative to the top of the night stand where the product is kept.  This is not ergonomic.PROS== One huge pro, compared with my prior Sony clock radio, is that reception is markedly better in the presence of CFL lighting and LED lighting.== There is digital radio tuning on this high end version (not the lower ones).  I really like this.== It has lots of bells and whistles including 5 types of nature sounds to wake up by, separate alarm times for self and for significant other, and  the ability to project the current time on a darkened ceiling.SUMMARYIf you want a simple clock radio that is a no-brainer to operate, do not buy this item.  If you don't mind reading a manual and learning to program the radio, and keeping the manual handy, this offers a lot of neat features.NOTE TO MANUFACTURERThis product has much worse controls than my prior Sony clock radio, model ICF-C218 ""Dream Machine"", where the alarm is set using two elegantly simple controls located close to each other on the top of the unit, so that changing the alarm time can be done very quickly. First you turn a dial to point to alarm setting mode. Second, you push a prominently located lever either to the left or right to make the alarm time go forward or backward, in an accelerating manner where the longer you hold the lever, the faster the time spins by.  On my old clock radio, the radio is tuned using a convenient wheel on the right side of the unit, together with a volume setting wheel located just beside it, a lot easier to find and manipulate .","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KCPIVXYIFTUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEYHMPK#wasThisHelpful","R1KCPIVXYIFTUG","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My spouse has strong opinions about pillows. During the last decade her job has taken her on the road maybe 10-30 days a year, to many destinations, and as a road warrior she encounters numerous hotels and numerous pillows, and has become somewhat of an expert. She is highly sensitive to pillow quality, and finds that a good pillow helps her sleep better.Her verdict is that these are grade A pillows.  She says:They are not too soft and not too firm. They deform just enough to conform with her head. They compress much less than a lot of pillows. They give sufficient support. They quickly rebound to their original shape.They are well made with good stitching and high quality fabric. There are a lot of cheaper pillows available, but she definitely prefers these. The pillows she has bought include Ralph Lauren, and she thinks these are better.I should add that this product was offered to me for free by the vendor, with the agreement that I provide an honest and unbiased review. My wife is much better qualified to review pillows than I am, so I decided to rely on her opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS0KIXIEAP1AP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OE6DDXC#wasThisHelpful","RS0KIXIEAP1AP","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fell in love with this product editing Thanksgiving dinner photos, for a dinner with 14 people.  I found two features really absolute winners. First, when I chose Adjust Photos tab, then chose Suggested Settings, the prog radically improved most pix.  Second, and most important, the lighting in the room was patchy, but within the Adjust Photos tab, there is an applet called Fill Light/Clarity  that within the most badly lit areas will increase brightness and reduce shadows, while leaving well lit areas alone, so that there is much more even illumination throughout the entire picture.

"I found the Kona French press to be very well made - the pressing function was smoother than others I've used - perhaps the quality of the mesh is finer or more flexible.  Also the plastic frame enclosing the glass provides more strength - others I've used do not have this support.  I used it to make coffee and found the quality of the coffee excellent - the press did its job well - no grounds escaped into the coffee, and the pressing action was very smooth against the glass.I especially wanted to try it with tea as well - because I thought that a French press could be applied very well to make good quality spiced tea.  I added my usual spices (a stick of cinnamon, some crushed cardamom seeds, a few cloves, sliced ginger and about three teaspoons of loose tea (given the size of the press).I really liked the result - the tea tasted very good - spices came through and balanced well with about 6-7 minutes allowed to brew before pressing.  And the big plus over using a regular teapot is that clean up is faster and the French press strains the tea as part of the way it works (no need for extra equipment - strainers etc).This product has the advantage of having an exceptionally small footprint  compared with a drip coffee maker. Definitely a plus for a  crowded kitchen.COMMENTS TO VENDORI would like to see markings on the side of the flask showing volume in fluid ounces and in metric, to aid in getting proportions right, but this would be hampered by the plastic cage surrounding the flask, but a good designer might find a way.  Maybe put the markings on a diagonal of the cage.Unlike my one cup French press, the flask of this product cannot be removed from its cage for cleaning (or, to be totally accurate, I tried to remove it, and did not succeed). Our other 4 cup coffee press has no cage at all. It has a bottom plastic stand, to provide a stable base, and no cage at all, and a top plastic assembly that is glued to the flask and provides a pouring handle and a bit of extra strength to the unit. Which makes the sides easy to clean.  Being a utilitarian, I prefer this kind of simplicity. But for the stylistas, the product being reviewed has much more pizazz, and I guess cleaning is not much of an issue.  And, more important, the plastic cage no doubt imparts greater strength and reduces the likelihood of breakage of the glass flask.  Might it be possible to surround a glass interior lining with a lexan shell that is unbreakable, allowing a cageless design ?The Amazon ad states a capacity of 34 fl oz.  Filled to the brim with water the flask contains a volume of 38 fluid ounces. However, in practical terms, given the fact that boiling water is a hazardous substance, I would not want to use more than about 28 oz of water. Which still would yield four 7.5 oz cups of black coffee.The product was supplied for free by the vendor with the understanding that I would provide an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA598T29BZBTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMJDJ5C#wasThisHelpful","RA598T29BZBTH","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I compared this headset with the one that came with my I-phone.PROS== A great big fat plus is that the product comes with 3 sizes of earpieces that cover the speakers,  which allows a better fit to my ear than the headset supplied with my I-phone, that has no sizing option.  In my experience, the earbuds felt more secure in my ears than the original Apple earbuds when I changed from the pre-installed medium size earpiece to the small size. Be careful when changing the earpieces or they may fly off and be hard to find.== The sound is definitely as good as the sound from the original I-phone headset.== Stylish design and well finished.== Nice case for cord storage.== Cord does not tangle as easily as the one supplied with the I--phone.== The product is an inexpensive replacement for the original I-phone earbuds if these are lost or damaged, or if you just want a spare pair, or if the original buds do not fit well.CONS== None yet.UNCERTAINTIESCannot judge durability as yet.  The headset supplied with the I-phone that my office gave me six months ago for work purposes are still working.  I have just now started using these buds.NOTESThis item was supplied to me for free by the vendor with the understanding that I would provide an honest and unbiased review.

"I have given this product a provisional 5 stars, because while I like it very much so far, I have used it only for a short time.  If my opinion changes I will revise this review and my rating.I switched to this product from Norton 360 (2013 version), not because I disliked Norton 360, but because Eset got a much higher rating by Consumer Reports than Norton Internet Security 2014, and cost about the same, on Amazon.  I always stay a year behind because I have the impression I get the same level of protection as buying the latest version. If any reader knows better, I would appreciate if they would correct me on this.I relied on Consumer Reports in making my purchasing decision because  end users such as I typically do not have the time or technical savvy to test and compare the different internet security packages, so that a Consumer Reports review in my opinion is of very high value, since they have strong resources to conduct proper testing,  and a strong reputation for objectivity.I deployed Norton Removal Tool to dismount Norton, and then installed Eset, on four workstations.  The installs were fast and easy with only a few options and questions.PROS:== When I looked at Consumer Reports online, I found ratings for 14 security software products, updated to September 2014.  Eset got the highest score, of 65. G Data Internet Security 2014 got 64, F-Secure Internet Security  2014 got 60, and all the other 11 products scored below 60.  Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 got 59,  McAfee Internet Security 2014 scored 52, and Norton Internet Security got 50, and Panda Internet Security scored 42.== One can download a 30 day free trial of this product, then license it if you want to keep it.== A great big fat pro in my book is that this product says it covers Windows 2000, XP, Win 7 and Win8.  Why do I like this ?  Because I have Win XP on 2 of my 4 workstations, and Win7 on the other two.  The fact that a reputable company like ESET will cover Windows XP is great news for me, because I know XP inside out, while I am a newcomer to Win7, which I installed only because of Microsoft's threatening behavior vis a vis XP, saying it would cease ""supporting"" XP in early 2014. I liked XP. It never let me down.  So I am delighted that ESET is supporting XP.  Actually, I also have a semi-retired workstation running Windows 2000, because Win2000 supports some software I wrote using Visual Basic Version 6, but I almost never go online with that machine.== Eset does not slow down my computers, but on the other hand I don't notice any significant improvement over Norton 360. But I should also note that I am running very fast quadcore desktops that rarely slow down for any reason, except when online and encountering slow websites or bad scripts.CONS:== Lacks some of the bells and whistles that my Norton 360 had, like computer tuneups and backups, and password vaults.== Eset wrongly identified a piece of Firefox loader software as a potential threat.  I got on the Firefox user forum and reported the identification.  Several Firefox MVP's scoffed at this and said the Eset database clearly is not totally up to date, and is flagging the Firefox stub as a threat purely because it is not yet in the Eset database of safe software.  So... even Eset is not perfect. In any event, Eset flagged about 15 pieces of software as potential threats, a lot of them freeware that carried dubious companion adware or unwanted toolbars.Most users of Eset will not encounter this, as most Windows users have learned to avoid freeware, since ""free"" usually means there is a catch, like adware.  I, on the other hand, am somewhat adventurous, downloading all kinds of interesting freeware, which cost me dear in the old days, with several serious virus attacks, the last time being in about 2008.  But recently I have not had any apparent malware attacks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNXF9MB48YSKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZKO82W#wasThisHelpful","RNXF9MB48YSKT","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The volume button on the remote control to my Onkyo home entertainment receiver has become intermittent, requiring heavy pressure, and sometimes not working at all. Today I fixed it by dribbling a drop of Stabilant around the button and rocking the button back and forth.

"I got this from Target for $18.On the plus side, this item is beautifully built, stainless steel, highly polished.On the minus side:== It is hard to get all the food out of the jar.  When I filled it with chili, and tried to eat it with a spoon, there were areas of the jar that the spoon could not reach efficiently.== A very major defect is that the mouth is narrower than the base. You will note that eating bowls never have mouths narrower than their bases.

They do not show the jars with the lids off. They do not show what kind of threading is used.

"From the photo in the ad, I expected a water receptacle that was round and wide. Instead, the box contained a receptacle with a very narrow footprint, 1.5"" wide by 7.5"" long.This design is obviously appropriate for collecting rain droplets, that fall fairly randomly.But I suspect it is inappropriate for collecting water droplets distributed by a water sprinkler of the type that I have, which is likely to contain strong biases in the pattern of water distribution.  My [ASIN:B000TZ716M MELNOR Turbo Oscillating Sprinkler] squirts water through 18 nozzles located on a rotating bar using an aiming process that traverses the nozzles up and down like the guns of a battleship elevating and descending.  If there were no wind, the droplets would fall on narrow tracks, with wide spaces between the tracks. So the distribution of droplets is uneven and not random.For these reasons, I need a collector with a larger surface area than this one.One could check the accuracy of a small footprint rain gauge like this through comparing it with a large footprint item like a 5 foot diameter wading pool.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRW5VMOLEQEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004APARCW#wasThisHelpful","RMRW5VMOLEQEL","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently we remodeled a bathroom, with nice fixtures and nice tiles.  I was dissatisfied with the light cast by the floodlight located in the recessed can above the wash basin.  After trying four different floodlight bulbs, I came to the following conclusions.[1]  Dispersion angle of the light beam is very importantIn my opinion, my bathroom looks much better when the beam dispersion angle of the floodlight leaves the walls above waist level in relatively low light, and the wall sections below waist level in a relatively bright light. In the case of my bathroom, I found that the ideal beam angle to achieve this would be about 70 degrees (see Footnote 2 for the method to calculate beam angle).The beam angles of the lights I tried are as follows:== Polaroid (the light reviewed here):  About 65 degrees by my calculation== Bioluz LED Br40 Smooth 17w 2700k 1400 Lumens --  110 degree angle, manufacturer's calculation.== Philips model 429035, 3000K, 1200 lumens  .  25 degree angle stated in Amazon ad== G7  Power Vegas BR40  .  180 degree beam angle.Unfortunately, many manufacturers neglect to state beam angle.[2] LumensI found that between 1200 and 1600 lumens gave pretty bright light.[3] Kelvin color temperatureLight with Kelvin color temperatures between 2,700K and 3,000K is considered to be ""warm"".  Warm is more flattering to humans, and more pleasant.  I found that temps between 2700K and 3000K worked well for me. Quite possibly a bit higher up to 4000K would also work. See Wikipedia for discussion.[4] The recessed overhead light does not properly illuminate the face of someone using the bathroom mirror.  To accomplish this, we installed an actor's style array of lights around the edges of the mirror./------------------------------------------------------------------FOOTNOTE 1: PROS AND CONS OF POLAROID FLOODLIGHTPROS:(a) it is bright with 1600 lumens ;(b) has a beam dispersion angle that is better for my purposes of illuminating my 5' x 8' bathroom(c) has the best guarantee I have seen, 15 years;(d) very important for my purposes, it has ventilation slots surrounding the light source, so that the exhaust fan which is part of the light fixture can draw more air out of the room (none of the other three bulbs I tested had this type of ventilation slot);(e) it is rated as suitable for damp locations, which is exactly where the lamp will be located, in a recess in my bathroom ceiling.CONSNone that I have yet identified./-------------------------------------FOOTNOTE 2:  If you want the brightest part of the beam to cover the wall below waist height (about 30""), do the following measurements to find the correct beam angle: [a] Measure the distance between ceiling and waist height, and call it D1. So with a ceiling 96"" from the floor, D1 will be 96""-30"" or 66"" (I assume a waist height of 30""). [b] Then measure the distance between the center of the light and the furthest wall, and call it D2.  [c] Then construct on graph paper a right angle triangle where D1 is the perpendicular side, and D2 is the side horizontal to the ground.  Then use a protractor to measure the angle at the top vertex of the triangle. And multiply that angle by two.  If you remember your trigonometry, you can do it that way too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZQLPCH6RO6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HF7KVO6#wasThisHelpful","R3PZQLPCH6RO6R","A300O9HLPSZNVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A300O9HLPSZNVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edits at the end below:I loved this phone at first and wanted to use it several months before writing a review.  You can read all the technical specifications in the great reviews written by other Amazon Customers.  For $99 at the initial Amazon Price, I was giddy when the package arrived.  I paraded this in the faces of my iPhone-loving fan people.  After all, the package had a working unlocked phone, a screen saver, headphones, a case and a charger - all for under $100.  But wait, there's more!  There are two sim slots and an expandable memory slot.  Too good to be true, BLU?Verdict: Yes (see below).After four+ months of using this several times a week as a secondary phone, the microphone works intermittently and cuts-out in the middle of conversations.  Moreover, sound volume levels are low compared to other phones (please see other reviews with this issue).  I've constantly had to move apps. to the storage card due to space constraints.Problem: some apps. will not move to a storage card; therefore, if you have a lot of these, you will run-out of storage space quickly.  The concept of a cheap unlocked phone with the bundled goodies is good, but due to all the issues, I sadly can't recommend this product due to poor execution. I'd like to see more storage space and a better microphone in future BLU phone iterations.  I would consider purchasing an upgraded version (even if the price is slightly higher) to give a US-based company a second chance.Oh, many months ago a the Lollipop operating system upgrade was promised.  Google just released Marshmallow.  This phone doesn't have Lollipop as it still runs KitKat which is ancient by now.  What's up with this?  Blu - too good to be true.Edit: It's now November 21st and Lollipop is still not available for this phone.  I'm troubled by this.  If a company can't keep promises, why purchase?

"This is NOT CNET's pick as depicted on October 24, 2015.  HooToo seems to be misleading potential customers which I find to be less than ethical and makes me question the company's trustworthiness.One CNET columnist mentioned this router and an associated Amazon coupon code.  He didn't review the router; rather, he mentioned other customer reviews on Amazon.  I've read through the reviews and some seem to be paid - consisting of one word like ""excellent"" or ""perfect"" or one sentence like ""this is the best ever.""  Some reviews are written by reviewers who have one or two reviews published with one word and a five star rating.  I wish Amazon would fix this since so many of us rely on customer ratings before making a purchase.I've had this product for a few months and it works, but doesn't always hold a connection before dropping off.

"I like these headphones.  They pair with a phone easily and sound quality is adequate for the gym.  While noise isolation is not active, the on ear headphones do a pretty good job of blocking-out sound.  Others had issues working-out and keeping these on their heads.  I wore a baseball cap underneath the headphones and they remained on my large melon throughout workouts on the treadmill.  What I don't like is that the charging cord frayed after two months and is inoperable.  Therefore, I can't charge the headphones.  I have to purchase a new headphone to get a cord as I can't find the right manufacturer cord (actually in stock) separately.  Emails to MEE (the manufacturer) have gone unanswered.

"Got this on a lighting deal for around $40 and that's all it's worth.  For that price, I'll keep the shoe.  I don't like that the toe box is too long, but the shoe width is far too thin. I had to stretch this pair width-wise to even get close to a size D (the shoe is stamped size ""D"").  The footbed is not removable to accommodate orthotics.  Cushioning is fair to poor so you don't want to walk in these for hours at a time.  Arch support is average, at best.  The shoe leather is soft and requires little break-in, but is not top grain.I recommend the saddle tan for pairing with nice dress jeans and the shoe center seam seems to highlight a long-sophisticated look.

The leather is soft and buttery requiring little break-in time.  The sole appears to be slip-resistant.  Cushioning is average: not too thin so you can wear for a night out on the town, but definitely not something you can walk in for hours upon hours sightseeing without your feet hurting.  The shoe dresses up with a suit or down with blue jeans and constantly gets compliments.  If you wear orthotics, the footbed is removable to accommodate an orthotic!

"In a quest use natural products, this was purchased this in a local health food store on a whim expecting to reorder on Amazon.

This smells like a precise mixture of unwashed underarms, dirty laundry, bug spray and kerosene.  After 36 - 48 hours, the smell seems to dissipate and guests want to come into my home again.

"I bought four scents of Primal Pit Paste stick and spray sight unseen from the manufacturer's website.  As a man, I don't want to smell like a woman.  The Lavender isn't for men and makes me smell like a floral bouquet.  The Thyme and Lemongrass scent is simply awful and causes stains on all my shirts that will not come out in the wash or at the dry cleaners.  The Royal and Rogue is fine for men (thus, I recommend for men), but it also stains clothes. The Primal Spice scent is also nice for men and seems to stain clothes less than the other scents.All products eliminated underarm odor well; hence, a three star rating.  The Thyme and Lemongrass scent seems to overpower everything so it may simply mask scent rather than eliminate it.  I didn't break-out with a rash like others on here and tolerated the product well.  My hope is the manufacturer reads these reviews and changes the formulary to not stain clothes (minus one star for the staining).  The price point is also high compared to other products on the market which, in my opinion, deducts another star from the rating.PS - I can use the spray on ""other areas"" of the body to eliminate odor and can report the product works well without presenting a skin rash.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVAMIO970DFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FVRCQ0Y#wasThisHelpful","RUVAMIO970DFW","AHM54PJQF2JA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHM54PJQF2JA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this from a local pharmacy.  This is the only cream that will help persistent and embarrassing eczema all over the body.  Not bad since I've tried everything on the market (including bleach baths to help the eczema): both prescription and over-the-counter.  My doctor's office has the 42% Urea Solution for the same price, but I can't find that online, so this is the next best option to purchasing from a doctor.  Combined with coconut lotion, all eczema signs disappear within two weeks.  You don't need to use the coconut oil with this product - it simply takes away the light stinging Urea causes and has numerous other benefits you can find with a web search.One warning: be careful not to get urea on your nails as it thins them considerably over time.

"This is a nice shoe, but once you take the inserts out to add orthotics, you see the lousy workmanship on the sole (inside the shoe).  The sole isn't sewn or glued to the upper well.  Attention to detail is lacking.  There tiny pin needle spaces between the sole and the upper where stitches were missed or glue was not added uniformly.  Glue is missing from some parts of the inner-sole or is applied too abundantly in other parts.  I question how long these will last, but they are comfortable for all-day wear right out of the box with no break-in period.  Nothing horribly wrong, but attention to manufacturer detail is lacking.As for fit: perfect.  I'm a size 10.5 in other shoes then these are spot-on.  Width is a perfect ""D"".  Shoes do not provide good arch support; hence, the addition of orthotics after removing the factory foot bed.

"This is a long and narrow shoe with built-in arch support.  If you have flat feet, these most likely aren't the shoes for you.  Rather, someone with medium to high arches could benefit from this model.  I have bum legs/feet from various injuries over the years and need comfortable shoes with arch support .  This ""fits"" the bill from the comfort perspective.  The leather is a bit hard at first, but loosens and becomes buttery with neutral shoe polish and a few wearings.  Allen Edmonds Walnut Shoe Polish make these look too dark; so, neutral is your best bet.The insoles are NOT removable unless you peel the glued-in inserts off to place your own very thin orthotics.  I recommend Superfeet Black as they are one of the thinnest orthotics available.  I don't suggest thick orthotics (like Superfeet Orange) with these shoes unless you size-up.  Even then, the shoes may be far too long.I'm normally a size 10.5 in Cole Haan and the 10.0 fit well with a little tightness over the forefoot.  This loosened with three days of walking and patience.As for aesthetics, the shoe is very good looking and well-made in Vietnam (hence, not China).  Amazon does not list the country of origin at time of this review.  The color is fantastic, but I would not recommend these with a suit unless you are in your early-20s and can pull-off the look without your co-workers thinking you're a complete tool.  I'm older and can't wear what I used to - so won't wear these with a suit.  However,  these look awesome with khakis or jeans even being middle-aged.  I don't think you can resole these so they are basically throw-away shoes when worn-down.If the worthless insoles were easily removable, I'd rate five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLU0JV6GJTXZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBBQJYQ#wasThisHelpful","RLU0JV6GJTXZR","AHM54PJQF2JA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHM54PJQF2JA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm writing from the perspective of someone middle-aged with mild hearing loss.  Hopefully this review will help if you are in a similar boat.  I purchased this from Sony almost a year ago for a far higher price than is offered for now.  I've used this daily since primarily for playing music and listening to Umano - a smartphone application that reads news to you.  As an aside, the Umano application is just awesome.  If you don't have it, get it - it's free.  (Note: see update below - voice and music sound far crisper on the Bose Mini purchased a year after writing this review).Some great reviews already tout the technical merits of this Sony product which I will not repeat.For listening to music, as long as you don't turn the volume too high, there is virtually no distortion.  For voice, sound is clear and when turned-up, there is little distortion; although, there seems to be a lot of bass.  I'd like to hear less bass and more treble. However, voice sound is still very good and easy to distinguish when you turn the volume all the way to the top.Using this as a speakerphone is decent, but not great.  Distortion is noticeable when volume is increased, halfway to the highest sound setting, and people on the other end of the phone say it sounds like I'm talking from the inside of a tin/metal tunnel.For someone hearing-impaired who needs to listen at a higher volume; just expect a little distortion.  Nothing too bad and for the current $99 price point, go ahead and push the purchase button.  I just feel it does not warrant a five star rating because of the distortion.  Four stars is still very good in my opinion.  This product seems better for listening to background music at a lower volume - a little less than halfway up to the highest volume setting.A few other reviewers note the unit can fall-over a lot.  I also find this as the side legs don't lock to hold the speaker upright.  They fold-down to make the unit easy to carry when travelling.  I'd like to see the side legs actually lock to hold the speaker firmly in-place.Alternatively, I also have the Sony SRSBTX500 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Premium Speaker System which costs twice the current price of the SRSBTX300 and yields far less distortion when playing music or listening to voice at higher volumes.  At higher volumes, voice seems clearer and far more distinguishable with the Sony SRSBTX500.*****Update:  After owning this for almost a year, it has fallen-over many times.  Does not stay-up for long. Has damaged walls due to it being heavy and the stand (arm) being flimsy.  I do not recommend purchase and am downgrading the rating from four stars to three stars.********Update 2: After this unit fell-down (again) and ruined my baseboard, I purchased the Bose Mini and it blows this speaker (and the Sony SRSBTX500)  out of the water in voice clarity and music depth.  At half volume voice is clearer.  Recommend you purchase the Bose.  It's also smaller, sturdy and does not fall-over like this does.  Gave the Sony units to charity and am in the process of purchasing another Bose Mini for a different room.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GERUUHNDC6EA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLCLURI#wasThisHelpful","R2GERUUHNDC6EA","AHM54PJQF2JA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHM54PJQF2JA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not going to repeat the other awesome reviews with regards to steel used, pocket clip, etc...  I own a lot of knives (kind of a knife nut) and this is by far the deceivingly sharpest out of the box blade I've ever received. It doesn't look sharp out of the box, but will scare the hairs off your arm before you can shave them. I'll use it to open other boxes containing other knives.The build quality is superior to most knives on the market.  Fit and finish are remarkable and the knife handle does not scratch in my pocket easily or collect pocket lint.  The blade is much harder to deploy than most Spyderco knives, but that is remedied with a torx screw adjustment.  Blade retention is excellent - if not the best I've worked with.This knife is not large enough to get a decent grip with all five fingers.  My pinky finger can't fit on the handle.  If you expect to get a five-finger grip, purchase another knife.  This knife is NOT built for lefties as the locking mechanism will get in the way of left-handed blade deployment.  I'm not going to deduct a star for this; just be aware it may bother some people.However, what I love is that the knife fits perfectly in the fifth jeans pocket.  The fifth pocket was introduced to blue jeans around the turn of the century and its original purpose was to hold a pocket-watch.  I feel this knife has singly created a new use for the fifth pocket.  Sure, there are other smaller knives out there, but this product seems at home in the fifth pocket.  It is used as my back-up to larger EDC folders kept in the front jeans pocket.You can also use this as a gentlemen's folder as it looks outstanding with a suit or more dressy clothes.  It looks classy next to a titanium or pewter flask.In summary, push the purchase button before Spyderco chooses to discontinue this model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18R57P7H0TL0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006L6WSIY#wasThisHelpful","R18R57P7H0TL0O","AHM54PJQF2JA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHM54PJQF2JA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW!  This ranks right up there with my Benchmade knives for quality and that's my highest compliment.  The S30V blade color looks like a clowns knife in the Amazon picture and looks fantastic in-person.  Blade deployment yields a wonderful sounding ""thwack"".  Jimping is on the top of the handle - just before the blade and on the butt of the knife.  Blade is perfectly dead center and came moderately sharp out of the box. I'd like a sharper blade from the factory, but this is adequate and can be corrected in five minutes. The grippy G10 handle feel in the hand is ergonomically as good and well-designed as many Spyderco knives.The knife rides deep in the pocket, tip down, right-handed carry.  Can be adjusted for left-handed carry.This is made in the USA.What I love are the aesthetics as this is a gorgeous knife with elegant flowing lines. Push the purchase button.  You will not be sorry.  This is a knife your friends will want no matter what age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11C0ZPZCFDZZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080IYV3Q#wasThisHelpful","R11C0ZPZCFDZZK","AHM54PJQF2JA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHM54PJQF2JA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've purchased Anker batteries for two other phones including the AT&T Note 2 and have been happy.  This battery arrived nicely packaged with a 62% charge and fits into the AT&T Note3 well.  However, it doesn't last as long as the original Samsung battery.  I conditioned the battery by letting the charge run down to 10% as the manufacturer instructs and then charging to 100%.  Full charge time was two hours and ten minutes using the Samsung supplied charger.  Over several weeks, I get a little more than a eight hours moderate usage (talk, text and occasional YouTube video) out of the Anker product while the Samsung battery yields a full day (12+ hours) of similar moderate usage.All-in-all, this is most likely the best replacement battery on the market and I would recommend purchase.  While the Anker product does not come with a travel charger, the Caseology competing battery (at time of writing this review) comes with a charger. However, the Anker product comes with NFC, which when I tested, works.  The Caseology battery does not yet support NFC.I wish this battery lasted as long as the OEM battery and had an external travel charger like the Caseology battery.  I'd like to rate five stars as Anker products have been very good purchases in the past, but can't given the shorter usability factor.  I know people view four stars as being a negative review; however, it is not in mind.  While this product works for me, it's not working as well as the OEM product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EIL3WWWIWBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FF54C8Q#wasThisHelpful","R10EIL3WWWIWBH","AHM54PJQF2JA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHM54PJQF2JA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice knife for opening medium-sized boxes open or for removing thread from clothes.  It's not meant to be used outdoors.  More for an office setting.  It will not scare your co-workers, but is a little too large to be a keychain knife; too small to be a hunting knife.  I like that it rides low in the pocket rather than sticking out for the world to see.The knife does NOT have jimping of any kind on the blade which makes it more prone to your hand slipping down the blade when using wet - food prep, etc....  The handle is grippy, has a little jimping on the top for your thumb, and has indentations for your fingers.  It has a brown and white color with small pictures of what look like deer heads.The blade is a bit off center, but not too much that it hits the handle sides.  You can't adjust the blade because it's fastened to the handle with pins rather than screws.  The blade is not easy to flip open with one hand.  In fact, it drags when opening.  Nothing mineral oil didn't solve, however.  It came sharp out of the box, but not sharp enough to scare the hair off your arms.  Edge retention seems decent.All-in-all, a cool knife to show your friends or use around the office or give as a gift to someone who just wants a casual knife.  For the low price point, three and a half (rounded to four) stars seems appropriate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QH1KHIG1R23Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN0MB3K#wasThisHelpful","R3QH1KHIG1R23Q","AHM54PJQF2JA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHM54PJQF2JA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We received our LeapPad about two weeks ago,  We have five grandchildren in the recommended age range for this device, and they all love it.  I am amazed at how easy it is for the kids to figure out how to use it.  After I show them a couple of things, they are ready to play.  The older ones(6 &up) have been very helpful showing the younger ones what to do.They have enjoyed playing the pet app, Paw Patrol, the cooking app, and they love the camera and all the fun things they can do with it. The LeapSearch has a wide variety of entertaining videos and educational items.This device will keep the kids busy for a long time, but it is best to set a time limit when they play with it.  The parental controls lets you set a time limit, but I just tell my grandkids when time is up.  The only problem I have with the device is that it only lets you establish three profiles and I need five.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R212P4AZA8IQWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1OQC6#wasThisHelpful","R212P4AZA8IQWE","A2TXMYYGSZCSZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TXMYYGSZCSZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am delighted with this set.  I wasn't aware of the education sets until I saw this while shopping for Legos for a gift.  I love being able to buy a box of Legos and knowing exactly what I am getting.  Having extra small building plates is so helpful.  I shared this set with one of my grandsons.  We split the box between the two of us.  He selected 11 pieces and I added 11 pieces to my tote of Legos that visiting grandkids play with.  The only problem I now have is that I want to get more education sets as do the kiddos.If you are looking for a great new Lego set, we recommend this set:LEGO City Town Starter Set.

"My grandson received this bulldozer for his birthday and loves it.  I am very impressed with the Lego vehicle, the details are incredible.  I was surprised and pleased to see the constructions workers in this set are not both men.  One of the workers is a woman!The tracks, made of 42 pieces each, move freely with no sticking.  It works on hard surfaces as well as carpet.  The adjustable blade can be used at various angles, which makes it very realistic.  The building that comes with the set for demolition comes apart easily for good playability.  My 10 year old grandson had some difficulty assembling the bottom of the dozer, but was able to complete it with a little patience.

"First, this toy's packaging is overdone.  It took me 15 minutes to remove the pieces from the box.  I will say that everything is very secure, and will definitely not come loose in shipping.Sofia's arms and legs are poseable, but the elbows and knees do not move.  Her eyes do not open and close. Her hat is removable.  Minimus is stationary, and the wings are easy to insert.  The instructions state that the batteries included are for demonstration purposes only.  I find this rather odd.  I wish they would put in decent batteries, or just state batteries are not included.  It takes 3 button cell batteries.  The batteries in the toy I received seem to be working okay.When you press Sofia's amulet, she talks and sings quite loud.  When you place Minimus near Sofia, you are supposed to hear them chat.  The one I received doesn't do this.  Sofia and Minimus talk and music plays while they are flying.  This feature works well, and is the kids' favorite part.  The instructions also state that when you award Sofia the trophy included it will activate phrases, ours doesn't do this.This toy is cute, but I really think it is overpriced.  I plan on contacting Mattel when their office is open in hopes of getting some answers as to why all the features are not working.  I will post an update.Update:  I spoke with a very nice customer service representative from Mattel today.

I think it would be a bit more stable if it was a bit bigger, but given its size it is a blast to play with!I've had no big issues with control, it really does follow your basic wishes when using the remote control.  I do however feel the size gets in the way in that it is a tad small, if it was slightly larger and heavier I think control would be better.  BUT, that is where the slight bumpers on the outer edges of where the copter blades are come in handy.  If you bump only slightly, it is possible to maintain control without disaster.

"We love Battleship - we have electronic, regular and now Star Wars.  I will admit I have reasons to love and hate each one.  I love the electric and how it helps and interacts when you tell it what to hit.  I love the simplicity of the regular.  And I love the floating ships of the Star Wars (plus, it is a favorite family theme anyway!)This game was easy to set up.  Clear instructions, stickers were easy to put on, pieces easy to get ready.Play was easy too - same as usual.  I think there was one less ship in this version - there was a 2 hole, a 3 hole, a 4 hole and a 5 hole ship.  There are little tabs that fold down, otherwise, they hold the ships and make them look like they are floating above the game board.My one and only complaint was that the floating ships made adding the red ""hit"" pegs a bit hard to add to the ships in a few places.  Otherwise, this game was great - the whole family loved the Star Wars theme and the length of the game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SFBO9XX0DNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCL6#wasThisHelpful","R31SFBO9XX0DNZ","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up, I have fond memories of loving caramels because my Dad loved them.  Now as an adult, I love them, and enjoy trying new caramels and twists on them.  This tin arrived at my house and first off, I was shocked at how large it was.  Sometimes when it says the weight in the description, it can be hard to tell just how bit something will be.  This is a really good size.  You really could pull this tin out at a party and likely (if it isn't a huge party) have leftovers.These caramels are oft and chewy, and there are three different flavors:  regular caramel, butterscotch caramel and vanilla caramel.  I liked all three, but preferred the vanilla caramels the best.These ""soft cremes"" are similar to a saltwater taffy in consistency, but really do taste like caramels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LE0ZDHV372JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRDEI#wasThisHelpful","R3LE0ZDHV372JC","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very effective make-up remover wipes.  I like the feel of my face after using them, and they do a really good job of cleaning makeup off my face.The only thing I don't like is that the smell is a bit off for me.  I wish it was a tad pretty smelling.The Simple Brand claims that you only need one wipe across your face to remove the makeup, and for the more stubborn waterproof makeup you simply hold the wipe gently on the area for a few seconds and swipe, it will remove the makeup with no issues.  This is the case for normal makeup, I only use waterproof eye liner.I am very appreciative that there is no alcohol used in the wipes, as that tends to be so harsh and drying on skin.  I also like the clean light feeling my skin is left with, instead of the feeling you can get from some wipes that feel like they have left a layer of something behind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CP5FVILQ4G28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RAVQIW#wasThisHelpful","R1CP5FVILQ4G28","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used quite a few laminators over the year, some easier than others.  I was excited to see just how easy this one is to use.  Not only is it nice an compact and portable, it is easy to set up anywhere with enough room to feed your project in on the one side and for it to come out on the other (even the floor works great).I love the auto-shut-off feature.  I haven't needed it yet, but I like the knowledge that if I start something, walk away and forget it, it will automatically turn itself off.The machine does have a button to choose between 3 mil and 5 mil laminating pouches, which is helpful and gives us some options for the pouches we can use.Out of the box, the laminator comes with 20 letter size laminating pouches.  I've used a few for some ABC flash cards that we are using daily and they turned out GREAT!This is a great laminator for home projects, saving artwork, creating projects with the kids, and saving important documents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDHRPC799H1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3CGD3E#wasThisHelpful","R1DDHRPC799H1C","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun and interactive castle that was fun to build with the kids.  It had 786 pieces, so we started by sorting them by size and basic shape.  Then we followed the instructions.

Not only does the castle look neat, it has some fun features.  The castle is basically a center section with two towers, and each of the towers has hinges that allow them to open up for play.There is a jail section, a crown/throne room, and a lookout section, all with neat booby-traps and fun interactive pieces.

"I love the concept of this cold roller ball - sometimes you have a muscle or area that really needs to be massaged and the cold helps reduce swelling.The ability to put this into the freezer, chill it, and use it to roll out knots in sore muscles is great, and it does a great job.I've found after using it a few times, that if I'm feeling lazy and don't want to take the grip off, it is just fine to put the whole thing in the freezer - it just chills your hand a bit when you are using it.I really have only one concern, and that is how to clean the roller ball.  The roller ball sits securely (as in, I can't get it out no matter what I try) inside the hard yellow base.  The rubber grip comes off fairly easily, but I don't think the yellow plastic can be removed from the ball.  And the  way the ball works is like a roll-on deodorant, and I have a very fancy expensive rose roll-on deodorant, and I do notice a bit of build up under the roller where you can't get to it, so I make sure to only use it after a shower... same concept here.  If you use this after a workout, before you shower, you are going to get sweat buildup under the rollerball, and I don't see how you can clean it.  Soaking it in rubbing alcohol might do the trick, but I'm just not sure. And, after reading the pamphlet it came with, I don't see anything about cleaning it at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6XONQJCICZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPGL3E4#wasThisHelpful","R2G6XONQJCICZW","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been married for almost 15 years - in fact, this August will be our 15th Anniversary.... and ... we were high school sweet hearts prior to getting married.  We dated for 7 years... so after being ""together"" for the past 22 years, I've noticed that our idea of LOVE has changed.  When we first met, it was the sparks flying kind of love, and it has evolved into a deeper love filled with respect, trust, commitment, etc.There are times when you do have to think about your relationship and realize that you've chosen to marry the person you are with for wonderful reasons, that you have built a great life together, and that each and every day you get to make the choice... to say ""I choose you!""  Whether you say it in your head, or out loud, it is something we all want to hear, or at least I do.  I want to hear that I'm wanted and chosen. AND, I want my husband and kids to know that each and every day, I choose them.  Even when I wake up grumpy, or feel overwhelmed, I still choose them, and after reading this, I see that it is important to not just think about the fact that you are choosing to live your life with your family, but that it gives you empowerment.The book is based on Faith, and choosing to place our faith in God and the scriptures that support his teachings.  Each chapter in the book looks at different ways we ""choose"" and how the choices we make empower us and empower the people in our lives (especially our significant other): I Choose to.... Pursue You, Love You, Bless You, Honor You, Keep My Commitment to You, Be Loyal to You, Trust You, Forgive You, Be Adaptable, Submit to You, Share Your Burdens, Serve You....Now, I will be the first to admit that I really need to work on quite a few of the topics within the book.  For example, I have been known to hold a grudge for a long time... and a choice that was made over 20 years ago should not be in the forefront of my mind now, which it isn't (yes, I'm thinking of something specific LOL, that hubby thinks I still hold onto from our early years and a major purchase decision, but I see that I need to find a way to reverse what happened then and show him that the Trust, Forgive, Adapt all apply and I've gotten beyond that incident...)I have come away with a newfound feeling of empowerment, that the choices I'm making are biblically supported, and are good for my family and myself.  Honestly, I plan to re-read this a few times to really let some of the topics really sink in, and I want to practice telling others that I'm choosing them.  I also want to go beyond and show them that I'm choosing them as well.After reading Deb's book, I can see that we are all in the same boat, or at least in a similar boat, and that is inspiring.  I'm planning to suggest this book at our next book club, as I feel that it can improve our relationships both in the home, and in friendships.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZJWWS7HX1LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787960#wasThisHelpful","RUZJWWS7HX1LM","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This K-Cup works perfectly in our off-brand K-Cup machine.  It fits just fine, and brews without any problems.The flavor is a nice black tea with a hint of creaminess.  My husband and I have been drinking more tea and less coffee/soda respectively, and this is a nice tea to have on hand when you don't want to brew an entire pot.I realize that the price seems a bit high, but when you compare the price to loose leaf tea, it isn't so bad when you consider the convenience of tossing your K-Cup into the machine and pressing a button.  If you are comparing it to a general tea bag you buy at the market, it is a bit pricier.Overall, both hubby and I enjoyed this tea although it is not a favorite.  His favorite right now is the Hartley and Sons Paris tea in a K-Cup (he likes it so much we also have it in the loose leaf tin).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODR9XKHTI1MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK3D75M#wasThisHelpful","R1ODR9XKHTI1MS","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fun to assemble with the  boys.  This comes packaged similarly to a snap-together model.  You take the parts off the plastic holders, file any rough pieces (boys were too excited, so we put it together and I went back later with a file and got rid of the rough pieces).  You assemble it according to the instructions, add the stickers and go play.Note:  no special tools are needed unless you want to file the edges where they were connected to the molding plastic (not needed).  The toy comes with the tool needed to twist the little screws for the arms and feet (the yellow screw on this toy's shoulder).Instruction note:  The instructions are in Japanese, but with the piece numbers clearly printed on the instructions and on the plastic molding plastic, you can figure it out with very little frustrations.Final note - this toy does not come with a marble holder (we are new to the toys, so I'm not sure what it is called), so it can only hold 2 marbles at a time, which is just fine.

"In a household with young boys, this is a great feature... not only is it a cool toilet seat (their words), but it lights up in the dark which they love.I know that Kohler is a quality brand based on past experience.  This seat was easy to install, and it replaced a wooden seat.  I actually prefer wood seats in general as white eventually stains, so I'm waiting to see how this white seat does.I am impressed with the extra fluffy features - the charcoal, the scent, the light, and the slowly lowering lid.As of now, with only having had this installed a short time, I'm not able to talk about the length of use for the charcoal or scent.  First of all, it is easy to install, both the seats, the batteries and the extras - they are all easy - really just took a few minutes - I really expected it to be harder.Honestly, the night light is now a favorite feature - we usually have a small night light in the bathroom so the bathroom isn't scary at night for the kids (and so we don't really have to turn the light on if we don't want to), and the night light burned out.  The nice thing was that with the lid closed, the light from the seat was enough so that the burned out nightlight was not an emergency situation.  When you lift the lid, the light moves to the toilet bowl - again, the boys have chuckled about this and find it really fun.I like the light scent, but if the replacements are expensive or hard to get, I won't be replacing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAI6WKBTEXWW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVA7RXS#wasThisHelpful","RAI6WKBTEXWW9","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My feet are very dry and I get callus build-up pretty fast.  This electronic pedicure file is the perfect FINISHING touch to my heel/foot routine.By itself, I don't know that it is aggressive enough to really make my feet feel great (my feet will actually hurt when my calluses get too bad around my heels).  So, here is what I do: when my feet are really bad (not often, maybe every few months), I use a heel razor to get a good portion of the callus off, then I use a European Foot File in the shower.  This works wonderfully on a regular basis, but doesn't leave my feet smooth (even using the smoothing side isn't perfect), so now I use this electronic foot file last to get the slightly rough skin that is left that will catch on my soft sheets.I've never been happier after doing a self-pedicure than I am now!!!Note - this comes WITH the 2 AA batteries needed to use the foot file.  I do wish it was a plug-in file so I wasn't going through batteries, but so far, I'm still on the first set of batteries and it is going strong.It is pressure sensitive and will stop if you are pushing too hard.

First off, if the technology really does work (how do you test for dust mites if you are at home?... I'm sensitive to dust, so I am careful with our bedding, but even I can't really tell if pillows or bedding is getting dust mites) I like the idea assuming the chemical applied to make it anti-allergy isn't harmful for us in the long-run (need to do more research in this area myself).Let me explain something about the fluffy vs firmness of this pillow.  I consider soft pillows to be those that don't give a lot of support, but kind of form around your head and you can REALLY form them how you want them, while extra firm is heavy and will barely move if punched (think the really expensive memory foam pillows).  Then you get the medium, which provides support without the filling moving all over, and is still fluffy so you can sort of get it more comfortable.I do consider this pillow to be medium firmness - it provides a lot of support for how light weight it is.  It is also very fluffy and compresses some when you use it.  I really like this one for a medium firmness pillow.The cover is nice and seems to be made out of good quality fabric.It says it is 100% washable, but I have not washed mine yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R194A29AFOFAXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRLY6NY#wasThisHelpful","R194A29AFOFAXB","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, we've had a chance to make a few blended drinks so far with this amazing machine, and my husband who was skeptical as to how much this would actually get used, now thinks it is the answer to EVERYTHING... well, not everything, but all drink-related slushy type drinks!We call it our ""Smart Drink Mixer""... in the past, when making milk shakes, or blended drinks, we've always had trouble with separation of the icy and liquid parts, and with ice chunks.The designers/programmers of the Black and Decker XL Blast Party Blender did a great job.  It blends ice into drinks perfectly, leaving no annoying chunks, and the directions are easy to follow.Additionally, I love the pour feature in the lid (the lid fits very tightly with a rubber edge), and the chilling sleeve that keeps the blender bowl cold when it still has drinks in it.We've used it for a few football get-togethers and it is PERFECT!  I've since gotten rid of my two other blenders as this has the versatility and usefulness I need.Dishwasher safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10N2WUJX8A84A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHBD10K#wasThisHelpful","R10N2WUJX8A84A","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the concept of this Door Anchor for exercise straps.  When I've gotten exercise bands in the past, I've basically had to buy each piece that I want, they don't usually come as a bundle.  So, I've got some great handles, and a great band, and I'm able to do basic exercises with it.  This anchor allows me to attach the band to the door to do additional exercises.To set this up, you need to be on the side of the door so that when you pull it closed, you pull it toward you.  Make sure you are pulling the door shut (not pushing it shut) so that the door jam is between you and the door (this gives the door strength so that you can't pull it open toward you while exercising.This anchor will only work on door jams that have a bit of space between the door jam and the door itself as the nylon strap needs some space to get between the door jam and door.  In our house, it works on our family room door (which is where I prefer to work out), and on our bedroom door, but that means I'm working out in the small hallway, which is not great.The wide part at the end of the strap goes behind the door while you are closing it so that it locks the anchor in place and does not allow it to slip through the door jam when the door is closed.You then attach your workout band (does not come with the door anchor) to the anchor with the included carabiner ring.I like the ability to change the height of the anchor by sliding it, or moving it.  I can do it above the door, below, and from various heights on the side of the door.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TGBH751EUPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPZ7G1I#wasThisHelpful","R16TGBH751EUPV","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My just-turned-5 year old loves this game.  He is familiar with the cartoon, so he knew the characters when he started playing the game (Millie, Geo, Bot).The game is really great - it uses the familiar Umizoomi characters to help kids learn about patterns, measuring, numbers, shapes, and basic problem solving.Kids will help the Umizoomi team to fix the town.  Some challenges call for your child to show which way to go on a map of the city based on the number that comes next (1, 2, 3...).  I really liked that the game keeps things easy enough for kids to understand and learn from, but challenging enough for them to learn from.Another thing I really liked was that my son learned about measuring using non-standard things... example: we tend to use a ruler to measure everything, but when you don't have a ruler, you can use something else.  In the game, Millie uses her hair to measure how long items are.  My son turned around and started using his Build-a-Bear to measure his bed and a few other things around the house.  I LOVED THIS!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZ7T5D7GPOW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6NHM#wasThisHelpful","R3SZ7T5D7GPOW3","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my everyday eye makeup, I typically use a mineral based pearlish peach color on my lids, and a mineral charcoal for the outer edge over waterproof eyeliner, blended to look nice, finished with mascara.  This shade of Japonesque Velvet Touch Shadow actually matches my current favorite Smashbox color perfectly.I will say that my Smashbox covers my eyelid a little better than the Japonesque, but this one does look nice and covers well, it just seems to be not as fine as the Smashbox shadow (so it seems to take a little more for the same coverage).Once I get the right amount on, it looks great, and it blends nicely with my other shadow to finish off my daily look.I use this with my eye brush (it does not come with a foam or brush, so you will need your own), and generally use it dry, although it is fun to change it up a bit by getting the eye brush wet first.  It makes the color a bit brighter, and changes the look just a bit to stand out a little more.Overall, I'm very pleased with this color and coverage.  I will certainly use this shadow going forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65OUDA8EFWXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR66YBC#wasThisHelpful","R65OUDA8EFWXH","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After taking these for about two weeks, I can say that I've experienced nothing negative while taking these, and they are easy to store (they don't need to be refrigerated).They claim to aid with digestion and boost your immune system.I make a point to add probiotics to our diet any time someone in the family has been on antibiotics or had a bad stomach virus.  When you take antibiotics, you kill both the good and bad bacteria in your system, so taking a probiotic afterwards is important to add back in the good bacteria your system needs to stay healthy.This is a good option as it does not need to be refrigerated like other common probiotics.  This makes it easy to take on trips, keep in a desk, or simply have on hand.As with most supplements, short of scientific experiments, it is hard to judge if a product is working.  The only thing I can say is that I have not experienced any negative affects from taking these.

"I love LeapFrog learning tools, so I was really excited to give this new LeapTV a try.  We got to test out the PAW Patrol learning game.  It is aimed at kids ages 3-5 and is gender neutral.I love how interactive the game is.  It tracks motion via the controller (held in child's hand) and the LeapTV camera (similar to a Kinect or Wii sensor - it can see your child's movement, and in some cases, it can add your child's image into the game).  Your child works to help with six rescue missions.My 4 year old followed the game really well.  He understood what he needed to do pretty easily, and seemed to pick up the movement and theme of the game quickly.The game kept his attention really nicely, and captured my 8 year old's attention for about 20 minutes.I like that the game is youngster friendly as opposed to the older games that are played on the Xbox and Wii.My only complaint is that the dogs talking actions (mouth moving) seemed to go on about double the amount of time the dogs were actually saying something, so on occasion there was a bit of confusion as to if he was done talking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QNL8A5GZ2MZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG3RHB6#wasThisHelpful","R1QNL8A5GZ2MZY","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She and her son are living in a house with Ashley and her daughter (the house is actually Ashley's brother's home).

"After watching family-friendly action/adventure movies like Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, National Treasure, etc., it is really fun to find a fun new series of books that centers around adventure.  This book is aimed at approx. 4th-6th graders per the Scholastic site, and it is around a 5th grade reading level book.  I've been reading this book with my 2nd grader, who is not quite ready to read it on his own, but who enjoys the book as an adventurous family story.The story centers around Alex and his best friend Ren.  Alex is terminally ill, his mother is an expert on Ancient Egypt, and she uses a spell from the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead to help Alex.  Unknowingly, she also unleashes five Death Walkers when she uses the spell.  She also disappears, and so do the Lost Spells, so Alex and Ren have to try to find his mom.  While trying to find Alex's mom and save the world, the kids run into Mummies, scorpions, and so many more challenges.Kids will be able to read the book and then go online (with parental permission) to play the game online, build an Egyptian tomb, hide treasure, set traps, and challenge friends.  Note - you will need a code from purchasing the book.  My advanced copy of the book does not have the code, so while the kids and I explored what we could of the site (which looks very fun), we could't play the game.I especially love that this book will get boys and girls interested in Ancient Egypt.  (Alex is a boy, and Ren is a girl, so both boys and girls will enjoy the book and enter the adventure)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4BGDHJWMQR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545723388#wasThisHelpful","R2L4BGDHJWMQR8","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been replacing brakes and pads on our vehicles recently, and this really helps speed the job up while working with the lug nuts.Having not owned or used an Impact Wrench before, I can't really compare it, but it is sturdy.  The only criticism I can point out here is that it is a very heavy tool.  To me this says, quality, and solid equipment, but is also translates into something that causes muscle fatigue faster than necessary.  So, for a home/shop use where it will only occasionally be used, this may not matter as much, but if you own a shop and are going to be using it all the time, make sure you consider the weight.The switch makes it easy to switch from untightening to tightening.One thing I've learned over the years is when it is good to have a battery vs. when having an electric tool is nice, and in the case of drills and similar tools, I'm finding it is really nice having a wired component you can always count on to have 100% of its power instead of a tool that could wear out the battery mid-way through a project.Over all, I'm really pleased with the time we saved instead of using a hand wrench, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other projects we can use this for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQI0JF5U22CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZHIN0S#wasThisHelpful","R2NQI0JF5U22CA","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Kenmore canister vacuum that I love, and finding good bags that are sturdy are important because I go through at least a pack per year if not more.  At less than $1/bag these are great bags!!!They are sturdy (I can fill the bag to the point there is no room left, and they don't break open when removing them from the canister - yes, I've had that happen with cheap bags before).They fit well.  I've never really had a problem using C bags of any brand as far as fit - slide the holder into the part that holds it securely, and kind of squish the bag in.  Done.Chemically treated?  While I'm not sure about long-term health affects of using chemically treated bags, I LOVE that they are coated with something that prevents bacteria from growing and spreading - this time of year, cold season takes over and the last thing I need is my vacuum spreading more germs.I had to dig through one bag for some Lego pieces that accidentally got vacuumed up, and it is pretty amazing to see the tiny particles of dirt this bag holds in.

"My all-time favorite water bottle is my Contigo, it has a screw on lid, flip spout, and uses a plastic straw.  I really like the plastic straw as opposed to having to squeeze the water out of the bottle.  That is why I didn't give this bottle 5 stars, so if that does not bother you at all, kick it up a notch and ignore my 4 stars.The Water Bobble Sport water bottle is easy to use - basically, unscrew the lid, fill the bottle most of the way (I am able to fill it more than my husband can fill his Brita Filtered Water Bottle), replace the lid and squeeze the water into your mouth to drink.Prior to the first use, you are supposed to fill the bottle and squeeze the entire bottle of water through the carbon filter.  At first, the water did come out with a black tinge, which the instructions mentioned.This is not my daily-use water bottle as I fill my Contigo with filtered water from my refrigerator.  BUT, this water bottle came in really handy when we went on a trip - I don't like to drink tap water, so instead of going through a ton of water bottles from a store, I was able to take this water bottle with and I used it to filter my water - loved the convenience.Note:  to replace the filter, you buy a new filter/cap piece - I initially tried to unscrew the filter to clean the mouth piece, but couldn't get it apart.  After looking online, I found out that they are one piece and are not meant to come apart (I didn't see anything about that on/in the packaging).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2GJP7CBGN08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2SPF9M#wasThisHelpful","R3J2GJP7CBGN08","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wore this for family portraits and date night - after 2 kids and lengthy bedrest for one, it was a nice supportive slimmer.

When I took the straps off my shoulders and tucked them down, they were a bit lumpy but the slimmer fit much better.  So, if you are busty, try this on before removing the tags.Otherwise, this slimmer worked really nicely.  It fit well, provided support and did make me feel slimmer.  I planned my outing and avoided the bathroom because I really felt it would be easier to remove the whole thing rather than use the hooks at the crotch of the slimmer.By the way - this is made extremely well.

"I found this lotion while on a trip to the ocean with friends.  It has quickly become my favorite!  Not only do I love the scent, but it soothes dry skin and lasts a while without being greasy!To me, it is a medium lotion, doesn't go on too thick, and fully absorbs into skin fairly quickly while leaving skin feeling moist but not greasy.  I consider a light lotion to be almost watery when you rub it in, so this one is not runny.LOVE the scent - to me it is kind of grapefruity - in fact, that is what I thought it was until I read the bottle and saw Orange Honey.What else to say - a little goes a long way and it feels GREAT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEYKQSZJ6FJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S01TBG#wasThisHelpful","RBEYKQSZJ6FJI","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please note - if you have ever installed those vinyl stickers to a wall, they tell you to wipe the wall down with rubbing alcohol ahead of time and give it time to dry.  This removes dust and dirt that you don't notice and lets the sticky side adhere better to the wall.  I did this at home for this too.This is an awesome board - not only is it huge - you can cut it to a specific size (it can also be used to resurface an existing white board).  I wanted a way to make lists on the refrigerator, and also on the kid's bedroom door.  I also thought it would be fun to give them a section to color on themselves.  It wipes cleanly with the included eraser cloth, and it is easy to write/draw on with dry-erase markers (not included).Tips - it is easiest to place this level on the wall by marking the wall ahead of time (use pencil if it won't show, or use tape to create a level line to follow).  Then pull back a few inches of the backing to line it up.  For larger pieces, tape the entire thing up when you get it lined up, then start at one side and start peeling the backing back - fold it and place the edge on,  once it is where you know you want it, you can start pulling more of the backing off and removing the tape holding it to the wall as you need to.Post-It has made optional accessories that can help - a pen holder tray and additional eraser cloths.  We are using generic dry-erase markers with it and they work just fine.Use this at the office or at home - on the fridge door for lists/menus/reminders, front door for reminders, kids bedroom wall for drawing, kids door for a chore chart checkoff list or reminders (you can use vinyl chart tape to make lines and customize a board, but it does not always remove cleanly, so make sure if you use it, you get it put exactly where you want - once it is left on for a while, it will leave a mark if you try to remove it and the board won't cleanly erase from where it was), use it to make fun dry-erase gifts (cover the front of a board or clipboard, add a frame, place on a jar or container and update the contents... but keep it dry,, etc)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YPGNZ4PQBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC1D5QU#wasThisHelpful","R15YPGNZ4PQBZ","A2H667ZUNLNTF1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H667ZUNLNTF1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My favorite thing about this sleep set is that it is very compact.  I have a memory foam neck pillow that is quite the pain to haul around and although it is more comfortable than this blow up pillow, this one can be deflated and stuck in the side pocket of my suitcase.This is not the most comfortable neck pillow in the world, but it does the job.  The mask is cheap but works as well as the ear plugs.  If you need a compact solution for traveling and aren't too picky, this could be for you.

" 5:33 Mins I was very impressed with this track slider.  I have always wanted one to get those great moving shots and this one did not disappoint.  It is super easy to setup and with its case is easy to transport.  I was also very impressed with the build quality.Out of the box it took me about 3 minutes to set it up.  There are no instructions included but none are necessary.  This track works by itself but I would recommend a couple things to go with it that will make you experience and video better.  First, you need a tripod head.  I would recommend one with pan/tilt functionality.  This will make shooting the video much easier and give you more flexibility.  Second, I would recommend a tripod to mount this on.  You can see from my video and attached pictures how I used the tripod.Overall this is an impressive product at a great price.

The water bottles hold 10oz each and are very secure in the belt so there is no worry that they will fall out of flop around while running.  The main pouch is very spacious and would pretty easily hold any phone.  It does have individual dividers with in the main pouch to keep things from rubbing on your phone.  It also has sweet access hole that you can put the headphones though.I typically don't run/jog far enough on a regular basis to need to carry water with me, but on those super hot days this would be a great thing to have.

I can easily fit my iPhone 5s although I'm not sure how easily the bigger phones like the iPhone 6s Plus would fit.  I imagine it would be VERY tight or they would not fit at all.

"Aside from these arriving in a brown box that's not quite a pretty as an Apple box they appear to be the same cable. The ONLY difference I could find between these cables and the Apple cable that came with my iPhone is that the Apple cable was about 3/4 inch longer.  Other than that they were identical in look and feel.  The connectors were also identical.  The wall charger also looks similar to the Apple ones.  I did notice that it got pretty warm but not hot while charging my phone.My only complaint would be that the wall chargers are only rated at 1 Amp max output so they are really designed to only charge phones.

"This armband is the perfect solution to spotty bluetooth connection I've had when my phone is in my pocket while running.  I've run into bluetooth issues where it cuts in and out because there isn't direct line of sight between the phone and headset.  Now with the phone on my arm I don't have any issues at all.  I don't yet have my iPhone 6s but my iPhone 5s works fine in this case.What I like- Quality materials- Easy to put on- Feels comfortable on my arm- My pockets can be empty now as this hold anything essential that I need for running.What I don't like- Due to the nature of phone sizes, these cases are getting big to fit them.  I've got pretty skinny arms so it looks HUGE on me. :)Overall its a great armband at a good price point and I would recommend it to a friend.

"When I first took this out of the packed I noticed right off the bat that it is not made of cotton.  It is more of a nylon/polyester that is super stretchy and feels just like a skirt my wife has.  I ordered a Large and I am 5'9"" 165lbs and it was quite baggy especially for a slim fit.  I would go a size smaller if you want the slim look.  It is made from a very thin fabric and is very comfortable.My complaints are that the sleeves are way too long.  They hang down past my hands and have to be pushed up to about my elbow to stay up.  The neck is also a bit big for my taste.  Take a look at my pics to see how it fit on me.  If you are a V-neck person this could work for you but take note of my complaints first.

"First of all I thought this shirt felt a little big for a Large slim fit which I was fine with.  I was worried that it might be a little small but it fit about like how I like a shirt to fit.  It did not feel slim fit at all so if you are looking for that, I'd go a size smaller.Second, it says it is made of cotton, however it does not feel like cotton at all.  It feels more like a performance shirt than a cotton T-shirt which was a pleasant surprise.  It is stretchy and super comfortable.My two main complaints come down to the 3/4 sleeve that are just awkward.  Pushed up I thought they looked fine but all the way down did not look good.

"This is a pretty nice plaid shirt.  I typically order L size shirts but because it is classified as slim fit, I went a size bigger and it fits about right.  It is a little baggy in the mid section, but I really don't want anything that's tight so it fit very well.  I'm 5'9"" and 165lbs so you can see from the pictures how it fit me.

"First of all, I'm 5'9"" and about 165lbs.  When I saw that this was slim fit I decided to order an XL where I would normally order a L as I prefer a little room in a hoodie than a snug fit.  This thing was was bigger than I expected yet was true to size.  When I see slim fit it usually means smaller, but in this case I think if you typically wear large in normal fit, you should get large here as well.  I was also very surprised at the quality of the fabric and the feel.  It really does feel high quality and I'll be honest, I was expecting something cheap feeling.  It is also very warm.Over all this is a nice hoodie that I will use however I only gave it 4 stars because of design.  I really do not like the off centered zipper.  It is a little awkward and I'm not all that fashionable anyways.  :)  I did receive a promotion on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMI4W7IFB3CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01689SQFW#wasThisHelpful","RLMI4W7IFB3CF","ANYTXWI3WZDCH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANYTXWI3WZDCH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just recently got a bunch of little solar lights and these were a great addition!  They came will packaged so the glass globes didn't break.  They are actually quite solid and heavier than I thought they would be.  They are nice and bright and fade through different colors.  They also have an on/off switch so you don't have to have them on at night if you don't want.I did have one little issue when trying to put on the glass globe of the second light.  The little metal clips are pretty tough to bend back to slip the globe on.  The first one went on nice and snug quite possibly never to be removed again.  When putting on the second one, one of the prongs stayed a little bent rather than returning to its original position so that globe is not on as snug but is still secure and doesn't appear to be going anywhere.All in all, I really like these and they liven up our front yard a little and go great with the other solar lights I purchased.

"These glasses are great if you can keep them in protective cases and keep them clean after use.  I thought they were great when I first got them.  They are comfortable and didn't feel like they were cheap enough to fall apart.  I store them in the glove box of my RZR with other glasses and just from rubbing over the last few rides, there are scuffs on the lenses that effect my view.  I can still wear them sure, but in hindsight I should have kept them better protected because they are not scratch resistant at all.

"This insect killer is awesome!  Every summer we have an issue with TONS of flies in the garage.  I had to battle a swarm of flies just to get into the house with this box after it arrived on the door step.  I quickly set it up and took it to the garage.  I put it off to the side on the shelf and turned it on.  The next day there were significantly less flies.  I didn't see any swarming the door, just a few on the ceiling.  48 hours later I took the pictures that are posted below.  It was a fly grave yard.  They are nearly all gone after 2 days. This thing is great and has proved to be very effective.What I like- It kills flies (very well)- Convenient tray to catch dead flies and is easy to empty- Super simple setup- QuietWhat I don't like- It only initially wounded some flies so there were about 10 dead flies out side the tray at the bottomOverall this is a great product and will make my summer days much more enjoyable.

"If you've never tried one of these electric fly swatters, you are missing out.  I've had two other brands of electric fly swatters and they are all pretty much the same in functionality.  You put the batteries in and then push the button down when a flying insect is near.  All they have to do is touch the wires and POP they are history.  Sometimes it even makes a cool spark and loud popping noise.  It is truly spectacular!The reason I only gave 4 stars is because the price for this is a quite high.  You can pick one up at Harbor Freight for $4 and I've seen them a lot cheaper than $20 else where and there doesn't seem to be much variance between brands.Overall this is a good product that should help reduce the amount of flying pests in your vicinity.I received this for free in exchange for my unbiased honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16VXUZ27FW03K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163A36T2#wasThisHelpful","R16VXUZ27FW03K","ANYTXWI3WZDCH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANYTXWI3WZDCH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a stylish case that really does protect your iPad Air 2.  It actually also fits my iPad Air 1 however the top flaps don't sit flush on the screen. It would work to protect it, but it is really designed for the slimmer iPad Air 2.All the holes are in the proper places and it is comfortable to hold. It is easy to install and remove.

"First of all this is not designed to put your phone in and leave it like a traditional ""case"".  It was designed to be a temporary housing for your phone in situations where you phone might get wet or you want to take your phone in water.This waterproof cases performed as advertised. It will fit a phone up to an iPhone 6 however anything smaller will also work. I put my iPhone 5s with battery case in it and it worked great. It fits easily in the case and the touch screen still works through the front plastic.It keeps your phone dry but be careful when opening it after getting it wet.  If it hasn't air dried for a while I'd keep it tipped almost upside down when opening it because some water can get in the plastic area above the seal.Overall this is a great product at a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPQC7MJ3YZIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01590KDH0#wasThisHelpful","R2LPQC7MJ3YZIM","ANYTXWI3WZDCH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANYTXWI3WZDCH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable is great! I've got a lot of micro usb cables and so far this one has had the best performance that I have tested. I did a test to check the performance of this cable vs one of the regular mirco USB cables that came with another device.First of all, typically you get better results out of a shorter cable and in this case I'm comparing a 6in standard cable to the 6ft Crabby Digital premium cable. As far as the device I was charging for the test, I tried several different devices and settled on a 20000mAh power bank as it was getting the highest throughput. The images speak for themselves. The standard cable only gave an output of .25 amps while the Crabby Digital premium cable gave an output of 1.44 (up to 1.58) amps to the exact same power bank. That will give you significantly shorter charging times.The flat style cable has its advantages and disadvantages. It doesn't knot up as easy but you pretty much have to coil it back up the way it came or else it looks like a mess.Overall, this is a great cable with great throughput","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SP6P2STYKJ3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ68L0E#wasThisHelpful","R2SP6P2STYKJ3B","ANYTXWI3WZDCH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANYTXWI3WZDCH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Upon receiving this travel pouch, my 8 year old daughter fell in love with it.  While it's meant for carrying cash and passports, it's now her purse for EVERYTHING and its perfect because she can take it on her bike and its super easy to carry.  She throws her iPod in and is ready to go.  There are pockets everywhere in this thing.What I like- TONS of pockets- Feels secure- Zippers and materials are quality- Great for traveling but has many other usesWhat I don't like- No complaints yetOver all if you need a travel bag or something to just keep track of all your personal items, this is perfect!

"This is a great little keyboard/case combo for the iPad Air.  The keyboard is very easy to pair with the iPad and the keys are very responsive.  I was very impressed at how easy it was to type on the small keyboard.  I was able to type with relative easy without looking at the keyboard at all and the keys were all where I expected them.  I only have one complaint with key placement that you'll see below.Things I like- Easy to setup- Very responsive keyboard- Keys are well spaced- Simple to pair with iPad Air- Protects iPad while not in use- Keyboard detachesThinks I don't like- Adds significant bulk to the iPad.  It's almost 1 inch in thickness- The lock button is TOO close to backspace and is not paired with the function key so it is easy to accidentally lock the iPad while typing.- Not real practical to use in portrait modeAll in all this is a good keyboard case combo.  Typically when you're looking for a keyboard you can expect added bulk.  Making the lock key work only when ""function"" is pushed would be my only suggestion for improvement.  I still give it 5 out of 5 stars because the lock key is not a deal breaker for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QTDQYYB5I55R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEGG4S8#wasThisHelpful","R1QTDQYYB5I55R","ANYTXWI3WZDCH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANYTXWI3WZDCH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this battery case because my previous battery case destroyed my iPhone 5s battery.  This happened because when the iPhone was fully charged, the battery case continued to supply power rather then turning off.  Over time with my battery being constantly charging it wouldn't hold a charge.  Enter this case.  It is MUCH better.  After it charges the phone it powers off.What I like- Powers off after the iPhone is charged- Protects phone from drops (I've dropped it a few good times and it's been safe)- Can fully charge my phone- LED status light on the backWhat I don't like- A little tricky to remove case- It does warm up quite a bit while charging (feels like I have a hand warmer in my pocket)- Adds quite a bit of weight to the phone (but you would expect that)Over all this is a great case and I would get it again.

"First of all I got this from the Amazon Warehouse so it was classified as ""very good"" condition. You can see in the pictures that the box it came in was re-taped shut. I will also admit that I have never owned or even used a torque wrench before.  The good news is, this wrench appears to be good quality and was pretty simple to operate.  I also operated as expected.  I purchase this to tighten the oil plug on my Polaris RZR to get it to the proper torque.What I like- Pretty easy to use (instructions were helpful)- Quality tool- Worked as expected- Comes with protective caseWhat I don't like- Torque only works when using it clockwise (which was fine with me because that's all I needed, but may not be enough for some customers)Overall I was very satisfied with my purchase.  Torque wrenches are expensive so I was happy that I could get a little bit of a discount from the Amazon Warehouse and the tool turned out great.

"Right out of the package I was very impressed with the quality of this shade.  The material is looks like it will last for a long time.  The hardware is also great quality.  For some reason I expected Harbor Freight quality but it was not.  I didn't install mine in the greatest place, but I just put it up there temporarily so that I could try it out and take pictures so you can see what its like.What I like- Very high quality (material and hardware)- Very easy to install- Rain proofWhat I don't like- Unless you want to be using a lot of rope, you really need a cluster of trees pretty close together- Doesn't provide a ton of shadeThis sun shade has a pretty specific application and will be perfect for those in need.  It's not going to shade the whole yard by any stretch, but if you have a place in your yard or park (or even camping) where you need a little more shade and protection from the rain, this is for you.  The quality is there and for these reasons I give this a 5 out of 5 review!

"I've had mine for a couple years now. They still work great and hold a seal even when re-used multiple times. I've heard a few complaints about them, so I wanted to mention a few things in my review that worked for me.Here are some tips to getting the bags to work really well. Use the proper size bag and do not be tempted to overfill them - use fewer items in more bags and use the proper size bags. For instance, fold bulky bedding fewer times (so they're flatter) and place them in large bags rather than in smaller bags with a bulkier fold/stack. Place the items deep into the bag, and leave plenty of space near the seal. You don't want anything pushing the walls of the bag apart near the seal. When closing, pinch the clip firmly and go over the seal a few times, making sure to go all the way to the edges. Do not try to bend or fold the bags once they're collapsed and don't cram them into snug spaces (in other words, be sure to store them in such a way that if they do happen to break their seal and expand, that won't cause a problem).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVHFDIVANXGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035Z9CYM#wasThisHelpful","RSVHFDIVANXGX","A3FW29GQ2BNLHI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FW29GQ2BNLHI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"it's difficult to find unscented poured pillar candles in beautiful colors. If you can find them, they are usually poorly made, with aerated wax that burns too quickly and smokes. The Richland candles are proportioned correctly, made with solid creamy wax and a thicker wick to prevent wick-drowning or core-burning. The colors are rich and gorgeous just like the photos, and the color runs all the way through - not white with a color dip. They're long-burning and nearly odorless.

"This is a very clever device. Super easy to use - no learning curve whatsoever. I've been using cardboard donuts forever to make pompons... never again! I ended up wasting so much yarn the old way - tediously trying to get my pompons consistent sizes and perfectly shaped and trimmed. The Clover eliminates that process entirely! Your pompons come out exactly the same size and perfectly round every time. Only a few snips required for a perfectly round ball with a velvety-smooth surface. No more tedious pom-pom haircuts! You can make them as plush as you like, and they're still a cinch to tie. I'm gonna buy a bunch more yarn and cover my house with fat, plush, colorful pompons!

"I'm disappointed in the quality of this wicker box. I purchased some of these a few years ago, and the old ones are great quality, with evenly woven, strong, flexible wicker, square corners, lids that fit. THIS file, however, is barely better than junk - not really worth the money, in my opinion. Just unwrapping it out of the thin plastic bag broke off several pieces. It's very lopsided and loosely-woven with the same chunky, stiff, brittle wicker they make cheap baskets out of. There are big gaps all over and the lid doesn't even fit. It's been coated with some sort of varnish that gives it an even cheaper appearance.

"Sharpie makes some of the best markers out there. I've used so many brands of markers in my design work, even some very high-end brands, and none are as juicy, pigment-saturated, and long lasting as Sharpie. A few things I like about Sharpies: The color saturates the paper evenly so you don't get as much stroke/overlap marks as with other markers. The solvent base does not destroy paper like many other markers - even thin or delicate paper. Sharpies contain a lot of product. Other marker brands are fat, so they look like they hold a lot of juice. But side by side, in identical jobs, my Sharpies outlast even the most expensive brands of design markers.They're not really intended for pro illustration/design, so they don't come in a wide variety of colors (yet). The cap colors don't really match the pigment very well. But what they lack in that category they make up for in quality and price. I wish all markers were this good.

"I've used Otterbox with several Apple devices over the past five years and this was my least favorite.  I actually returned it for a refund.  Here's the deal...Description says it has a portrait viewing angle but it really does not.  Sure, you can sit it in a Portrait viewing angle but the cover, which turns into the stand, does not have any feet or pegs or slots to support that angle.  So, unless you are completely still it falls down.  Landscape mode is much better but you really only have one option for viewing/typing which is an awkward angle for my taste.  There is a second landscape viewing option which is completely upright, which is designed for movie watching but it falls forward if you aren't completely still.

"I've tried many - I'm talking at least 15 different iPad cases which I either sold on Craigslist or returned for a refund.  All of them had something wrong - mostly design flaws, some construction flaws.This is very well made and so incredibly versatile.I love hanging it from the knobs on my kitchen cabinets when I'm cooking and referring to recipes.  I sometimes hang it on my door knob to remind me to take it to work in the morning.  The best part is the portrait viewing angle.  Most cases are in designed for landscape viewing which behooves me why the designers and manufacturers haven't figured out a lot of programs are in portrait only - especially note taking apps and journaling apps.  The portrait mode allows you to move the device from almost completely flat to completely up right and every angle in between.  The landscape viewing is less versatile but very convenient and sturdy nonetheless.  Perfect viewing angles for watching movies.I use a Speck case for my iPhone 5 as well which I absolutely love.  I will be using all Speck products for my Apple devices from here on.Very happy customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R269RRECMYIGO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JGB4RQ#wasThisHelpful","R269RRECMYIGO4","A2RIX3T3I9AGC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIX3T3I9AGC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No glares, no concerns with scratching the screen and the same responsiveness as no screen protector.  It seems pricey but well worth it.

I have a stronger signal in my bedroom (opposite side of the house) than I did with my Comcast modem, I can even stream movies in my bedroom on my iPad now, something I wasn't able to do before.Regarding Comcast device protocol - I was told by their tech department that even though they could ""see"" it was working, it wasn't one of their two approved devices for replacement of their modem (and subsequent $7.00/mo modem fee being waived).  However, I called back the rep who opened my account several times and I spoke with several people in customer service and now they have removed the monthly modem fee from my account and gave me a credit back to the beginning of my service (several months back).I definitely recommend this for Comcast customers.

"I absolutely love this little guy.  It works fabulously and diffuses/mists approximately 6-7 hours before it needs a refill.  If you use it with the light on, your water evaporates much quicker (3-4 hours), I'm guessing because of the heat from the light.  I bought this on August 26, 2012 and have run it constantly, day and night and it has been wonderful.  Its a pleasure coming home and my house smells like lemons and oranges.  I use 5-10 drops of organic lemon essential oil and sweet orange essential oil both which are anti-fungal and anti-viral.  If I could afford it, I would buy one for my bedroom and the office of my house.  I highly recommend.  I can't remember the last time I was more satisfied with a purchase.UPDATE JAN 28, 2013:Ok.  So I decided to give my unit a thorough washing the beginning of January (I purchased mine Aug 2012).  Afterwards, I couldn't get it to cut back on.  I figured I got water into places that shouldn't have received water.  I called the manufacturer to get some advice they never called back.  Amazon was less than helpful (one of the few times this has happened).  So, I began messing around with it and behold!  It DOES work!  Its crazy... sometimes I have to hold the ""on"" button down for 10-20 seconds.  Sometimes I have to hit the on button several times and then hold it down for a few seconds but it DOES come on every single time.  So, to all of you out there who say your until stopped working, if you still have it in a closet somewhere, break it out and mess around with the on button.  You never know.I still use mine every single day 24/7 and its great.Happy essential oil diffusing!

The buckle is simple.It would seem that it will be too warm to wear on hot days, but I plan to use this as a general hat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TIAH8X3X2EUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076OBDNG#wasThisHelpful","R3TIAH8X3X2EUE","A6CBY6KJNOYON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6CBY6KJNOYON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My last diffuser had recently died. (I also bought it here on Amazon, and it was a great little thing.) I used my last diffuser everyday and it eventually wore out. (I was careful and maintained it often.) I plan to use this one just as much. I came upon this one due to the good reviews and different type of design.I use every night with my Doterra essential oils. Depending on the oil, you'll need to add a few more drops or less. The mist is great and I find it suits my needs. I use this in a decent sized apartment bedroom and it works well. This product is also easy to operate and quiet. (My last diffuser had a beep when it shut off.) It's not completely quiet though, I find the gentle water bubbling sound quite soothing.It has a large basin that accommodates plenty of water. The one setting is continuous and the other has 20 second diffusion intervals. The lid/top does not screw or latch on, so be careful with pets or children. The light also has two settings: alternating bright to dim, and continuous light. (And off, of course.) One of the main features that I had researched was the fact that it shut off when water was low. This one does just that, so I am pleased with that feature.The grey color I ordered was fine for my decor. The size is taller than my older one, but that's because of the design. (See my picture for approximate size reference.)I recommend this product for your essential oil diffusion needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RC5XC014NOKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9SKES8#wasThisHelpful","R3RC5XC014NOKF","A6CBY6KJNOYON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6CBY6KJNOYON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I  pull this thing out every late Autumn and place on our bed, and now in early Spring, I have to now remove it because it's too warm to have it on our bed now, even when shut off. Here in Southern California, we don't get year-round use of this blanket but it works for us in the ""colder"" days of the winter months because we do not have any central heating.Before we retire at night, we turn the thing on and go brush our teeth. By the time we're done, we get into a nice warm bed. I suggest you plug this directly into a wall and not a power strip. Unless it's a ""heavy duty"" power strip, you won't get the same kind of power output. My side wasn't as ""warm"" as my husband's and I realized that it was on a power strip. Plugging it into the wall solved that problem and now we enjoy the same warmth.It's great that you do not feel the wires, unless you really look for them. It's also nice enough to leave on your bed for the rest of the year if you live in a cooler area. I've had this for a few years now and I wish I get more months of use out of it, but that's okay. I love the adjustable setting (we have the Queen) and can set it to what we want. I also love that you can set it and it shuts off after 8 hours. (I can't count how many times I've forgotten to shut it off after running out the door in the morning for work. But it shuts off automatically.)This isn't your ""grandma's"" heating blanket but I'd definitely get this for grandma as a nice and toasty gift. ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11AJWCKFOYESB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L1R3PM#wasThisHelpful","R11AJWCKFOYESB","A6CBY6KJNOYON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6CBY6KJNOYON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Got this in Beige and Black. Both are nice and I use them often. Great for use in the heat as it is lightweight and ventilated. It is lined a bit in the crown, so that's a nice plus. It is your standard ""paper"" hat, but it is my no means ""cheap"" in quality. It's is of decent quality and is made well. (It's not a cheap costume type hat, if you know what I mean.)

"I've been looking for a long-lasting eyeliner without having to get the gel kind, etc. This one is great. I've used the ones from Avon and also others in the drug store and found that this one lasts much, much longer that ones I've tried before. I use eyeliner everyday, and I can't seem to find a ""waterproof"" one that lasts even for a few hours.I use on my waterline and on my lash line. I only need to apply once, and maybe another time after about 5 minutes. (Because blinking seems to always thin it a little, right?) I find that it lasts all day. Usually, by the end of the day, my eyeliner is non-existent on my eyes. With this one, I can see that I still have it on and don't need to re-apply.

"This is a nice fashion piece. Simple, yet really adds to your wardrobe. I find that this dark grey color is great because it's not black, yet not light grey. The felt/wool fabric is a bit more flexible and more floppy-ish than other hats I own. Like most hats, it isn't lined inside, yet it has a black ribbon ""sweat band"" inside. This is a nice light-weight hat, but won't feel like it will blow away.It is definitely crush-able and compact, however I do not recommend it. The one thing that I did not like about this hat is the way it was shipped. It was folded into one of those mail-able, plastic, opaque, mailing ""envelopes."" So this caused my hat to acquire a noticeable bend/crease in the brim and the crown part. I was unable to use it that day for an event I was going to attend. However, since I understood that wool/felt could be ironed, I did so under the proper low-iron setting. I was able to iron out the deep creases and it seemed to come out better than new.I also didn't like that it took longer than usual to arrive, possibly from the seller's destination.

I've conducted a ""shake test""...I've placed my iPad into the case and tried to shake it upside-down to see if it would fall out onto my bed. No, it stayed in place. I did notice that it shifted slightly. I may place some thin craft foam between my case and iPad to create some more thickness. OR I may simply add (sew)in another thin elastic going vertically. (I may be paranoid but I'd rather be safe.)The elastic was NOT loose as previous reviewers have stated. I did not see any ""warping"" either but then again, I've only had it one day. The knob there is pretty flat so it does not look like it will interfere with anything. I don't see any interference with the zippers anywhere. (I'm thinking some previous reviewers here have the misfortune of receiving a defective one OR that the company has improved their product.)The outside of it already has some leather ""scratches"" that I will assume will increase as I use it. I can't wait until the normal wear and tear adds to the character of it. I like how the inside of it is soft and almost plush. It definitely has some sort of soft layer for cushioning.Overall, I know I will get lots of use out of it. As a student, this will provide added safety since it could blend in with my other books.

"I bought mine for about the same price from BB&Beyond. I wanted the tan colored one so that it will look like a paper coffee cup from a distance like the ones you get from the coffee shops, but they had no more in stock.Anyway, the cup does it's job. It's light but sturdy, it's functional and good looking. The brown part helps keep your grip on the cup as well as keeps your fingers cool. It cleans well and I haven't had a problem yet. I use it almost everyday, even for my cold drinks. I love that I can take it to the local coffee shop and they fill it up for me without having to use a paper cup. Sometimes the the coffee tastes like the paper cup and this plastic cup eliminates that ""paper-coffee"" taste. I don't care about the ""environment"" mumbo-jumbo but I don't like to be wasteful either so using this cup helps prevent my trash from filling up quicker and again, eliminates that dreaded paper-coffee taste when using paper cups.I like that when I'm done with drinking my coffee at work, that I can re-fill it with ice water or soda and it keeps my drink cold for a long time.This cup cleans well and the coffee doesn't stain it. It's comfortable to hold and it fits well in my car cup holder. My boss thought I was buying coffee everyday not knowing that I was re-filling my cup with my own coffee at home.

"Pros:-Very useful.-Bounces the on-flash light.-Lightweight.-Sturdy construction.-Not flimsy. The plastic feels nice and thick.-Fairly good in size.

It won't really fit in my camera bag.-The black drawstring pouch isn't as good in quality as the Lightscoop itself.

"I did not buy these cards here on Amazon. I found them at your local famous named ""dollar"" store.

For example, on the King of spades it has: 'Temple of Doom: ""Cover your heart Dr. Jones!""'If I had found these here, I'd have definitely picked up a set. And yes, there are scenes from all four movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19IOZEMEUMGJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027OXHZC#wasThisHelpful","R19IOZEMEUMGJO","A6CBY6KJNOYON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6CBY6KJNOYON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Tamrac (sub-compact) bag JUST for my Canon XSi (kit) wasn't cutting it. It's a nice little bag but it didn't have much cushioning and only an itty-bitty pocket in the front. Which is why I invested in this Slingshot 100.This bag makes me feel like I can take my camera anywhere! It feels well protected an insulated enough to take a few minor bumps here and there. The 100 is just perfect enough for my XSi and two lenses. (Or a lens and a flash unit with a bit more room to spare.)The way it swings over to have easy access to your gear is wonderful! This bag was really thought out and you just know a photographer was there in the design of this bag.Ladies, the pocket on top and in front can act as your purse. So now you can have your purse AND camera in one place.Guys, your wallet can either fit in one of the pockets OR right next to your camera.The strap fits comfortably and just fine. (Yes, it sits between your bust ladies. If you have a larger bust...no problem!) The padded strap adjusts quite nicely. The bag didn't make my neck or back hurt. (Then again, I got this small bag so that I WOULDN'T carry a lot of gear with me. What would be the point of my back hurting? If you want something to carry more gear, I recommend the SlingShot 200 (or 300) or the Lowepro backpack-type series.)I would buy this bag again in a heartbeat. It was worth my money. When I was doing my research in the local camera store, I compared it with the other bags and nothing came close to the padding plus functionality of this bag.NOTE: The day I got this bag, I was heading for a 'halloween' type amusement park and I DIDN'T want to take my gear. (Yuk, dark flash pictures of guys dressed up as monsters?) I ended up taking out the adjustable padding and using the Slingshot 100 as a purse. I placed nothing in the outside pockets. (To keep the people behind me in line from possibly pickpocketing something.) And I placed my wallet, glasses case, make-up bag, etc. in the zippered camera compartment. Easy access to everything! And it was drizzling that night...the weather cover did just nicely!(P.S. It was Knott's Scary Farm.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AOIGWOJVTPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BAX50G#wasThisHelpful","R26AOIGWOJVTPM","A6CBY6KJNOYON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6CBY6KJNOYON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This card is a great alternative to fumbling around with different sized cards. I just wanted this ONE to deal with so I decided to get this 16gb sized one. For example, I've already taken about 300+ pictures and I am still able to take over 2500+ pictures left on the card. I don't have to worry about it getting full right away or having to deal with downloading often if I don't want to.It's fast enough for taking pictures on my Canon Rebel XSi DSLR camera.

"This is a great product. I've owned it for about a year and it works wonderfully.I used it on my leg and it caught on my shorts. It ended up breaking the plastic inner ""teeth"". I love this thing so much though that I am willing to find a replacement part for it.It works best when you've removed the dead top layer of skin. You need to exfoliate. (The instructions say so too.)If you don't, you will end up going over the same area more than twice and it takes you longer to finish the process.It works great on my arms too. I tend to ""bite the bullet"" and take the pain. After the initial pain of it, you actually feel the pain less and less. (Maybe it numbs it somehow.) If I really feel it, I use ice to numb it further.

"The Truth. That's it.This series reveals how God's Truth has been distorted and has been changed throughout history. It also shows how truth's you thought to be correct are in fact wrong. And this series doesn't stray away from the Bible. It isn't ""emergent"" or ""post-modern"" in any way. It sticks to the facts and set's you back on course on the Truth. There are lots of visuals and lots and lots of revealing scriptures.Our church was showing it and decided to keep showing it. We were glad because some of us want to see it again when time permits. There was never a time when we didn't want to leave our seats.

"This fits in my purse and my husband always has his in his back pocket.It has a soft dark blue cover with the Celtic cross and other designs ""embossed"" on the front. The spine has the same embossed look but with the ""Holy Bible"", the ESV Seal, ""English Standard Version"", and ""Crossway"" on it. The back is plain with only ""True Tone Series"" and the ISBN number on the lower right hand corner in very small letters. The cover is a soft leather and will gather small scratches dull out a bit when used. It does not take away from the beauty of it though but gives it a nice ""worn in"" look.The words are in a very small font with the words of Christ in red. So if you don't mind the small font, it could work for you. This bible contains footnotes, a ""Weights & Measures"" page and a condensed Concordance. The outside pages are silver in color which fades after much use. (But don't they all?) Pages are good enough to hightlight passages and it won't seriously bleed through.About the ESV:This version is wonderful. I really liked the NASB but this ESV ""version"" is the closest to it. (Being that the NASB is the closest to the original Hebrew & Greek, ESV is the closest to the NASB but in a more ""flowy"" manner that doesn't ""water"" the Word down like the NIV does. Some of my friends and I like to joke that the NASB is the ""Yoda"" version. The sentences are not as nicely structured because of the almost ""literal"" translation of it. The ESV fixes that.) Plus the ESV version is endorsed by J.I. Packard, R.C. Sproul, A. Mohler, W. Grudem, etc.My church has switched to the ESV and this bible is perfect because I can  easily carry it with me. Not to thick, not too long, and not too big, but it isn't too small either. The look of it is nice as a gift, which is how I got mine. At some bible stores, they will have them emboss your name on it if you wish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2449GPK5CZN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1581347650#wasThisHelpful","R2449GPK5CZN1","A6CBY6KJNOYON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6CBY6KJNOYON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little guy is great. It combines my cell phone & Palm in one...and for us gals who have to go fishing around in our purses for them, it can be frustrating. Well, the Centro helps eliminates that. (Hence, ""smartphone"".)I have my schedule, alarms, task list, phone, e-mail, IM, text, web at one place. (It has other features that is also useful, like the weather, e-books, camera, voice memo, music and Sprint TV though ""Sprint Power Vision"" where you can listen to the free radio there.) There is much more though!Anyway, the phone is just the right size for my pocket. It's not too small and not bulky either. (I AM using the clear hard case I bought at the Sprint store which is very sturdy and has a tight clip for securing it to your pocket.) And I can see how the letters are a bit cramped where it would be a small challenge for somebody with large fingers. But for me it is fine.The screen is very crisp, clear and bright. I find myself having to turn down the brightness at night. It can be seen very well in the sunlight/daytime. (Some of the pictures/wallpapers are very nice looking on it.) With the memory at hand, I only placed five (Classical music) songs for now until I get myself a memory card. And I've already uploaded lots of custom ""wallpaper"", e-books, and games onto it. The speaker is fairly loud and clear with the ringtones/alarms. I find myself having to turn the sound down too. Oh, I love the ""mute"" button on top. I can just walk into church and simply turn the sound off at the switch of a button. (And nobody would see or hear it either.)I chose black, as the red was a little to ""bright"" red for me. (I felt it would draw too much attention to me. But if that's what you want...) The Centro is light but not flimsy feeling. It does have weight so you won't miss it in your pocket too much. (Is that a good thing? Your call.)The camera is ok if your taking pictures bright lighting but there isn't any flash. The video is a bit choppy. But I guess if you want a decent camera, you shouldn't be looking for that here.Oh, and yeah it froze on me once in all the time I had it...but I had a complicated program running. (You just have to remove the battery for a few seconds. You won't lose your data.) Also, it does need to reset a few times on it's own...but I suspect it is only natural as it ""upgrades"" itself on it's own. It doesn't bother me or hinder my productivity.I like Sprint, I've been with them waaay over 10 years with the same phone number. I don't get the best service at my house but everywhere else the phone operates so much faster.

"I got my Rebel G 10 years ago when it was over $200 bucks at a major department store. I've been using it ever since.It's sturdy and feels solid in my hands. The click that it makes isn't too loud but when you place your film in...it sure is pretty loud as it advances. I've used it in all types of weather and lighting situations and it still works fine. (I've done well to protect it from moisture and extreme heat too.) I've invested in a (hybrid digital/film) good lens an now my photo options are expanded. I use the original lens in situations where I can hand my camera to a friend and have them take the picture with the trusty green box (amateur) setting. There are several settings that Canon has on this camera that help you easily compose for the right situation.I'm not fond of the pop up flash as it can be distracting and does not produce lots of light in very dark situations. But good thing it gives you the option of adding another flash of your own onto it's hot shoe.Sometimes the auto-focus is a bit slow though it may be that my batteries are getting low. I rely on the manual focus. The batteries are what hinder me a bit since they are about $12 for a pair of them.Personally, I've had good experiences with Canon. And this camera is no different. It can be used by a beginner or with somebody who knows their way around a camera. This is also a great student camera since you can switch to a manual mode.

"My thumb hurt on my right hand so I decided to get this strap.It just slides on nicely using the slot it has. It is fully adjustable and is pretty sturdy for elastic. It isn't flimsy which is what I wanted. It helps alleviate the weight on my thumb so I don't feel as tired when I play for a long time.This is great for those who march! It was perfect for the Rose Parade because I was marching for a long time and there are a lot of people around. There have been times when people have bumped me hard and if it wasn't for that strap...my clarinet would have been a goner! (On the floor!)It comes off the thumb-rest just as easily as it is placed on. Other than the snickers I get from the sax players, I don't mind wearing it.

I like that this is a 2-pack, one in clear/white & one in light blue.I gave this case 4 stars only because it doesn't protect the front/screen part of the Z22. I find that I can't just place it just ""anywhere"" in my purse. But I would feel safe enough placing it in a lab coat or front shirt pocket.

"Tis book is a series of essays on the struggles, body image issues, and failires of families to accept that their teens are transgender.  It must have take great courage for many of these youngsters to write their stories; or, perhaps, they needed to tell their tales to make us all more aware of the torture, internally, and externally, that many of them endure.My only criticism of the book is that many of the segments are somewhat disjointed and difficult to put together in one's mind in a cohesive fashion.However, that being said, it is indeed an eye opener and perhaps something that trans teens should read as well so they know they are not alone. I particularly found enlightening the chapter on the teen who was actually two sexes - born with a malfunctioning set of ovaries and receiving multiple  feedback that was confusing from different doctors.

"Woman of Steel tells the story of one woman's journey into finding herself after a lifetime of receiving child abuse, neglect, and mixed messages from her parents.  Her mother would beat her in order to achieve some sort of ecstasy only she could feel; her father would stand by helplessly.  Her only recourse were the loving grandparents she was fortunate enough to have that not only encouraged but fostered her psychic gifts.  However, it was sometimes not enough to protect her.  Only Spirit had that capability.After a marriage that replicated her family of upbringing, she married a man who accepted her for herself.  This is a story of fortitude, courage, and insight into not only how spirit can impact our lives and protect, but how humans are so touched.My one complaint about this book was the repetition.  Oh my goodness!  Sometimes within the confines of the same paragraph!  One sentence, then another practically identical.  In addition, I found myself saying ""didn't I read that part already?""

"First of all, I do admire the research and depth that the author went into in writing this book.  This is a truly thought-provoking topic, and one in which I do believe occurs.  She describes in infinite detail how parents may notice a birthmark or scar, or a vocal intonation of a deceased loved one.  When it is a child in particular, often in younger years the child begins to describe such occurrences as dying in a fire, fear of fire, or other such manifestations of a past life.  These fears apparently stem from no where, and these memories are brought forth by the author in infinite detail that is both compelling and convincing.  These are real memories, and when researched, appear to be true.However, there are parts of this book that are just plain overdone and boring.  One gets tempted to skip over these parts - I didn't, but if you are at all familiar with the work of Raymond Moody and others, much of this will not be new.  However, I would recommend if you are indeed interested in the subject matter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N1EMJHZDYGAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061030449#wasThisHelpful","R3N1EMJHZDYGAH","A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I did find parts of this book enlightening as to the various aspects of what the disease does to the patient, in my opinion, far too much of it was highly repetitive.  Now we know Dr. Graboys has impeccable credentials, but the dialogue relative to that topic was a bit overdone.I did like the parts where the family dynamics were mentioned, especially from his children and stepchildren, and the intricacies of the disease.  I was hoping more were written by the author about the dementia facet of his illness.  I also liked the psychological aspects of his mourning his first wife, and the intertwining of that event to his current losses as far as his physical health.However, I do feel that there are better books written on the topic, and while I finished it, I can't say it really held my interest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AJJENAKIOQGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402768737#wasThisHelpful","R2AJJENAKIOQGC","A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a mother, and former Long Islander, it took a lot for me to read this book.  But imagine what it took Jackie Hance to write it?  We were all there at the time; the tabloid trash, the rumors this mother had to overcome; unspeakable horror and tragedy.  Yet, this book was written with such heartfelt love and gut-wrenching honesty that one cannot help but respect this woman.After losing her three little girls in a car accident, Jackie goes through a torturous time of mental anguish that affects her husband, her relationships, and the fiber of her being.  She conceives another child, questions whether or not it is a betrayal of the three girls she has lost to love this child; yet, she rises above this questioning pain, not only to love this child but to forgive the driver of the car, and to rise like a phoenix herself.I loved this book because it demonstrated that love and forgiveness can make us all thrive and grow.  I would say that if anyone ever questions her sincerity, don't - there is a lesson to be learned for all of us in this book.  And that lesson is only through forgiveness can one open up one's heart to growth and spiritual progress.  While the book is raw and gritty and sometimes can make you wince, truth spoken with love is often hard to digest.  Kudos as well to her co-author Janice Kaplan for assisting in making this a fluid, eloquent tale of redemption.  Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T04JST6E47NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147675800X#wasThisHelpful","R2T04JST6E47NH","A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book runs the gamut of emotions in telling the author's journey from childhood dislike towards her mother, to intense love that is reciprocated when her mother has Alzheimer's.  The author relates to us how, as a child, she and her mom were cold and distant with each other, yet, during this time of crisis, they both were able to express ""I love you"" and really mean it.Lisa Hirsch takes us through the diverse presentations of this disease on her mother's part - exhilarated and perky, and the next day confused and disoriented.  She expresses her own emotions as a reflection of how her mother is feeling, and shares honestly on her own blog and in this book how this is truly a family disease.I loved this book on so many levels!  The answers to her own blog from other caregivers were often sad, but uplifting as well.  This illness is cruel as we have no cure; nothing to look forward to, no hope.  Yet, the author has managed to take a sorrowful topic and at times make it uplifting and humored, all the while being grounded in the dark reality that is Alzheimer's disease.  If you are a caregiver, read this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3AANI7ZH25O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615773982#wasThisHelpful","R2M3AANI7ZH25O","A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RJ8YG0RJOHOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These rugs are stunning, with their vibrant colors and non-skid backs, they are so much better than the cheaper or more expensive ones.  The colors pop right out at you. They lose very little lint in the wash, unlike some brands where you have a whole 'nuther rug in the dryer filter when your done!On the negative side, the washing instructions state ""machine wash cold on gentle cycle, tumble dry low"".  Now I have a rather new HE washer and dryer, and tumbling them on low didn't really get them dry.  My dryer has a setting of low ""More Dry"" so I may try that next time.  You wouldn't want to dry on medium, because it sort of destroys the rubber backing, but plain old low didn't dry them enough.3/14/15 - So.. I tried them on Low, ""More Dry"".  Then I ran them on low ""Speed Dry"".  Now maybe it's my dryer, which is new, but these are the only mats I've ever had that didn't dry well.  More than likely, because they are a superior quality to others.  But if you live in a non-HOA community, where you can have a washline, hang them out!

"This book is a must-read for any caregiver.  The author relates to us how she and her husband met again years later after having been married to others.  She a widow, and he divorced, they find the love once again that they shared in their youth, only to have Charlie develop dementia symptoms in his sixties.Carol writes with such endearing descriptive fluidity that one doesn't have to ""imagine"" what they are going through; the reader already knows!  She is brutally frank yet honest, great love yet anger; animosity for being placed in the position of caregiver, but guilt for feeling that way.  Yet, she only wants what's best for her husband.  The conflicts over nursing homes, the failure to recognize loved ones on Charlie's part - these are all part and parcel of this family disease.And resources!  This book is full of resources for the caregiver.Also, I loved the way the author got up on her ""soapbox"" in relating how the middle class elderly are treated as far as funding for dementia care in this country.  Carol ended up living with her daughter because she was forced to ""spend down"" her assets just to fund her husband's assisted living.  She compares this to care in other countries, and this government does indeed sell it's elderly quite short in Alzheimer's care.  So sad.This book is gripping in it's descriptive, engrossing details of the author's journey, and a warning for all who may become caregivers.  Life isn't rosy if you are not wealthy.

"This is an inspiring and captivating collection of angel stories.  This book is not only a great gift for someone, but, if you are going through some daunting challenges yourself, gift YOU with this wonderful work by Joan Webster Anderson.  She has truly outdone herself this time.I could not put this one down!  Each vignette lets us know that there are certain situations that simply could not be coincidence.  For example, the pilot who put his badly destroyed plane down successfully without injury, the pregnant women who successfully drove to find her husband in a tornado, all the while sensing that an unseen pair of hands were on the wheel for assistance, or the lucid dream warning that came to a woman about the health of someone she barely knew, which proved to be a dire warning this woman must act on.Did you ever look into the eyes of a little child, or sense them following ""someone who wasn't there""?  Children have an amazing capability for sensing angels, spirits, and otherworldly beings because their minds are not cluttered with day to day thoughts and have no fear that ""someone will think they are crazy""To quote the book, ""When people are more like angels, earth will be more like Heaven"".  Now wouldn't you like that!

This one is a beautiful silky fabrication, all the shams fit to a tee, and you get a good value for your money.  My only complaint is that both throw pillows are different sizes, but they are the same pattern, and that is just my personal preference, that  they be the same size.It is nice and warm for such a light fabric, I really found it very easy to swing around my oversized King bed.  (Yes, it really is oversized).  You can fold it easily and it fits back in the bag (unlike so many others) because of the nature of the fabric.

So I had no doubt in my mind these would be good, and I was not disappointed.The fabric is sort of a velvet, with fluffy petals all over!  They are inexpensive and durable enough where you could even use them in a kid's room, without worry.  These are a true chocolate brown, so the color is quite true on the web.

The padding on the back is nice and soft and is made into two molded pads across the back instead of one giant, floppy beanbag that you find on cheap lap desks.

"I'm loving this foot file!  I've tried this and the Ped Egg Power Platinum and of the two, this is my favorite.  First is the filing drum.  The Amope drum sits up high in the brackets so you can use the entire filing surface, you can see in the picture that the filing surface is the same height as the arms holding it, plus the drum is curved, making it even better. The Ped Egg filing drum sits down in the brackets holding it by about 1/4"", making it impossible to use the outer edges of the filing surface.  Second, the Amope just feels better in my hand, it feels like a better quality even though they are most likely about the same.  Part of that may be that the Amope takes four AA batteries vs. the Ped Eggs two AAs.  This makes for a heftier tool and a better feel for me, plus the Amopes handle is shaped for a more comfortable grip for me.  The Amope only comes with a single grit filing drum, I'd guess it's a medium grit.  It feels like it's right between the coarse and fine grit drums that the Ped Egg comes with.  Once again, I'd pick the Amope because the nice medium grit works well at taking off calluses, but doesn't leave my feet feeling like I need to use a ""smoothing"" grit on them, like the Ped Egg does.Just like with any battery operated callus remover, don't press to hard on your foot, let the tool do the work and you'll be happy.  Take your time and your feet will feel great!

"I love what Ms. Griffith says at the end of the book. Something to the effect of writing escapism, cotton candy books. That's a great description of what this book is!Blake is a wealthy politician, who is also a bachelor. He seems like a great guy, dedicated to his role in society, but not a guy ready to settle down. He works long, hard hours and when he's encouraged to take a vacation, he does. And a lovely, foreign girl almost immediately catches his eye.I couldn't help but laugh at the way Blake falls all over himself when it comes to Cressida. She is pure perfection, with a streak of human, but she isn't the kind of girl a woman loves to hate. As perfect as she is, she's very down-to-earth and there's something about her that encourages protection and friendship. It's hard to not want to help her.I love that there's a lot of mythology woven into the story, as well as mystery, adventure, and intrigue. The romance is sizzling clean and so much fun. There are a lot of crazy things that occur (both good and bad) and at times, so much happens in so little time, it feels a bit rushed, but overall, this story is highly entertaining and almost a sugar rush. I can't wait to see what other stories will be a part of this series.Content: mild, non-graphic violence (when the bad curses happen); no language or religious elements, aside from the mythology; mild-moderate romance (steamy clean kissing and vague thoughts of more, but not without marriage).

"(4.5) I've followed this series from the beginning and have fallen in love with this family of five boys. I should say ""men,"" I suppose, since they are all grown now and are all gradually making their way back home to their hometown of Seaside. Each book in the series can stand alone.Each brother is so different from the next and bad boy, Cruz, has always intrigued me. Tatted up and ready to open his own tat parlor, he's a rough and tough kind of guy. When a building promised to him is sold from underneath him, he intends to talk the new owners out of using it for their church, but comes to find one of the nicest girls he's ever met--and her preacher father. How can this diamond in the rough be good enough her this family? Once Cruz's tough exterior is cracked open, a soft, gooey inside is found. I really liked him and how he would do anything for anyone. Appearances sure can be deceiving!This story has a slight Beauty and the Beast feel to it, which is one of my favorite fairy tales. Talia is a darling girl, with a love of cleaning and books. I really liked her character and her zest for life. I love how she is able to accept people for who they truly are. Her father is an amazing man and I really love the way he is able to wrap everyone around him in wisdom and love.The setting is fun--a small, touristy town that is now a bit more quiet with the summer season over with and the Christmas snows flying.I felt like the ending was a bit rushed and the series wrapped up a little too quickly (I guess I wanted more), but I did enjoy the journey and loved seeing bits of the other brothers' lives. I'm looking forward to the spin-off series with the cousins.Content: some mild violence (fighting); no language; some religious elements (it revolves around setting up a church and a preacher's daughter, but isn't preachy at all); mild romance (kissing).

"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, but I'll be honest. As soon as I heard this was being released, I pre-ordered a copy. I've read books by each of these authors before and have loved the way they each tell a story and I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.One thing that I absolutely loved about this anthology is that each story takes place in a great new setting--Echo Ridge, NY--with characters that make appearances in each story. How great is that?! I loved getting glimpses into the many characters lives and seeing them through different eyes in other stories. I love the description of the store where they all have a connection to--Kenworth's.Years and years ago, my grandmother worked at a department store in a smallish town and Kenworth's has that same type of nostalgic feel to it. I could picture the candy counter, the soda fountain, the women's department, the window displays, and most of all the Hope Tree. I love the contribution each character had to this charming store and community. There are stories of hope, stories of second chances, stories of moving on, stories with Christmas magic, and most of all, stories of love. I would love to find a town such as this to finish raising my family in!For me, it's impossible to choose a favorite of the bunch. Each is so unique and they all tie together so nicely.  I'm really hoping that we get more of this place and the people who live there (a summer anthology?). This is the perfect book for lovers of clean romance and heartwarming Christmas stories.Content: mild religious elements in most of the stories; no language; mild romance (kissing); mild violence in one story.

For twenty years, he pines for her.

"When I started this book, I wondered what in the world I was reading. This is unlike any Twelve Days of Christmas version I've ever read. The book begins with the narrator giving his enemy trash-- a briar from a tanglewood tree, rusty nails, rotten eggs, etc. I wondered if this was meant to be a Halloween story or a joke, but then it all made sense. What this enemy chooses to do with this garbage is touching and heartwarming. This person truly exhibits a positive attitude and sees the world in a ""glass half full"" way.

"Power of the Matchmaker is a prequel for a new series that will release one new book each month of 2016. Each story will be written by a different author. I love having the backstory right up front so that I can understand a little more of who this matchmaker is and why she does what she does.Mae Li is young and in love with Chen and when the village matchmaker matches each of them with another, she realizes that she can't go through with a loveless marriage, while watching Chen with another. Armed only with a comb, as a token of Chen's love for her, and the clothes she's wearing, she embarks on a journey to escape and find a new path.Mae has many difficult decisions to make but she shows true grit and strength, even though her story breaks my heart.

"The story starts out with Ani discovering that her boyfriend has a family...and her heart is shattered. In an effort to heal, she takes her college graduation trip to Italy a few months early, but a bicycle accident leaves her without a thing to her name. Up to this point, I wasn't sure about the book and if it would draw me in enough or just be a downer, but after this point, I found myself pleasantly surprised to see that everything turned right around and completely engrossed me.I've never been to Italy, but I feel like I've been there now. Ms. Doughty's descriptions are vivid and detailed. Ani first encounters Paulo, but for some reason, although their paths have crossed a few times, he seems reluctant to help her. After the accident, Ani is taken to Dr Cosimo Lazzaro's family home to recover from her accident and finds herself enveloped in olive groves and romance. Cosimo is quite the charmer. Compared to David Gandy, he's very handsome and suave, yet Ani's heart isn't sure about another smooth talker. What's a girl to do--go for a reluctant man, a willing man, or no one at all?I couldn't get enough of the setting descriptions. I also loved the other characters. Each is full of a unique personality and true friendships are formed. I loved the growth and healing that Ani goes through. The surprising romance is toe tingling and believable. I love a story that is brain candy, yet has some substance and this is a perfect combination. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this series!Content: swoony romance (kissing, but clean); mild violence (accident); no language or religious elements, aside from the characters visiting an ancient religious statue and mentioning a prayer.

I love that Ms. Krey can write in a way that really touches my heart, puts a smile on my face, and causes me to feel a part of the story. She has a writing style that really speaks to me.Kylie has twin older sisters and a younger sister and they all seem to be well liked by the boys. With a school Christmas dance approaching, Kylie watches as everyone around her gets asked, while her own heart is secretly yearning to be asked by her best friend, Kole. It's a tough spot to be in--happy for others, while feeling envious and inadequate at the same time.As hard as it is to believe (at least for my kids), I was a teenager once and this story had me flashing back to my own experiences. Is there any girl who hasn't had a crush on her friend? My sister and I are really close together and went to high school together for a couple of years and it was a hard thing to deal with--one of us getting asked to dances before the other. Feelings of jealousy and insecurity are real and I love the way Kylie learned to deal with things. Not only is this a darling YA story, but when Christmas (my most favorite holiday) is thrown into the mix, magic and fun are waiting to happen.I loved the characters, especially Kole and Kylie. Each had an important role to make this story so sweet, realistic, and heartwarming. I've found a new favorite to add to my ""must read every Christmas"" list!Content: no violence, language, or religious elements; mild, clean romance (kissing).

"*I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*I found myself intrigued by this story line--buying ghosts on eBay? What a concept. When Caitlin's cousin orders two ghosts on eBay, one never arrives, but the other one connects with Caitlin (Cat). Through various events, it comes out that Liam, the ghost, is the twin brother of a girl who died on her wedding day and is desperately trying to find her one true love, which leaves a mystery to solve. There are a lot of interesting and creative elements to the story that are fun.Cat isn't a consistent character. She's a virgin, yet she purposely dresses provocatively, especially on first dates, which leads to mixed signals. She also claims to be falling in love with Liam, but she's very flirty with another man in his presence--multiple times. Cat also comes across as being very spoiled and entitled. I love it when she starts climbing out of her self-absorbed world.On the other hand, Liam is old for his age, having grown up in a different era. So much in the world is new, but he's very adaptable, committed, a true gentleman, and loyal. I liked his character and enjoyed watching him quickly figure our way of life out.I enjoy a story that unfolds before my eyes, instead of just informing me of events and there were glimpses of showing here, but most of it is telling. That said, I did enjoy the moments with mystery and action and enjoyed the way the characters went about solving things. The ending is great!Content: This book is technically clean (not squeaky clean), as no sexual events occur, but only moderately, as there's a lot of innuendo--talk of sex, being a virgin (or not), and other things that have to do with these two points; some mild violence; a fair amount of seances, Ouija boards, evil spirits, etc; moderate swearing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15SBROC5IM56Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616507748#wasThisHelpful","R15SBROC5IM56Q","AIDLU1FNYSOHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIDLU1FNYSOHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sweet Christmas story specific to LDS beliefs. I love the relationship between this grandfather, or Papa, and his granddaughter, as it is apparent through the words and pictures on each page. My nine-year-old daughter and I read this together and she was very fascinated with the illustrations, which really brought this charming story to life.I love the way this grandfather has something both tangible and emotional to share with Alice. Sometimes an object means more with the story behind it and this is exactly what is shown in this book. Alice learned a powerful lesson about giving through the story her Papa shared and it really is touching.Highly recommended to any family for the Christmas season. It made me ponder on what we could change with our traditions to included stories or items to share from our heritage.*I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193OZMABB8EAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462117414#wasThisHelpful","R193OZMABB8EAO","AIDLU1FNYSOHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIDLU1FNYSOHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again--I love a cute, first meet and this one is great! We first meet Wendy in Dash and Date, as a competitor on the reality dating show. She is a very no-nonsense, successful, high profile realtor and when her grandma dies, she goes home to fulfill the requirements of the will--to live with and help her brother run the inn for 30 days and then sell it, so that her brother can move on with his life.Wendy can't get over the fact that her parents abandoned her (and her brother), leaving her grandma to raise them. As soon as she could, she left home and never looked back, working hard to make a home for herself. I get all of that, but I wanted Wendy to wake up and realize how much she actually had. I firmly believe if you can't find a way to be content with what you have, you'll never be content and will always be searching for more. She has some towering walls up around her heart, as well. I think Wendy could've used a good therapist. Those moments aside, I really did like Wendy and her determination to work hard. She's a great, complex character.In a moment when her evil twin emerges, leaving her emotions on her sleeve, she meets Max. Of course, he sees her at her worst and still likes her, which is a good thing. Max is a saint--and a good-looking one to boot. I can't think of a more patient, accepting, and kind man than him. He is exactly what Wendy needs, but she may just push him too far--a person can only take so much of being pushed away.I have two favorite parts of the story. First of all, I loved the legend that is associated with this town and the inn. What an incredible setting for this legend to be a part of! I couldn't help but get very caught up in it and the romance that ensued because of it is just perfect. So perfect. I also loved the way Wendy really dug in and did her part to fulfill her duties. By doing so, she got to know herself very well, as well as her grandma. I love the lessons learned and the way things resolved and I'm definitely looking forward to more! Yay for a new series!Content: no language, violence, or religious elements; romance (kissing--some a little intense, but still clean).

"This time of year is perfect for ghost stories and since I'm not big on the gory, over-the-top scary stories, this one was perfect for me. Can I just say, who hasn't ever dreamed of living in, or at least, visiting a castle? I sure have and in fact, a few years ago, I had the chance to see one in Germany. As I stood along the wall and looked out in the distance, I could just imagine people watching for enemies and bustling around in every day life within the walls. These stories were all different, yet had that common castle theme running through them that really kept things interesting, especially as most of the stories had ghosts.The collection starts out with DANGEROUS TRUTH, which is a suspenseful story of an American girl, Olivia, who is serving her way across Europe and encounters who she thinks might be her MIA dad. There are some intense and dangerous situations that arise and with the help of good-looking guy, Henri, she's determined to find some answers. I enjoyed the story, but thought it was a little choppy, as it was mostly from Olivia's point of view and then at the end, suddenly started switching, which threw me off. Olivia is brave, naive, and stubborn, which made for some crazy times.ALL BY MY SELFIE is a fun story in a Scottish castle. Gwen discovers that she's the only one who can see a #ScottishBoyfriend ghost and that leads to chasing a mystery to set him free. The characters are great and the setting is very intriguing. I was very curious to see how it would all end up, as a little romance blossomed, and loved the way it all worked out.A family with multiple sets of twins inherits a castle from Ireland, now set up in Washington state in A SAVAGE GHOST. Lia and her younger sister, Mellie, are more sensitive to the pranks and feelings that are meant to scare the family away, but her brothers are blamed for the mischief. Coop is a crush from the past and he and his family are the caretakers of the castle. I loved the blooming romance, as well as the culmination of events that lead to a satisfying ending in yet another ghost mystery.THE GHOST OF DUNLOW MANOR is a fascinating story of a young ghost who doesn't want people in her house. When writer, Alexis, and her personal assistant come to stay, the ghost takes a liking to them, since they are determined to solve her murder and set her free. I really enjoyed the way the characters interacted with one another, as well as with the ghosts. There are actual two romance stories running parallel to each other and the relationships are gentle and sweet, yet romantic.I found a few familiar characters in ROSE OF SHERWOOD, but with twists. Do any of these names sound familiar? Friar Tuck, King John, King Richard, Robin Hood, Maid Marian? This is a romantic twist on Robin Hood and is full of adventure and peril. I enjoyed the characters and the way the story line worked itself out in a pleasing way to the finish line.All in all, a fun collection, especially for this time of year (October)!Content: I think one or two stories had one or two mild curse words; there are moments of peril, murders, etc, but nothing is graphic at all; the last story had quite a bit of religious elements, but the others did not; all of the stories had mild, clean romance with nothing more than kissing and two instances of unmarried couples sharing a bed with nothing happening and no details.*I received a copy from the tour host in exchange for an honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YFCV1JH9AKPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153LE9KW#wasThisHelpful","R1YFCV1JH9AKPV","AIDLU1FNYSOHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIDLU1FNYSOHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a lot easier to follow the wish of a heart than it is to set it aside and think of others and that's just the lesson that Ruby learns when her mother sends her to work as an elf for the holidays. Ruby is yearning to go to Italy for Christmas, so her long-time boyfriend can finally propose. But when does life work out as planned? Ruby is hard-working and no stranger to digging in and showing determination to get what she wants. In fact, she's kind of a snob at first.North is also working as an elf for the holidays. His harden heart needs to find forgiveness and there's no better way to speed that along than to serve. North is a great character. He's so good with his special needs brother, with the many children who come to see Santa, and with the various North Pole employees, but there are still a few walls that need to come down. He's so kind, but full of pride and really knows how to hold a grudge.There's something magical about Christmas that can change hearts. Just think of the Grinch--his heart and mindset changed with realizations about others and himself and these are similar lessons that North and Ruby learn for themselves. I love stories with growth and transformation, in positive ways, and this is the perfect story to warm any heart, especially with the holidays approaching.Content: very mild romance; mild religious elements (characters attend church).

"Have you ever read a book that just strikes a chord with you? This one did just that for me! When Becca and Carson first meet, and fall in love, they are young. She's barely 18 and at the moment, alone in the world. Who does she turn to for advice about these runaway feelings? Her hairdresser. Uh...probably not the best person to give advice, considering she's on her sixth marriage and has a degree to practice psychology, but doesn't use it. Needless to say, this relationship went bad and all for crazy reasons. Fast forward seven years. Becca is a lawyer in her small home town and in a huge case, finds herself going up against none other than Carson--""He was one of the good guys. Even if he defended bad guys for a living."" For a man who claimed to only give his heart away once, he's got some big decisions to make in the relationship department, considering that he's dating his boss's daughter.I love a book about second chances, especially when the first chance was unresolved. The chemistry was leaping off the pages in flames, yet was clean. At first, I thought Carson was kind of shallow because he really seemed to focus on appearances, but my opinion changed as I got to know him better. I love the theme that sometimes what you think is reality isn't, especially when the whole story or reasoning behind a decision is cleared up. Becca learned a few lessons in this the hard way.The big pluses for me are the characters, the romance, and the humor. Not only are Carson and Becca great, but there are a whole slew of quirky, fun, and entertaining characters, who were really brought to life. Like I mentioned before, the chemistry is incredible and the way Ms. Griffith uses descriptions really ignited it in my imagination. Again, the metaphors and analogies are well done and really added to the humorous situations and I found myself laughing quite a bit. The setting is so much fun! A ghost town? I really need to visit this place. A good romantic comedy has all of these elements, plus a little tension, and they were all tackled in a great way that left me thoroughly entertained and in love.Content: I think there were one or two mild cuss words, but otherwise clean, as far as language goes; no violence; no religious elements; mild-moderate romance (kissing, one character tries to take things a step further, but it remains clean; great chemistry).

"The story started out a little slow for me, as I was trying to figure out how everything and everyone connected, but it quickly picked up pace and had me completely engrossed. Whitney owns two restaurants that are struggling and when she inherits an old hotel in North Carolina, she leaves, to not only try and figure out a way to save what she has, but to try and decide what to do with what she has been given. I could understand her temptation to just sell it all off to get the money to save her restaurants, but what she discovers along the way is more important than all that. So many livelihoods depend on her and her decisions and it's not an easy role to be in.Whitney is a strong, capable woman, one who hasn't liked to put down roots for awhile. I love the transformation that happens when she discovers some old letters and a little mystery surrounding her family. She is so deep and real--I actually cared what happened to her. I loved that this book turns into two stories in one. We get the current situation and these letters take the reader back to the 1930s. Images are very vivid through wonderful descriptions. It made me think that it's a shame letter writing has fallen to the wayside, since we've now lost out on a way to keep memories alive.There are several really great characters in this book. Whitney's step-father, Clyde, is a curmudgeon. In fact, I was a little fearful for her safety around him. These letters did more than just entertain Whitney--they brought many people together, formed bonds, and helped them see each other in new ways. Joel, a wayward teen who needs a little direction; Mark, a shop owner who wants to keep his business alive and who is deeper than he seems; and Denise, the cousin with whom Whitney owns the restaurants.I found deep feeling and emotion within the pages and was caught up in the powerful storytelling. I love the way it comes full circle. The ending felt a little rushed, but I was completely satisfied.Content: very mild romance (implied affairs, kissing); very mild violence (one character is beat up); no language; this book is published by a Christian publisher, but it's not religious--no religious elements.

"What a interesting concept for a Christmas story! Julia is a girl of many talents and trades--she paints, in an edgy way (modern meets history), she's a waitress, and she dresses up as Jane Austen for various events. One night, she falls asleep on her Jane Austen job, and in her rush to get home, she drops a very valuable book. In an effort to locate it, she finds herself meeting book historian, Eliot, who is the man she glimpsed in her midnight run home. Different event bring these two together time and again.Julia is such an intriguing character. She marches to her own drum and almost seems embarrassed about some of her hobbies. She has so many facets to her personality and character and it's entertaining to watch them all come to light. Eliot is more serious and scholarly, yet he has the streak of a dreamer in him. They're both on quests for different things and I loved watching things unfold.My favorite thing about the story is the interactions. Julia and Eliot have the beginnings of chemistry and Eliot and his sister have such a fun sibling relationship. This is a fun addition to any reader who loves Jane Austen and Christmas.Content: no language; mild romance; mild religious elements (thought prayers).

"What an adorable book! I love the Regency time period and each story brought a different offering to an Autumn Masquerade. Now I'm dying to attend one!I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the antics that Lila came up with in A Merry Dance. She has had her heart set on marrying her cousin, who is in America for a time. She is such a great eavesdropper and discovers that her uncle has another in mind for her. Determined to deter this new man, Mortimer, Lila does the opposite of everything a woman should do to attract a man--and finds herself in very humorous situations. Lila is so unconventional and imperfect, but I couldn't help but admire her. She knows her mind and heart, after a few struggles, and follows them. I loved the interesting characters, the fun story line, and the captivating romance.There's nothing worse than having a gorgeous man forget he's ever met you. In Unmasking the Duke, Hannah discovers that the hard way. She's so shy and clumsy, but discovers she's the opposite when she can hide behind a mask. After a stolen kiss at the ball, she's shocked to learn the identity of the man whom she's falling for. Hannah is easy to relate to, at least for me. The power of a mask is so evident in this story and until she truly feels comfortable with someone, it's a necessary tool to hide behind. The Duke seems to have it all--looks, money, title--yet he, too, finds it easier to be himself behind a mask. I loved how this story shows that we all wear masks and all use them to hide behind at times in our lives. That right there endeared me even more to this beautiful romance.What's in a Name is a fun story about twins--identical on the outside, but so different on the inside. My sister and I are just over a year apart and although I don't think we look that much alike, we were often mistaken for one another. It's so easy to fall into expectations based off of what a well-meaning adult wants for her charges. These sisters have an overzealous aunt and it's up to them to be true to who they each are--at a cost. I love how the Duke immediately knows which twin is which, but the aunt has no idea. He truly knows the heart and soul of the one he loves--all through letters--but he knows. I loved the descriptions of the ball and the tender interactions between sisters and suitors.Content: each story has mild romance (kissing); no violence, language, or religious elements.

Without any prospects on the horizon, she turns to Match Made Easy, a paid service, to find the perfect date to show her family she is not affected by ""the curse."" What she gets, or rather...who...is not quite what she is expecting: Trent. Maddie is a little uptight, but so adorable.Trent isn't perfect, but he sure comes across that way. I love the way he was able to handle Maddie and the situations that arose throughout this wedding weekend.I was laughing out loud in so many places! I was feeling embarrassed for Maddie, cracking up over sizzling exchanges and reactions between the two, finding humor in her eccentric family, and swooning over interactions between them.I've read similar themed books before, but never with this much chemistry and laughter. I loved every minute of it and enjoyed the wide range of emotions felt. The characters are well developed and practically jumped off of the pages.This book definitely stands alone, but we do see Jack and Sabrina from Fiance by Fate make a few appearances.

"I read Book 1 in this series, Another Summer. I was curious to see where the series would go and I was surprised at how full of emotion this story was.Josh is a photographer who is somewhat of a loner. Not close to his family for good reason, he does his job and that's that. When a good friend asks him to mentor a new eleven-year-old boy in town, his first reaction is to say no...until he gets a look at the older sister. His world starts to change...in a good way.I have to admit, at first, I wasn't impressed with Josh. He seemed very fickle to only mentor Daniel because of his sister, Faith. I couldn't believe he'd use such a sweet kid to get a relationship, or a hook up, or whatever he was looking for. However, I was in for a surprise when Daniel wormed his way into Josh's heart and changes occurred for all involved. I was also surprised to learn more about Josh and that his reasons weren't clear cut. He has a past that he's trying to cope with. It just goes to show that we have no idea what's going on in the lives of those around us and there may be very good reasons for them to act the way that they do.Faith is a great big sister! She's so compassionate and selfless. I enjoyed learning about her teaching methods and the way she handled the other teachers was very mature. Faith has a boyfriend, back home in Texas, and I would have liked to actually see that relationship. It's mentioned that they've decided not to be exclusive, but there's no interaction between then until a shocking discovery is made and he comes to visit. Even then, he didn't act consistent with someone who's so casual in commitment.Daniel is a gem! He's zesty, sweet, energetic, and spunky. I love how he's the glue that holds so many people together.I felt that things wrapped up much too quickly and would've liked more resolution, but it's still a great addition to the series.Content: mild romance; moderate religious elements, considering the father is a pastor; nothing else of note.

"(4.5 Stars) I received a copy of Book 2, The Fisher Brothers stories, in exchange for an honest review.I love stories that build on each other and that's just what these novellas do.  In The Christmas Bell, we meet the oldest Fisher brother, Ben. He's got a successful business in CA, but is home in Christmas Town, Maine for the holidays. Coming from a long family line of fire fighters, he decides the perfect gift for his father, the fire chief, is to find the missing bell and bring it home. Ben is a very determined character, who is also a little insecure and clueless at times. He is so adorable, in kind of a dorky way, and I couldn't help but to like him.Andrea is an old high school classmate, one who always seemed to have it all. Determined to make her own way in life, she's now into history and antiques and Ben contacts her for help finding the bell. I love how independent Andrea is and the cautious way this friendship develops into more.What good is a love story without a little misunderstanding, some mistletoe, and a cozy, heartwarming setting? I loved this town, this family, these characters, and their story. I love a small town with a homey feel, well established traditions, and this really came through for me. *****In Making Up Under the Mistletoe, we treated to the story of the next brother in the Fisher family--Josh. Josh married his high school sweetheart, Ivy, eight years ago and they've had quite a marriage. He is a fire fighter with his dad and brother, Rick, but his heart is set on moving on and having a break from Christmas Town. On the verge of divorce, Ivy and Josh have to figure out what really matters if they want to have any chance of saving their marriage.I'm chalking it up to marrying so young, but this couple really has trouble communicating. Ivy is so set on helping her dad and doing what she thinks is best that she doesn't ever really hear Josh and his opinions. On the other hand, Josh, otherwise known as Crash, is a risk taker, knows what he wants in life, and thinks he's doing what's best for his small family, but he doesn't stop to talk about things with Ivy. Too much assumption going on!I loved the Christmas miracles that occurred in this story. I grew to love the characters and to understand them and their motives. My heart was touched with this enjoyable story.*****My Christmas Hero really hit home for me! Rick is next in line to be fire chief, but has to continue to prove himself, since his dad is the current chief. He's a very commanding, yet likable guy and I easily fell for his character.Julianna, or Jules, is a sweet local girl who does odd jobs, including that of a dog walker. What hit home most is that she's not a perfect woman. While walking a dog, she ends up stuck in a tree and has to be rescued. And that's only the beginning! Her day goes from bad to worse and Rick's right there in the middle of it all. I relate best to Jules because we're a lot alike.I love the way Rick is able to take an embarrassing situation and turn it around. He is challenged to ask Jules out, but is determined to follow his own timetable when it comes to love and not that of someone else.

"I read the first book, Before the Clock Strikes Thirty, and really enjoyed it, so I couldn't wait for this one. Rachel knows what she wants after finishing law school--a nice, prestigious job and some money. A hit to the economy leaves her digging for change to make ends meet and her pride won't allow her to work just any old job--even a job offered by a former crush. Henry is tall, rich, and full of charm, but he's been burned before and a little leery of falling in love again.I love Ms. Mace's writing style--the witty banter, strong yet flawed characters, and humorous but romantic storyline. Rachel takes a job as Henry's secretary and finds herself doing all kinds of crazy work, including buying him gourmet cookies every day. These were great characters and I did like them, but there were times when I wanted to tell them to wake up. They were both a little hardheaded and missed things right under their noses. I also liked Rachel's friend, Shannon. She relies heavily on Rachel and goes in circles about decisions, but she is a lot of fun. Book 1 is her main story.This is a great workplace story with fun main characters interactions, especially with the assumptions and misunderstandings scattered throughout, and thoughtful gestures. I always enjoy a good, clean romantic comedy and this was definitely one that I was in the mood for.Content: Clean!*I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ON8VD40IA25R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621086216#wasThisHelpful","R3ON8VD40IA25R","AIDLU1FNYSOHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIDLU1FNYSOHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read most of these Timeless Anthologies and it's often very hard to choose a favorite, since they're written by some of my favorite authors. I think it's a brilliant idea to compile a specific author's works into one book!Although I've read most of these stories before, it was so much fun to reread them. I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed the love letters in Between the Lines. The poetry and eloquent speaking was so romantic! The insta-attraction and adventures between Dani and Mark in Firsts and Lasts had me swooning. Natalie and Adam's reunion in Golden Sunrise was toe tingling for sure! I found myself almost rooting for them to have a Vegas elopement. William was so sweet and charming towards Claire in A Taste of Home, much to her surprise. I guess annoying little boys do grow up nicely. I thought War of Hearts would be depressing, but how could it be when two former lovers reunite across the world in times of war, giving themselves a ray of hope in a dismal situation? And I absolutely loved the new story, never before seen in a collection--Our Song. It's so easy to take life and relationships for granted and to think the grass is greener on the other side. There were some sweet and important lessons learned in this story and I thought it was a great kickoff to the book.Each of these stories hit the sweet spot in my heart in different ways and I enjoyed every minute of them. I love the mix of contemporary and historical. I love the clean romance and felt my stomach drop in anticipation so many times with thoughts of the sizzling chemistry. I love the characters and the relationships they all had with both friends, family, and each other. Those are the threads that really tie a story together and this one is definitely a favorite!Content: mild kissing; Clean!*I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QZ0T7QK5SN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106WTIMM#wasThisHelpful","R32QZ0T7QK5SN","AIDLU1FNYSOHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIDLU1FNYSOHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I reflect on life, I've come to realize that you never know what will happen to change the path you're on. Sam is living the life of a playboy, much to his parents' dismay. Fun times, casual dating, and fast cars are more important to him than anything else--until an accident puts him into a coma.Sam's brother reads to him from a journal while he's in the coma and Sam suddenly finds himself transported to 1915--100 years earlier. I loved the events that took place to lead him to important realizations about himself and life.The book mostly takes place in the past and I enjoyed the characters and the simpler way of life. I really got a feel for the way things were back then and the relationships that people had with friends, family, and townspeople. There is a tight sense of community and many families suffered from trials and hard times and all banded together to support one another. I don't live too far away from where the book takes place and it's fun to picture how things looked 100 years ago.I couldn't image how the story would wrap up and I was satisfied with the way it all played out. I would've loved an epilogue, but it is still a fun story.Content: clean romance (kissing); no language; mild religious elements (characters are religious and there are one or two instances where it really plays a part, but most of it is in the background); mild violence (murders). Nothing is graphic, but detailed just enough to give the reader of what's going on.

"This is the fourth trilogy that takes place in Fircrest, WA and by now, I really feel that these characters are my friends. The characters come and go throughout each of the books and I love seeing them beyond their stories.I have to admit, I didn't like Meredith or Asher much in previous books, but getting to know them better and watching their transformations changed my mind about their characters.Meredith is a very strong willed woman and she throws everything she has into relationships, whether it be friendships or romances. It's all or nothing with her and because of that, she leaves herself wide open to being hurt and finds herself being very cautious. Asher is similar in many ways, but he's not one to hold back. When he sees something he wants, he goes for it. He puts on such a bad boy front, but I love how the Matafeo men can make him cower.Meredith and Asher team up with a friend to form an online dating site and I loved learning more about it. The ideas are so creative and the new characters introduced are intriguing. I really enjoyed that aspect of the story, along with the humor. There were some misunderstandings that had me feeling terrible for a character, yet they were pretty funny. As usual, the clean romance is always my favorite part! I loved the references to music and the ending was absolutely perfect for the story.Content: no language; no religious elements; no violence; mild romance (kissing).

"I love this series! Cleo is such a fun and strong character. She's been a bodyguard for her good friends, Rayne and Ivy, but she's not as tough as you might think. She has a very tender heart and a soft side that is endearing. She's a health nut and fiercely loyal to those she loves. I found her likeable and similar to me in that I love to eat well and exercise, but I love my treats too. I really need to try these cronuts--are they real?!I really enjoyed getting to know Cleo better. She has a way about her that brings down walls. Her new roommate is very bitter, but after a short time with Cleo, the walls come crashing down. Cleo is very open to love, craves to have someone to call her own, and after a few hesitant moments, she fully embraces it when love comes knocking.I loved the feeling of family that was felt throughout the story. Strong bonds of loyalty are built and the process is very enjoyable. I also loved the threads of humor woven through the storyline. There are many humorous situations and the way the characters handled these, along with the stressful times, really made me like them all the more. The romantic moments were my favorite, of course. There are moments of peril and suspense that are found throughout this series and wrapped up nicely. I'm so excited to continue on with the next trilogy and can't wait to see what happens next with this beloved town of Fircrest!Content: clean romance (kissing); moderate violence (attack, attempted kidnapping, beating, etc); very mild religious elements (brief prayerful thoughts mentioned); no language.

"I remember reading the first book last year and I really enjoyed it, feeling both sorry for and hopeful for Sophia. This book seems to pick up right where the first one left off and you definitely need to read The Skeleton in My Closet Wears a Wedding Dress first to get the full story.Sophia is young--19 and divorced--and is at BYU, trying to get on with her life. She has a new love interest, but just can't seem to get over her past. Love is blooming all around her and she really has to turn inward to figure out what she wants and what she deserves.I did enjoy Sophia, but at times I just wanted her to get over it already. As a more ""mature"" adult, meaning more experienced and older than 19, it's easy for me to say that, but to be hurt so young isn't much fun, I'm sure. That said, I can understand the length of time it takes for her to process things, but it dragged on in places. The more I think about it, the more I realize that the story took a natural course, instead of being rushed or forced, which is good. Luke is a keeper, if only Sophia can wake up and realize it.There were many humorous moments that had me smiling and almost blushing with embarrassment. I'm prone to awkward situations and klutziness, so it was fun to laugh at someone other than myself.The journey to self-awareness and growth is painful at times, but I loved the lessons learned and overall, I really enjoyed the storyline.Content: no language or violence; mild romance (kissing); moderate/heavy religious elements, LDS, (churchy moments, mild preaching, etc).

"I've enjoyed this series. Each book stands alone, as each one tells the story of a different character, but characters from other books play very minor roles. What's different about this one is that WWI is over and life is moving on in England. Colin is set to carry on with his family's large estate and needs to find a way to get the money to save it. He does let his father control him a little too much and doesn't have the guts to follow his heart.Nora doesn't have anything holding her back in Iowa, so when she discovers that she has inherited a distant family member's sheep farm in England, she sells everything off and leaves. She's used to hard work and moving doesn't change that. She's very likeable and finds herself in a little love triangle, while dealing with a mystery. Someone wants her gone and she needs to figure out who and why.The mystery had a few elements and one was easy to figure out, but the others were a little trickier. The mystery, combined with the clean romance, really added to the gentle story and helped move things along at a good pace. The secondary characters were a pleasant bonus.Content: no language; very mild violence (brief mentions of war); moderate religious elements (Christian--church, church choir, prayers); mild romance (kissing).

"Sophia is like a Barbie doll, but she realizes soon after a quick marriage during her freshman year of college, looks don't always keep a man. I haven't ever been in this situation, so I can't exactly relate, but I honestly can't imagine going through what Sophia did--and all by the age of 19. College life is tough, but to add a divorce in the mix has got to be really hard.Sophia and her situation tugged at my heartstrings. She was thrown into the world of adulthood, but then pulled back into the world of a young adult. Her confidence seems shaken and it's hard to break out of that, especially when she still holds onto hope. I loved watching Sophia gradually open up to trust again.I thought Luke was a great friend for her and his understanding of her and her situation was priceless. What a great guy! He's one of my favorite characters.Sophia's roommates? Wow. One of them was especially bad, but I think the others could have been extremely supportive, had they known what was going on. I think too often, we're quick to decide how others will feel and react to situations without giving them a chance to prove our thoughts wrong. It's the natural human way.I really enjoyed the growth the characters went through and it was fun to be taken back to my college years.Content: no language or violence; mild romance; moderate/heavy religious elements, specific to LDS church.

"I love this cover and it fits the story perfectly! It's very intriguing and gorgeous. As mentioned in the description, Lucy is a ghost and a lot of mystery surrounds the reasons why.I get a little leery of paranormal stories because some of them are really far out there, but this one, even though there's black magic and the occult, was handled in a clever way that didn't leave me feeling icky. I really enjoyed the mystery of it all and the way things unfolded. There's plenty of adventure, magic, and creepiness (especially the rats) mixed in with a great clean romance!Lucy is a very determined character who has her flaws. Philip, a servant, has issues too, but they way they work together to figure things out is wonderful, leaving the reader with a deeper sense of who they truly are and what they each have to deal with in life.I don't want to give things away, but I really am impressed with how the story was written and how it all came together, although I felt the ending could have been stronger.Content: no language; mild, clean romance; mild violence/horror; Clean.**I received a copy in exchange for an honest review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPFWWVKS9UOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462116728#wasThisHelpful","R2YPFWWVKS9UOV","AIDLU1FNYSOHR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIDLU1FNYSOHR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I normally where a 2X, which is what I first ordered.  It shipped fast in a USPS Legal size Priority Mail envelope.  How they got it in that envelope, I'll never know, because it was already bursting open in my mail box  (but the vest was not exposed or damaged.)The surprise was when I tried the 2X on -- Way too big, like maybe it was mislabeled at the factory (Made in China -- but high quality workmanship.)So I sent the 2X back and ordered a XL, which came in fast today.  The fit was much better, but still on the loose side.  I could easily where a thick sweater or a couple of shirts underneath.  I think I won't try an L, I'll stick with the XL.This is a cold-weather garment, and I can't see anyone wanting to wear it in the summer, or even when it was just cool out -- unless they ripped out the sherpa lining and made it into a two-piece (shell and removable liner).  Looks like that would be easy to do.  And I might just do that to make it an all-season vest.I like the pockets.  Two big ones with a slant opening on the outside bottom, and two smaller side-entry with a zipper on the outside chest.  Only one large pocket on the inside, open at the top, and attached only to the sherpa lining, not to the shell.  My 8.4"" tablet fits in it nicely.  Could also carry a pistol, but I'm not sure if the sherpa lining is strong enough to take the stress and weight of a weapon.Dickies web site shows this style as discontinued, so I guess they will come out with a different look next time around.  When the seller runs out of these, there probably ain't no more.  So if you are inclined to get one, better do so before they are gone for good.  I have seen a few on other websites, but not anywhere near this low price.EDIT:  Not that it is available anymore (discontinued by Dickies) but this is now my favorite ""jacket.""

"This is the head that actually grabs the inside opening of the bearing so you can hammer it out.  this review is for the 15 MM size, but it applies equally to all the other sizes.If you are a mechanic, you probably would buy an entire set of several different sizes, plus the driver rods.  But if you are a bike owner with only one bike or two, you only need the right-sized head -- which is the diameter of the axle rod that fits though the bearing opening -- and a large screwdriver.  You will likely need a separate-sized head for the front wheel bearings and the rear wheel bearings.The way you use this is a two step process:1) Set the head onto the bearing, and2) Drive out the bearingTo set the head in the bearing, rest the flat slotless side of the head on a 2x4 block, or some solid surface at a height so the center of the wheel rests on the same surface as the head when the wheel is placed over it.  The slotted end of the head is what grips the bearing, and it should project out of the bearing an eighth inch or so.  With a flat-head screwdriver, or with the driver rod (sold separately, or included with a whole set) insert the wedge end into the slot of the head and drive the driver into slot with a hammer as far as it will go.To drive the bearing out, remove the center support block so there is a clear space for the bearing to exit the wheel.  Tap on the driver rod with a hammer (I use a baby sledge) until the bearing slips out of the wheel housing.  This may require quite a bit of hard hammering if there are a lot of years on the bearing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHFCKSRJ1JVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WJJ4EW#wasThisHelpful","R3LHFCKSRJ1JVK","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see this design all over the internet in two colors - red or green.  When you look at the pieces that comprise it, you realize they very likely all come from the same manufacturer(s) in China, with a few different options.I got my mine (red) on sale, with a big discount, and free shipping to the store.  This thing weighs a lot, so shipping is a big part of the price.  The best price deals seem to have a ""ship to store free"" option.I use mine as crawl seat when working low on my vehicles.  It is tad tall for a creeper seat, but it sure beats bending over or resting on a knee or two.The rubber tires inflate up to 30 psi, and each tire is rated up to 300 pounds, so this rolling seat can handle a lot of weight.  If you are rolling on concrete or a hard surface, use the higher pressure to roll easier.  But if you are in the garden, or on soft dirt, a lower tire pressure is better (allows a bigger contact area) to keep from sinking into the dirt.This isn't a precision machine -- It fits together loosely (for a machine) with noticeable slop (wobble) in the moving parts (steering and seat).  But the wheels are on ball bearings and the things works fine and rolls easily for its intended purpose.  And its made of steel so it can take considerable abuse.  You might be tempted to tighten the steering mechanism, but just bring it to just short of snug, or you will make unnecessarily hard to steer.  The nuts that go with the bolts are self-locking, so you don't have to worry about them coming off.All and all, it is a good, useful piece of equipment, especially if you get it at a good price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9HBROCCQSR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HG2YOU#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9HBROCCQSR1","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These come in three modes -- white, black, and four-colors (red, blue, yellow & green), four cubes to a set (16 wire panels).  The panels are 14"" by 14"", and the wires in the grid are spaced 1-1/2 inches apart.The panels (grids) are all identical in size, so you can mix match them if you wish.  And you can stack as many cubes together as you have space for.  They are light enough so you can pick up a considerable number of them and move them around.They go together easily with the included plastic connectors, but for best results use plastic cable ties (2 to 5 cable ties per joint, depending on the number of corners joining) to reinforce the connection.  You can also put these together without the plastic connectors, using only cable ties.I find them very nice looking, and very sturdy (with cable ties).

It is also priced about $70 more than the Pro 8.4.The Note Pro also comes in two screen size (10.1' and 12.2""), while the Tab Pro and Tab S (will) come in three sizes (8.4"", 10.1"", and 12.2"".)  Otherwise, they all have similar top-of-the-line specs and features.The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro is just below the Tab S at the very top of the Tab line.  The Tab, Tab 2, Tab 3, and Tab 4 are successive budget models, while the Tab Pro and Tab S are the elite high-end (and expensive) versions.  It (will) comes in four flavors: WiFi only, and WiFi plus data (3G/4G), combined with either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage.  It also comes in two colors: black, or white (I guess that would make eight flavors.)COMPETITIONAs I go through the features and specs below, I think it will be increasingly clear that Samsung has targeted the Tab Pro 8.4 to one-up (or more) over the Apple mini-iPad Retina -- and at a significantly better price-point ($350+ versus $600 for a comparable Retina.)  And there are numerous comparisons available in print and on YouTube, most favoring the Tab Pro 8.4.  Just google ""Tab Pro 8.4 versus mini-iPad Retina"" to find the comparisons.CASEThe Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is ten percent taller, four percent narrower, and maybe a smidge thinner than the Apple mini-iPad Retina. The two are almost exactly the same weight.  The Tab Pro 8.4 has a pleasing simulated-leather back, which is very realistic in look and feel, including stitching. The mini-iPad retina has a metal back.O/S, RAM & STORAGEThe Tab Pro 8.4 runs on Android 4.4.2 (Kit Kat) which is the latest released version of Android -- seems to be a very stable and a well executed O/S.  I have yet to run into anything funny or alarming with it.  One thing I like very much about Kit Kat is that the O/S manages your memory for you -- you no longer have to worry about where things go.  And it has a massive memory/storage capability -- 2 GB RAM, plus 16 GB of fast internal storage, plus up to 64 GB external micoSDXC storage, for a whopping 80 GB of very fast combined on-board storage capability.In comparison, the Apple min-iPad Retina does not have a user-accessible external storage, so once you purchase your mini-iPad, you can't add more storage later.  Apple does offer sub-models with more internal storage, but at a greatly increased price, for example at 64GB, nearly $600.  Compare that to an 80GB Tab Pro 8.4 at $400 ($350 for the 16 GB Tab Pro + $50 for the 64GB microSDXC card.).ANDROID 4.4 (KitKat) - Writing to the micro SD card.Some forums have been complaining about the restriction on 3rd party apps not being able to write to the microSD card when running under KitKat.  So I address that issue here.  This applies to all Android devices running KiTKat (Android 4.4), not just the Samsung brand or the Galaxy Tablets and phones.The Google Android Team has begun enforcing a restriction in KitKat (Android 4.4) that was put in place in early versions of Android 4 that requires the app creator to give permissions to ""foreign"" apps on moving what the app owns or creates.  This is a security enhancement to prevent rogue apps from malicious actions on your device.Prior to KitKat, the default was ""permitted,"" which didn't require the app creator to do anything.  However, under KitKat, the default is ""not permitted,"" so the app creator has to specifically allow permission to move a file it owns or creates (if the app creator wants to allow a ""foreign"" app to do this.)This primarily affects 3rd party apps like ""File Commander,"" which can no longer move apps or files it didn't create from ""device storage"" to ""external storage"" (it can not write to the microSD card.)Samsung's own native file manager, named ""My Files,"" does not have this restriction -- it can write to the microSD card, and it can move files to the microSD card of other apps that have given it permission to do so.  Generally, if you get an app from Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, it has given Samsung's file manager permission to move it's files and write to the external storage (the microSD card.)So your first source of added apps should be Samsung's Galaxy App Store.  Apps sourced elsewhere may or may not have been updated for KitKat (Android 4.4)USER GUIDEThe 175 page hyper-text user manual (available only on-line) states that some microSD cards may not be compatible, which influenced me to by a Samsung-brand 64 GB microSDXC card.  A very small-format printed Quick-Start guide comes in the package, but you can download the digital User Guide from Samsung's web site (even before you buy), which is more comprehensive.CONNECTIVITY-- WiFi & BluetoothThe Tab Pro 8.4 has the latest versions of Bluetooth (version 4.0), and WiFi (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac),.-- Infra Red BlasterInfra Red Blaster provides an all-device remote control.-- HDMIThe tab Pro 8.4 does NOT have a dedicated HDMI port, though it does support a USB to HDMI adapter, which you can purchase at many outlets, including Amazon.com.-- WiFi DirectWiFi Direct allows you to connect wirelessly with multiple devices (that also have WiFi Direct capability) and share information and files.  WiFi Direct may not be immediately useful to you, but it is a feature you would probably want in all your future devices.-- USB to PCNormally, when you connect a handheld device to a PC by USB cable, the device becomes just an external storage device to your PC (or Mac), and no other features of the device can be used while so connected.  If you do this on the Tab Pro 8.4, you will see two new storage devices on your PC:  ""Card"" and ""Tablet.""  ""Tablet"" is the internal storage (16 GB) that comes with the device - don't mess with it.  ""Card"" is the external microSD card that you can install, and add files to from your PC. If you go about changing folder and file names you didn't add, you can screw up your device. When you are connected to a PC by USB, the Tab Pro 8.4's battery will not be charged.  So you should have the Tab Pro 8.4 fully charged before attaching it to a PC by USB cable.-- KiesSamsung Kies is software to install on your PC or Mac which enables you to connect safely using a USB cable to update firmware, synchronize files, and transfer data much faster that Bluetooth.  You can also synch with your PC's Windows Media Player (but forget synching with Apple iTunes - Apple just won't cooperate with Samsung or Google in any way.)You download Kies to your PC from Samsung's website. There may be more than one version -- You use the latest version For the Tab Pro 8.4.  After you install Kies, it will ask you to download a Samsung Kies USB driver that will increase the speed of the connection.When you use Samsung's Kies software to connect your PC by USB cable to the Tab Pro 8.4, you won't see the Internal and external storage drives.  Kies will perform firmware upgrades, and while doing so, you can't use the device for anything else.  However, if you are just transmitting folder and file, or synching, you can simultaneously use the Tab Pro 8.4 features and apps. Using Kies makes transfers safe, and it knows where to put your music, pictures, and videos. For those files and folders, Kies will give you a choice whether to store on the internal storage or external microSD card.-- OTGI don't find any information or spec from Samsung about USB OTG (On the Go), which would allow the USB port to host external devices connected by USB (such as an external USB flash drive or an external GPS antenna.)  However, some reviewers report that it does support OTG.  OTG requires a special OTG USB cable/adapter, which is available from Amazon.com and other outlets.To check it for myself I connected my USB flash drive by an OTG USB-to-microUSB cable, and I could see all the files on the flash drive, and the Tab Pro 8.4 could open the files that it had a type for, such as graphics, music, and video files, and some documents.  If it didn't know what file type the file was, it couldn't open it. So OTG (with an OTG USB cable)does work.When you are properly connected to a flash drive, you find the flash drive within the app named ""My Files.""  Open ""My Files"" and on the left side of the screen will be a list of ""folders"" as follows:- - - Device Storage (that's your internal 16 GB or 32GB storage)- - - SD Memory Card (f you added a microSD card), and- - - USBDriveA (if your flash drive is properly attached)When you are finished with the flash drive, don't just disconnect it - first unmount the flash drive.In comparison, the Apple mini-iPad Retina has the same Bluetooth and Wifi, but not Direct WiFi.  It has USB to its proprietary Lightening connector, which is about the same size as a microUSB connector.  Apple touts its lightening connector as very high speed, but that would only be true if the PC on the other side has USB 3.0.  Leave it to Apple to be as incompatible as possible with any other standard.  The mini-iPad Retina has no IR Blaster, nor capability for additional user-furnished storage. The Apple mini-iPad Retina does not mention OTG, so I can't say whether or not it has it.PROCESSORA Snapdragon 800 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Processor (with 2GB RAM), and on-board GPU powers the Tab Pro 8.4, which is the most advanced and fastest processor used in Android devices.The mini-iPad, by contrast, uses a Apple A7 CPU, which is no slouch, but only 1 GB of RAM on board.  In throughput test comparisons, the edge goes to the Tab Pro 8.4.DISPLAYThe Tab Pro 8.4 has a 5% larger screen area than the min-iPad Retina.The Tab Pro 8.4's also has a higher pixel density -- display resolution is WQXGA (2560 x 1600 pixels) at 359 pixels per inch.  That is better than Apple's retina display (2048 x 1536 pixels) at 326 pixels per inch.The aspect ratio of the Tab Pro 8.4's screen is 16:10, which is the same as my computer monitor - so everything I see on my PC screen can be shown in even higher resolution on the Tab Pro 8.4.A 16:10 aspect ratio is nearly the same as the HDTV aspect ratio of 16:9.  Contrast that to mini-iPad's aspect ratio of 4:3, which causes HDTV content to either be truncated on the sides, or the HDTV image to be very small on the screen.Samsung's default screen settings are a little too dim for my tastes.  The Tab Pro 8.4 really shines with blazing, vivid colors at slightly higher brightness levels.  The downside to increasing the brightness level is that the screen (which is the primary culprit in battery usage) depletes the battery faster.White is the color with the highest battery drain (white requires all color pixels to be on).  So the use of white backgrounds should be eliminated or minimized.  I created a wallpaper that is just a totally black rectangle (stored as a .jpg file).  The black wallpaper allows images on the screen to stand out better, even at reduced brightness levels.  I also set my Kindle app to ""white type on black background"" for the same effect.  Finally, I created a lock-screen which has my logo on it on a black background.Clearly, the Tab Pro 8.4 is positioned to compete aggressively (both feature and price wise) with the Apple Retina mini-iPad.  Excellent, very sharp images on the display (depending on the resolution of the image itself).  This is the type of display that you only want high-definition images on.MULTI-TASKING / MULTI-VIEWINGAll Android devices can multi-task, but you can normally only view one screen at a time for any running app.  The Tab Pro 8.4 allows up to four multi-tasking apps to be displayed simultaneously, and you can pair any two so they always show up together.  This is a great feature for comparing two documents side by side, organizing files into different folders, or displaying a graphic in a separate window while browsing a document.  It is a big step that brings much of the power of the PC display to the Android Tablet.BATTERYHere the edge clearly goes to the mini-iPad Retina with a 6,470 mAh battery to the Tab Pro 8.4's 4,800 mAh battery.  That translates to roughly 10+ hours for the mini-iPad Retina versus 8 hours for the Tab Pro 8.4.  Of course, user time will vary greatly - depending on screen brightness, sound volume, and the number of apps open.  If you need more time between charges, consider purchasing a mobile battery extender, and/or invest in a car charger.BATTERY CHARGER (wall mount)The supplied Samsung USB Battery charger is rated at 2 amps, which is designed to rapidly recharge the device.  Don't use any battery charger with less than a 2-amp capacity (which would include most cell phone charges) - they won't charge rapidly, if at all.The same goes for the included Samsung USB cable - it is designed to handle a 2-amp load on recharging.  Other USB cables may not be able to handle a 2-amp current.ERGONOMICSThe Tab Pro 8.4 is (in my humble opinion) the perfect size for a handheld mobile device.  Any bigger display/device, and you would have trouble holding it with one hand.  Any smaller and you would be sacrificing clarity and resolution.The Tab Pro 8.4 has a higher aspect ratio (16:10 to mini-iPad's 4:3), which is easier to hold in one hand.  And the higher aspect ratio of the Tab Pro 8.4 is better for watching HD movies and video content.That this size tablet is the new norm is testified by the fact that my wife and daughters have pretty much abandoned their larger iPad and smaller iPods for the mini-iPad.  And I have pretty much done the same for Android devices.  While my wife and daughters are designer brand afficionado snobs, and will probably always choose Apple over Android, they were impressed by the Samsung Tab Pro 8.4's display.CAMERATwo Cameras -- 8MP Rear + 2MP Front.  That is better than the mini-iPad Retina's cameras (5MP rear + 1.2MP front.)  Not the highest resolution for professional photographers, but very good for the price range, and excellent for the amateur.  The higher camera resolution allows a wider utility for the digital zoom without undue pixalation.  And the Tab Pro 8.4's rear camera has flash, which the mini-iPad Retina doesn't.  Both have auto-focus.  Neither have an optical zoom.GPSThe Tab Pro 8.4 has a fully functional on-board GPS.  And it is fully compatible with Google Maps and Google Earth.  The Apple mini-iPad Retina does not have GPS.SOUNDThe Tab Pro 8.4 has stereo speakers on the bottom (same as the min-iPad Retina.)  Surprisingly good sound comes out these tiny speakers - no deep bass, but good enough to listen to movies and music without earphones.  Put on some HiFi earphones for the best sound, or plug into some quality big speakers with a woofer for that big bass component.MUSIC PLAYERAt first glance, the included Samsung music player (simply labled ""Music"") appears to be just a plain, simple, featureless music player.  But it is actually a very understated, but feature rich, player.  I mention it here because it would be all too easy to prematurely dismiss it.You access the features from the Music screen by tapping on the small ""Options"" icon (three vertical dots) in the upper right corner of the screen, and then tap ""Settings,"" and then ""Player.""  It would have been better (and much more noticeable and convenient) to have these in tabbed folders directly from the player screen, but it is what it is.The options under ""Settings > Player"" are:- - Sound AliveThis is a multi-feature that has ""Basic"" and ""Advanced"" tabs.Under the ""Basic"" tab is a graphic square layout that allows you to choose a setting between ""Instrument"" and ""Vocal"" (Karaoke effect) in five levels on the horizontal; scale, and simultaneously a setting between ""Treble"" and Bass"" in five levels on the vertical scale.  Some of the setting possibilities are labeled, such as: Classic, Normal, Pop, Rock, and Jazz.Under the ""Advanced"" tab is a seven-band equalizer, and three special effects choices for ""3D,"" ""Bass,"" and ""Clarity.""Available under either ""Basic"" or ""Advanced"" is a ""Tube Amp Effect"" that puts a little reverb in the sound.  The ""Tube Amp Effect"" is only available with the earphones plugged in.-- Adapt SoundIt is either on or off.  I'm not sure what it does, but it only works with the earphones plugged in.- - Play SpeedYou can slow the music down, or speed it up -- by quite a bit - using a bar scale.- - Music Auto Off.Turns the Music player off after a time interval you choose.- - LyricsProvides song lyrics.  It is an on/off switch, and I presume you have to be subscribed to Google Music, or some lyrics service, to use it.- - Smart VolumeIt is an on/off switch that adjusts the sound level of all music tracks to level 13.The options under ""Setting"" > ""My Music"" are:- - TabsTabs allow you to choose which attributes you want to be able to sort your music by (Playlists, Tracks, Albums, Artists, Folders, Genres.)  ""Playlist"" and ""Tracks"" are mandatory defaults.  In addition, when you sort, you can choose to sort by where your music is stored (Bluetooth folder, Music (internal storage), external SD card.)- - PlaylistsThese are the default playlist choices (Favorites, Most Played, Recently Played, Recently Added) plus any playlists you created (in another screen.)Other Music options directly on the music player are music ""Shuffle,"" and ""Repeat.""  ""Repeat"" has the following settings: play all, repeat all continuously, and repeat once.BUILT-IN APPS & APP MARKETSBoth of these devices have a slew of apps to choose from, running in the hundreds of thousands.  The edge in apps probably goes to the Apple mini-iPad Retina because any app for Apple usually runs across all of its product lines, regardless of O/S version.Android apps tend to be more device and O/S specific - many apps created for older Android versions, or a specific manufacturer, or made for cell phones, won't work on the Tab Pro 8.4.  Google Play Store will advise you if you try to buy or install an app that is not compatible with your Android device.  And it asks you to report apps (with a single tap) that stop working, so it can prevent future downloads until the app is fixed.The Samsung Apps store is now called the Galaxy App Store (tap the ""Galaxy App"" icon) should be your first resort to look for Apps.  Samsung has produced a line of apps specifically for its Galaxy lines, and new apps are being added all the time.  Samsung is serious about bettering Apple in every way, including apps, many of which are not available on Google Play.  And some apps originally designed for the Galaxy Note also work on the Tab Pro, and are free.- - SAMSUNGThe included Samsung apps for the Tab Pro 8.4 are in a folder named ""Samsung"" while the Samsung App Store icon is now named ""Galaxy Apps.""  That is a little confusing, so I thought I would mention it, because the ""Samsung"" folder icon looks just like an app icon rather than a folder.  When you tap on the ""Samsung"" icon, a window opens up with the included apps displayed (Alarm, Calculator, Downloads, Help, KNOX, S Voice, Side Sync, World Clock.)- - KNOXThink of Knox as in Fort Knox - a place of high security.  Knox is the secure (encrypted) part of your Tab Pro 8.4 - password protected.  When you tap on the Knox icon, it prompts you to create a password and creates a secure folder for all your Knox-secured applications and files.  It then opens a table of secure (KNOX) versions of applications, some of which are free, and some you might have to pay for.In addition to the included apps, Samsung includes a $25 voucher for your choice of apps to purchase (from the Samsung App Store, not Google Play.)  Some very powerful business apps in the Samsung store may be free, such as the Hancom Office set (HOffice, Hword, Hcell, Hshow, etc.) which will give you all the power to read, modify, and create Microsoft Office compatible documents.INTERNET BROWSERSTwo internet browsers are included.  Both are mobile versions, and both will look for a mobile version of the website you are visiting, but both will also provide full internet browsing.- - Google Chrome Mobile, just labeled ""Chrome,"" will synch itself with your Google account (if you are signed in.)  And if you have tabs pinned on your PC version of Chrome, they will also be pinned in the mobile version.  What you won't get with the mobile version are the apps and extensions that your PC version of Chrome can have.  But word is out that Google is working on adding the apps and extensions to the mobile version, with a target release of late 2014.  Chrome will allow you to zoom in and out on the web page.- - Samsung mobile browser, just labeled ""Internet,"" has a different tactic - you set the ""small"" print at the level most easily read by your eyes, and the content is sized accordingly.  You can still zoom in and out on the web page.  I had my doubts about this small print-setting tactic, but after using it, I rather like it.CONCLUSIONIt may be debatable exactly what the best hand-held thing on the market is now, but the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is right up there at the top - feature wise, and price-point.RECOMMENDATIONI, as a rational engineer, would pick the clearly superior Samsung Tab Pro 8.4 over the Apple Mini-iPad Retina. I bought one for myself.  And my wife said she was going to upgrade to the Tab Pro 8.4 and abandon her Apple mini-iPad.And I would definitely recommend the Tab Pro 8.4 to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPM7H4ZIAIL4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWMPRNY#wasThisHelpful","RPM7H4ZIAIL4Z","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I looked at a lot of 2-line phones, and there is a major price jump from one-line to two.  But for me, the consolidation of phones sets and regained desktop is more than worth the price - and that is especially true for the well-priced, top-performing VTech DS6151 2-line system.The base set includes one handset, and I especially like that is cordless.  Each cordless expansion phone comes with a charger, and are boxed as a single expansion set.  The 3-pak is just three separately boxed sets.  Most vendors will sell the base and as many expansion sets as you want.  You can add up to 11 additional handsets (total of 12) for a single base.I bought the phone base (DS6151) separately from a three-pak extension set (DS6101) from two separate vendors and saved a bunch, and both arrived within 1 day of the other.The expansion phones will not work without the base, But the base can be used by itself for those who don't need extensions.  VTech also offers a headset (IS6100) for this model, which plugs into the side of the handset.The 2013-14 models seem to have corrected all the complaints from prior years.  I found the sound quality to be excellent, the volume range quite wide, and quite loud (and clear) at the highest setting.There are two line jacks on the base.  Line1/Line1&2, and Line2.  If you have one cable carrying both lines (standard 2-pair telephone cable with a single plug) then you just use the Line1/Line1&2 jack (4 contacts - the inner 2 for one line, and the outer 2 for the other line.)  If each line has a separate cable, then one cable plugs into one jack, and the other cable plugs into the other jack.  The second jack (Line 2) only has the two center contacts.  In most cases, you won't have to worry about it.I don't use land lines anymore, and I just plugged into two MagicJack-pluses plugged into a router hub on my home network -- no problems.Some notable features of the DS6151 are:0) Very intuitive, logical and labeled layout of buttons, and LCD panel and option selections.1) A very clear, comprehensive 90-page user manual is included.  The expansion handsets come with a 16-page user manual.2) Each line can have its own ringtone.3) Each handset can have its own ringtones4) Each handset has a speaker option5) The base has a separate speaker option, and can make and receive calls (on speaker) without the handset.6) The base has a full-feature digital answering system, as well as a separate voice mail for each line.7) You can screen incoming calls8) Caller ID and Call Waiting are supported (if your telephone service provides it).9) Speed dial (up to 10) Directory (up to 50)  Entries can be made from any handset, available to all handsets.10) Hold, flash, call transfer, and redial.11) Intercom (individual handset or all), find handset, conference calling12) Record a conversation.13) Missed call indicator, and callback feature (callback requires caller ID service)14) Character chart on p.40 of the user manual -- very handy when you want to find a particular character.And I probably left out some features.All-in-all -- an excellent, full featured, 2-line phone for the home and small business office -- at an unbeatable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YHX34878YFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CTI9FY#wasThisHelpful","R15YHX34878YFC","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this model because of the great number of reviews, the great majority of which are very positive.  The other reason I chose this model was for the quick-connect feature.This charger/maintainer is suitable for all types of batteries -- car, truck, motorcycle, ATV.  It is so fail safe that you can't hook it up wrong and damage it.  it is not suitable for a quick charging a low battery, however -- only for overnight charging, and keeping it charged.I especially like the ring connectors, which fasten permanently to the battery, while allowing a very quick connect and disconnect of the charger.  The ring connector has a cap attached to keep the plug clean when not in use.  I like this feature so much that I wrote Schumacher and asked how I could get two more ring connectors -- and they sent me two, not only for free, but delivered by FedEx.  That was before I learned you can order extra ring connectors from Amazon.Connecting the ring connectors to a motorcycle battery is straight forward, as the battery cable clamping bolts unscrew without any problems.However, a car battery cable clamp can be a little more difficult, as the tightening bolt isn't designed to come out of the clamp easily (it is designed to be retained by the clamp on loosening.)  However, the clamping bolts can be forced out so the ring can be inserted with the bolt through it.  Takes a little effort, but it can be done.  And once done, is quite worth the effort.  An alternative to forcing out the clamping bolt is to cut a slot in the ring of the ring connector so it is a c-shape and can just be slipped on the clamping bolt without having to remove it all the way.All-in-all, a great automotive battery charger/maintainer.  Perfect for those who don't drive often enough or far enough to fully recharge the battery after starting, or for batteries left for long periods without use.I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QJBKX7G31G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009IBJAS#wasThisHelpful","R39QJBKX7G31G5","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was about to buy the cheaper version of this when I read in one user review that the Ken Onion version was now available.If you want to put a convex edge on a blade, this is the premier tool to do it.  There is a cheaper version by the same manufacturer, but the Ken Onion edition is heavier duty, has wider (3/4"") belts, and you can operate it almost continually.Convex edges of a blade provide the most durable and sharpest edges, but are also the hardest type of edge to do by hand, requiring exceptional skill.  Work Sharp makes it easy, and the Ken Onion edition does it best.The only drawback is the price.

"I now use cedar shoe trees in all my good foot wear.  They preserve the shape of the shoe, dry up any sweat inside the shoe and prevent mold.  But cedar shoe trees are not cheap, so when I saw this pair at a very good price, I bought them.They are just as good a quality as my more expensive shoe and boot trees, and at considerable savings.

"I have all the VHS tapes of the original Star Trek series.  So I am a Star Trek fan.  But like the old Beta-Max player, VHS players are becoming rare items indeed, and a few of my cassettes have some shipping damage.  So I wanted a Blu-ray disc set as a more permanent, easily stored solution.  When this set came on as a special, my price-point value was met and I grabbed them.Well, the Blu-ray set is even better than the VHS tapes, having enhanced graphics.  The story line is still the same western-movie formula, over-simplified morals, Capt. Kirk save the girls and beat up the villain.The equipment and tools mock-ups seem primitive, and technology references dated .  In one of the episodes, they kept referring to data stored on magnetic tape.  Well no one today stores anything on magnetic tape.  So that makes the series dated and greatly detracts from the ability to immerse oneself in the plot.  I often find it difficult to watch this series anymore.Nonetheless, if you are a died in the wool fan, and you want an archive of this series, the Blu-ray version is the way to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OB9QQ5DCBRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PQ7JQK#wasThisHelpful","R5OB9QQ5DCBRX","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking for something like this for a while now -- and this seems to fit my self-image perfectly.  It is very functional - just what an engineer like me would appreciate. It is a two-piece (case and holster) with a dark matte black finish.  Looks like something Special Ops, Black, Ops, or the Swat Team would be sporting -- really masculine, almost a machined look with its ridged finish.Sorry, it apparently only comes in matte black for the LG 840G. :( But the exact same case and holster design for other phones comes in several colors, including red, white, blue, purple, pink, and black -- so I would guess in the future we might see more colors for the LG 840G, which might appeal to a wider audience.The case itself is one piece, hard plastic, lined with microfiber on the inside for shock cushion, and a rubberized textured exterior with ""machined"" ridges for maximum grip. The case itself is not bulky at all, and fits precisely and snugly over the LG 840G, with all the right openings accurately placed.The separate holster is made of the same material as the case, with the cased phone slipping precisely and firmly into the holster. The inside of the holster is lined with micro-fiber pad which protects the phone screen, and firmly retain the holstered case so it won't fall out, yet still allow the phone to easily be un-holstered.The cased phone can be holstered face-in for maximum protection, or face-out for easier call detection.  In the face-in position, the holster covers the phone's speaker, which muffles the phone's ringtone (which is the only negative I find on this product.)  I may (carefully) drill a small line of holes in the holster back so the phone speaker is not completely covered in the face-in position.The holster has a rotating swivel belt clip that doubles as a vertical or horizontal stand.  The swivel belt clip rotates into 13 different detent positions from vertical to 90 degrees either side.  The clip on the holster has a nice firm grip, with a built-in hook on the end of the clip so that it won't easily detach itself from your belt or your jeans.  I don't normally wear belts, and stick the clip into my jeans pocket.  I can vouch that the clip stays put, and doesn't slip out of my pocket.I have to comment (as an engineer) on a few of the comments reporting broken parts -- the holster should be located on your side so that when you sit down, no part of it catches on your clothing, as the rubberized texture will grip your clothes and put tremendous structural stress on the holster, clip, or case.The offer here includes a stylus (not really needed for the LG 840G) that works well, and a case opening pick that also works well (and will save your fingernails.)All-in-all, an exceptional design that I would recommend it to all my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY13QRI1K48K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL1TVKG#wasThisHelpful","RY13QRI1K48K2","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this all-in-one touchscreen PC for my kids.  Their previous PC had Windows Vista as the OS (which I came to hate.)  But Windows 8 (which I like) is much more intuitive, and designed for a touchscreen.  Very easy to transition from a touchscreen tablet to the PC.I had my eye on the HP touchscreen models for some time, but was put off by the cost. Then I got an HP email flyer offering this model direct from HP at a very substantial discount, plus free shipping, no taxes, and 18 months no-interest to pay for it. This no doubt was an inventory clearance, and this particular model probably will be replaced with a model upgrade in the future.  But it may still be in inventory at HP outlets, and at the right price could be a very good deal.Very impressive specs:i7-3770S Core CPU8GB of Ram23"" multi-touch full-HD display with LED back lighting2 TB hard driveSuperMulti Blu-ray player (Plays Blu-ray and DVD, but HD-DVD movies cannot be played on this modelIntegrated Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi LAN 802.11 b/c/g/nNVIDIA GeForce GT 630M graphics card w 2GB DDR3 dedicated graphics memory6-in-1 memory card reader2 USB 3.0 ports (on the side)4 USB 2.0 ports (on the back)Wireless keyboard with built-in volume controlWireless optical mouseTV Tuner & remote control (multi-format NTSC, over-the-air ATSC, Clear QAM)SOUNDS:Beats audioBuilt-in speakersearphone portO/S Windows 8, 64 bit2 yr warranty & technical support.The only con I can find is no HDMI port included, which for me is no problem as I have no need for one (my HDTV is in the same room with plenty of HDMI ports))I added MS Office 2010 Home/Student to the order.Just one wire connection is absolutely required - the power cord.  This model comes with built-in WiFi, and an Ethernet port.  I happened to have an Ethernet cable already there to the PC that this replaced, so that is what I hooked up to (Ethernet is faster and more secure than a wireless connection.)-- That's it -- only two cables max (Compare that to the dozen hooked up to its predecessor, and the seemingly endless cables hooked up to my main PC.)  Push the power button -- and its up and running within seconds.I installed MS Office, and some other software I had.  You also get a free 90-day trial subscription to Norton Anti-virus (I ported over my anti-virus software from the old PC.)I like HP computers in general, primarily because I have a good after-warranty HP-certified service shop nearby that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for out-of-warranty repair services -- Not that I need them very often. I have never required in-warranty service, but as the PC and peripherals age, a little knowledgeable service goes a long way to extend the useful life.So far, this new touchscreen all-in-one is a joy to own and operate.  My kids use touchscreen PC's with Windows 8 at school, so they have no transition issues at all.  In fact they know more about it then I do.Would I recommend this model?  Definitely, and especially if it was substantially discounted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IC0SUVCGA9M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2V9FYO#wasThisHelpful","R1IC0SUVCGA9M9","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my 2012 Nissan Frontier SL Crew cab.I was expecting a raised center like in the picture, but the item received was uniform across.But I went ahead and dry-fit it -- and -- it looked just perfect on the vehicle -- very nice looking.And so easy to install.Just pull out four plastic retainer pins on the hood seal, place the bugflector tabs between the hood and the rubber seal, screw in the furnished screws with nylon washers into the holes just vacated, close the hood, and put on the four rubber bumpers -- and you are done.Perfect fit and installation't couldn't be easier.This II (2nd generation) model leaves a good inch or more between the bugflector and the hood, so you can reach under and wax the hood easily.

"PRICE POINTIf price were no object, I would prefer the WeatherTech snap-in design over the AutoVent glue-on design, but I bought AutoVent  because it was half the price of WeatherTech.  Price matters in my world, and half the price matters a lot.I find the product worth the price I paid.APPEARANCE & FUNCTIONI got the four-piece (front and rear windows) set for my 2012 Nissan Frontier SL Crew Cab.  I was a little apprehensive about how they would look.  But they look very nice on the vehicle -- they blend in very well.  In fact, my wife didn't even notice them installed until I pointed them out.They also work as advertised.  The smoke tint is just right.  From the inside you can see through them so they don't block your view.  From the outside, you can't tell the windows are cracked an inch or so.Being able to securely (and invisibly) crack the windows open an inch makes a big difference in a parked car -- allowing the interior to breath, and prevent heat build up -- no hotter inside than outside.I also tested them in the rain and they work well.INSTALLATIONThe package includes a pot scrubber square and a separate alcohol wipe pak for each window.  You could also use a regular pot scrubber pad if for some reason the included pot scrubber piece was missing, lost or you destroyed it.  The installation instructions are pretty clear, but I've added my own comments below:REMOVING OXIDIZED RUBBERThe pot scrubber is to remove oxidized rubber on the face of the window's rubber seal that the double-sided tape will fasten to.  If you don't remove that oxidized layer, then you won't get a good bond.The alcohol wipe is for cleaning the rubber seal after the pot scrubber is used.  You need to remove all loose material, so run the wipe over the surface twice or more.After the pot scrubber and alcohol pad I blew the widow channel out with compressed air to be sure all the contaminating dust was removed.SMOOTHINGThe edges of the visor are unfinished and rough.  Only the bottom edge is exposed, so it is the only edge that needs smoothing.  I used a piece of steel wool to smooth the bottom edge.  It didn't take much work, and it leaves a smooth edge that won't snag clothing.  I use compressed air to blow the visor clean of all dust and steel wool.DRY FITThe next step I did was dry fit the pieces in the window channels to make sure they were placed correctly.FRONT VISORSThe tapered, curved piece for the front side-windows are pretty obvious as to proper orientation (the narrow end points forward, and the embossed AutoVent logo goes to the rear.)  They fit snugly in the window channel.  With the vents in-place I ran the windows all the way closed to make sure they would close properly and completely.REAR VISORSThe rear side window pieces are straight, and proper orientation not so obvious.  They also fit loose, so you can shift the rear tab in place.  The rear visor design (for my vehicle) accommodates the split design of the window (a fixed piece that doesn't roll up and down, and a movable piece that rolls up and down.) The rear visor only spans the movable part of the window.The rear visor design fits the top and front edge of the visor in the window channel.  But the rear tab of the visor is designed to fit outside the window channel, between the metal post and outside rubber trim.  This little detail is often overlooked, and most people (including myself) wind up installing the rear tab in the window channel, where it tends to interfere with raising the window.Not to worry if you mis-located the rear tab -- there is a simple cure. Butter the outside surfaces on the rear tab (and the part of the channel that mates with it), with some Gorilla Glue or Goop, keep the two surfaces separated until dry, then press them together and run the window up and keep it up for 24 hours until the glue has fully bonded.TAPE IT ONOnce satisfied with placement and orientation, the taping goes fast.  Just pull off a pigtail of the tape facing long enough to catch with your fingers.  I ran the windows all the way up before pulling the tape face off.  But I couldn't pull it all off without lowering the window a smidge to release the pressure a little.DURABILITYHard to say anything until I have had them awhile.  I don't detect any problem at speed.  The visors with the windows cracked an inch are much quieter than an open window - no noticeable wind buffet to induce vibration.The material is thin, and appears it might crack or break easily if any force was used on it.  But I'm not going to test its limits.If the back tab of the rear window visor isn't glued down, it tends to block the window from rising, and that could potentially weaken and eventually crack and break the visor if left uncorrected.However, with proper installation and care, they should last for years.All-in-all, I am satisfied with the Autovent visors, and I would recommend them for my price-conscious friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PT8HL8L9A851/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CF6S0O#wasThisHelpful","R1PT8HL8L9A851","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sanoxy adapter I received is an L-head microUSB, which is identical in every detail to the eForCity adapter that also sells for $1.50 and ships from China.  I have both adapters, and cannot tell the difference between them.  In fact, I conclude that they are both made in the same factory in China.The following discussion is to help you determine if you can use an OTG adapter:OTG stands for On-The-Go.  OTG microUSB to USB adapters are special adapters for connecting peripheals to a host microUSB port on a cell phone, tablet, phablet, or other handheld device.If you have a tablet, cell phone, or other personal device, that has two micro-USB ports, one might be a slave port, and the other might be a host port.  If the device only has one microUSB port, then it is most likely a slave port, and the OTG adapter may not be usable.  However, some handheld devices have a OTG port that can be used either as a host or a slave.The USB ports on your PC are host ports.  Anything you hook up to a PC USB port is a slave, even if it is an input device, such as a keyboard, mouse, or an output device such as a printer. Some devices (cell phones, tablets, phablets, e-readers) may have a host port (most do not).  Host USB ports on a handheld device are still unusual, and the user guide will usually have some remarks on it (unless you got your device directly from China).Most personal devices (such a cell phones, tablets, etc.)only have a slave microUSB port (or a miniUSB port.)  You connect the slave USB port (micro or mini) on your device to a host USB port on your PC.  In this case the PC is the host, and the device is a slave.  Usually you can only access the device's storage (such as an installed microSD card), and nothing else.  You use an ordinary USB to microUSB cable for this connection - not a OTG adapter.  For slave-only ports, you can not hook up to a USB flash drive, keyboard, external GPS, or other device.Some personal devices have a host port, or a combined host/slave port.  If present, it may be called a host USB port, or a OTG port.  This is very often a separate microUSB port.  If your device has a host port, you may be able to attach external devices, such as those you might attach to a PC.  You use an OTG microUSB to USB cable for a host port.  You use an standard USB cable (microUSB to USB)when the device is a slave.Just because you have a host port on your device doesn't mean all external USB accessories will work.  There also has to be internal software support within the device in order to use such peripheals (USB flash drive, 3G dongle, bluetooth dongle, keyboard, printer, etc.)If your not sure what cable/adapter to use, just buy one and try it.  They are so cheap you'll only be out a couple bucks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11BJY8JN1D665/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GI2VMG#wasThisHelpful","R11BJY8JN1D665","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have children in school, day care, or any group setting, at any age, there is a high probablity of their acquiring head lice.  So it behooves you to have the knowledge to know what to look for, and the tools to deal with adult head lice, and their larvae, and eggs (nits).  RobiComb is one good tool that I have found useful -- and it works, for children and adults.  Also, it is easy to use on long or short hair -  as long as the hair is dry and untangled.  However it is not easy to use on that is tangled, or tangles easily, such as in some dry, fine hair.About the only way to prevent head lice infestation is to have very short hair -- so short the scalp is exposed to light (head lice abhor light.)  Any longer, and head lice will target it -- the longer the hair, the better they like it.I was introduced to lice treatment in the Philippines, where we employed house girls from the small villages.  Invariably one or two would come in with head lice.  And when one household member is discovered with lice, EVERYBODY (including adults) needs to be treated.  But head lice is just as prevalent in the US as it is in the Philippines.  So don't think that just because you live in a first-world country you are somehow immune.  Head lice is endemic world-wide.KNOWLEDGE:One of the best sources of information on treating headlice is the paperback publication ""Head Lice to Dead Lice,"" by Sawyer and MacPhee.  This paperback is avaiable on Amazon(dot)com.  You can find other sources and materials by Googling the internet.Sawyer and MacPhee recommend olive oil treatment, which suffocates the lice.  It requires repeated application every four days for six or seven applications.  Its advantages are that it is non-toxic, good for healthy shiny hair, and it works - providing it is done properly (hair and scalp saturated) and repeated every four days for six sessions.  However, re-infestations are so probable that perhaps you could just as well opt for a continuous reapplication every four days, or maybe every Friday or Saturday religiously.TOOLS:Sawyer and MacPhee don't recommend the RobiComb, but they didn't actually try it, so their opinion on it don't count.  I have actually used it, and I can report, like others here, that it does work.  Whenever my school kids come home and report a bug in their hair, I begin treatment immediatly.The drawback to the RobiComb is that it is expensive.  If you are going to use the RobiComb, then each member of the family should have their own, and not share it.  That's also true of nit combs, hair combs, and hair brushes, pillows, caps, hats, hair bands, etc..  They should also use it everyday.  Not only that, but you should have a method of disinfecting the combs, bruches and tools you use on the hair, such as Barbicide or alcohol (but don't immerse the RobiComb in it.)The advantage of the RobiComb is that it can be carried and used anytime and anywhere without anybody really noticing -- such as waiting at a traffic stop, or just sitting around -- no mess, no smell, no pesticides to poison you, and no oily hair up in a shower cap for eight hours.The RoboComb emits a high-pitched tone when it is turned on.  You place the tips of the comb in touch with your scalp as you push it through your hair (Most adult lice and larvae will either be on your scalp, or close to it.  Eggs will be a just off the scalp firmly fastened to a hair shaft.)  The tone will be interrupted whenever the comb encounters alien life forms on your head.  That's the time to remove the RobiComb from your head and see what youv'e caught.  I always smash them with my fingernail to make sure they are dead.Some other things you will want to have is a good blow dryer for your hair with a high heat setting(s).  Head lice do not tolerate heat well, so after a shampoo, a good blow-dry session on high heat will kill a lot of them.  (be careful not to burn your scalp, or the children's scalp)  A shampoo and blow-dry sessio is also in order if you use the olive oil treatment.In addition, everything the hair has, or may have, touched (such as pillow cases, sheets, blakets, caps, hats, scarves, clothing, etc.) should be tossed into a dryer set to high heat (cotton) for twenty to thirty minutes.I don't use any chemical preparations for head lice, as they all can be toxic, especially for children, and especially because reinfestation is so probable, and head lice quickly becone resistant to them.All in all, the RoboComb is a fine product, that does work, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GR1FUYVN3G8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P6TF8W#wasThisHelpful","R2GR1FUYVN3G8L","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This government publication is available on-line for free (just Google the title)My original review was base on the relatively few ""peek preview"" pages available on Amazon.com.  Now that I have acquired a complete copy, and had a chance for a more comprehensive review,  I have substantially revised my comments.This historical tome covers US Army Corps of Engineer projects and organizations involved in the Middle East and Africa - from Morocco to Pakistan, and Europe to Somalia, and everything in between., from 1941 to 1991 - a period of half a century.  That was a fascinating era, with many major political shifts, both at home and abroad, and a fascinating read from both a historical and an engineering perspective.I  worked in this arena, under its various names and re-organizations, from the mid 1970's until the mid 1990's, some twenty-plus years, all told.  so I knew quite well many of the people mentioned in the later phase (Part III.)  Whatever names the effort and organizations went by, it was (and I presume still is) one of the most dynamic and capable organizations within the US Army Corps of Engineers.  I am proud to have been associated with it.The tome is an accurate, though necessarily condensed, rendering of the history of military construction in the Middle East and Africa. It is mostly a technical rendering of the projects and major personalities involved throughout the historical period covered.  But there are also revelations of some of the political infighting, and international considerations that effect such projectsThis tome would make a very good technical background for a movie.  What is missing are the interactions of the personalities involved -- affairs, betrayals, poor command decisions, personal conflicts between influential individuals, conflicts between the design engineers and the construction management staff, and so forth.  For example, few people recognize, even inside the Corps of Engineers, that the major reason the organization did not continue to get more projects from the Saudis, is that the command structure (Gen. Wells, and General Albro, in particular) made unilateral decisions that infuriated the Saudis.  And if that weren't enough, the organization retained at least a million dollars of Saudi money that they had no intention of ever returning (and used for years as a carry fund to temporarily fund new project prospects.)  I would bet that that million dollars is still there in the organization's pocket.The bottom line is that this is a great book for historians, history buffs, and those interested in that theater --  which is an accurate account of what in my professional career was a most exciting time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR918N44LBL5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0160817382#wasThisHelpful","RR918N44LBL5P","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorilla calls them wheel locks.  Most others call them locking lug nuts.  I bought two sets of these for my new pickup truck with 18"" aluminum alloy wheels.  In my opinion, they are the best of the locking lug nuts.They don't really lock like a padlock or door lock -- you just have to use the proper key shape to engage the nut.  Gorilla makes thousands of shape variations, and you must have a registration number (comes with the package) to buy a replacement key.  This keeps the keys out of the hands of most thieves.I especially like the design of the rotating outside casing that prevent anything other than a proper key from engaging the special-shaped lug nut -- you can't get a wrench, locking pliers, or normal socket on it.  The space between the outer rotating casing and the lug nut is also extra narrow, so ordinary sockets and tools can't be used as a wedge.I install two per wheel, opposite each other to maintain wheel balance -- each with a different key to make it even harder for a thief (who might happen to have one matching key, but unlikely to have two that match.)I also purchased these on Amazon at a very good price.If you are not sure which catalog number to buy for your particular vehicle, visit the Gorilla-auto (dot) com web site's application page.  Except for replacement keys, they do not sell direct to the public, but all the info you might need for your application (and alternative designs)is there.All-in-all, a great product.  I would not hesitate to recommend them to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNXD7CV605TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CMD9TK#wasThisHelpful","RMNXD7CV605TI","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a massive, heavy duty hitch step - built to withstand impact from a ready-mix concrete truck.  You aren't ever going to break it.  It is fairly heavy -- maybe even heavier than hitch receiver it is attached to.  It is designed to be used as an attachment point to retrieve off-roader's from the predicaments they deliberately get themselves into (but can't 4-wheel out of.)I'm not that an aggressive driver, and for me it is a very convenient step I use a couple of times a day -- and as a heavy duty ""bumper"" to give tailgaters pause to reflect being so close to it.I also very much like the shape - like an arrowhead, that would inflict considerable damage to vehicles driven by idiot drivers foolish enough to tailgate me, or rear-end me at a stop-sign or stop-light.  I put some red reflective tape on the step so drivers behind me can see it better.All-in-all, a superior product - not for everyone, but unsurpassed ruggedness for those who need or want it.

"This is a unique cargo net that not only is very functional and durable, but it is - bar none - the coolest looking cargo net I have ever seen.  I leave it on all the time, and have many compliments on the net, and inquiries as to where I got it.  I even got a big a big 4' spider to ride on it.The net is manufactured in two sizes for pickup trucks (large and small), and four colors (black, red, blue, and yellow.) There are also smaller versions for car-top racks, and a version for motorcycles. The only source I have seen that carries all variants of this product is Auto Anything (also best price.)For my pickup (Nissan Frontier, Crew Cab, long bed) I use the small size.  I also chose the red color to compliment the red color of my truck.To deter theft, I fasten the rear of the net with elongated security rings to the tailgate attachment points (supplied with the net.)  When I'm not actually securing a load, I hook the front of the net over the rear cross slat of my roof rack, which then forms a compound space curve over the bed.  I don't use the included hooks on the sides of the net because I already have attachment cleats permanently mounted.All in all, I am delighted with this product, and I would recommend it to my friends.UPDATE: Feb 2014I left this cargo net on continually for 18 months straight, constantly exposed to sun, rain, heat, and cold.  It held up pretty good all that time, but it eventually deteriorated enough that I finally took it down, and will be replacing it (with another Spidey Gear Cargo Net.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11UV698XN1KEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CEBX5A#wasThisHelpful","R11UV698XN1KEP","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is supposedly the TracFone successor to the very popular LG 800G TracFone.  So if you are familiar with the LG 800G, then perhaps the best way to think of this phone is as the WiFi/3G/plus version of the LG 800G.  It is already available in some WalMart stores, and now on Amazon.  Check out the Turk Forum for actual pictures of the bubble pack.It is NOT a smart phone, and doesn't run Android.  But if it is anything like the LG 800G (which is one damn fine feature phone), it will be a runaway hit with the otherwise minimal phone use crowd that TracFone attracts.What it has (that the venerable LG 800G it replaces does not) is WiFi and 2G/3G data. And it has all the well-executed built-in widgets (Music Player, Audio, Picture Viewer, Video Recorder, Voice Recorder, Calendar, Notepad, Tasks, Stopwatch, Calculator, Tip Calculator,  Unit Converter) that came with the LG 800G, incuding a 2 MP camera.  In addition, the LG 840G has an external microSDHC card capacity up to 32GB, versus 4 GB for the LG 800G.Sorry - no GPS.  But you might be able to hook it to an external GPS if (and that is a big IF) you can find a Java app to process the GPS output.  I don't offhand know of such a Java app.  But then again, I was a long time in realizing their was a java app for facebook.The touchscreen on the LG 840G is larger (3.0"") than the LG 800G (2.8"" -- 320x240 pixels).  No info yet on the LG 840G screen resolution.There is a 180 page user guide (90 pages in English, 90 pages in Spanish), which is quite an improvement on the next-to-nothing user manual for the LG 800G.The LG 840G comes with triple minutes for life.It is too early to tell if all the LG 800G fanatics will migrate to the LG 840G.  But based on the high popularity of the LG 800G, I betting the LG 840G will be a hot seller.  If you are a minimal cell phone user, better get your TracFone version before they are gone.  If you are a moderate to heavy cell phone user, you might do better with the Net10 or Straight Talk versions.EDIT (26 Dec 2013):The Lg 840G continues to be THE most popular feature phone.  It is the most popular cellphone purchased on Home Shopping network (HSM.com), and the most viewed and commented on Turk Forum. Its staying power comes from its relatively low price, triple minutes for life, sensitive touchscreen, WiFi, Bluethooth, and 2/3G data capability, as well as the many well-executed built in features included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZFCTA4FKYA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LRNLW2#wasThisHelpful","R3CZFCTA4FKYA1","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Curt receiver 13241 application to my 2012 Nissan Frontier Crew-Cab Long-bed SL.I cut the box the receiver came in to lay flat so I could use it as a mat to lay on.This is my second Curt hitch receiver.  The first was for a Mazda Tribute.  As expected, this receiver is massive, accurately made, and finished well with a thick coat of black powder coat.This is a heavy item (for me) weighing in at 45 pounds.  Still, it was easy to put on by myself, and I am 70+ years old.  The bolt holes were accurately drilled, and the Nissan came with weld nuts already in place.  The six bolts came with thick conical washers, which are designed to exert pressure on the bolts as they are tightened.  All it took was lining up one bolt hole and start a bolt, then do one bolt on the other side.  The rest is easy.  Probably the hardest part, besides getting the first bolt on, was torquing the bolts to 65 foot-pounds.  There was one bolt partially obstructed by the exhaust pipe, that required a knuckle joint on the socket wrench.That's all there was to installation. the only tools you will need are a 3/4"" socket and driver (or 19mm), a 6"" extension bar for the socket, a knuckle joint, and a torque wrench set to 65 foot-pounds.  You could just use a 3/4"" (19mm) box wrench.On the Nissan Frontier, the receiver was jut a little inside the rear-most edge of the rear bumper, with maybe less than 1/2"" clearance below it.  I set a 2"" hitch into the receiver with no problem.  However, a Texas ""tailgate"" hitch cover, which extends 3"" beyond the hith cove shaft, would not fit because the rear edge of the bumper interfered (the receiver was recessed a little too much under the bumper.)All-in-all, the Curt hitch receiver more than met my expectations, and I would recommend it to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSX8G3LF51QI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007V9XAU#wasThisHelpful","R1PSX8G3LF51QI","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These air filters are specified as the OEM air filter recommended for my Craftsman variable speed self-propelled lawn mower, which has a 190cc Briggs & Stratton engine.I had not changed the air filter for a couple of years, blowing it ""clean"" with compressed air instead.  But you can never really blow the filter completely clean, and it eventually plugs up enough to affect engine performance.  So I was in desperate need of replacement air filters when I ran across these.  the price for a single filter is kind of pricey anywhere you look, but the five pack was very well priced, so I jumped on it.The bottom line is that these filters fit perfectly, and result in the engine starting with one pull again.

"I was introduced to this type of exfoliating wash rag so many years ago in the most pleasant way - by my then Korean girl friend.  Just to see it hanging on the shower now brings back very pleasant memories of oriental baths and showers for two - it almost brings tears to my eyes.  There is nothing like a back scrubber that is alive and beautiful.But, I digress.  Back to the cloth - these exfoliating wash rags are very common in Asia, but often very hard to find locally in the US.  I am glad to see so many offered by Amazon.com.  This one is huge, area wise, and should last a very long time.  While it says ""super hard weave,"" when it is wet, I find it just right for me - not to soft, and not to hard.  It is long enough so that you can also easily use it by yourself on your back, and even on the bottom of your feet.  They are perfect for those with flaky, dry skin -- they remove dead skin without harming the live skin underneath - as long as you aren't too aggressive with it.  And it is gentle enough to use on your face - but again, don't be too aggressive with it.Parents who use these on their children should not use pressure, because used too aggressively can damage a child's skin.  It would better to allow the child to wash themselves so they could adjust the pressure to suit themselves.All in all, a great product, at a good price.  The only thing better would be a beautiful Asian back scrubber to apply it.  I would highly recommend this too my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5720N4FPHUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KCCEGO#wasThisHelpful","RL5720N4FPHUW","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What attracted me to this shower caddy was its price - a very good value for the functionality offered.It is made of steel wire covered with a rubberized coating.  As long as the coating remains in intact, the steel is protected.  It is sturdy enough for a couple of shampoo bottles, soap bars, and wash rags or back scrubbers.  You wouldn't want to hang too much off it though, like a full-sized wet towel.  How long it endures just depends on how rough you are with it.  It should last for years under normal use.This is a small caddy, about 18"" tall, 10"" wide, and protrudes about 4"" from the wall when in place.  It has a shallow basket for bottles, over a double-bent rack for soap and other small items, and two hooks on the bottom.  It is near the perfect size for what I wanted - a little extra shelf space, and a couple of hooks, without being obtrusive.  It complements the soap dish and bottle holder already built-in to my shower wall.The rubbery plastic pipe hanger lock (included) is a must if your shower pipe neck is significantly slanted downward like mine is.  The lock works very well.  You might not need it if your shower pipe comes straight out of the wall.  If a cover exists on the water pipe where it protrudes from the wall (which is s typical plumbing installation), then the top of the rack may protrude that much further off the wall if you use the rubber lock.  That was the case for me, but the small outward incline it produced was so slight as to be negligible. Most people will not want to remove that wall cover, because it hides the hole for the water pipe, which isn't always as neat as it could be.The rubbery plastic suction cups (two included) are removable and relocatable, so you can adjust their location to avoid seams and grout lines. They work best located at the bottom of the rack, and are mainly intended to keep the caddy from swinging sideways. The best time to apply the suction cups is when the shower wall is wet (they will stick better.)  If you have trouble sticking them, use  little soap on them.I put both suction cups on one side of the rack because the built in soap dish on my shower wall prevents me from placing a suction cups on the other side.  That is not a fault of the caddy, however, and the suction cups do the job they were designed to do - keep the caddy from swinging sideways.All in all, the caddy works well for me, satisfies a need, for a reasonable price.  I would certainly recommend it to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNKIVU61V1WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QE3DR2#wasThisHelpful","R2PNKIVU61V1WK","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My bike is a 1987 Honda Shadow VT700C with 76,000+ miles on it.  I have been using Mobil-1 oil in it since I bought it new 25 years ago.  When it was new, I used 5W30, at about 50,000 miles I switched to 10W40, and last oil change I went to Mobil-1 high mileage.  Still the engine clatter seemed to be getting worse.  So I was looking for some Mobil-1 20W50 oil, which is also recommended in the owner's manual for hot climates.When I saw this V-Twin Mobil-1 20W50, I whistled at the price - fifteen bucks for a single quart -- two or three times the cost of regular Mobil-1 oil. Still, maybe that was what I needed for my aging engine.  So I bought case of 6 for sixty bucks - which works out to ten bucks a quart.  Later I saw WalMart also carries this, and it comes in two grades - regular for about eight bucks, and advanced for about ten bucks.  What Amazon.com is selling is the Advanced grade, and the price is comparable to WalMart, and no taxes, plus free shipping.I am very impressed with this engine oil.  Engine clatter has all but disappeared.  The bike sounds and runs much better.  It is pricey oil, but it is worth it.I would heartily recommend this oil for any v-twin, and especially for all aging older engines, V-twin or otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PIRUF1ABEUA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SKV4T8#wasThisHelpful","R3PIRUF1ABEUA8","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had Magic Jack for a number of years now.  I've used it with a dial-up modem and with broadband.  MagicJack will work with a dial-up modem in the US pretty well, but Fax on a dial-up modem will generally result in dropped lines.  MagicJack should really be used with a DSL line or better.  Once I switched to broadband, I couldn't tell the difference in call quality, and the Fax worked fine.  In fact, if I didn't already know I was talking through MagicJack, I wouldn't be able to tell -- its is very good voice quality, even from MagicJacks located overseas, providing they are connected to the internet on a DSL line or broadband.MagicJack used overseas and plugged into a computer on a dial-up modem won't work very well.  The slowness of a dial-up modem, and delays in data packet routing will result in dropped lines.  If you are going to use a MagicJack overseas, make sure the computer you plug it into is connected to the internet by broadband or a DSL line.When MagicJack Plus first came out, you couldn't transfer your existing MagicJack time to it.  So I didn't get one.  But just recently, MagicJack reversed that policy, and now you can transfer your remaining MagicJack time to MagicJack Plus.  I've now switched over to MagicJack Plus.MagicJack Plus doesn't need a computer -- it plugs directly into an Ethernet or wireless hub.  But the Plus can also plug into a computer using a short USB cable (supplied).  The plain MagicJack only plugs into a USB port on your computer.If you like having a splash screen dialer with all your contacts and call history on your computer and at your fingertips, you can use either the plain or the Plus plugged into a computer.  If you plug the Plus into a Ethernet or wireless hub, you won't have that on-screen splash screen dialer with contacts and call log -- unless the phone you are hooking the Plus up to independently provides that.I find the MagicJack Plus gets up and running faster -- near instantaneously.  On my computer, the plain magic jack takes a few minutes to boot itself, and I have to reboot my computer often.  When the computer is down, so is the plain MagicJack.  The Plus can always be removed from the computer and plugged into the hub without skipping a beat.MagicJack is going to discontinue offering the MagicJack plain in another few months will only offer the Plus.  MagicJack periodically has sales and significant discounts, especially for existing plain MagicJack customers.  MagicJack offers connect time by the year, and has a five year plan that includes a good warranty and relacement feature in addition to cheaper time overall.

"This is a Dandy's, or Fancy Dan's, cane - the type used by Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly in the movies.  It is a very pretty cane, yet masculine, and suitable for a black-tie affair. This type of cane is intended more as a dress accessory -- like a musician's baton, a magician's wand, or an officer's swagger stick, rather than a workhorse.Underneath it's pretty exterior, though, is a rugged carbon-fiber construction, which makes it very strong and durable -- suitable as a whacking stick, if necessary, which is why a cane was carried in the bygone era when men carried canes as a matter of course.The dimpled, shiny, solid  aluminum head can be unscrewed, so you can change the head to suit yourself, assuming there are other heads available. In my opinion, the shiny head that it comes with is a perfect match.There is a rather small rubber tip on the end, which is perfect for those who will probably be carrying the cane much more than actually leaning on it.It is very light in weight, yet very strong due to the carbon fiber construction.  That is what attracted my attention.  I bought this cane primarily for my 9-year old daughter as a walking stick.It is quite long as a cane, but a perfect length as a walking stick for a 9-year old.  Even if I was the one using it, I wouldn't cut it shorter.My daughter loves it, and for a change, won't be handing it over to me on our walkes because it got too heavy for her half way through the hike.All in all, it is a very good buy, well made, well-priced, and very nice looking.

"Pretty good sword cane, as sword canes go -- made in India, according to markings.  It is a heavy cane, weighng more than my four-foot rosewood hiking stick.The blade is carbon steel, and has considerable spring to it, indicating the blade has been well tempered.  I didn't want to test the flex limit of the blade, but it appears to be sufficient to be a useful weapon.  The handle is solidly mounted on the blade.  I did not detect any play or looseness.The blade is 29"" long, which is really long for a cane sword. That might not seem like a lot, until you see it in person. Add another 5"" for the handle. That gives the bearer a very long reach against a mad dog, bear, coyote, wolf, or a human attacker.The blade surface appears to have been highly polished, and I detected no hint of rusting. The point of the blade is elongated and well-formed for easy penetration. The edges of the blade are sufficiently beveled to take an edge, but as it comes it is not sharp enough to cut you by just running your fingers or hand down the edges.  A slashing blow from the blade as is would leave a nasty bruise but probably not cut through the skin or clothing.  The long, thin blade design is mainly for stabbing and trusting, not slashing. For slashing, you would want a much wider blade (but then it wouldn't fit into a cane.)You could sharpen the edges, but if you do, I'd only put a concave edge on it, which requires specialized technique, but preserves the strength of the blade and puts a more durable edge.  If you do sharpen the edges, you might want to install across guard to keep your fingers from slipping onto the blade while thrusting.  The sharpening process might allow rust to form on the edge, but you could oil the blade to prevent rust from forming. I can't tell by just looking if the edges have been hardened to hold a really sharp edge.The ""scabbard"" or body of the cane is heavy duty, weighing as much or more than the sword. It has a small rubber tip on the end, which I particularly like, because it doesn't detract from the gracefully simple design. By itself, the scabbard makes a formidable whacking stick. So you have two weapons in one -- In your right hand a sword, and in your left hand a whacking stick (or vice versa).In summary, this is a nice-looking well-made, heavy cane with a very long (for a sword cane)decent sword for emergency use against an attacker with no more than a knife, or a shorter sword cane.  But it isn't something you would take to a competition sword fight.There is one con -- the button for unlocking the sword from the scabbard-cane is small and very stiff.  Pressing on it requires so much force that it hurts my thumb to do it.  On the one hand, that's good as an in-home safety measure to prevent kids from releasing the sword (my 9 and 12 year old's can't open it), but on the other hand, I have to use a penny or a folded business card over the button to release the sword, which makes it difficult to access the sword when I might need it most in a hurry.  I eventually pressed on the top of a button snap, which was enough so it doesn't hurt my thumb to press it hard.All-in-all, a great sword cane.  I am satisfied with it, and I would recommend it to my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5RULQBXHX8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H6932Y#wasThisHelpful","RU5RULQBXHX8F","A3TWFM69THKQBK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TWFM69THKQBK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This booster seat is big and wide. I like the latch connectors. It keeps the booster seat in its place. The wings add protection to side impact. The height adjustment is convenient and functional. My complaints are mainly centered around this big and wide part. My daughter is 44 lbs, which is above the lower limit of 40 lbs. But it seems that she needs another booster seat inside this booster seat. The base is too wide for her. Also the big, flat, wide base doesn't quite fit into our bucket leather seat. This booster seat works best with flat back seat. I believe it works even better with captain seats in mini vans.

"I have been looking for several years to find better replacement bulbs for our built in microwave that sits above our stove as serves double duty as range hood with lighting and ventilation.  Eureka!  These are the ones! The old incandescent bulbs burned extremely hot using 80 watts (more than all the other bulbs in 4 other rooms combined).  Never felt comfortable leaving them on for a night light because they were so hot and used so much energy.  Have seen this size LED bulbs offered for a while but there is never enough description to make me feel comfortable as to âwill they fit and workâ.  They not only fit, but they fit better.  The old ones took the entire available space in screw in/out making the task to change out a bulb more difficult than it should have been.  These fit perfectly with plenty of room for easy installation with zero modifications.  My wife and my preference for the cook top area lighting would have always been a daylight white light, but you donât have a choice with the incandescent, just the standard yellow/warm white.  We were excited and very pleased with our choice of the daylight white for our purchase of these led bulbs (if you prefer the yellow/warm white you can still get your choice too).Now we leave our microwave light on high 24/7 for cook/counter top lighting and night light lighting.  Cool 8 Watts vs hot 80 Watts.  Stated life expectancy for the incandescent bulbs was 1000 hrs and never lasted more than 5-600 hrs tops based on many burnt out bulbs requiring time consuming replacement maintenance.  These donât have a stated life expectancy that I saw at this time, but I assuming any led bulb would be rated in the 10-50,000 hrs range.  So Iâm thinking now that we are running these 24/7 that if we get around 10,000 hrs that will give us a year between changes, so time will tell as we just recently installed.  While these leds are rated about 20% fewer lumens than the incandescent, to us they appear to be brighter upon initial install than the originals.  Iâve noticed with the house Cree bulbs that they seem to be brighter to begin with and then dim down a bit over time, which could just be a perception thing.  Our microwave light has full power and dimmed settings and these are not supposed to be dimmable with an incandescent dimmer, but ours dimmed fine, with no perceivable flicker to me (wife says she might see faint flicker dimmed but not sure), so I just that is a hit or miss event.  However, dimmable is not something that matters to us at 4W full power per bulb and cool to the touch bulbs, so we leave them at full power 24/7.  Iâm not an electrical engineer, but I suspect that burning led bulbs dimmed without an led dimmer would likely shorten their life, so for us why even go there.While the packaging is more than adequate to insure safe arrival and storage, it is not glitzy retail packaging.  The manufacturing appearance quality on my inspection seems much better and higher than the name brand retail packaged product.  I was very impressed.  We are very very pleased.If you too are looking for a better choice for your intermediate base incandescent microwave bulb, these led bulbs are the wise upgrade to go with.If you are concerned about will they fit and work for you, I am including some photos that would have helped me and should help you feel better about your choice.Update 09/12/2015  Reducing to 3 stars as they only have lasted 4 months.  Gradually more and more of the 80 tiny little leds have burned out, that now at about 40% gone they need replacing already.  Probably will stay with them, but disapointed.

"This is a lesser quality Cree bulb.  Uses 1.5W more than their original bulb, almost as much as CFL.  Built cheaper without the heat sink.  Loss of heat sink reduces life/warranty by 2/3, but cost by not even 1/3.  If you want less expensive go with CFL.  If you want better value, go with the original Cree LED bulbs, not the 4-Flow.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKF9M9GIQHNBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP4SHZQ#wasThisHelpful","RKF9M9GIQHNBK","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Worked well to begin with for several months.  Then Keyboard lag (letters/numbers type show up after delay or are skipped after delay) developed intermittently, then more frequently.  At first you'll think it's you, but as problem lingers and becomes more and more annoying, you run Googles for ""Keyboard Lag""  and discover it's an old old problem going back many years for the MK520.  You still think well maybe it's the other folks and you can get your's back up to speed.  Well you've been careful not to change from the original USB slot for the sender receiver, only trying swapping out batteries, just in case, but now you start down some of the ""maybe"" fixes.  You try a USB extender to get the sender/receiver extremely close to your combo, you try setting your usb port to never sleep, don't have a USB3.0 port so not that, you try Turning on Filter keys in Ease of access, go through all the check list you can find and give up.  Realizing that most tech support is lousy but having good experience with Logitech of many many previous years you think, well I'll give that a shot.  They respond (after a few) days with standard scripted ""your fault, not a known problem (which is totally BS) no nothing reply that is typical of the tech support we've all come to know and dread, ending with a ""let us know if we haven't solved your problem, and when you do that goes off into la la land never to return.  So if you kept your wired keyboard somewhere you go back to using that (the mouse works fine so you don't have to put it up).  Wouldn't recommend you buy the MK520 if you intend to use it as long as your system last. Have heard lot of other poor comments on MK520 after checking, so not just a few of us.  I've heard Wireless computing doe not have the problem but I can't afford theirs for home use and have a few good comments on the Adessos, so might try those after I tire over using the wired keyboard.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R452KSSVXBYG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VANO7C#wasThisHelpful","R452KSSVXBYG1","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very pleased. I was sceptical as to quality if the tools would even last one go around.  On the chance that they might vs the cost to have links removed from my wife's many less expensive fashion watches, I gave it a shot.  Used almost every tool in the kit first day and not a one failed or shows any indication of problems.  They definitely aren't jeweler's quality tools, but who would be expecting that for the price.  I don't see how I'll ever wear these out for home use.  Just on one Fossil watch it paid for itself with the watch back removal tool so I could get at the battery, then there is a little battery lifter tool that is much better than any tiny screw driver or the like you might have tried used to remove watch batteries (by the way Amazon is the place to get your watch batteries) and then I used the link pin driver tool and link pin no mar hammer to shorten the watch by my wife's desired link.  I am the hero today because of the kit.  It comes in a clear plastic case, which for me will be what I store the tools in for future needs.  There are several little screw drivers and other tools I did not use today.  There is a tool for pry off watch backs if a watch has that method for accessing battery, needle nose plyers that are just fine to use for this intended use, a pair if intricate needle nose tweezers for moving around tiny parts if you need to (or they are great for removing splinters too).  Anyway.  I love these and can't believe the value for the home user.  Amazon carries these same tools under various parts numbers at various prices, so be sure to check for the best priced option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GG1K8ZDFWAW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EHL687W#wasThisHelpful","R1GG1K8ZDFWAW2","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Totally equal to OEM cartridge performance and quality in my experience.  These are not refilled or remanufactured cartridges, but brand new.  I have purchased these several times.  I think some of the poor reviews are from bad suppliers.  Various suppliers offer this product from time to time.  Be sure to check the rating of the supplier before you make your purchase.  Since the quality experience is equal to OEM cartridge, it only makes sense to go with these.  The typical Brother printer can be had for $60-$100, but the OEM replacement cartridges will cost you $50.  It's just not logical to buy anything but these.  When the printer finally fails you won't be sad that you have $30-$50 in cartridges left over that you can't use.  Just take the money you save and buy yourself another Brother printer and none-OEM cartridges here on AMAZON.  Just do the math and you'll never buy another brand printer or OEM cartridge, nor will you be angry at the money you spent on printers and supplies again.  This is definitely the way to go.

I have to change out the Duracell twice a year, so I thought I'd see if the Energizer had a longer life.  These Energizer only lasted a few days before failure.  They were new and sealed in package with Use by date of September 2015.  Based on Duracells having expiration dates about 3-4 years out, I thought this was odd and contacted Energizer.  Energizer indicated the A23 batteries have a 3 year shelf life and that my package was made in December 2012, would expire in December 2015 and should be used by September 2015.  I wish they would print something like that or more consumer friendly on the package.  So my batteries were reasonably fresh and I don't know why they failed so quickly.

"Just another ""Blended"" meh decaf Kup for the Keurig system. My wife and I, like millions of Seniors medically require a decaf coffee. During the holidays we had younger guest and needed non-decaf for them, so I picked up the 100% Arabica Colombian for them. It had wonderful aroma, so much so that I went off the wagon and had a cup (or 2 or 3). That coffee was wow in so many ways. The aroma as I said draws you to it, the the taste is so rich and bold, but not strong and not bitter, as other coffees. The Gevalia 100% Arabica Colombian non-decaf coffee is the absolute best coffee I have ever had from a K-Kup. So that is how we purchased 3 boxes of decaf to try (decaf not available in stores in our area). I now know that ""Blended"" means - our worst beans in combination to cancel out the others' bad qualities as best we can to get rid of them. This decaf was almost identical to every other ""Breakfast Blend"" for the Keurig machines. (I've used and kept the same Keurig brewer since 2006).  Lacking in aroma, richness and boldness of taste and bitter to the palate. Makes you just want to spit it out. Since it is so like the other ""Blends"" we'll try to use it up, but won't be buying this ""Blend"" ever again. Definitely would not recommend you waste your money with premium price for low average product - just go with whatever ""Blend"" you've been buying and save some money. Maybe someday one of the roasters will realize what a huge market they are missing by only offering decaf in their Blend, plus a Hazelnut and a Vanilla. Big Big demand waiting to be met with a product in decaf that has the WOW! of the Gevalia 100% Arabica non-decaf Colombian coffee.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJ94AGGMKA6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHLAKUE#wasThisHelpful","R1MJ94AGGMKA6V","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The short curved blade is just like the great paring knife your granny had.  I buy the Rada knives with the black resin handles because I throw them in the dish washer.  They are available in a bushed aluminum handle that is just like granny's - but must be hand washed as the dishwater will quickly put a black oxidation on the aluminum.  If you choose the brushed aluminum handle, hand wash and store in the paper sheath the knife ships in you probably can hand it down to your grand kids.  If you don't have time for such, go with the black resin handle and you'll still get many many years of usable service from this great product.

We have also found these great for storing and organizing all types of things from tools, crafts, flower bulb storage, grand kid projects, etc.  Like I said these were a test for our idea of finding ways to may our retired life a little easier (or course would be good for busy households as well).  We love everything about these containers function wise.  But the price is a bit high to just throw away (actually recycle)  as we wanted to do in our situation to get out of a cleanout/wash/dry/putaway chore and black is not the prettiest color to serve from - so...  To get the cost down we went VERSATAINER NC-729 in white (AMAZON B0037XL5S8) to get the white color and the cost down to less than 32¢ each delivered for these round ones (the rectangular version less than 38Â¢). We would have stayed with these Reditainer (actually TriPak model MT0750) had they been offered at bulk pricing (and in the white we prefer for home use).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAZ92PKDWOYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EA0P9RK#wasThisHelpful","R3IAZ92PKDWOYF","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Read and followed enclosed directions.  Then programmed - which takes maybe 15 seconds.  Tested and Bam! worked first try.  Mounted with two screwed provided which took about 2 minutes. (The install might take longer if you have hard wood and need to drill a pilot hole, so add that to my install time if you do.) I couldn't be more pleased with the ease of programming and operation of this keypad.  None of these are super heavy duty, but this one is much tougher built than others.  Unit appears to be waterproof with no openings for entry points on the upper part front or back.  9-Volt battery (supplied) compartment on bottom front.  Keys appear to be sealed to prevent water entry around them.  The keys are of nice size and protrude so you are sure which one you are pressing.  The key pad lights up when pressed.  So to use in dark, just press any key to get the keypad to light up, then enter your chosen 4 digit code and press enter.  This works because whether in dark or daylight, only the last four keys pressed before entry are used. The cover has a detent to keep it locked up and out of your way while you are entering your code. Means a lot when your eyes are not so good and your fingers aren't as nimble as they used to be.  With good eyesight and youthful fingers, you could flip the cover up part of the way, enter your code + Enter and quickly be on your way. Closes with just a press of Enter key without a code.  I like everything about this keypad.I did contact LiftMaster about their other two units, the 387LM and 377LM.  My understanding is that they will all work with Purple 315MHz openers. The 387LM being a generic model offered for 5 frequencies to cover almost ever door opener brand, but it is not as heavy duty and I have friends and family with that version and the slide up cover is aggravating in ease of slide and them getting it to stay on.  The 377LM is pretty much same as the 877Max, but only works on Purple 315 MHz.  My understanding is that that LiftMaster will discontinue the 377LM when all product is gone, offering the 877Max instead which works with all Liftmaster openers from 1993 to present.  You can control more that one door opener with the 877Max if you have them.  Several other features also on this unit if you need them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLX6PLX0CQCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051V40NQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLX6PLX0CQCM","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product works as well as possible with the govt allowable signal strength.  I first placed the receiver in where it had a clear line of sight through window to mailbox, which happened to also be a ""spot"" near a DSL modem, TV, dish receiver etc.  The inside white receiver box didn't like the interference there at all.  I don't know if it was one of the items or a combination.  When it didn't work, I moved it to another clear line of sight location where there was no other electronics nearby and it worked like a charm, but it was not in a location that was easy to see and it didn't fit in the dÃ©cor either.  So I thought I'd try other locations in the house.  The receiver liked everywhere except near electronics.  So I moved it to my second choice of convenient to see locations it worked.  The location was my last try because I thought it least likely to work because the line of sight is blocked by a brick outside wall and to interior walls.  That location is where it has remained and it has worked without fail.  Another thing that I have that is supposed to be a problem is that I have a Heavy Duty Aluminum Mailbox - the type that wouldn't dent if hit with a baseball bat.  The receiver has a wire sticking up about a foot for an antennae and is plastic, not so stylist.  Receiver requires a wall outlet plug for power connection.I am more than satisfied with the Mail Chime and there does not appear to be any other product to compete, so either this one works for you or you are out of luck.  That's how I saw the situation and think you should measure your expectations along those lines.  The Mail Chime is just going to work for some people like myself that it probably shouldn't and maybe not for some others that you might think it would.  There are just so many variables from location to location that determine whether it will work.  Since it is electronic most of the sellers do not accept this product back.  I bought as a ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"" so that I could return if it did not work for me.  As to this device and for the ability to return if it doesn't work for you, my opinion is that you should only purchase as the ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"" option.  There is not much to go wrong on this so I would think it should last at least 5-10 years. When the battery does someday need changing in the mailbox send unit, (I checked it out before I installed) it's going to be a 2-5 minute piece of cake no hassle deal. I think if this product interest you that you should try it and go for it based of my results. Last thing... Mail Chime does have an audio ""chime"", but you can adjust it to high or low volume or in my case, I only wanted to see the ""red notifier light"", so I turned the volume off. That's a good choice to have for all the different needs folks would have.***Update:  Unit has been ""buggy"" during it's short life.  After few months starting to not work until send unit was removed and shaken vigorously to free up tilt switch.Send unit signal strength grew weaker and weaker (I did indeed, keep constant ""fresh"" batteries installed).  Unit finally failed beyond ability to Rube Goldberg fix attempts to get it back work.  Super happy with to begin with.  Liked less and less as time passed.  After 6 months not work effort to try to return, you have to pay charges to ship it back and an additional $15 on top of that cost.  Makes ""warranty"" replacement after 6 months cost more than 50% of value, which I consider beyond reasonable cut off point to pay out for a ""warranty"" item.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETO0170EOBQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00103FDDU#wasThisHelpful","RETO0170EOBQ8","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Too expensive for quality.  Works fine for short time - a few weeks to a few months.  Then it begins to quickly deteriorate.  The backing begins to stick to desk top surfaces and will lift off the finish ruining the area of desk that was under mouse. After it has your desk surface stuck to the back the pad doesn't stay in place.  Then it begins to curl inward toward your desk top.  Then then plies begin to separate.  I paid more for this because I expected more. It's not a lot of money to most folk I guess, but it was to me.  I don't mind paying more when I can get good quality and forget about it.  In this case, I should have just got several of the old cheap kind I guess.  They wouldn't have ruined my desk and I could have afforded to throw them away every few months for the same amount this one cost.  You just don't know these days about products.

"Very disappointed.  An excellent job of writing skills put to very poor use.  The book starts off reasonably interesting, enough so that you read on and on, hoping it will soon move on and get to business.  It just never happens and I just finally had to give it up at the 80% read point.  The book is devoted to opinions about why every director of the FBI, in Kessler's opinion, has failed miserably as Bureau head, and has been solely responsible for every miss step and failure ever to occur. On the other hand he tries to make a case for why the field agents bad decisions at critical moments at events such as Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc should not be held against them.  The book reads more like a rant.  Tale after tale, accusation after accusation are not sourced, so obviously they get nowhere close to a fact.  An example:  Vincent Foster committed suicide because Hillary Clinton hurt his feelings (not factual on any known or stated basis - thus, just gossip from unknown or fabricated source).  All the Witch hunts of the leadership and defense of the field agents, might have been a better read if it were titled in a way to indicate that was the road you were going to be taken down.  The time certainly was not well invested in providing any hint of any Secrets of the FBI.  I'll give another of his books a try, but if it fails to deliver like this one did, then I'm closing the door at 10%.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUW93ZBF0CY5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307719693#wasThisHelpful","RUW93ZBF0CY5Z","AG3V1LGJW7KVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG3V1LGJW7KVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Michael Giacchino has been busy of late, having scored four films that were released a month or two apart this year, with Jupiter Ascending, Tomorrowland and Inside Out being the others, along with Jurassic World, and all of them are incredible efforts. I would say, from my point of view, his score for Tomorrowland was his best, with Inside Out right behind (and i have listened to all of them on CD), but my favorite might be Jurassic World, only because he incorporates John Williams' mesmerizing theme from Jurassic Park, which always brings a tear to my eye in how beautifully composed it is.What makes Giacchino's score stand tall, though, isn't the returning theme, but his own variation of ""Jurassic."" His theme for Jurassic World can be heard in ""As the Jurassic World Turns,"" in the opening minutes before Williams' theme comes in the last minute. Variations of Giacchino's them can be heard later on, especially in ""Gyrosphere of Influence."" Like with all of Giacchino's scores, there's a massive sense of wonder and magic, or in this case, discovery. He also adds a good deal of horror elements with the track ""Indominus Wrecks,"" just a little over two minutes in, where intense piano and strings have your heart pumping as fast as the unfortunate characters in the film. But, the track ""Nine to Survival Job"" really gets me, as it's the music that plays over the final moments of the movie, and if you've seen the film, the last minute of the track brings pure happiness after a brilliant return 14 years later. I love the ""Jurassic"" films, even the absolutely awful third movie, but because they're not just action blockbusters. They're adventures, and we rarely get real adventure films. Even Tomorrowland, which I'll review at a later time, was a bold and completely original adventure that Giacchino helps bring to life in the best way possible. Just listening to this soundtrack brings nothing but nostalgia-fueled happiness. I hope i wasn't the only one, and i hope the scores for The Lost World and Jurassic Park III are re-released in lieu of Jurassic World's overwhelming success.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZ9YPAV4NFI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWUD62U#wasThisHelpful","ROZ9YPAV4NFI0","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Giacchino has a very distint style in how he creates a world of musical soundscapes that defy imagination. Like John Williams, who he is often compared to, Giacchino almost always has every score conducted wit a full orchestra, and rarely uses synth or electronics. Here, with ""Tomorrowland,"" he squeezes in the smallest amount of synth, takes a full orchestra and creates what I would call his masterpiece. ""Tomorrowland"" is a strange beast, of which has received a mixed response from critics and a more positive response from audiences, but one thing that helps bring this boldly original sci-fi adventure to life is the score.Full of fun thrills, adventure and heart, Giacchino embraces the unknown and embodies the theme of ""Tomorrowland"" in his music; the soound of a better tomorrow. In the opening track ""A Story About the Future,"" it starts the score with a loud, quick and playful tune to set the scene for the titular place. ""A Prologue"" is more sinister sounding, helping to build the mystery and unknown qualities of the film's journey. ""You've Piqued My Pin-trest"" is another playful sounding track as a young Frank Walker is thrown head-first into adventure, with ""Boat Wait, There's More!"" being the follow-up moments. It's ""Edge of Tomorrowland"" everything changes for Frank and for the audience, as Tomorrowland is shown in its literal shining glory. I could go on, but I'll stop. The score is timeless. Sure, it just came out, but everything about it screams gorgeous masterpiece. When was the last time a completely original sci-fi adventure movie was released? I can understand a few reasons why some people weren't huge fans, but I didn't see any narrative stumbles at all. The second act was slower and the third was extremely fast, but they should have been to begin with. You have the truth-revealing middle frame, where everything is laid out for the audience and the characters, then the third act is where they act on these reveals and answers to impossible questions. I just wish people didn't listen to critics and saw the film for themsevles. I guess originality is truly dead; remakes, reboots, prequels and sequels are all people care for now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AS7XI12S91P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5SU4B6#wasThisHelpful","R3AS7XI12S91P0","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Band of Brothers and The Pacific, two ground-breaking, emotional, triumphant and phenomenal series that cover two sections of World War II; the European Theater and the Pacific Theater. produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, both shows are considered to be not only two of the best representations of WWII in terms of filmmaking (I say filmmaking because, while they're seen as miniseries, they're basically extended movies), but incredible in every way possible, from the direction and writing to the acting and the production values. Saving Private Ryan, arguably the best WWII film, pales in comparison when looking at these two works. I won't detail their synopses, since information can be found pretty much anywhere, but i'll talk about their merits and the differences between the two.Band of Brothers, an emotional powerhouse that puts you in the shoes of Easy Company dropping into Normandy from the skies, with a group of men that fight not just for the world and their country, but for each other. With gripping performances from Damian Lewis, Donnie Wahlberg, Kirk Acevedo, Ron Livingston and a slew of other actors throughout the series. What makes Band of Brothers even more incredible, though, isn't just the production, visuals, or direction, but how you come to love nearly every character, including the small parts as they all come together and fight in such a horrific and gruesome war that defied reason. The Pacific differs from Band of Brothers not just in it focusing on the Pacific Theater of War instead of the European Theater, but that it lessens (just a tad), your love for the characters to show the effects war has on the psyche, the sheer brutality, relentless terror and violence. You still come to love and feel for characters, just not as quickly. Also, The Pacific does have the feeling of being grander and bolder, but not better. Both miniseries are brilliant, haunting, epic and outstanding in every department, with both outdoing one another in a single area.The blu-ray box set has some of the best video and audio technical specs to ever be on blu-ray, and if you do not yet own either series, this is a must-own. It also comes with a bonus feature that doesn't come with either series separately, called ""He Has Seen War,"" a 54-minute documentary that's extremely well-put together and informative. Here's to hoping Spielberg and Hanks team up again with HBO to deliver one more WWII series that focuses on the North African campaign of WWII, as it could complete their World War II Saga, similar to Clint Eastwood's Battle of Iwo Jima film saga.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFNSG6W6JDVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GYSUYI#wasThisHelpful","R1MFNSG6W6JDVS","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Directed by the Spierig Brothers and Starring Ethan Hawke and rising actress Sarah Snook, Predestination is adapted from the Robert A. Heinlein story, ""-All You Zombies-,"" a story that deals with time travel and the predestination paradox (i'd look it up; it would take up the whole review to explain in detail). Hawke's character meets the Unmarried Mother, a customer at the bar he tends, and the bartender shows his patron something unbelievable; he's a time traveler, a temporal agent who's sole purpose is to find the Fizzle Bomber, and change human history.Predestination is not the first film of its kind, but it certainly is original, even if adapted from a previous work, as it expands on Heinlein's story, bringing to light new elements and details, while still keeping a great deal away from the viewer's eye. The film is superb in every way, bringing both entertainment value and cinematic value into a short and sweet sci-fi thriller. The Spierig Brothers, who previously directed Daybreakers, are in top-form, carefully weaving together their screenplay with their focused and unflinching direction, creating a tense, and unknowing atmosphere as the characters move through different times. The acting was very brilliant, with Sarah Snook being the stand-out among the cast, but not topping completely Hawke's performance, which is one of (if not the) best performance he's given. The production and visual effects were surprisingly incredible for such a low-budget film, and there was never a moment where the film seemed out of its depth. Honestly, i really think these two brothers should stick with science fiction, because their delivery of Predestination couldn't have been done any other way without either straining the plot, revealing too much or a number of other problems that could arise.Predestination is a true sci-fi film, and if you are not a fan of anything science fiction related, do not watch this. If you like a good mind-bender, a thriller that keeps you guessing or a simply well-made movie, look no further. This is a must-see and a must-own.

"The Order: 1886 is the newly released Playstation 4 exclusive game that centers around the Knights of the Round Table, formed by King Arthur, in an alternate history timeline, where the knights keep the world safe from half-breed monsters. Through the miraculous discovery of Blackwater- a mysterious liquid that extends lifetimes- the knights continue to fight this on-going war, even though humans have been on the losing side since the beginning. The way the game is structured plays out like a film, and through this, comes a very theatrical and bold musical score.Composed by Jason Graves (with Austin Wintory co-composing The Knight's Theme), the soundtrack for The Order: 1886 is magnificent on multiple levels. Graves has a very unique sound, that of which is easily heard here though the use of eerie strings, pulsating percussion and haunting choir vocals. But, in comparison to past works, his score is less horror-based (like Dead Space and Tomb Raider) and more emotional, more character-driven. You can spot some recurring themes in the tracks, but what sticks out is his propensity to use violas and violins to create the atmosphere, only here they're more quiet; almost somber and tragic, whereas in Dead Space they were terrifying and heart-pounding. When it comes to intense action tracks, Graves is in top-form. ""Commandeered"" is one of these tracks, creating a smooth but intense rhythm that helps to create one of the game's finer action moments where Sir Galahad and his knights commandeer an airship. The one track that stands out the most, though, is ""The Edge of Sanity."" Epic, tragic, pure brilliance all rolled into this majestic piece that starts off with a dark and quiet voice, but builds into a bold, raging, courageous work of art that can be placed against any heroic act at a time where, it seems there can be no hope left.The soundtrack for The Order: 1886 is a must-own if you are a fan of Jason Graves' music, video game soundtracks, or scores from composers like Hans ZImmer, Ramin Djawadi, Brian Tyler, James Newton Howard, Bear McCreary or even Mark Snow. Jason Graves is becoming a bigger name in the video game scoring department, and hopefully will branch out and do a movie or TV show, because his music is superb!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MO6RORCZIT81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R71A532#wasThisHelpful","R2MO6RORCZIT81","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ramin Djawadi is no stranger to action music, but the way he delivers is very unique, whether it be the quiet build to a pulsing electric sound like in ""Person of Interest,"" or heart-pounding percussion and loud choir voices like in ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Dracula Untold."" Djawadi has made a very peculiar name of himself along side popular composers like Hans Zimmer (his mentor), James Newton Howard, Brian Tyler, Harry Gregson-Williams and Bear McCreary, and here with ""Safe House,"" Djawadi channels a more familiar sound and overall score in albeit a fast and pulsating way.The score is very similar to the scores of John Powell's ""Bourne"" films, using almost no synth and a whole lot of traditional instrumentation, mainly with percussion. So, unless you're a fan of action scores, intense orchestral music or any of the composers listed above, i'd give this soundtrack a listen before buying it, as it's very similar to scores like ""Green Zone,"" ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" and ""Unstoppable.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ULNCM0Q1E9XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OAB4OG#wasThisHelpful","R1ULNCM0Q1E9XO","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Call of Duty franchise is an interesting one in that, while they release a game annually, the series is always met with criticism (most of it pointless from gamers who call the series crap). After the massively underwhelming installment that was Ghosts (what is seen as a Michael Bay-esque video game), we are graced with the first game from Sledgehammer Games in the series, Advanced Warfare. In the review, i will only talk about the campaign, as i am not a multiplayer gamer. But from what i've seen, the exosuits have created a massive change for first-person online gameplay.The campaign focuses on Jack Mitchell, a former Marine who, after losing his best friend and fellow Marine Will Irons and his own arm, he is given a place at the Atlas Corporation, a private military contractor owned and operated by Will's father, Jonathan (portrayed by Kevin Spacey). Here, Mitchell is given a new arm, and a new purpose; to honor Will's memory. But, when the KVA, a new militia group led by the mysterious 'Hades,' attacks around the world, Atlas steps in to stop him, with Mitchell and his new team leading the charge.That's as far as I will go in revealing the story, but after playing the game multiple times, i must say this is the best Call of Duty to date. Like Call of Duty 4, the campaign in the game sets up a new trilogy, and actually cares about story-telling and not generic blockbuster-fare of cinematic events and massive explosions. What captured my attention, was the amount of detail that was poured into the story, the gameplay and the realism, even though it was futuristic. And that's when i see the name of the man behind the curtain; Mark Boal. The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, both films written by Mr. Boal, boasted realism that one expects to see in a documentary about war, coupled with emotional ties to the characters, all of which is definitely present in Advanced Warfare. The dialogue, the script, everything about Advanced Warfare screamed a more action-packed blockbuster version of Zero Dark Thirty, but i didn't fully know it until i watched the credits. Now, i'll say the campaign isn't game-changing in any way (mainly due to an ordinary conclusion/third act), but because of how well-written it is, how invested they were in creating such life-like characters and a truly horrific situation that reaches extremely brutal heights, Advanced Warfare has given me faith in the series again. Now, the gameplay itself is extremely smooth; the exosuits are brilliantly designed, the gunplay is polished, and the graphics were top-notch, with the cutscenes looking like an actual feature film.I've always liked Call of Duty, but i don't call myself a fanboy, as i find many disappointing things about the series (whether it's the emotionless plot of the first Black Ops, or the somewhat convoluted plot of Black Ops II, as well-written as it was). Either way, Advanced Warfare is the beginning of a new trilogy and a great one that boasts realism, fantastic characters and a simply good story that looks like it should be a movie franchise, or an HBO miniseries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9UQVZXOLIIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU1YEE0#wasThisHelpful","RZ9UQVZXOLIIQ","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2Guns is the action-comedy starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg about two undercover operatives (DEA and Navy SEAL Intelligence) who discover a secret operation between the CIA and illegal drug trade after stealing millions from Mexican drug-kingpin Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). The film was smart, fresh, dryly witty, violent and very lovable, and the musical score from Clinton Shorter (District 9) helps to shape the fun, atmospheric setting of the film.Having composed, conducted and helping perform the score himself, Clinton Shorter's score is often times upbeat and offbeat, matching the characters, their convoluted conflict with the CIA, drug cartel and crooked military operatives, and the friendship that develops between the two leads. With the uses of acoustic guitars, synth, and drums, the soundtrack to 2Guns is certainly one to check out, but isn't for everyone. Also, it's a short soundtrack, being just under 40 minutes long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN27FI3TPU6F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJFZXEO#wasThisHelpful","RN27FI3TPU6F4","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bear McCreary is truly a one-of-a-kind composer, and is the composer who is dominating the musical soundscape of television. With shows like The Walking Dead, Battlestar Galactica (and the spin-off Caprica), Defiance, Da Vinci's Demons and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, the man certainly knows no limits. And now, he's taken on another television series that requires both a different tone, and a different sound, both of which he masters immediately. He brings the Scottish-sound, the vocals of Raya Yarbrough, and his traditional use of ethnic instruments as well as sweeping orchestral sounds in a near-perfect soundtrack.The soundtrack is a must-own for fans of McCreary and of anyone who likes instrumental scores, but i must say, it is an unfinished product. Until Vol. 2 is released (CD being preferred if you ask me), this is only half of the masterpiece Mr. McCreary has crafted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O5SVR6BZ9RQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHYBCN6#wasThisHelpful","R1O5SVR6BZ9RQF","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gravity is a mixed bag. It is far from a masterpiece, which is what many have been calling it. I won't go into the synopsis since it's been covered a dozen times over, i'll get right to it. Gravity is absolutely beautiful. Alfonso Cuaron's direction is marvelous and supreme, Steven Price's musical score is hauntingly epic and the visual effects are top-notch. But, the script and characters? Not even close to astonishing. I've seen people raving about the acting and how emotional this film is, but in all honesty, i thought this film was one of the most emotionless films ever made. Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone was annoying, stupid and extremely unrealistic, and George Clooney's Kowalski felt like he was just there to fill in the space of a male lead (which is funny, since he doesn't have much screen time). Then, the script is decent at best. It does nothing new for the science fiction genre, or for drama, the dialogue is mediocre, and the story has been done before in other films and even in TV, just not to this extent. What i will give to Cuaron, though, is how he uses symbolism and themes like birth, rebirth and evolution (the most famous scene being Stone floating in zero-G, symbolizing a womb).I don't hate Gravity, but i refuse to call it a masterpiece, for that it is not. But i will not deny the film's beauty and technical achievements in filmmaking, especially the extended 'long-shot' sequence at the start of the film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3K1PYI9G3GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H83EUL2#wasThisHelpful","RT3K1PYI9G3GG","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From Paris with Love is an action movie from the director of Taken about a low-level CIA operative (Rhys-Meyers) who gets entangled in a terrorist plot when he teams up with the unorthodox agent Charlie Wax as they foil the terrorists' plans to bomb the US Embassy.Honestly, I really don't know why this movie failed at the box office. John Travolta was in his element and at his best in a role that was a mix of Pulp Fiction's Vincent Vega, and Castor Troy from Face/off. He was ecstatic, crude and wild as Charlie Wax, but easily his most entertaining character as well. Rhys-Meyers was good as James Reese, being a funny counter-part to an already funny, bad-ass and witty lead in Travolta. The script was not Oscar-material, but you don't need an Oscar-script to have a great action movie. Pierre Morel's directing here seemed inspired by the Bourne films and the new Bond films, but I think it was on purpose, which actually helped the film a lot.They really need to make a sequel or two to this fine, outstanding action-fest. Charlie Wax is easily on Travolta's top 3 characters, and the film itself was just a fun and refreshing action movie that doesn't have a lot of CG or digital effects (CG isn't bad, but in an action movie you shouldn't need a lot).4.5/5 Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16VLPQQ84IKY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZG97OC#wasThisHelpful","R16VLPQQ84IKY8","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main Uncharted trilogy is easily the greatest video game trilogy of all time so far, and always will be one of the best. The games literally play out like interactive adventure blockbuster movies, and the experience is one-of-a-kind. We're given a slew of incredible characters, truly memorable writing in the story and dialogue, and ground-breaking graphics.In Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, we're introduced to Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter who is searching for his long lost ancestor, Sir Francis Drake, who supposedly came across the lost city of El Dorado, after finding his coffin empty at sea. So, embarking on a quest to find El Dorado, Nate teams up with his life-long friend Victor Sullivan and a reporter named Elena Fisher, who just can never keep her nose out of trouble.In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Nate discovers that Marco Polo found the ancient city of Shambala, or as some call it Shangri-La. Once again, Nate embarks on a quest to find a lost city, but this time, he has something far greater to be aware (and afraid) of. The war criminal Zoran Lazarevic, former Soviet intelligence, is also searching for the fabled city, and that an old friend of Nate's is working for him. Fighting through waves of mercenaries with tanks, a helicopter and battling on a train, Nate soon discovers that some treasures are never meant to be discovered.The Uncharted saga is one of the most well-written and created stories of all time, not just in video gaming. If they adapted Drake's Fortune into a movie with a great director and writer(s) attached, it could and would be able to match both the Indiana Jones saga and The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings sagas, for being creative, complex, focused and well-realized. In terms of gameplay, the first game does have a few bugs that are annoying, but do not take away from the great experience, as for a game that was released in 2007, it was and is highly impressive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1646L8WC680ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055202HE#wasThisHelpful","R1646L8WC680ET","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The World's End is easily the best comedy I have ever seen. When five friends get back together after twenty years apart, they return to their hometown of Newton Haven to do The Golden Mile; 12 pubs, 60 pints. But when they return, they begin to realize changes, and soon discover that their home has become something else, and that the people they once knew are something else as well...Edgar Wright has truly crafted the greatest comedic trilogy on the planet with the Cornetto films. First, we got Shaun of the Dead; a romantic comedy with gory zombie violence. Then, we had a buddy cop comedy with Michael Bay-esque action sequences. Now, we have The World's End; a classical alien invasion movie, with a comedic King Arthur at the center. But, in comparison to the first two, I wouldn't say World's End is better or worse because, it is the end. The World's End, like Wright said, ""Is a thematic wrap-up."" We've followed these style of characters and the comedic rolls through the years, and we get to see them off in a blaze of glory (literally). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, though, were easily at their best, with Frost sometimes stealing the show in this installment. The soundtrack was fun, really helping fill the screen with intensity and energy. Surprisingly, the action sequences are among the best I've seen for any movie, with stunts coordinated by Brad Allen from Jackie Chan's martial arts team. Even the visual effects were top-notch, especially when we get to see the robots as robots.In the end, The World's End really is the perfect send-off for fans and watchers of the Cornetto trilogy. And for those just jumping into The World's End, I suggest watching the first two beforehand because, that way, you can appreciate this one more (if you like Wright's style of dry, witty humor). Honestly, I've never felt better after leaving a movie at the theater; The World's End really shows the importance of friendship, and why we love movies in the first place.5/5 Stars*****","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8A62H6E2THMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPEJX12#wasThisHelpful","R8A62H6E2THMP","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gears of War 2 is a truly remarkable and epic game that takes the Gears saga to a more emotional and heartfelt level of intensity and awe. So, in order to convey the grand scope and scale of the second installment, Epic Games recruited Steve Jablonsky (Transformers, Battleship) to score this sequel, and the others from then on. With Gears of War 2, Jablonsky offers a sort-of quiet patriotism to the grandeur of the game. This is very well noticed in the main theme, ""Armored Prayer"" which plays in the sequence where COG officially goes to war, leaving the city of Jacinto. Now, while I love Jablonsky's work, being able to convey electronics and orchestral sounds/choir together, but this score in particular was missing a bit of emotion, and at times even, it would get slightly repetitive. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but here, if they repeated a more emotional theme with the intense pounding of drums and trumpets, and the haunting choir in the background, this would have easily been the best video game score of the year.So, in the end, it's a must-own for anyone who likes Steve Jablonsky or video game music, but for those who also like movie scores or instrumental music, listen to samples and clips first, because some may be turned off by this heavy, hard-hitting soundtrack.4/5 Stars****","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQG4T9Q358YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HMFCGM#wasThisHelpful","R3GQG4T9Q358YR","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Battleship, directed by Peter Berg (The Kingdom, Friday Night Lights), gives us a sci-fi action blockbuster about our attempt to contact extra-terrestrials through the use of a giant, super-powered satellite. These alien creatures respond, but when one of their ships is accidentally destroyed when it flies into a satellite, they set up their ships and begin the offensive, believing this to be an act of war.Battleship was far from great, but it was a fun, entertaining blockbuster that was better than both Transformers sequels. Steve Jablonsky, who scored the Transformers trilogy, returns to the action blockbuster with Battleship, which is (in my opinion) better. Now, Transformers does have memorable themes, but Battleship is a very unique listening experience. He blends both orchestral sounds and electronics to shape the atmosphere of the film. Some of the sounds in the score are actually sounds made by the alien ships in film, too. What is really impressive, though, is how these random sounds and electronics come together so fluidly, and with rhythm. My favorite track on the disc by FAR is #10, Shredders. It is both intense, and haunting with the deep bass and electronics.Battleship is not for everyone, but I highly recommend it to those who love movie or video game scores, or someone who likes action-packed music.4/5 Stars****","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLENGFKPRL8IJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KL8TPU#wasThisHelpful","RLENGFKPRL8IJ","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Raven, directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) comes a fictional but somewhat accurate portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe, and of the time period when he spent his final days hunting a killer. No one really knows what happened to Poe the days before his death when he was reciting the name ""Reynolds"" over and over before his heart stopped. This movie offers one theory, and it's a very intriguing one.John Cusack plays Poe, a drunk who now sees his potential being wasted by the masses and a newspaper publisher, where some of his short stories get published. But when murders begin to happen as depicted in Poe's stories, a detective named Fields arrives to address the situation, and work with Poe to find the murderer.The Raven is, honestly, one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It doesn't rely on heavy visual effects, but still makes very good use of some CG (a shootout in the forest, and some nasty gore). McTeigue's directing is superb, I would even say slightly better than V for Vendetta (definitely more-so than his actionfest, Ninja Assassin). Cusack was surprisingly great as Poe, who was not necessarily the action-thriller hero you would expect, with the hero being Luke Evan's Fields, more-so. Evans was great, and while his character wasn't given a lot of background, he was still a likable and interesting character. Alice Eve was good as Poe's love interest in the film, who gets entangled in the game when she is kidnapped by the killer, giving Poe incentive to help. The musical score by Lucas Vidal was impressive, offering something that sounded like a haunting mix of Sherlock Holmes (Zimmer's score) and Knowing (Marco Beltrami). The cinematography was very good, being shot in impressive locations like Belgrade and Budapest. The script, while not award-winning, was very memorable and well-written. There were a few cheesy moments of dialogue during conversations between Brendan Gleeson's character and Cusack, but mainly the script was great at building the eerie atmosphere, and following through on a mystery that wasn't predictable.The Raven is one of the most underrated thrillers of all time, and it really should have done much better at the box office. I just hope this isn't the last time McTeigue does a period-piece thriller, because he would be great to adapt Dan Simmons's novel, Drood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HXTV2E4QV80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005S9EJGO#wasThisHelpful","R25HXTV2E4QV80","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cabin in the Woods, directed by Drew Goddard, tells the story of five college students headed out to a remote cabin for spring break. Like most slasher/horror films, these teens begin to exhibit the standard clichÃ©s. But this is all a ruse; deep below the earth, a facility monitored and controlled by a secret organization watches the five from all angles, subjecting them to whatever horrors are released. Will these students survive long enough to uncover the mystery?Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon (creator of Firefly and Dollhouse) crafted a true horror gem with ""Cabin,"" taking all the horror movie clichÃ©s and turning them on their heads. Goddard's direction really helps to create the foreboding and eerie atmosphere that is filled with terror, and laughs? That's right. Laughs, and a lot of them. Joss Whedon brings his creative genius with dry, witty humor to the big screen. And while the humor is absolutely hysterical (I died laughing a few times), the scares are there too. The script was cinematic gold. The characters were perfectly written, nothing ever felt rushed or cut-down, and it played out with such skill and admiration for a genre that had become crap, with what Whedon calls ""torture porn"" (aka, the Saw franchise, the Hostel films, etc.). The Cabin in the Woods is filled with gory violence and kills, too, but at least the film itself has a complex story and intelligent characters. The visual effects, surprisingly, were and still are top-notch for a low-budget film, combining CG and practical effects. The musical score by David Julyan (The Prestige, Insomnia) was superb, and the acting was great, especially Fran Kranz and Richard Jenkins, with Jenkins playing one of the engineers within The Facility.The Cabin in the Woods is easily one of the best horror films of all time not for re-inventing the slasher or what scares it had, but for the mind-bending and thoughtful story that was a homage to H.P. Lovecraft and all great horror films, their creatures and abominations. On a final note: Beware, movie-goer, for your understanding of Unicorns is wrong.5/5 Stars*****","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R165OJ0XU9C2DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008G33O0G#wasThisHelpful","R165OJ0XU9C2DK","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Greg Edmonson, who previously scored the first Uncharted game, returns in even greater form in the sequel, Among Thieves. Blending an array of orchestral sounds, with East Asian sounds to help create the game's atmosphere and showcase the locations, Edmonson crafts a masterpiece of a score that I can compare only to some great scores with it setting such a high standard for video game music, with comparisons to Gladiator, Blood Diamond, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.With ""Nate's Theme 2.0"" there isn't much that's different from the first theme in Drake's Fortune, but the percussion is a little heavier. ""Bustin' Chops"" is a great action-packed piece, but it's the track that follows that is one of the most beautiful musical tracks of any movie or video game score. ""Reunion,"" this track is the embodiment of greatness. The scene in the game when this track plays is more depressing than the track sounds, but the track itself is an emotional powerhouse. ""Breaking and Entering"" is another slow moving track that isn't really emotional, but helps to set a scene, as if it were painting a picture of obstacles to come.I'll stop there with track analyses, but what I don't care about with the CD release, is why the bonus tracks (that weren't in the digital release) are out of order. Because technically, the track ""The Heist"" would take place before ""Bustin' Chops,"" and the track ""Tunnel Vision"" comes before ""Train Wrecked."" It just bugged me a bit, because when you listen to them in order with the bonus tracks it does sound better. Either way, this score is a must-own for anyone who listens to instrumental/classical music, or video game/movie scores.

"The Thing is not a remake, but a prequel to John Carpenter's cult classic of the same name, where an alien being crash-lands on Earth after a supposed malfunction in its ship. The year is 1982, and a Norwegian team stationed in Antarctica have just uncovered the ship, and the frozen occupant. Recruiting the help of paleontologist Kate Lloyd, the financier of the discovery Dr. Sander Halvorson and his assistant Adam Finch then escort her to the dig site. But after they recover the creature and celebrate, things take a turn for the worst when the being awakens after thawing out, and begins killing the crew one by one. But the Thing doesn't just kill them, it assimilates them, becoming them. So, how do you fight something you can't see?Directed by Dutch filmmaker Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr., The Thing is a surprisingly well-made prequel that does the original justice, but not in the best way possible. If this prequel wanted to really define the greatness behind The Thing, it would have been longer, taken different twists and turns, but ultimately end at the same conclusion. Instead, it plays out a lot like the original film. When I mean a lot, I mean some of the scenes play out almost exactly like they did in the original, like when the Thing attacks the group after they try to help one of their own, revealing itself to be the injured party. Now while this isn't bad, it still would have been better if they did something more original. The acting was superb all-around, especially the slight show-stealing Lars, played by Jorgen Langhelle. The visual effects were overall good, having some truly award-worthy effects, and some run-of-the-mill effects that were alright, but kept the effects from ranking along side films with some other great CG the same year (Cowboys & Aliens, Real Steel, and Super 8). Though the scene that deserved an award just for the awe-inspiring feeling it produced was the shots of the alien craft starting-up. The effects were and still are some of the best, which is kind of surprising for a $35 million movie. The script was good, nothing award-worthy but living up to the original, and Marco Beltrami's score was just great. Keeping the same theme (which appears in the end credits) from the original, Beltrami creates a haunting and eerie sound-scape that is very memorable and spine-tingling.Honestly, I really don't get why this movie bombed at the box office. Was it because of the theatrical trailer? Did people actually listen to the critics when the movie came out? If so, that's sad. If you have seen the original or like science fiction/thrillers, get this. I'm not sure that there are many movies that can or have had a prequel treatment that's as good as this.4/5 Stars****","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VTCG45G6YSUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067QPVD2#wasThisHelpful","R2VTCG45G6YSUE","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never would have thought Brian Tyler to score an Assassin's Creed game, but boy was I surprised when I listened to his soundtrack. Tyler is a very good composer, having done big blockbuster films like Iron Man 3, Timeline, Fast Five and the upcoming Thor: The Dark World, but he's also done a couple video game scores, his best being Modern Warfare 3, which was good but not great. Here, Tyler continues the theme for AC with a Pirates sound similar to that of Klaus Badelt in Pirates of the Caribbean, but with a little more creativity. I personally love the second track the most (Pyrates Beware), which sounds incredibly epic and tense. While I don't think Tyler is as masterful as Lorne Balfe or Jesper Kyd, he proves himself to know source material in this great addition to the Assassin's Creed saga.My own personal problem (previously addressed with the Assassin's Creed Revelations soundtrack) is the availability. I will not purchase an only mp3 score, having no use for mp3 downloads. I love collecting CD's and having the physical copy there for my stereo, to listen to in the car on the way to school or work, and then to look at the phenomenal artwork and the credits, the people who made this score possible. So, while this is a truly great soundtrack, I won't waste my money on something I don't use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CASAP8AD82LT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXB6DAC#wasThisHelpful","R2CASAP8AD82LT","A3JBLXCH954NMV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JBLXCH954NMV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was a classic story of love and miscommunication. While it didn't reinvent the wheel, it was an enjoyable read.Jared and Sheridan were well-developed characters. Sheridan had a lot of heart and soul behind her, some of which you didn't really learn about till later in the story, just as Jared was finding out. Jared is a classic football star, preoccupied by women throwing themselves at him, until he finds himself knocked flat on his a$$ by Sheridan. He's immediately smitten and they get thrown into a whirlwind fake marriage...that doesn't stay fake for long. While they have zero communication skills (and thus, several cases of mistaken understanding), they quickly fall in love and have to figure out how to make it last forever.The plot was fun, the characters well written. There are two books that follow this one, but I don't know if I'll be reading them. I didn't feel much of a connection to Willow and Nick, the main characters in the next book. Still, this one was a good read, well worth my time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M8P7QUXTG6ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFQAN7S#wasThisHelpful","R2M8P7QUXTG6ZH","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this lotion for years and I've loved it for just as long.I initially tried it for a brand new tattoo. Truly fragrance-free, sensitive-skin lotion is harder to come by than most people think. There are a thousand of them on the market, but there's always a bit of something irritating in it. This is the one I tried and it's absolutely perfect. No fragrance whatsoever. The actual lotion is very light and not at all greasy.It worked great on my tattoo. I use it on my face regularly. It's safe to use on any part of your body without working about it being irritating.I'll definitely continue using it in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EN10MR0JSAZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZ22Y4S#wasThisHelpful","R1EN10MR0JSAZP","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the regular Biore strips for years and I've always liked them. They keep my nose soft and remove dirt and grime that have attached itself to my face, but I've never really been dependent on them. Really, I use them only when I remember or when I notice some out of control blackheads. They've definitely never left my face less greasy (unfortunately).I've read a lot about the power of charcoal and have used it in several different mediums, so I was excited to try out this one. These strips work exactly the same as the regular Biore strips. I didn't notice a difference in my skin between the regular ones and the charcoal ones. They did leave behind a black residue, which scrubbed right off. My nose is still soft and clean.While I didn't notice a difference, I think I'll continue using these over the others for a while. The fact that charcoal has been proven good for ridding the body of toxins makes me want to continue using them for this reason only. Who knows if it makes an actual difference, but I like the idea that it does.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Q3W3NLM6RCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6IHQCC#wasThisHelpful","R15Q3W3NLM6RCZ","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taste-wise, I like this powder a lot. It tastes like basic chocolate, and I don't find it to be a very fake flavor. It doesn't taste overly chemical-ly. It mixes great with milk in order to make awesome smoothies. It mixes smooth every time (chunky protein powder ruins everything!).As far as the actual healthy properties of this powder go, it's not so great. If you go about it without reading the nutritional facts, you'll be fine. But once you start reading the label and realizing that it doesn't 100% add up...you may feel differently. I know it's jam packed with fake chemicals, most likely, so I'm hesitant to buy it again in the future. It's low carb, so that's awesome. But the chemical additives ruin it for me.I'd consider buying it again in the future, because of the taste alone, but if I can find a different, healthier alternative, that's definitely what I'll be buying next time around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HX96M502FXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMUP58#wasThisHelpful","R36HX96M502FXB","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this book sounds a little shallow on the outside, once you start reading it, you'll quickly learn that the author knows her stuff.I would recommend this book for any older teen or 20-something that wants to live a financially-healthy life. As one of those 20-somethings, I know how easy it is to feel like you have your $h*t together. Unfortunately, as time goes on, situations pop up, and you feel like you know less and less. It seems really simple at first, but then you have to learn how to buy your first house, start a retirement account, build a savings account and an emergency fund, invest some of your money, fight for a promotion and raise. It's overwhelming at best.That's where the author comes in. She talks about all of these subjects in a very blunt, real, informative way. She doesn't talk down to you. She doesn't expect you to know the terms, and so she explains them. And my favorite part: she swears throughout. I'm always a sucker for some good, well-placed profanity.Anyway, this book is a lot more comprehensive than you might expect. Chapters include:* Stop Smiling and Nodding: Embrace the Rich B!tch Attitude* Hello, It's a Marathon AND a Sprint: Get a Grip on Your Future* Your New LBD: Create a Little Budget Diary That Fits YOU* Put a Roof on it: Home is Where Your Stuff is* Eat, Pray, Drive: Transportation, Food, Insurance, and Other Essential Expenses* Get That Monkey Off Your Back: Paying Down Debt* Lock It Up: Saving Sucks, but So Does Being Broke* Work It, Bitches: Put Your Career in Overdrive* Aging Gracefully: You Will Get Older--Do it in Style* Make it Grow, Baby, Grow: Investing is Just Not That Serious* Being Under, Over, and on Top of ""The Man"": Rich B!tches in a Man's World* Bringing it Home: Your Life is Your BusinessI'll definitely be interested in reading further books from this author in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6SCG4KO1334/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373893175#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6SCG4KO1334","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this case had a really great concept behind it, but the execution just isn't what I was hoping. I think it would be great when I go out and do things (where I might not have a charger readily available), but not for every day use.First off, the charging cable it comes with is WAY too short. I haven't looked around to see if I could get another with the same connectors that is longer, and I'm sure I could, but the fact that it comes with a tiny cable is just ridiculous to me.The case seems rather flimsy. The top ""bumper"" is not very tall, so I think if I were to drop my phone (which happens more often than I'd like to admit), it would shatter the screen. There is little to no protection in this case. The plastic seems like it's rather weak, like it could fall apart with just a little usage.I find the on button on the back of the battery pack to be too easy to press.For reasons unknown, I cannot get this case to charge when it is plugged in to the computer. It works great when connected to the wall outlet, though.I do think the case is rather aesthetically pleasing. It looks nice, but needs a little more work done before it is something that I use on a regular basis.All in all, the case is just okay. I'll be keeping it and using it occasionally, when I think the battery pack will come in handy, but I don't think I'll be using it on a regular basis. It's just too chancy when it comes to protecting my phone.**Note: I was provided this item at no cost in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BVFGRFMBWBA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R72NQM8#wasThisHelpful","R3BVFGRFMBWBA9","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen more and more products lately that contain charcoal and I've been itching to try them. When the opportunity arrived to try this particular bar, I jumped at the chance. I've used Biore products off and on my whole life, but never really with any regularity. I think I'll be using this bar for a long time.First off, the scent was pleasing, if a bit surprising. Once I looked carefully at the ingredients, I located the source: peppermint oil. The smell was pleasant, but I wasn't really prepared for the little bit of eye burning that came with it. I know this is common with peppermint oil, so it didn't really shock me, but I wasn't expecting it. There's no warning on the box about keeping it away from your eyes, which really did surprise me. There probably should be. Some people are more sensitive to the peppermint oil than others.I really do love the feeling this bar leaves behind. I keeps my face soft. Even on days when I forget to moisturize, I don't get a dry, flaky face. Instead, it stays soft and silky all day, which is SO nice. I am also noticeably less greasy, which I'm very appreciative of. I haven't noticed a huge difference in pores or blackheads, but the difference it makes in my skin alone is well worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1373P4ZZPO0K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6IHQOK#wasThisHelpful","R1373P4ZZPO0K2","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you think ""desk fan,"" you think of something tiny and weak, but better than nothing on a hot day.This fan beat out expectations in a big way.It's actually quite well made. It's fairly sturdy plastic that seems like it will hold up for quite some time. I'm not so worried about breaking it, so it can be moved around my desk as necessary.It puts out quite a good amount of air circulation. There are different speeds available and the highest is quite strong. You don't have to be sitting right up close to it for it to be effective.While it does come with the USB plug, it also comes with a regular AC adaptor, which I think would work better. I'll be using the AC adaptor more regularly, I think.All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised by the fine quality of this fan.

"While the whole ""stepbrother taboo"" didn't originally attract me to the book, it was the plot. I'm a sucker for a couple who hates each other and must learn to tolerate each other, only to fall completely in love.Brynn and Nate have great chemistry. I wasn't so sure at first because she spent a lot of time basically mooning over him. It was very naive and innocent and it honestly kind of drove me nuts. But that quickly went away as they had to interact. As they began to actually learn to be friends, I started to understand the attraction. They were a great pair.From the beginning, the relationship between Brynn's mother and Nate's father is obviously going to end in flames. When it finally did, I felt like it was a bit rushed. Suddenly all these things were happening at the end, a sort of snowball effect. The end of their relationship, as well as the dark moments of Brynn and Nate's relationship, all seemed to fly by as you approached the end. I wish it had gone by a little slower, maybe.As far as the whole ""stepbrother taboo"" thing goes, I just don't get it. It shouldn't even be a taboo. The parties are not related by blood. They didn't grow up together. They're literally meeting each other as adults and learning how to be family, as well as more. Doesn't seem very taboo to me.All in all, though, I enjoyed the book. I'll be picking up more from this author in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN14KGYYH0FD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1507554303#wasThisHelpful","RN14KGYYH0FD9","AW1FQRY25NXVS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW1FQRY25NXVS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Parables of Jesus"" is a congenial and loving attempt to provide the cultural context for the parables of Jesus  -- which (truth be told) can be enigmatic. But they are always pithy. Jesus didn't elaborate or explain his meaning. Unlike this illuminating yet wordy video.Jesus did not give motivations to the priest and Levite who passed by wounded man on the way to Jericho. But our narrator does. Jesus dispenses with the Prodigal Son's waywardness in a few words: ""he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.""  But the video  shows him as a rube being cheated by greedy locals and expands at length on his lavish parties. Jesus tells us how a man who found a pearl of great price sold everything he had. The DVD goes into detail about his negotiations with the seller, and his selling off of his paintings, pottery and furnishings.Maybe this is carping. There are valuable insights. For instance, the Prodigal Son's demand of half of his father's estate was equivalent to wishing the old man dead. Indeed, the DVD has the effect of taming Jesus's parables -- of reducing them to lovely life lessons. But the parables are as radical in our day as they were in his. Selling everything you have was meant literally, not spiritualized into doing whatever it took to get into heaven. Try replacing the despised Samaritan with a Taliban or ISIS fighter and see how ""sweet"" the story really is. And the tale of the dishonest steward was a call to Jesus's disciples to be as clever and creative in their pursuit of the Kingdom as the crooked are in pursuit of patrons.""Parables of Jesus"" is well-meaning and provides easy lessons for committed Christians. But mature Christians who seek more than comfortable nostrums would be advised to look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W93Z7X7FFZ0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E5KUTW#wasThisHelpful","R2W93Z7X7FFZ0P","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adored ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves,"" Truss's fun and educational tour through the misuse of punctuation -- but only for the noblest of reasons: to understand its proper usage. ""Talk to the Hand"" promised to give the same treatment to rude or insensitive language. But I found it a bore. The humor was pale to the point of disappearance. And Truss's point -- that the linguistic lubricants of yore  (the 'thanks yous"" and ""pleases"" of our forebears) were all but  extinct -- was lost on me. I agree that hearing polite speech from a corporate recording has none of the charm of a personal response, but her implication that human speech has devolved into a series of linked eff-words was overdrawn. There's no question that the public language of today has more than its share of words that were considered taboo fifty years ago. But Truss makes no allowance for the welcome loosening of many of society's former strictures. As the eclipse of the corset gave way for female organs to breathe, so has the loosening of language given many the ability to express themselves freely without feeling they were transgressing with every earthy expression or split infinitive. Despite the many encomia from literary giants gracing the back cover, I'd give this one a miss.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KG0SFXPSF6WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592401716#wasThisHelpful","R3KG0SFXPSF6WJ","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled upon this film while looking for ammo against those who see 9/11 as an inside job, perpetrated by the US government to get the public riled up for a war in Iraq. Using plenty of archival footage of the building of the WTC and the attacks, the film shows how the building was constructed, the decisions that went into its design  and the vulnerability that these gave it to attack from fuel-laden jets.The most affecting interview was with the architect who moved so  such of the building's structural support from the building's interior to its outside framework. His admirable desire to save weight led to his choice of two materials -- easily blown-off fireproofing and sheet rock rather than concrete walls -- that contributed to the weakening of the structure's steel trusses and effectively blocked access to emergency stairwells.As an introduction to the structural issues that caused the collapse of North and South towers, ""Why the Towers Fell "" is incomparable.

"Author and historian Barbara Tuchman gives us a dense, but interesting book in ""March ofr Folloy."" The best sections provide behind-the-scenes looks at the personalities and thought-processes behind two great convulsions in American history: the British reaction to colonial ferment in America, and our nation's entanglement in Vietnam.Tuchman portrays the aristocracy Britain as being wedded to its need to show strength against the colonies, informed  by an aristocratic preoccupation with keeping the colonies in their place.She also shows how he colonists' insistence in being represented in Parliament made so little sense: the average British citizen was not represented in Parliament either! By its thick-headed and ham-handed actions, the British government all but guaranteed that America would break away. It's fascinating to imagine what might have happened to America's hopes for independence had the King and his court been ruled by the wise, rather than the rash.The Vietnam conflict was informed by a need for the US to project post-WWII strength against the newly ascendant Communist sphere. But the US never grasped that the Vietnamese would see  us as just another white colonizing power like the French. While we had legitimate concerns about the ease with which communism was spreading in the 1940s and 1950s, we were hamstrung by our politician's dread of being the ones to have ""lost"" another county to communism. That gave free hand to absolutist commie-haters, and made it impossible to kind of flexible approach that might have allowed us to deal with the subtleties of that conflict.Tuchman's take on the Trojan war was kind of silly, though. It's one thing to dissect history, and another to analyze fiction as though it were history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8NWQ9DRZXPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345308239#wasThisHelpful","R1D8NWQ9DRZXPE","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is no book that can satisfy the obsessive search for details that locals crave about the Boston Marathon bombings. But ""Long Mile Home"" is a start.Focusing mainly on 5 individuals -- Heather Abbot, wounded at the Forum Restaurant;  Krystal Campbell, killed by the first blast; race director Dick McGillivray; Mass General surgeon Dr. David King; and police officer Shana Cottone-- authors Helman and Russell take us from the preparation for the marathon through the bombing to the lives of the participants and their families as they struggle to move forward.For a series of events that took place over only 5 days -- from the running of the Marathon on Monday, April 15, 2013 to the capture of the last Tsarnaev brother on Friday the 19th -- there is a vast expanse of ground to cover -- especially for Bostonians who were glued to the media for the whole time, who know the area and who have played the events over and over in their minds. Helman and Russell did a good job of digging up the tangled backstory of the Tsarnaevs, who fled Russia's fractured economy and dirty politics for a better chance in the US. We get sketches of each of the book's main subjects, including Krystal Campbell, the promising young women who is no longer available to speak for herself. But 300 pages is hardly enough room to cover every aspects of a story that directly drew so many into its web. The week included the bombings themselves, the frenzied attempt of bystanders and first responders to save lives, the heroics in local surgical suites, law enforcement's search for clues, a presidential visit to the wounded, a dead cop at MIT, a car hijacking followed by a wild firefight in Watertown, the historic shutdown of the Boston area, followed by the apprehension of the main suspect. Given the breadth of the task, the authors can't be faulted for not including every detail.But they include some fascinating glimpses behind the scenes. Of Watertown's David Henneberry, obsessive about caring for his boat, upset that two of the paint rollers he used to guard the craft from scratches, were inexplicably on the ground. Of police called to a shootout, arriving from all directions and firing towards each other. Of the mental calculations of Danny, carjacked by the Tsarnaevs, as he tried to escape. Of the frustrations obstacles and possible mental illness that might have Tamerlan to contemplate striking out at America.  Of the painful decision to amputate the healthy portion of an injured leg in order to improve mobility later.If I have one critique, it's that the book often pulls back from the more horrifying or intriguing details. You won't find mention, for instance, of the gruesome exposure of Jeff Bauman's tibia that was splashed over TV screens nationwide. Krystal's last moments, captured on film from a local building, are shrouded in gauze and indirection. Victims Martin Richard and Lu Lingzi get scant mention. You won't hear about the red lasers from sniper rifles dancing of Dzhokar Tsarnaev's head and body as he balanced on the side of the boat he had made his hiding place. You won't find out who yanked him off the boat or how. There is no mention of the raft of conspiracy theories that fouled the internet after the bombing. This reticence might make sense from the perspective of a local journalist, who needs to stay on the good side of the public and of tastefulness. But for those steeped in the basics of the case, and are familiar with its images, there was surprisingly little new to learn.But no matter. Journalism being the first draft of history, ""Long Mile Home"" lays the groundwork for future works of more depth and detail. It sets down a marker for those who would spin wild tales of government incompetence or nefarious misdirection. And it makes clear that Bostonians are four-square solid behind the victims of the bombing, committed to honoring their sacrifice and protecting their privacy, and uninterested in having their local tragedy turned into fodder for curiosity seekers and conspiracy freaks. There is much, much more to say about the Boston Marathon bombings -- including whether the Watertown search was well-executed and how uncoordinated fire nearly cost the lives of three Boston area cops. But that is for another day. Let the focus for today be on those who suffered and on their epic journey to regain some measure of peace and wholeness.For all who suffer and struggle, and in memory of Krystal, Lu, Martin and Sean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DJJQ9LD2XUCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954481#wasThisHelpful","R1DJJQ9LD2XUCZ","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wes Anderson has made a few great films (Whale and Squid, Moonrise Kingdom) and some real sweet stinkers. IMHO, neither audiences nor actors seem to understand which is which -- and what sometimes makes his films great to watch. The Grand Hotel Budapest Hotel is not exactly a stinker, but tries to be so much more than its writing and direction allow. Its all-star cast is split between those trying to make every moment grandly ironic (Ralph Fiennes in particular) and those just playing it straight. Fiennes's every line is delivered as though he expects  it to reverberate with Comedic Greatness. Instead, he brought so much attention to his delivery that the story and his character were often lost in the dazzle. The movie's visuals also try too hard -- the girl with a Mexico-shapped birthmark (ha!); the out-of-place Pakistani lobby boy with his title writ large on his cap (ho!), the funicular trundling up to the hotel (hee!). These are presented with so much comedic ""ta-da!"" that they lose any chance of being charming.Many will love ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" not becuase it's all that funny or great, but because they know they are supposed to. Expect the knowing laughter to be loudest at the start, and taper off as the movie winds down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EU6IGIRO3U60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAQJMJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2EU6IGIRO3U60","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nathaniel Philbrick has done it again, with ""Bunker Hill,"" the story of the beginnings of the American Revolution. With occasional forays into the French and Indian War of the 1750s and other pre-Revolutionary events, Philbrick covers the period between the Boston Tea Party in 1770, and the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. That gives a chance to cover a wide swath of well-known US history, including the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the Boston Massacre, and the Tea, Stamp and Intolerable Acts  -- all of which flames up hottest in my little corner of the world, Boston, MA. But Philbrick doesn't relay dry historical facts. He brings to life the great personalities of the time  -- firebrand Sam Adams and his cooler cousin John, a barely-controlled George Washington, dandified John Hancock, bewildered General Gage and his more combative replacement General Howe -- as well as many lesser-known (and often mythologized) figures of the period. Paul Revere gets scant attention, presumably because his small though critical role has been covered adequately elsewhere, notably in David Hackett Fisher's ""Paul Revere's Ride.""  But Philbrick's lively prose and keen eye for the telling detail make history jump off the page, letting the reader visualize events in exciting and often terrifying colors. Concord and Lexington come to life vividly, and you experience every emotion, from the horror at seeing Concord ""burn"" (a house accidentally caught fire while the Brits were burning caissons, and they helped put out the blaze), to the white hot fury after the Regulars opened up on them at the North Bridge, to the patriot's confusion after they crossed the Bridge and realized the import of their actions, to the scandalous hatchet slaying of a wounded Regular, to the wild and lethal chase back to Boston that left nearly as many patriots dead as their British prey.But if there's one tragic hero in the book, it's the relatively little known Doctor Joseph Warren. A whirlwind with a busy medical practice, he managed to be a mover and shaker in colonial Boston and served on the Commitee of Correspondence whish kept the flame of resistance alive in Massachusetts . A young widower (he was only 34 in 1775) he may also have been active in the boudoir as well. Philbrick introduces us to his public amour, Mercy Scollay, and to the teenage ""incognita pregans"" that he and his friends kept under wraps. When the Battle at Bunker Hill finally got under way, Warren wanted to be nowhere but in the thick of the fight, and there he died, rather brutally as it turns out.Philbrick does not insult the reader by giving a sanitized version of history. There are heroics aplenty, of course, as doughty New Englanders (with some more timid exceptions) built in one night a breastworks right in the teeth of the British Navy. And the effort to build pre-fabricated defense on Dorchester Heights was not only a feat of daring, but one of well-thought-out engineering and military prowess. Once on the Heights, the Patriots, by then led by Washington, could not only bombard the besieged city of Boston, but the British fleet that protected the town and its community of British troops and Tories. But for every deed of valor, there were follies aplenty. Building on Breed's Hill (the actual site of much of the fighting) was not as smart as building on nearby, taller Bunker Hill. And there was no unified command structure during the battles. Though this might have helped the Patriots, as the Brits might have been confused by the uncoordinated (and therefore unpredictable) attacks they had to withstand. And there was plenty of cowardice as well, with leery patriots leaving the battle field prior to the battle and failing to reinforce it when needed. At the end of the day, however, the British had suffered nearly 50% casualties. Enough to make them realize that they were not up against a gaggle of bumbling farmers, but with a force to be reckoned with.History, as taught in school and echoed in patriotic speeches, seems about inevitable events. But ""Bunker Hill"" will show that great events, even those with storied histories, depend on the cumulative actions of men of determination and action, and that chance -- a changing wind that brings the sound of digging to an alert officer, the happenstance of a general reluctant to fight -- can play large roles as well.""Bunker Hill"" is a masterful work of history that expertly threads the needle between hagiographic nonsense and hypercritical carping. It's a treasure!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DO2LWRG65LIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025445#wasThisHelpful","R3DO2LWRG65LIR","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jessie Crockett's ""Drizzled with Death"" follows in the footsteps of her marvelous ""Live Free or Die"" by thrusting rural New Hampshire folks into the very maw of death and peril. Well, one of them anyway. The unfortunate Alanza Speedwell is a cranky, land-razing so-and-so who mysteriously lands face-first into a stack of flapjacks at a pancake eating competition. Dani Green, the young and unmarried daughter of a local maple sugaring family, is appalled at the death, not only for Alanza's sake, but because it might implicate her family's maple syrup as poisonous and put her folks out of business. She needs to find the killer, and fast!Complicating matters is the escape of a truck load of zoo animals, which (aside from providing some comic relief) pop up at all the wrong times and places. Not to mention the human fauna-- which includes a skeptical (but ripplingly handsome!) fish and game official, a lovelorn, New Age mom, a peekaboo mountain lion,  a roadkill taxidermist and enough midnight skulking about to fill a bookcase of Peyton Place novellas.""Drizzled with Death"" grabs you like a walk in the New Hampshire woods -- starting out as ordinary until each leaf works its magic to mesmerize you. Jessie's women are as scrappy and ornery as her men are old-timey and blustery, making for a combustible mix of chase and rejection that contrasts with the book's bucolic setting. Jessie's New England  setting--with its sugar sheds, Granite-State-shape bottles, wood stoves and maple-topped hills--makes for a wonderful backdrop to Dani's derring-do. The north country's foliage-covered knobs and dales are beautiful to look at, but they shield mysteries and perils beneath their leafy boughs!Expect a thick outpouring  of lovers' misunderstandings and suspects galore. And I bet you won't know whodunnit until Jessie reveals the truth! ""Drizzled with Death"" is a fun, suspenseful read, seasoned with Jessie's trademark wit, tight plotting and memorable characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZ58BI44CVFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425260003#wasThisHelpful","ROZ58BI44CVFR","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish that the furor over Reza Aslan's book, ""Zealot,"" had never occurred. The outage over a Mulim writing a book about Jesus was a huge distraction, and set up the kind of phony battle lines that our culture is famous for. On one side, the conservative and Islamophobes who hated the book on principle because of its author's religious identity. On the other, the atheists and the kind of reflexive liberals who support whatever their enemies hate. In the middle are those like me who hope to read the book on its own merits.And while those merits are well-deserved, they are too often shaky.The main thesis of Zealot is that Jesus of Nazareth was very much a person of his own era. Like many others in his day, he was antagonistic to the economic inequities that were becoming more pronounced in first-century Galilee. Like many others, he looked upon the Roman occupiers as signs of evil times in Israel. Aslan wants us to believe that Jesus, while not an armed rebel leader, was a Jewish nationalist bent on removing the Romans fro m Israel. It's this thesis that, In the end, he fails to prove.Along the way, however, Aslan treats us to many aspects of 1st century life that are generally unknown to casual believers, and which are worthwhile keeping in the mix when we try to understand Jesus and his times. He will also introduce readers to aspects of New Testament scholarship and history that are shocking to the lay worshipper, yet are (for the most part) well established among non-fundamentalist scholars. While he has a tendency to embrace the most shocking scholarly hypotheses  (no Joseph!) and accepts or rejects the historicity of certain gospel traditions in his own unique manner, his opinions are not out of line with what many scholars say about Jesus and the first century world.In the first century, the ancient subsistence farming economy was breaking down under the pressure of increased taxation from the Romans. Small shareholders found it increasingly difficult to  maintain themselves in an economy where 50% of their earnings were siphoned off to the Romans, to local landowners to pay off debts, or to the Temple treasury in Jerusalem. Add to this the local political instability. When kings like Herod the Great were in power, they hired lavishly from the local peasantry to build and to decorate their new cities. When kings died or were overthrown in revolts, these artisans and other workers were out of work, unable to return to failed farms and unable to find new work.Aslan does a nice job of explaining the Temple economy, which required Jews to sacrifice animals (which cost money) in order to fulfill their religious observances. He does skate the edge of anti-Semitism by calling the priestly class, and their money changing network,  ""moneygrubbers."" But to the average illiterate and impoverished Jew, with no other recourse for forgiveness of sins and removal of impurity, the machinery of the Temple's sacrificial system was ruinous financially. It might well be that this led people like Jesus to wonder whether  it was also empty spiritually.Aslan tries hard to draw a straight line between the Jesus of the gospels and the various messiahs and rebels that sprouted up during this time period. He thinks that when Jesus asks his disciples whether they have swords (they produce two) this makes him a bandit leader. He takes literally Jesus's statement that he came not to bring peace, but the sword. He claims that ""Render under to Caesar"" was a political statement about returning the land to Jewish ownership. And he makes too much of the short, violent scuffle in Gethsemane when Jesus was arrested. Yet though it's doubtful that Jesus welcomed the Romans into Israel, there is a great deal of subtlety here that Aslan does not bring up. For instance, Jesus's command to turn the other cheek is hardly the kind of advice a Rome-hater would proffer. And neither is his advice to walk two miles with the soldier who pressed him to carry a load for one mile. If Jesus wanted Rome to go, it was God who would make that happen. And that is a critical difference between Messiah Jesus and all the other messiahs of his age.Aslan is correct in his statements that Jesus foresaw a reversal of fortune in the near future. (Read Luke's ""Magnificat"" if you want to get an idea of how radical was early Christianity!) Jesus saw the Twelve disciples as judges who would rule over the twelve tribes of Israel. He saw himself as the Son of Man, a conquering figure drawn from the Bible's eschatological tradition. Aslan is correct that Jesus offered a critique of the Temple system, at a time when the Temple leaders and Roman overlords were in uneasy alliance against rebels and others who would cause disturbances. And he is correct in seeing Jesus's cleansing of the Temple - with its direct physical action against the money changers - as the action that precipitated his arrest and death. Finally, he is completely on target by noting that crucifixion was a Roman punishment, not a Jewish one. It was reserved for political crimes - sedition, rebellion, treason and revolt.While Christians have complicated and overthought Jesus's teaching in order to make him seem too other-wordly,  Aslan has gone too far the other way, making him too ordinary. For Jesus to have been seen as a threat to Rome and the Temple did not require him to advocate physical violence against them. Given the cruel and suspicious times, it was enough that he was actively planning to rule Israel, after God intervened in history, in place of the Romans. An ethical teacher and self-styled prophet, whose healings taught the peasantry that God was on their side, didn't have to raise a finger or an army to seem like a threat to established power. Merely by publicly standing against them, rather than sinking into safety and anonymity, Jesus drew too much public attention to himself and had to be dealt with. Pilate's writing on Jesus's titulus -- ""King of the Jews"" -- was a cruel joke,  something that Aslan thinks the Romans, those spawners of satirists and bawdy poets, were incapable of.Though ""Zealot"" contains a great deal of scholarship, the book has serious faults. Aslan minimizes the range of opinion within biblical scholarship.  One scholar might reject the birth narratives as entirely spurious, while another finds some or much truth in them. Aslan, for instance, goes farther tha n most in suggesting that Joseph, Mary's betrothed and Jesus's step father, did not exist. He suggests that Mary was an unwed mother, which has some possible support in Jesus's opponents calling him ""Son of Mary."" But though this is a legitimate hypothesis, it's hardly the consensus of scholars. Aslan is also somewhat arbitrary in his rejection of gospel verses that he doesn't like. Gone are the trial before Pilate, the infancy narratives (Jesus was born in Nazareth) and even a synagogue in Jesus's hometown (though he later backtracks and suggests that there might have been a room devoted to the Torah). And he is maddenigly contradictory. The Jews of Jesus time were mostly illiterate, yet Jeses seems to have been familiar with Scripture, and his disciples enough so to immediately bring to mind that Jesus as being ""zealous for the law"" when he cleaned the Temple. Most unforgivably, though, for Aslan and his editors, he commits some serious errors of fact. He thinks the Sea of Galilee was salty, when it is an inland, fresh-water lake. He confuses James the son of Zebedee with James the brother of the Lord. He claims (in opposition to actual archeological finds) that Jesus was nailed through wrists (OK , so says the possibly-forged Shroud of Turin) and ankles, which don't have the same bone structure as wrists! And that Jesus  carried the crossbeam of the cross (most scholars agree on this) but that it was attached to an upright laid on the ground, which was then hoisted up into position. Though these errors not consequential to his thesis about Jesus as a religiously-zealous Jewish nationalist, they do point to a rather slapdash creation for what should have been a very careful analysis.For all its shortcomings, Aslan's ""Zealot"" is not a bad book. It is certainly not an attack on Christianity or on the person of Jesus. And, taken with a grain of salt, it will expose readers to controversies about Jesus's life that scholars have been wrestling with for years. The book is the continuing effort, by people of goodwill twenty centuries after the death of Jesus, to make sense of a figure of immense complexity and seeming contradictions. I don't agree that  Aslan's Jesus is as ""compelling, charismatic and praiseworthy"" as the Christ worshipped in churches. But taken with an element of caution and skepticism, it does sketch a story of his times that is richer and more robust than the watered down Jesus of sermons and popular culture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7G1QPEXL2EO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140006922X#wasThisHelpful","R1N7G1QPEXL2EO","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Lewis, Georgia congressman, Civil Rights hero and last remaining speaker from the 1963 March on Washington, gives us the first installment of the story of his life and activism in ""March:  Book One."" Lewis grew up on a small farm in Georgia, and hoped to be a preacher. He preached to the chickens which were in his charge. But the zeitgeist of the era pulled him toward the new movements to obtain civil rights for blacks, putting him into contact with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his efforts to use nonviolent means to open up busses and lunch counters to all customers. The story focuses on the sit ins held at various Montgomery, Alabama stores, and shows the raw hatred and intolerance that were the norm in the South prior to the 1960s. Lewis acquaints us with some of the lesser-known light of the movement, like lawyer Jim Lawson and Diane Nash and with the training that the protesters endured (being spit on, called names and physically threatened) to toughen themselves up and remain non-violent. Lewis is not shy about showing the divide between older blacks like Thurgood Marshall, who advocated a less confrontational approach to desegregation, and younger blacks who were impatient for justice.The book's black-and-white panels give he story a sense of age and weightiness. But it's the gravity of the subject and the living witness of John Lewis that give the book its punch and makes the story so compelling. This all really happened, within the memory of the author and of many readers.""March: Book One""  is the story of a people on the move to reclaim their dignity and value in the context of a viciously racist America.

"""Girl with No Name "" tells the fascinating tale of Luz Marina, a 5-year-olf girl kidnapped from her Columbian home and left in the jungle to die. Somehow, with the help of a troupe of capuchin monkeys, she survives for several years before being found by a couple of game hunters and brought to the city. Her tale of survival is amazing. Almost too much so. When he eats bad seeds, an elderly monkey pushes her to a stream and forces her to drink water until she vomits up the poison. After that, she basically lives in a bucolic dream, eating what the monkeys eat, sleeping where they sleep and generally living in a child's paradise of colors, lights and never-ending play.About a third of the way through the book, I started doubting the story was real. It seemed incredible that a child could live so easily in a jungle in which indigenous people had to work so hard -- building fences and hunting and crafting containers, etc. The child never had  a toothache or cold or childhood disease. The perfect life.But it seems that a kidnapping, even in a dangerous country like Columbia would have made the news somewhere. Not to mention the mafia activity that the author claims she witnessed, including an explosion that destroyed a bridge and killed two boys. Not even the convent that sheltered her is asked to show records of her stay. And the ghostwriter who prepared the manuscript only relies on her own interior sense that Luz was telling the truth.""The Girl with No Name"" makes for an action-packed read. I read it voraciously to the end. But it would have been even more amazing had it not seemed like a fantastic story concocted by a former street kid to account for a real history she chose not to remember.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BTQ5NC6CSENB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605984744#wasThisHelpful","R2BTQ5NC6CSENB","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Demi's ""Joan of Arc"" is filled with art inspired by medieval stained glass and by the Books  of Hours of famous dukes of the era. The plates are brightly colored, with splashes or silver and gild that shimmers off the page like those precious metals. But the story of Joan--she of the voices, the armor and the stake--paled by comparison. There are too many place names and personages for what seems to be a book aimed at young children. No mention is made of the scandal of Joan wearing men's clothing until the final scenes in which she is condemned for the practice.  There is no explanation of what a Dauphin is, or who the Burgundians were. And some might be put off by the book's Catholic slant. Finally, the map in back of the book names  cities not mentioned in the story, misses an opportunity to show Joan's movements, and (quelle horreure!) misspells ""CompiÑgne,"" the place of Joan's capture.The story of Joan is one of courage and honor under pressure.

"I loved the Nation, Terry Pratchett's reflection on death, chance, the gods and beer. In the mid-19th century, after a tidal wave devastates a South Seas island, Mau (a local boy), Daphne (a marooned white English girl) and a motley assortment of islanders, must work together to rebuild their lives. Mau is assaulted by conscience-like voices of the grandfathers, ancestors who badger him about his failings.  Daphne is haunted by the death of her mother and baby brother. Naturally, these two opposites attract and help each other to survive the harshness of their new surroundings.Pratchett really gets into Mau's head. The boy is haunted by the demands of the ancestors and the gods, but in a rage that they did nothing to prevent the killer wave, or at least warn him about it. He comes to rely on himself, and his motto ""Does not happen"" -- his insistence that there is no fate, only the unwillingness of people to allow evil to happen. This stance takes Mau pretty far and goes a long way toward making a decent life for the islanders.The book relies non deliberate revisionism to drive home its point about the inherent worth of all people. While there is a great deal of casual racism by certain evil characters who come to the island, the place is a social paradise, where anyone who wishes to contribute can. The old world, with its gender, class and racial distinctions, was largely washed away with the tsumani. Still the islanders, especially Mau, struggle with the fact that ""trouser men"" (whites) have so much technology, while he and his people have so little. Is he unworthy? Cursed? Not smart enough? Pratchett's solution to this conundrum is clever and ennobling, if not historical.The Nation is another in a long line of Pratchett's brilliant and funny musings on the follies and saving graces of the human race. A delight from its drowned beginning to its bittersweet ending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ITMA98NFMMLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061433039#wasThisHelpful","R3ITMA98NFMMLK","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you were a big fan of the Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" series when it came out in 1980, or like me, you somehow missed most of it, not realizing its brilliance, this DVD is a must-see. It's wonderful how well the productions values have stood up over time. Carl Sagan, with his corduroy jackets, hushpuppies, turtlenecks and trademark long 1970s-style hair, is the consummate narrator of his own writing. His thinking, put into sound by his clipped, bass tones, is clear and accessible without being patronizing. But the star of the show is really the Cosmos of the title, and the numerous scientists that brought it to our understanding. Johannes Kepler (who determine the planetary laws of motion), Christian Huygens (who, among many other things, determined that Saturn's rings did not touch the planet), Albert Einstein (whose laws of relativity bring order to the oddities of the very fast) and Hypatia of Alexandria (who ran the famous library there) all merit prolonged segments. Sagan also gives homage to the ancient Greeks and Ionians, the practical merchant people who gave science its first boost. Democritus (who posited the existence of atoms) and Aristarchus get big mentions. Great thinkers like Plato are derided as ""mysticists,"" people who preferred thought to experiment and cogitation to involvement in the real world. Pythagoreans, entranced by supposed relationship of numbers and ratios, actually suppressed the existence of irrational numbers (like the square root of 2) because it did not fit their dogmatic schemes about the universe. With these, Carl is not pleased.Sagan uses Cosmos to teach about the universe, but also to proselytize for his strongly held scientific convictions. One, that the growth of the storehouse of knowledge is good, and that science is the best way to achieve it. Two, that human beings evolved from previous creatures. Three, that the universe is unimaginably large, complex, dangerous, yet comprehensible. Four, that the wonders and varieties within the natural world are accessible to the human mind, and they do not require the involvement of a creator. The minerals of Earth, for instance, are not created ""de novo"" where they are found. Instead, they were cooked in stellar furnaces, and spewed into intergalactic space when the stars blew up. Life on Earth began with amino acids, spewed into the seas by the work of lightning reacting with the primeval atmosphere of methane and ammonia. Self-replicating chemicals organized into more and more complex forms until life began, and continued evolving for billions of years. Sagan's Cosmos is one of randomness and accident leading to the enormously beautiful and complex structures - galaxies, stars, planets, life - that we experience today. For Sagan, these facts are a reason for wonder. Coming years before today's culture wars over creationism and evolution, there's a kind of innocence in his presentation. One wonders how such sentiments would play in today's polarized and science-phobic culture.The breadth of Cosmos is staggering. It covers the evolution of life, the possibility of life on other words, the lifecycle of stars, birth and death of planets, relativity and time dilation, the development of the elements, the variety of planets and moons in our solar system. Sagan does a bit a self-promotion for his own ideas as well. He helped develop informational disks that were attached to the Voyager spacecraft as they explored the outer solar system. He was instrumental in determining the surface temperature of Venus. He is a relentless promoter of planetary exploration and interstellar travel.But overall, Sagan is a teacher. The Cosmos series is serious science but is accessible to 6th graders. Sagan goes to great pains to make his language and great ideas understandable to those without science backgrounds. And his images -- a galaxy rising over the ocean of a distant planet, the brilliant explosion of a nova, the extinction of life on Earth by a bloated and dying sun - are as beautiful as they are educational. Sagan's prescience about global warming (the same thing that is cooking neighboring Venus) and his fears that humankind need not necessarily survive our use of atomic weapons, make him a clear-sighted and far-seeing observer of nature and of the way human beings manipulate it, perhaps beyond our ability to correct for our errors.Cosmos is a triumph on so many levels. It is a work of art, weaving together the strands of music, history, art and science into a brush that paints the universe in colors that are vivid and enticing. The shame is that Sagan, dying at age 62, had so little time to spread his ideas. What he would have made of the world wide web, of the Hubble telescope and of personal computers. But Cosmos lives as his greatest legacy. A work of passion and thoughtfulness that is unsurpassable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWBPN9N298ARM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000055ZOC#wasThisHelpful","RWBPN9N298ARM","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Clasby has taken playing with toy soldiers to the next level. He recreates battlefields by cutting and pasting images of re-enactors onto computer-enhanced photos of the battlefield itself. This technique yields a fairly accurate picture of how the battle might have appeared in its day. The work that went into these images is amazing. Clasby's use of photographic perspective is spot-on, with smaller figures receding into the background.  The text is terrific, and is interspersed with scenes of Gettysburg taken in the aftermath of the battle. But a couple of drawbacks limit the book's success. First, the posed images seem rather lifeless and clean. The soldiers are dressed in period gear, but they don't show much emotion. Ranks of fighting men calmly walk onto a battlefield in which their brethren are hammering away at each other. The dead are shown, but blood is kept to an absolute minimum. The second drawback is the lack of maps. You would have to understand the topography and compass directions of Gettysburg very well in order to match them with the excellent written descriptions that Clasby provides.Drawbacks aside, I find myself drawn back to the book. ""Gettysburg: You are There"" might not get you as close to the fire and furor of the battle of Gettysburg as you'd like, but it is a fascinating approach that could be successful, if the kinks were worked out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZK0G0M2C1CL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580801110#wasThisHelpful","R2NZK0G0M2C1CL","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jeff Chu is well-positioned to explore the intersection of homosexuality and Christianity. As a gay man and the grandson of a Chinese Baptist minister, he understands each world from the inside. ""Does Jesus Really Love Me?"" is a sensitive and intelligent exploration of the many ways that American Christians have dealt with homosexuality. Chu himself lives the contradiction. In spite of having lost church relationships over his homosexuality (his mother cries for him every night) he has maintained a faith in God in spite of the wounds he carries.Chu's search runs the gamut of Christian reactions. He spends time with members of the Westboro Baptist Church, the most publicly and virulently anti-gay church. Amazingly, he comes to like them as people, even while rejecting their radical stance. He interviews the leadership of Exodus, the group best-known for trying to get gay Christians to stop being gay. At the other end of the spectrum, he speaks with Christians who have resolved the tensions between their faith life and their sex life by rejecting faith altogether. Chu is unique, I thinks, in allowing each of these groups and individuals to speak for themselves, even when what they say conflicts with his own experience.Aside from homosexuality, there are few topics that pit a fundamentalist understanding of the Scriptures against present-day lived reality. The variety of responses that Chu chronicles are both amazingly creative as well as heartbreaking. There is the couple (the husband is gay and knows it) who go on trying to have a married relationship even though the wife knows her husband is not physically attracted to her. They love and respect each other, even though something fundamentally important is missing from their lives. There is the gay man who has decided that he will lead a celibate life, even though that leaves him lonely and isolated. And many more. You have to admire how hard these folks want to love God, and who have contorted their lives drastically to allow them to feel worthy of that love. Chu has done a wonderful service by exposing the difficulty and stress that many deal with over the issue of their homosexuality. That he has done so without polemics and without judgment is an achievement in itself.""Does Jesus Really Love Me?"" is wonderfully-written and heartfelt look at an issues that will be with us for a long, long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DR0S3Z3M3YBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062049739#wasThisHelpful","R1DR0S3Z3M3YBM","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The narrator, never named, is the classic 7-year-old unpopular kid. A loner who always has his head in a book, he is the sad kid who has no one come to his birthday party. After his parents financial fortunes wane, they take on borders, one of whom kills himself. This leads him to meet Lettie Hempstock, an 11-year-old who lives on a farm at the end of a lane, with her mother and grandmother. Soon, the trio's weird talent for knowing what people are doing and thinking becomes obvious. Soon the boy is whirled into a terrifying supernatural adventure that pits him against dark forces and personalities.Gaiman is an expert at putting helpless kids in harm's way. And of getting them out gain. But ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane"" is NOT a kid's book. It deals with marital infidelity, suicide, nudity, loneliness and terrifying supernatural forces. It IS, however, a wonderful read and brilliantly original, like most of Gaiman's work. He know now to break through the patina of what we call reality, unveiling the dark and writhing forces beneath. Longtime Gaiman fans will recognize familiar themes in his writing - the scary monster-mother from Coraline, the three-faced goddess from the Sandman series and the unlikely bravery of timid children. But he packages these expertly into new forms.""The Ocean at the End of the Lane"" brings we readers into the impressionable mind of a frightened seven year old, letting us re-experience the chthonic darkness and magic possibility which the world holds for the young.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQQOFXBI47GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062255657#wasThisHelpful","R2GQQOFXBI47GY","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a longtime despiser of FOX News, I was titillated about this seemingly tell-all book about the inner workings of the organization. But while the book is well-written, funny and suspenseful, it ultimately does not deliver. Joe Muto, desperate for a job after graduating with a film studies degree from Notre Dame, lands a job as a lowly production assistant at Fox. In spite of his liberal misgivings, he eventually works his way up to Bill O'Reilly's show. In truth, the only interesting tidbits about Fox are that O'Reilly, though an imperious yeller, really has a talent for putting on a highly-rated TV show. He works hard, dictates the show off the top of his head, and leaves early to spend time with his kids. Even Muto likes him.Other than that, there's little firsthand info about Palin (she walked by his desk once), Hannity, Rove (who Muto finds wonkish yet likable), Beck or the rest of the Fox regulars who appear on the dust jacket. Muto comes across as an immature twirp who inadvisably and inexplicably leaks some banal backstage Fox video materials to Gawker, leading to his eventually firing.""An Atheist in the Foxhole"" is hardly sure to solidify Muto's career as a writer. If all he has to offer -- after 8 years inside one of the nation's most slanted news organizations - is this batch of tiny scoops (newsflash - Fox is cheap and it likes blonde bimbos as anchors!) then it's hard to imagine him as a hard-hitting journo where real investigative skills are required.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q2MSFEMGZU3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953957#wasThisHelpful","R3Q2MSFEMGZU3V","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Occupy"" is a slight book that won't give you much insight into the issues that drive the Occupy movement. It basically records a pep talk by Noam Chomsky to the Occupy protesters, with a little Q&A and some pictures thrown in. If you are new to the movement, you won't learn how our legal and banking systems are tilting away from the people they are supposed to serve. You will learn that Noam Chomsky is revered by the movement, but not why. To me, the most interesting part of the book was a piece by the National Lawyer's Guild giving protesters tactics for dealing with cops and courts.For staid middle-class folks like myself who are sympathetic with the sometimes-obscure goals of Occupy, this book did not sell me on the movement. The lack of clear goals and eschewal of leaders have always been problems, and they were not cleared up here. The references to obscure economics and social planners did not speak to my concerns. The cover, reminiscent of Soviet posters, was not designed to appeal to the ordinary Americans, presumably a necessary target of any mass movement. And the photo of a protester holding a cartoon of someone (George W. Bush?) tossing a paper airplane into the World Trade Center was perplexing at best and offensive at worst.""Occupy,"" with its toxic language and images is not the book you'll want to use to persuade your friends and family to join the movement.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPDF0LE164UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1884519016#wasThisHelpful","R3GPDF0LE164UI","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TV version is what happens when you strip of Terry Pratchett's trademark wit from his work, leaving the little more than plot events. And then it twists those plot events into a banal morality play with a love story tacked on. The show did a nice job with the surfaces, providing a true-to-Discworld version of the city of Ankh-Morpork and its denizens. But beneath the surface, nothing.It's understandable that the book's many characters would have to be pared down to a representative few. But give we fans a break with the plot! Gone was Pratchett's anti-corporate message. In was a Scrooge-like change of heart subplot that took over the film and made Moist von Lipwig shed his conniving ways (which Discworld readers know is nonsense). Gone is much of the suspense of the novel. As when Moist forges his way into bad-guy Reacher Gilt's table at a swanky restaurant. In the book, you knew Reacher was coming at any moment. In the film, it's just an unhappy coincidence that he shows up. And providing narration for half the film was silly, and a missed opportunity to include Pratchett's writing voice.Terry Pratchett's work is more than the sum of its plot points. This ""Going Postal"" hit its visual marks well, but missed the wit and soul of the original.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCWY2W5YXDXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056G1APW#wasThisHelpful","RUCWY2W5YXDXX","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have underestimated Alan Colmes. As the network's token liberal, he usually gets the worse end of ""debates"" on Fox News. I have thought of him as an amiable straw man - there to float preposterous liberal ideas that could be easily batted away by the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. His nebbish looks added to the impression of liberals being squishy and weak. But Colmes knows what he  stands for and what he is talking about. ""Thank the Liberals"" is a very long litany of the great work that liberals and progressives have done for this nation, from its very beginnings. Colmes argues that the Founders were in themselves liberals. They rejected the conservatism of a king/tyrant who determined the fates of all, in favor of a liberal doctrine that gave primary value to the opinions and rights of all citizens. The Constitution and Bill of Rights enshrined liberal ideas like being able to publish whatever you wanted, meet whoever you wanted and not be forced to worship against your conscience.Colmes then trots out a familiar list of rights that have been championed by liberals, and that have expanded notions of liberty. If you are not a slave, are a woman who can vote, a child who does not labor in a mine or a man who can end the work week after 40 hours, you have liberals to thank. Truly, the list of positive goods sponsored by liberals is extremely long.For this liberal, much of this was rather old news. But I did appreciate Colmes's step-by-step analysis of certain liberal victories, like overturning sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas, abolishing anti-miscegenation laws in Loving v. State of Virginia, and providing constitutional protections to accused Guantanamo terrorists in Boumediene v. Bush.Unfortunately, ""Thank the Liberals"" is not a title that conservatives are likely to pick up at a bookstore. They really should. But for liberals, the book provides a ""brief for the defense"" that might come in handy the next time Fox-watching Uncle Mike comes loaded for liberal bear at Thanksgiving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IPCE7ECEPANB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401940544#wasThisHelpful","R1IPCE7ECEPANB","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"David is back on familiar terrority with ""Let's explore,"" telling stories about growing up with his absurd family in North Carolina, peppered with a few fictional character treatments and some grotesquerie. Some of the material is funny - the letter written by a woman to the woman (now crippled in a car accident! Ha ha!) whose husband she stole. Some are poignant - the story of how David's dad gloried in the athletic achievements of other people's kids. But many are misanthropic at their core. There is a fine line between humor and hatred, and David straddles that line more and more as he gets older. He also manages to slip in one story that is grotesque - in this case, shopping for a stuffed barn owl (gruesome enough) for boyfriend Hugh, and stumbling across the skeleton of an African pygmy in a texidermist's shop. ""It would have been disturbing to see the skeleton of a slain Pygmy in a museum, but finding him in a shop, for sale, raised certain questions, uncomfortable ones, like How much is he?""What is delicious about the sentence is the suspense as David leads us to think he is ambivalent about the ethics of buying a hunted human being's bones. What is delightful is the way he levers off into the unexpected finale. What is creepy is that we are led to share in a his casual disregard of this human being's tragic history.David is still very readable and sometimes funny. But it's harder and harder to accept that his stories are taken from his real life, and that drains much of the pathos out of them.

"TOTL has everything that a suspense thriller needs - great writing and acting, exotic locales, weird characters, tragic losses, love and awesome plot twists. The New Zealand hinterland is the setting for a search for a missing 12-year-old girl. Her dad, a longhaired brutal alpha-male woodsman living on a compound, is a natural suspect in the disappearance. A female detective, a former townie, comes to the lake to be with her dying mother. She is battling memories of a brutal attack from years ago, and throws herself into the chase for the missing girl, along with the town's lazy and incompetent police force. Meanwhile, a commune of psychologically wounded women sets up camp on land owned by the alpha male.  Throw in a former pedophile, assorted trashy barflies, and mysterious source of date rape drugs, and you have the makings of a complex and compelling show.

"Caution: spoilers ahead.You can write a book that reimagines the story of a beloved hero or heroine, that turns myths about them on their head, and yet provides deeper insights into their character. Then again, you can write a book that merely inverts everything that you know about such a character, turns their virtues into failings and teaches us nothing about them. ""Testament of Mary"" belongs in the latter category.In ToM, Colm Toibin gives us a scant 81 pages that are long on Mary's self-pitying reflections about her life, short on insights about her and Jesus, dismissive about Jesus's mission and full of bizarre details and anachronisms. Toibin's conceit is that Mary was traumatized by the crucifixion of her son. No doubt. But since there is no resurrection in his book, just followers claiming one, there is little to solace her grief and pain. She inhabits Ephesus, lonely among those who do not speak her language, enduring visits by her male keepers, and loitering around pagan temples. Mostly, she mopes and complains, knowing that her real and ordinary life is being transformed by those who wants to make her son into something she knows he was not.The Jesus that Mary describes in ToM is a miracle worker, to be sure. He raises the dead, changes water to wine and walks on water. But his mother is unimpressed. To her, Jesus is a pompous jerk who likes to talk, ""his voice all false and his tone all stilted, and I could not bear to hear him."" He pals around with rabble - ""a group of misfits, who were only children like himself, or men without fathers, or men who could not look a woman in the eye. Men who were seen smiling to themselves, or who had grown old when they were still young."" His teaching are the late-night ramblings of fools. ""When my son would insist on silence and begin to address them as though they were a crowd."" This Mary not only seems to hate what happened to Jesus, but seems to hate her son as well.Unbelievebly, she prays to the many-breasted goddess Artemis, and has a silver idol of her in her living quarters. Her male guardians - it sounds like John and Luke - keep trying to foist their theological beliefs about Jesus on her. She will have none of it. In spite of her, they write a gospel about Jesus that is full of lies. She scoffs at their claims that by his death he saved the world. ""When you say that he redeemed the world, I will say that it was not worth it."" Holy Mother of God, indeed!With so much material on the market about the world of 1st century Israel, Toibin's errors and anachronisms are unforgiveable. His homes have kitchens, at a time when food preparation was an outdoor activity. Lazarus is buried in the ground, not in a rock tomb. To Toibin, a caravanserai is a moving group of travelers, when in actuality it is a hostel for travelers. Bizarrely, he has Christ pushing and pulling his cross down the street in an hour-long procession to Golgotha. His trial of Jesus is pre-staged, with ""everyone"" knowing how it will play out days before the arrest. And the idea of Mary, a devout Jew, praying to an idol is just ludicrous. At the very least, it demands an explanation that never came.Any interest in ""The Testament of Mary"" is a testament to the iconoclastic appetite of moderns to deal with the religion by rejecting everything about it. Christian stories are made tame and dismissable by claiming, without evidence or thought, that they are based on lies. There is no God, Jesus was just another misguided religious fanatic and the Church is only a place for pedophiles and pinheads. This I know, for Old Mary told us so.Luckily, dealing with the Christian scriptures is not a binary exercise - you don't have to accept them at face value or reject them wholesale. Mary can be an inspiring and even graced figure while allowing some poetic and symbolic latitude to the Bible's and the Church's otherworldly depiction of her. Toibin may see himself as adding to the conversation about Mary. But his book betrays a desire to discredit her, the son she bore and the Church that grew around his memory and continued presence in the lives of believers.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36F0G2K87CULI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EDOTPS#wasThisHelpful","R36F0G2K87CULI","A140XH16IKR4B0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A140XH16IKR4B0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm still pregnant so I haven't ""worn"" this yet but wanted to at least start a review because I think there may be serious sizing issues. I went to the Belly Bandit website and used their size calculator. I entered my measurements for 33 weeks and it said get an XL. I entered the same measurements for 34 weeks and it said large. I did both weeks because there is some discrepancies with my due date. I ended up ordering the large, thinking that it's better to be a little tight than too large, especially given how quickly I'll shrink after the baby is here...well the large came and it's huge! I'm 35 (or 36) weeks and I can actually wear it!  So even ordering down when in between sizes is clearly not enough. I imagine this will work for about a week and then I'll need the medium. I'll update once we get there, but heads up, even if you are at the tip top of a size range, you still may benefit from ordering another size down...","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZN550041M5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001T4WJPA#wasThisHelpful","R3IZN550041M5J","A3IK4LVT9OD9LH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IK4LVT9OD9LH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I know the color says ""neon pink"" but these are no where near the color that was on my screen (and I've never had this problem with amazon before).  On my screen, the shoes were PINK. Bright, but still very obviously pink. What we got in the mail was borderline hot orange, maybe coral?  Very neon. They are cute shoes, and the quality that one would normally expect from Carter's appears to be there, and sizing was accurate. Just not the color we anticipated, otherwise I would have given 4 or 5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVS5UG8ELUUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTKP5FY#wasThisHelpful","RDVS5UG8ELUUK","A3IK4LVT9OD9LH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IK4LVT9OD9LH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These were really cute in person but unfortunately we had to return due to ordering the wrong size. My daughter has another pair of Carters dress shoes (ballet flats) that are size 10 and fit ""perfect"" - these were too short.

"More comfortable than the NEOtech maternity belt I bought for $25. The back piece on this one isn't quite as high (the other brand keeps digging into my waist and hips because it's too long).  This is great for standing, but when you sit it will start to bunch a little. I use it mostly when I know I'm going to up and moving around a lot, otherwise I'm happier without it. Quick to put on. Comfortable even against my skin. At $13, I am really impressed how much like it. It is light support and alleviates (but does not completely eliminate) my lower back pain and my pelvic (pubic) pain. Highly adjustable so I do see how it would fit a wide range of sizes.4/2 update: After wearing this for a couple weeks I finally had to stop. It never stops moving! I am constantly adjusting it and I finally just decided I would rather deal with the pelvic and back pain than constantly adjusting this thing. Dropped to a 3 star rating - still ""works"" just uncomfortable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ZE3XDUB5QO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MT0MD4#wasThisHelpful","R21ZE3XDUB5QO1","A3IK4LVT9OD9LH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IK4LVT9OD9LH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought for our 3 year old's bed. It's not nearly as loud as some reviewers made it sound, but it's not completely silent, either. That said, most of the sheets we own aren't silent, either. I would say the noise level is on par with inexpensive cotton sheets. Yes, it makes noise, but it's not nearly loud enough to wake you (or keep you up for that matter). It's thin and not noticeable under the sheets. As for waterproof - we've had one accident that I caught within a few minutes - no leaking! So far, worth the purchase.  Glad we went with this over the more expensive options. My final purchase decision was based on reading the negative reviews and how almost every single one had a response from LinenSpa. The other brands I researched did not.

"Very comfortable! Size 3Xfit my 6'2'', large chest/shouldered husband perfectly. The strap that goes around the neck is very soft so there is less chaffing than we had with the cheaper ""canvas"" straps on the first sling we tried (which was also so small it barely came to his wrist).

"Bought this for my husbands fractured collar bone, in combination with a sling. I do not see how you could ever get this on by yourself...especially if you are using it for an injury.  By the end of the day his underarms are a little tender. Definitely follow the advice of other reviewers and wear over a thin shirt if you do decide to purchase. We didn't find that he got much relief from pain and it didn't really seem to stabilize his clavicle, even though we had the right size.

I do love that this book had a HEA.Angelica had always been a rich kid growing up that was until tragedy struck and she was left homeless.

One day she woke up at  her house the next she was in foster care. She pleaded with everyone that she and her parents had nothing to do with the picture but everyone else thought they knew better or did they? her only friend through this was Ethan he was a sweet boy and tried to help Polarity get to the bottom of things with this incident. polarity was a very strong girl for her age and very mature which made like her character even more.

I hope they have a solution.  If they do,  I'll give it 5 stars.update 03.02.14: sorry I didn't update sooner.  I emailed Anker and told them about the problem. They emailed me right away, asked for the model# and my address. They sent me another charger and didn't make me go to the post office and pay to return the old one. Then they emailed me a week or so later to make sure I got it and to see if it was working properly.  I emailed them back thanking them for their awesome c.s. and told them that it's working great.

"Although described as being ""Large"", the bones are pretty small.  That said, my Yellow Lab seems to really like them.  I did notice right away when I opened the bag that these bones don't have the same overwhelming odor to them that the other Blue Buffalo Bones have. Just wish they were bigger since I feel I must now keep a closer than normal eye on his treat chew time just in case he tries to swallow a not chewed well enough too large of a piece whole. Perhaps an extra large or jumbo size will be forthcoming from Blue Buffalo in the near future for those of us who have larger pets.

"Watched most of it on one of the cable channels but there were so many blasted commercials (sometimes as many as 8-10 or more in a row) that it was hard to maintain continuity of thought.  Plus during one episode there was a totally unnecessary local interruption regarding some politico happening that could have been easily forgone!  Be that as it may, we enjoyed the acting and the story line was relatively well written although it did stray pretty far from historical facts numerous times to accommodate Hollywood's version of Tut's exploits.  There were several scenes displaying nudity but they were tastefully handled and not dwelt upon.  Was a bit surprised the censors approved the miniseries for prime time.  Plus, we always enjoy Mr. Kingsley's performance in pretty much anything he appears in.  All in all, a pretty good piece of entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DXGM2ES1BBOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MJ851Y#wasThisHelpful","R1DXGM2ES1BBOV","A1JN63QBBNGB78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JN63QBBNGB78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As with all Blue Buffalo products that I have purchased through the years, my Yellow Lab gives this flavor a four paws rating.  He's been on an almost exclusive diet of both Blue Buffalo kibble and treats since he was a puppy.  Now that he is well into his senior years, I want to keep him as healthy as possible for many more years to come.  The ingredients used by the manufacturer appear to be well researched to assist in doing just that.  He's still very active, gets regular good health/wellness yearly exam reports, his vision is still very sharp and I firmly believe he can hear a flea hop outside in the grass as well as smell it when that flea lets wind!

"Was looking for a spot cleaning cloth that didn't have a strong chemical smell to it but would get the job done.  Decided to give this one a try.  Glad I did.  Although the wipes do have a bit of an odor, the odor is not to the extent that you need to ""wear a gas mask"" just to use them.  The one wipe used easily removed some dried in days old nose bleed drops, chew bone drool left behind by my Lab as well as some dark grease spots tracked in by the cable guy.

Can also tell the difference in the amount of heat generated by the old incandescent bulbs versus these LEDs.

"Have used these same pieces extensively for over fifteen years with no problems, even with the lids.  I did put one of the smaller bowls in the microwave with the lid on it (loosened of course) and noticed that the underside of the lid did have some tiny clustered bubbles in one place when I took it off of the bowl.  The lids do say right on them that they are both dishwasher (top-shelf) and microwave safe.  That was the first (and last) time I had ever put one of the lids in the microwave.  I have a made for the microwave cover that I always use when heating foods.  Doesn't appear to have affected the lid's performance since it still seals tight.

"Bought a number of various cast iron pieces when amazon had their ""four for three"" program.  Food cooked in cast iron just tastes better than when cooked in other types of pans/skillets.  Plus, we've used them in the grill when preparing certain meats to get that grilled flavor without having a messy grill rack to clean up.  You also don't lose meat due to pieces falling through a grill grid.  And, if you are campers like we are, bacon and eggs, hash browns etc., cooked over a campfire in cast iron skillets makes for really delicious eating!  I especially love to cook beans in the dutch oven.  While my hubby and sons are out fishing or hiking, I put the beans on and simmer them slowly all day.  Add some corn bread baked in one of my cast iron skillets...Yum!  (I cook these dishes the same way at home).

"These Mall Walker shoes are awesome.  Hubby has been wearing this brand/style for over fifteen years.  According to him, they are very comfortable and his feet don't sweat in them as they do in some of his other pricier similar type shoes.  They also seem to wear very good i.e., the pair he is currently wearing is about seven years old and have a lot of miles on them as he wears them exclusively when walking our Lab.  They walk approximately four to five miles every day, weather permitting.  For the shoe itself, I give a FIVE STAR RATING.The ONE STAR is for the inconvenience I've had to endure of having to box them back up, go through the amazon return process and get them up to the UPS store for ship-back.  All this due to the fact I was sent OBVIOUSLY WORN SHOES.  I don't mean just tried on shoes but shoes that had been worn to the extent that there were deep creases in the leather on top of both shoes plus one shoe had dirt (and a small pebble!)  in one of the profile ridges along the bottom as well as dirt on one side.  Never, ever in all my years of ordering shoes have I ever received an obviously worn pair.  Bummer.

"Whether playing a dramatic, semi-comedic or really rotten person role,  Max Schell was always at the top of his game.  My husband and I had the distinct pleasure of meeting and conversing personally with him at a book signing in Darmstadt Germany in 1997 where he read excerpts from and commented on his autobiographical book ""Das Rebell"" (The Rebel).  He also answered audience questions regarding some of his acting roles, his life in general and about his sister Maria who had such a tragic life and ending.  His answers or comments were loaded with both direct to the point personal comments and feelings as well as really funny and entertaining ones.  When speaking of his sister he became quite nostalgic but didn't dwell on his sadness about her.  He was a soft spoken man seemingly quite humble at times and extremely friendly.  He was surprised that there were several of us Americans in the audience since both the book and the entire presentation is/was in German.  (Was not a problem for us, both being fluent in the language).  After he found out there were Americans in the audience, he graciously took the time to translate a lot of his spoken word for their enjoyment as well.  He seemed to prefer these smaller type audiences, there were about 100 people semi-circled around him, so the setting felt quite intimate.  During the subsequent book signing, he took extra time when one of us Americans came forward for him to sign our books and wrote a personal note to each of us, by name, before signing our books.  He mentioned to us how grateful he was to his American audiences for fostering his career throughout the years.  I must say that even in 1997 the vestiges of age and declining health were becoming quite obvious.  It was with sadness when I read of his passing.  However, as with all of our truly great stars, they will be with us as long as their films exist.  As for this film, his role is one of the rotten characters that you love to hate.  We first see him as millionaire Jewish entrepreneur Arthur Goldman living in a Manhattan penthouse where he disses on everything from baseball, the Papacy, ex-wives to his family's extermination at the hands of the Nazis.  After he is arrested by Israeli agents and charged with being one of those self-same Nazis, we see him begin to morph into the sociopath character of Adolph Dorf, Commandant of the concentration camp where his family was allegedly exterminated.  No more spoilers.  This is a tense, on the edge of your seat type of movie almost from the git-go.  If you like these types of movies, you'll love ""The Man In The Glass Booth"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JM6ELLOFY1R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009MEJA#wasThisHelpful","R1JM6ELLOFY1R8","A1JN63QBBNGB78","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JN63QBBNGB78?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can one say about two of the most iconic actors of our time and the horror genre movies they made.  Although Vincent Price did become most famous for his horror movie offerings, he was known to be, by all accounts, one of the kindest, gentlenest, and most generous actors on the Hollywood scene during his lifelong tenure in the movie world.  He was also a gourmet chef, painter and writer of poetry.  I saw the ""Tingler"" when I was just a kid and it scared the pants off of me.  That campy thing (by today's standards) reminded me so much of the lobsters my dad would catch over on the coast and bring home that for a long time after seeing that movie I wouldn't eat a lobster for fear it was really a ""Tingler"".  It didn't help any either that I was sitting in one of the wired seats that would ""tingle"" every time that thing was on screen.

"I received my mattress pad today and thought it seemed fine.  It felt smooth and soft and looked like it would go on easily.  As I do with all new bedding, I washed and dried it on low.  But when I put it on my bed I could see that it was now incredibly lumpy.  As I ran my hand over it, some of the lumps were soft but some felt very hard and I knew that would be uncomfortable to sleep on.  Feeling through the cover of one of the hard lumps, it felt like it had some sort of a string in it.  I cut a small hole and started to pull out the polyester fiberfill.  No wonder it felt hard!  The fiberfill was twisted, knotted, hard and a complete mess.  I pulled it all out of the square and threw it away.  Something like that should never be used in bedding.  Since I have washed this I cannot return it but I would advise other people to think twice before purchasing this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35S4CXDXC2JKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW5WUNM#wasThisHelpful","R35S4CXDXC2JKH","A19KOAGQJUXL18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19KOAGQJUXL18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I very much enjoyed this delightful small book.  In the introduction, the author states the book's purpose ""...to offer friendly advice that might help one achieve the look, attitude and general sophistications of that beacon of style and intelligence known as the Lady...A chapette is...a woman of refined qualities that are reflected in the way she looks and the way she acts; a lady with a considerate yet freethinking attitude and a taste for retro fashions.""  This small book covers retro and vintage fashions, hair styles, makeup (along with interesting and little-known trivia facts) and also covers relevant music, literature and film.  Etiquette and entertaining are also discussed.  The book is illustrated with charming drawings reminiscent of the 50's and written with humor and wit.  Since it is 80 pages long, it doesn't delve into great depth on any one topic but rather presents an excellent overview.  I tried to find other books by Daisy Loveday, but I think the name may be a nom de plume because the Publisher's page states that the text is by Chris Turton.  The book is published in the U.K. which is apparent in the spellings and some of the words (i.e., ""boot"" for ""trunk"") but that only adds to the book's charm.  It would make a wonderful gift.

"I never thought I would be writing a less than five star review about an Anne Klein handbag.  I have purchased a couple of them and they are of excellent quality.  However, I was disappointed in this one.  I purchased the petal pink, and the tan rattan weave in the front of the bag clashed with the color and looked very odd.  White rattan might have looked better, in my opinion.  Worst of all, when I lifted the bag by the rattan handles, I heard a loud creaking noise.

It looks really natural on me and lasts until I take it off at night.  I have a very fair complexion and it works well, but I don't know if I would recommend this light shade for someone with a medium or deeper complexion because it might not show up enough.

"I have had swollen ankles for several years and gradually the skin around them became very dry, hardened and thick.  My dermatologist recommended a cream with 20% urea.  Udderly Smooth with 20% Urea has worked very, very well for me.  I apply it twice a day; once after my morning shower and once in the evening.  I have read (and my doctor told me)  that urea can soften the fingernails so I am careful not to get any on my nails.  I use a spatula to apply it to my ankles and wash my hands afterwards.  In just a couple of weeks my ankles have improved immensely.  Another thing I like about Udderly Smooth is the packaging.  So many products come in tubes, and when you have used a lot of the product you then have to cut the tube open to get out the rest.

There is no writing on  the box (except for the UPC code on the bottom) so if you just wanted to put a bow on it and give it to someone that would be all right.  Inside it fits in a special styrofoam mold so it will arrive safe and unbroken.  The rose is separate from the vase so that if you ever wanted to put a real flower in the vase, you could.

"When I buy things at the store I like to give the clerk the exact change.  When I kept coins in my clutch wallet, they were hard to reach, difficult to see, and took a while to get out.  I never wanted to do it if there were other customers in line behind me.  With this clear plastic purse, I can easily see what I have, and in addition it opens very wide making for easy accessibility.  It's a cinch to get the exact change.  Also, this purse has no gaps so coins don't fall out (I had a similar one a few years ago, from a different seller, and coins kept slipping out because the frame didn't meet).

There is something about the umbrella and the pink ribbon that shouts ""1950's"" and even the leopard print lining seems a little retro.  It has a long shoulder strap but since I don't wear shoulder straps I put the straps on the shortest holes to make it easier to put over my arm or carry in my hand, and I will probably trim off the longer strap length.  The inside has two cell phone pockets and a zipper pocket and there is a cute heart-shaped zipper pull.

"First of all, I want to alleviate anyone's concerns about this large bottle of fragrance being only about one-third the cost of what you would pay in a department store.  There is nothing wrong with it, it is the real deal, and it arrived in perfect condition in it's box wrapped in cellophane.  I don't know how Amazon can give us such great bargains, but I'm glad they do, and I'm happy to save the money to spend on other things!I've used this fragrance, on and off, for several years now, and I really love it.  It is a gourmand fragrance and smells warm and sweet.  If you have a sweet tooth (like I do) you will probably like Fancy also.  When I first spray it, there is a slight whiff of grapefruit, very refreshing, and then it dries down to a cozy delicious caramel.  It also lasts for a long time.Now, there is something else I want to say about Fancy; I've read comments and reviews where people have said that this fragrance is ""only for young women"" or ""not for anyone over twenty-five"".  Well, I am a mature woman, love Fancy, and have received many compliments when wearing it.  If someone wants to live by rigid  ""perfume rules"" that they have created, that's fine with me - it's their life.  Maybe they like having a lot of rules.  But personally, I think if you enjoy a fragrance, and other people around you like your fragrance, you should wear it.

"A few years ago I developed a condition where my right eye ""cries""  because of a blocked tear duct.  Unfortunately it has not responded so far to medical treatment and I have been on - until now - a desperate search for a soft, comfortable handkerchief.  I cannot tell you how many handkerchiefs I have purchased in the last few years and they were all disappointingly rough.  Yes, I washed them, over and over, trying to soften them up, but that didn't work very well.  Well, I am happy to tell you my search has ended, thanks to My Hanky!  They are cloud soft, and oh-so-comforting and absorbent.  What a relief!  In addition, Mr. Marino (the inventor) enclosed a personalized note and a brochure detailing the amazing story of how he came to develop these handkerchiefs.  My handkerchiefs came packaged in a pristine white box with gold lettering and a gold elasticized bow tie on them, so they are completely gift-ready if you want to order some as presents.

"I used to own a leather wallet given to me by some Brazilian friends. Itâs lasted me at least ten years, it hasnât fallen to pieces (or shown any damage), and has developed a nice patina.So why would I want to retire that wallet and change to this Aprince model?One reason. Old age. My old age.Iâve passed my three years and ten, and now I have to live in a wheel chair. This chair reclines when I want to relax, but anything in my pockets falls out, like coins.The old wallet has no provision for storing coins, but the new Aprince has provision for them. Itâs nothing fancy, just a pocket with no means of closing like a zip, but the coins are forced to lie flat. And that keeps them safe.The wallet is well-built of leather and is larger than my old wallet. That means that it can store 24 credit cards, along with bills and a space for your driverâs license.Iâm so pleased with my new wallet I wrote a song about the old one. Join in, youâll recognize the tune:Donât cry for me Brazil-ianaThe truth is, my coins all left meIt gave me a wild lifeAs I lost my penniesI could have spent themOn Seniors at Dennyâs.I was supplied the wallet in exchange for a review.

"Hereâs what â buy these. They work. They cost $50 for two.Hereâs why. You may be thinking of getting those âofficialâ hearing aids that only cost $5,000-$7,000. Donât.But I hear you cry, âThey cost 100 times more! They must be 100 times better.â Theyâre not.I went looking for the difference. AARP has a couple of pages on its web site called âWhy Do Hearing Aids Cost So Much?âAARP reports that manufacturers pay:Materials â $440Research â $1,320So that means that companies that sell two aids for $50 must be losing around $3400!I have some knowledge of the electronics industry, and these numbers are way higher than Iâd expect.I would estimate that materials cost $2 - $7. Research costs from $0, because chip manufacturers supply circuit drawings for free.Ask your doctor to refer you to a hearing consultant covered by your insurance plan. You may pay a little, but you could get a âfreeâ hearing test from commercial stores that are hoping to sell you multi-thousand dollar hearing aids.An ad for a worker in a commercial store requires they âhave strong selling skills but balanced with a passion to genuinely help people.âYou will almost certainly be sold a hearing aid like these â it increases the volume of upper range of your hearing â the part where you lose ability to hear the sound of consonants in conversation. With the lower range still audible, you regain your ability to hear whole words.Most hearing-impaired adults will be quite happy with this. Hearing loss is a naturally-occurring problem when you age.Around 50 million people in the USA report hearing loss, rising to almost half the population after 75. Thatâs almost as many that suffer vision loss, yet most of us use the corner drugstore or rock-bottom sites that make glasses of any prescription for $10-$40, like ZenniOptical. So try these hearing aids out. If they donât do the trick, go back and see your doctor. But for $50, theyâre worth the try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FWLKAMI0DNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY446EU#wasThisHelpful","R33FWLKAMI0DNM","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate to tell you this, but if you hope to learn Android devices, this book is not for you. There isn't any book that will help make the slog to using Android much easier. And if you're thinking of using Apple equipment, I see no sign that it's any easier.Basically a tablet or computer is a simplified desktop or laptop. It has a slightly varying range of abilities, depending what the CPU is capable of. When I bought my tablet in early 2015, I was concerned to get one with GPS. Android had access to Google Maps, but not every tablet had the hardware to deal with this.I bought a ten-inch tablet for well under $100 (a ValuePad, IIRC), and I'm sure if you pay several hundred dollars you'll be able to run what you want from one of the flagship models. But it seems that the space for applications is one gigabyte total. That means certain things have had to have been simplified, and that includes the operating system. So don't expect any windows or drop-down menus.Several applications require you to press on one icon from a close-together group of four.To give you an example, you can read Kindle books, and you open those by tapping on the icons. But when you have to close them, you tap on an unmarked space below the title, and then a widow opens from the left with a small dark home icon, Press this and you return to the library view. Noy only is this not indicated to the user, there appears to be no guide anywhere  on-line.Hart-Davis's book will help you to use common screens, like how to check the battery level. But once you try to use less common actions, you're basically on your own. And even better, each make of tablets likes to put its own icons into the OS. My tablet has half-a-dozen ""Child-safe"" icons which I never use and can't remove.So although Hart-Davis runs up against all the faults of Android, it's as good as any other. I have several of his other books and have recommended them in Vine reviews.I have a reasonable knowledge of computer programming; I first put pencil to paper back in 1971, and I've taught how to program in several different languages. But I advise you not to get fooled by Android. It is more difficult than you think.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A1J43V79C3LV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119116767#wasThisHelpful","R2A1J43V79C3LV","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ram Charan produced a book in 2009 (with Larry Bossidy) called ""Execution."" I was very impressed by this by this, and Charan's new book pleases me just as much.Charan identifies the activities of a company who decides to take on a major player -  or one even forced to compete with a larger business who's moving into the same area. He lists five areas where the company should be prepared. Some areas are like searching for possible competitors, while others are making sure that your company can easily deal with a change in focus.The stories of companies who thought that they were set for life covers a huge amount of businesses books.

"I first discovered Tony Judt from his book ""Postwar."" This is a great book about Europe from the end of World War II, and as I was born and lived there from just before the end of the war until around 1990 I learned a huge amount about the politics and sociology of the time.""When the Facts Change"" is a collection of essays from 1995-2010 that includes some works on Europe, and others on Palestine. As usual Judt writes clearly on every subject he covers, and you'll find it easy to read. It's edited by Judt's co-historian and wife, Jennifer Homans, and she also added a foreword.You may not agree with every sentiment expressed here, but Judt's exemplary writing makes it a great book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y77U1SYSLWC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594206007#wasThisHelpful","R1Y77U1SYSLWC1","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big Dead fan, and I feel sorry for those who think the band only plays plinky-plonk music for stoned hippies (although I'm sure you can introduce me to a fave band of your own). But I remember reading an interview with Jerry Garcia by an interviewer who though he'd ""got it"" when he told Jerry that the Dead ""were all about drugs."" Jerry corrected him by saying that the Dead ""were all about the music.""This book is largely about the music, although there are some drug references. Those references seem to be a bit old-fashioned since we've had plenty of tell-all autobiographies from rock stars, with detailed descriptions of their drug consumption.Kreutzmann tells his own side of the Grateful Dead story. His work as drummer is impeccable given the often free-form nature of the front men. I re-listened to a lot of those tracks and marveled at his ability to work in such tracks as ""Dark Star."" With his lack of experience with jazz drumming he still fit in very well.The last time I saw the Dead in the early 1990s, he and Mickey Hart performed a drum solo (a drum duo?) which took my breath away. They both performed a piece as versatile as the three guitarists, yet for most of the time keeping a heavy rhythm going on.Bill's book reads very well. I think you'll like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SRDSWFVNQQ88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250033799#wasThisHelpful","R3SRDSWFVNQQ88","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Welcome to the future of USB. I was looking through my boxes of obsolete stuff and found my first hub. One input, four outputs of blazing fast USB 2.0.Nowadays you need a power supply to recharge your mobile devices. Sure, they're supplied with a charger, but it usually powers one device at a time and requires its own wall socket. You can also plug into your computer's USB ports, but they don't supply enough power to charge the device quickly. You can hope that you'll have enough time to bring something, like a smartphone or tablet, up to charge to have enough time to make it run until you can charge it again.Do note that the charging ports only charge and do not transmit data, which is typical of this kind of device. Still, you have seven data ports which should be enough.One warning about USB is that you cannot daisy-chain hubs. Because I review a number of USB devices I've sometimes connected a hub into another hub. I had a problem with anything USB on my computer not working for about twenty minutes after the desktop appeared. Because I had a USB mouse and keyboard they didn't work either. I even reconnected them directly to ports on the computer, but nothing changed. Only when I sorted through all of my USB connections did everything return to normal.TP-LINK has a reputation for quality products and this hub didn't disappoint. It worked fine and caused me no problems while it was here. I recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D62EH3WM5O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCX6I8A#wasThisHelpful","R2D62EH3WM5O2","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I donât know why more people donât own laminators. A laminated sheet of paper is easy to find, will be rainproof out of doors, and can have a hole punched in it to make it easy to put on a hook. I have a bunch of nursing associates who come to my house to take care of me, and they can refer to my list of what to do without asking me all the time.Laminating machines cost from under $20 to several hundred dollars. The main difference is that it takes several minutes for the low-cost machines to heat up, whereas machines at the price of the Fellowes laminators take only a minute until theyâre ready to work. Fellowes claim that their laminators will resist jams, but often other laminators have jam release switches.You may want to laminate bigger sheets of paper than the letter and A4 sizes that almost every laminator can accommodate. 11 x 17 (double letter) and A3 laminators from many makers cost less than double the price of standard-sized machines and the pouches are a little bit more than twice the cost.Now you may be wondering, âOK, Iâm sold on laminating, but what did you find, good or bad, about the Fellowes machine?â Simply this â everythingâs good and nothingâs bad. In fact, I was so surprised with the ease of use and high quality, I read some of the other reviews here and discovered that just about everyone had the same reaction.So then I read some of the reviews of the cheaper models and discovered that everyone loves their laminator. But youâre sure to love this one, so get it for your business and keep a cheaper one for home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R328P1PTP4A39I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OILZLDI#wasThisHelpful","R328P1PTP4A39I","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, as so many other reviewers have noticed, is misleading in terms of what the cover promises. Unfortunately, reviewers can't agree as to what's wrong with it. It has too much math - it has not enough math. It doesn't do what it set out to do - it's a clear indication of how things are.Firstly, the title is wrong. The math in the book is negligible, and you don't even need to know anything about math to get Suzuki's arguments. If you accept his arguments that ""A is because of X, Y, and Z,"" then you don't need to be able to follow the equations - leave that to the math-heads.As someone who was born abroad and who has only been an citizen for less than ten years of the thirty years I've lived here, I don't understand the constitution fetish of so many Americans. If you think it's so important today, can you imagine how the original framers would feel if you told them that the Constitution would last (with a few changes) for 250 years. Yes, there's a lot in it that's still important in the twenty-first century, but there's also a lot that had no real meaning after the first fifty years or so.If I were King (well maybe not King), I would suggest that every 50 years there be a Constitutional Conference every fifty years over a ten-year period where alterations would be argued and eventually put to a national referendum. (And my vote would go to the non-politically elected Supreme Court, with nine judges being being selected anonymously out of a pool of around 100.)Time to get off my soapbox, and move my car so there's room for the Tea Party to protest outside my house.  :)And the book? It's good that Suzuki takes on questions like ""Why do we need an Electoral College?"" and shows us that the simple answer isn't always foolproof. See his explanations and become the guru of any political discussion in your area.So memorize the arguments and when people say, ""Why don't they . . .?"" you'll be able to say ""Why they Don't"". Recommended for those despairing of sound-bite arguments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGME0JR3RVP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142141595X#wasThisHelpful","R2TGME0JR3RVP3","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The arrival of this adapter surprised me, but not as much as the price.Obviously the small size and the low price means that one of the big chip-makers has brought out a new adapter chip. All previous AC standard adapters were a lot larger than this, and usually had a cord with a USB plug on the end. This is the smallest adapter I've seen.As a replacement for my $65 adapter this worked just as well at a third the price. With AC standard routers now going for under $50, this means that you could add a three times faster complete wi-fi for under $70.This extra speed is necessary when you consider that people are downloading movies and using wireless gadgets, which were pretty much unknown a few years ago.Like most wireless devices, this adapter works with previous versions of the 802.11 standards. So, if cash is a problem (never happens in my house, of course), you could buy replacements for your 802.11n networks one piece at a time. Obviously you'll need an 802.11AC router and adapters, but pointing out to your significant other that ""All we need is an AC standard router, and everyone on the network will get faster speeds"" improves your chances considerably.I  must thank Sabrent for sending me this adapter in exchange for a review. It will go into my laptop and will improve downloads considerably.

"America seems to have this on again - off again relationship with design. Since the 1920s Bahaus designs Europe has led the world in widespread design trends. That's not to say that everything in Europe is beautifully designed but it seems to that in the thirty years since I moved here I've seen very few houses that didn't have something that George Washington would recognize. American house design has many traditions from the past - houses that have columns across the front, hardware that emphasizes Victorian complexity - so much of it unnecessary.That's why I was so glad to see this book. Even though mid-century design has not become widely adopted, it has stood up to the sixty or seventy years to still appear modern yet part of the nature surrounding it. These houses are not cheap, and especially these days you can see high-end furniture. Each house described has a floor plan and many photos.The book gives justice to the the houses.

"Time was when USB ports were used largely for communications between computers and devices. There was one pin that gave out five volts, but to start with it didn't have enough power to run many devices. Before 2010, USB was suggested for charging mobile devices and since then USB has become the standard for charging portable equipment.Although you can use one of the USB ports on your computer, devices charge faster if you have a dedicated charge supply. Eventually these took the place of USB ports. These chargers don't send digital information - they have one purpose only, sending five volts at higher amperage than the on-computer USB ports. In a sense, they are chargers just like other chargers, but a USB cable sends the voltage to your device.Sabrent have put out a purpose-built charger for USB devices. It has the power to charge up to ten USB-charged devices. It has a power cable that attaches to the socket box at one end and the mains plug at the other, so when you get it all you need to do to get it working is to plug it into the wall and plug the USB cable that sends power to your device.In practice it works very well, charging far faster than many chargers supplied with devices. As a purpose-built charger, there is little to fault. It runs independently of your computers USB communications. I would like to say that with ten sockets it could be all the charger you'll ever need, but I have a very Rube Goldberg USB system with too many hubs. In addition, I have a set of headphones that need charging with USB, but most of the time they're not connected, so i get warning windows and sounds every time I power up, telling me that the computer cannot connect with a USB device  - the phones.So while you'll be able to use this for a long time for charging, probably some time in the next decade you'll be looking for a second one as the number of chargeable devices you own goes up and up. But until then this device will satisfy you, with its smart design, big capacity, fast speed, and looking like a well-made charger. Its as good as I can imagine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAYIX6797VXSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJ79UK6#wasThisHelpful","RAYIX6797VXSO","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Time was, if your windshield got dirty, you had to stop and get out and clean it. Then we got windshield washers (especially in NYC) and we could drive forever and still see. That was all most people wanted. Volvo added wipers and washers for headlights, but that was to get the mud off. Then we dropped glass headlights and moved on to plastic ones. Plastic was cheaper, lighter, and easily molded into shapes that blended into the body lines.That would have been great, but over a few years people noticed that their headlights were becoming less and less transparent. Although this discoloration looked like it was all the way through, it was just on the surface. For while people recommended cleaning with toothpaste, but this didn't work very well, and before long companies brought out restoration kits for predictable results.These kits really need a power drill, but if you have any kind of a cordless drill that should suffice. There are detailed video instructions on the 3M site (http://3mauto.com/products/headlight-restoration/3m-headlight-restoration-kit-with-tape-and-protectant-39098.html) and the actual process is quite quick and effective. Just change the pads to go from the most coarse through to the most fine. If you're thinking of selling your car, cleaning is a must.3m also includes a preservative coating to keep the headlight clean. I cleaned the headlights on the car of a friend of mine and she was ecstatic  about the difference in appearance and the amount of light the headlamps can put out.

"Most people know the term âLOL.â Itâs in common use in emails, and stands for âLaugh Out Loud.â But there are various meanings to that term so it doesnât mean quite what it meant at the beginning. It can mean, âYour message wasnât funny, but Iâm protecting your feelings,â or âI might have smiled internally, but I donât remember.âMoving on, it can mean âI definitely smiled, but that was about all,â or âI made some kind of noise of amusement, but you could hardly hear it.â And finally, LOL can mean, âI laughed so loud, I was embarrassed because everyone around me noticed.âIâm warning you, because if you have a sense of humor like mine, that will be at least one LOL in this book of the final definition, so be prepared. Itâs just past half way through and it involves a glazier. Itâs almost as if Alexander McCall Smith had used 15 books to set us up for this situation, and he doesnât disappoint. So read at your peril.Thereâs obviously a lot more in the book, but it is all resolved by the end, with many interlocking stories going on. Mma Ramotswe  and Mma Makutsi run the Detective Agency with numerous cases, Mr. J.L.B Maketoni has to make changes at Speedy Motors, Violet Sephotho makes an unwanted appearance, and Charlie - well Charlie is always in trouble.My wife remarked that this book had a slightly sharper edge than some of the earlier works, and I felt it was slow to get up to speed, but these are minor criticisms.

"For a long time we used battery chargers to keep our batteries ready. Often, if a car or motorcycle wasn't used much, it would stubbornly refuse to start just when you needed it. Things are better these days, with an alternator keeping the battery much better charged than a dynamo, but even so you can find yourself with a poorly charged vehicle that won't start.Running a trickle battery charger full time can cut battery life considerably. The Battery Tender is a ""connect and forget"" device that will not harm your battery. With battery prices rising to over $100, you don't want to buy another one when you don't have to.Simply connect the Tender to your battery and then to the wall. This device will work anywhere in the world. The newer model will charge much faster than the old, and is reliable.You can connect this device to cars you use every day, or just once a year.

"Fall is here, making me sad for the end of summer, but happy because this is the season of the Best American series. Anthologies like this are always interesting because if you donât like what youâre reading, a new article will come up in a few pages.So a lot depends on how well the articles are chosen, and in this case the selection is brilliant. You would have to subscribe to a large number of magazines to get these stories, and each subscription would be more than the cost of this book.As you read these articles you will wonder how much information on science and nature you have missed. I subscribe to the Scientific American and also read daily websites, yet all of these stories are new to me, and just about all of them are articles that I wish I read in the original.I read this book as fast as I read fiction by familiar authors, because the stories here are important. Some of them relate to my experience, like remembering experiences under anesthetic, and others show hidden dangers of genealogy research combined with DNA testing.The only story I had a little trouble with was that of a trapper who caught beavers and foxes. I felt it was a little âNature red in tooth and claw,â but then I thought that it wasnât good to hide myself away from this.If youâre the slightest bit interested in science and nature writing, you should get this book.

"Iâve had a Black & Decker toaster oven for a few years. This replaced my two slot old-fashioned toaster. Although it was sometimes difficult to set, it gave reasonable toast if you set it correctly. Thatâs why I was interested to see the next step up â this toaster oven which cost twice as much as my original oven.So is it worth the extra? Yes, I think it is. It does all the things that the original often did, and does them better. Most people who have used both say that the new oven gives quicker and more reliable slices of toast.It also has a convection oven, and my wife cooked a couple of pork chops which tasted good. The oven is about twice as large as the original, but if you put two of the originals on top of each other it would take up as much space. In terms of counter space, the new oven uses very little more space, and although itâs taller it has a flat top as opposed to the curved top of the original.Unless youâre really strapped for cash I recommend the new oven over the old.

"Years ago, I remember installing Windows for Workgroups 3.11 on my system. I now could network my system or even â gasp! â connect it to the Internet! But there was one extra purchase I needed, which was a router. Like most people of the time, I bought a Linksys blue box, and I started seeing them everywhere.At that time networking of any sort was only suitable for dweebs. Because networking started as something you did in mainframe computers, it needed a systems manager to set it up. The Workgroups version of Windows was the first OS that let you network your system without using a third-party program. At that time I thought that the Internet would never catch on because it was too complicated for the average user.As time went on and networking became part of the regular version of Windows, the process became simpler. The attraction of the Internet became enough so that people were ready to live with networkingâs complications. I can remember getting a Linksys wireless router, with two little antennae on the back, but it was a great feeling to sit in my living room and surf the ânet without apparently any connection to anything.Since then Linksys seemed to have dropped down in the scheme of things, with Japanese and local companies offering their routers. Whatâs also changed is that big companies have taken over Internet supply without anything like the service that the independent companies of the 1990s used to give.Now we have a resurgence of Linksys, with this model â the AC1200. As you can probably gather from the name, it has the new AC standard that transmits nearly three times as fast as the âNâ standard. Like most routers, it has four Ethernet ports along with a socket for USB â if youâve used an older Linksys router, youâll recognize the back panel.Itâs really easy to set up. You simply connect it to your existing network and follow the on-screen instructions. Although a CD is supplied, you probably wonât need it. If youâre thinking of upgrading to AC1200 you should do just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58UC4RQC88H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZWQTKO#wasThisHelpful","R58UC4RQC88H9","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first came across Caitlin Moran when I reviewed her book, ""How to be a Woman.' Modesty forbids but megalomania insists on revealing my reviewing of that book - the highest placed with over 100 ""Helpful"" votes.I looked in vain for some sort of ""Thank You"" for my review. A Rolls-Royce in my driveway, or even a few packets of McVitie's Chocolate Digestive Biscuits (sort of large Graham Crackers with one side thickly covered in chocolate). But nothing.So without any sort of a bribe (not that I'd accept them, but it would have been nice to eat Chocolate Biscuits in the back of the Rolls), I have to review this book. And unbribed, I have to say that this book is even better than ""How to be a Woman.""If you recall, Caitlin's first book was about her life, from around a thirteen-year-old to an adult. She's really broadened her scope with this book, which is about her life, from around a thirteen-year-old to an adult. The difference is that this story is the same, but largely fictional.In this book, she can use her imagination along with other people's experience. She goes to the pop record paper in London, gets a job writing reviews of bands playing in her local area, which she does without attending the concerts, but buy listening to their albums that she has to loan from the local library.Born Johanna Morrigan, she reinvents herself as Dolly Wilde, along with  a ""Who-gives-a-F***"" attitude. Of course, Dolly never was a virgin, but Johanna spends a great deal of time trying to get into bed with anyone - with everyone, in fact. She muddles through her sex life, but does have words of advice on how to deal with an incredibly well-endowed man. In fact, a ""thing"" which has to live in two post codes at once.Johanna has the solution to this. She advises doing it doggy-style and then crawling away from it, round and round the bed. The whole book is full of hilarious moments like this, and even better because she's writing fiction.If you've read her earlier book, you'll know what I mean. If you're new to Caitlin, buy it anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZ34PVWIZN9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062335979#wasThisHelpful","RZZ34PVWIZN9G","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then they worked on taking the input from the guitar lead, and the boxes got smaller and became foot pedals. Now I have two multi-effects that show me whether I'm in tune or not.You'd think that with these tuners around, I would have the last word in tuning. But the last last word is here, with the clip-on tuner. This has numerous advantages over previous methods, the biggest of which is that it detects the accuracy of the note played by using vibrations of the instrument itself. That means no amplification is needed, so you can turn the volume knob of your guitar to zero.The second reason is that it is clip-on. I found that it worked almost anywhere on the headstocks of my Fender/Gibson/Explorer style guitars. If you're a Bedroom Warrior like myself, you can swap it from guitar to guitar - or, better still, get one for each guitar. D'Addario has priced this competitively, but last time I looked Amazon was offering two of these tuners for under $20 the pair.You can see the tuning indicator very easily whether this is mounted on the front or back of the headstock. You can also use this device as a metronome.One problem many people have is that tuning the instruments may not be possible if there's an out-of-tune instrument in the band (that can't be tuned easily, like a piano). This tuner can be reset over a wide range so that you don't have to tune by ear to the offending instrument. The tuner also has auto on/off as well as a manual button for that purpose, so you won't find your battery suddenly dead.I can see these tuners becoming part of guitars generally - the last last last word. But today you can have one of these - or a Peterson Strobe (admittedly, a professional instrument) for a mere ~$3300. If I were you I'd pass on the Peterson and get this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKSNTF80RF74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1LLJUW#wasThisHelpful","R2NKSNTF80RF74","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Around 1990, shortly after I had arrived in the United States, me and my wife were living in Ipswich MA.  Then, after one more landlord had sold out from under us, we heard that 26 ½ E. Street was for rent. Our friends nodded sagely, and said âOh yes, thatâs the Updike house.âOur new landlords lived in the larger part of the house, and the apartment we had was not so full of Updike memories. Eventually they showed us the rest of the house, including Updikeâs study. Although it was not large he had a great view of the busy part of Ipswich. We also saw the marks he gouged in the floor paint with his heels as he sought inspiration.But Updike had already made Ipswich famous by his book, Couples. Thinly disguising the town as âTarbox,â he wrote of a group of friends who not only played sports and socialized together, but also slept with each other. It was probably the first novel of its kind that described a life in âThe post-pill paradise.âUpdike came from a sleepy part of Pennsylvania, and life seemed worse when he moved from a small town to the country. But his mother was a would-be novelist (and got herself published in the end) and Updike was born a creator. He went to Harvard and soon gained a name there, and achieved a major aspiration â to be published in The New Yorker.Adam Begley has done a great job with this book. The New Yorkerâs Janet Malcolm described it âas if he was writing a novel.â But thatâs understandable given that Updike greatly described his life in his novels. Quite often, Begley quotes a paragraph from one of Updikeâs books or short stories, and then carries on in his own words.Updike was a clear-eyed observer of the human condition. As well as a whole series of short stories and several books he had two series â the Rabbit stories, and the tales of Henry Bech. From the first story, Rabbit Run, âRabbitâ Angstrom tries to break free from his life. Henry Bech is Updikeâs alter ego, but with an ability to fall into trouble at any minute.Updike became famous and his books sold very well. He sold the house to friends and moved to a much better house in Ipswich. His philandering led him to confess to his wife. She replied that she had been unfaithful before him. Eventually he left his wife, wooed the wife of the couple heâd sold his old Ipswich house to, and they became married.You may have come across Updikeâs work in the adaption of his novel âThe Witches of Eastwick.â This movie starred Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer as the witches, who are intrigued by a new man who moves into the large house in Eastwick. This man is Jack Nicholson who has a devilish way with the women.The front cover of the book shows a smiling Updike and what I take to be Craneâs Beach, where Ipswich meets the sea. If Updike turned to his right he would see the Crane house, which was used for the exterior shots in âThe Witches of Eastwick.âJust when I thought that I had lost touch with Updike, it turns out that he had spent a year in the town of Georgetown - the next town over. He died in 2009 in the tony town of Beverly Farms. I doubt you could read this book without wanting to read Updikeâs work. Thatâs how I felt after finishing it. Begley keeps the story moving and you donât want to give up. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSCKOQ5AOCLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061896454#wasThisHelpful","R1PSCKOQ5AOCLE","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had a condition that required me to have a bandage on my leg that was replaced daily. Every day a nurse visited and either used her own scissors or the household scissors we had.The household scissors were terrible. The nurse's scissors were much better, and came with a little plastic guard on the end of one blade to stop them accidentally digging into you.Just before the treatment was over I got these scissors, and everyone agrees that they are noticeably the best. You don't have to worry about the plastic guard falling off and getting lost, because one blade is bent over at the end, so the guard isn't needed.When the nurses came I got them to use these scissors, and they praised them constantly. They cut better and more accurately than the nurse's purpose-built scissors, and they also didn't stick to anything with adhesive.I wouldn't be surprised if the nurses were issued scissors exactly like this - I keep them in plain sight so I can see if they sprout little legs and run away.For around twelve dollars they perform exceptionally, and I'm sure the time will come when you need them in your home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCZ00MN96ATK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BEJ07W#wasThisHelpful","R2DCZ00MN96ATK","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this book is attempting the impossible. But then I used to teach Office, usually without a book or notes.Word is perhaps the only application where you can know a little bit and still be productive. But I'll doubt you'll be able to do useful work in most of the other applications.That isn't the fault of this book. It appears to be a course book for classes - the major authors are the training company AGI. It explains what will start you off using Office, and does so clearly. The book itself is well-made, with lots of full-color illustrations and a CD of exercises.But unless you take further classes or study yourself at the intermediate stage, I doubt that you'll be the ""go-to"" person in your company for help with Office.So take a look at this book if you're aware of the limitations of Intro to Office books.

"I just received this case after reading through dozens of measurements. My Nikon Coolpix 9300 fits inside with a little space, but not enough for the camera to slide about.It seems pretty well-made, and my wish was granted - to get a bag for a silly price. For a few bucks it will keep the camera from marks and scratches.So I sold my Canon A570 and my Panasonic FZ3, because the Nikon exceeded the specs of the two put together. and the Nikon, as a refurb clearout, cost as much as what I got from selling the other cameras.So hopefully the Nikon will remain pristine and keep its value in this case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0PC9IGB35H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y4NWQE#wasThisHelpful","RI0PC9IGB35H4","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is how the book starts.""It's a Ground War, not just an Air War.""I hope you all got that. The authors say ""This the Most Important Thing we Learned.""I rather think that this is a metaphor that doesn't really convey what they mean. As far as I can see, it means that scaling up excellence means either not giving the message a quick once-over to the troops. or not assuming that you have to involve and move everybody - or maybe both.Or maybe I'm just stupid.The rest of the book is extremely useful. Many organizations form around a small group of people are all in tune with creating excellence. Then their fame overtakes them, requiring a far bigger number of staff to hold the same values. Some succeed, some don't.Authors Sutton and Rao give plenty of examples of how to spread excellence. Like many of the indispensable business books before them, the price of the book is equivalent to only a tiny part of how you'll benefit.Definitely recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVNZSOF5L2B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347022#wasThisHelpful","R2VVNZSOF5L2B3","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I looked through this book, and found the numbers interesting.The numbers are based on hits on Wikipedia and Google. This seems an obvious way of ranking popularity, but I suggest you look at the Wikipedia Top 25 Reports. These show the Top 25 hits for the week, and it seems to me that only about five of them might be appearing here in a year's time.I think that people refer to Wikipedia when something happens that they don't expect. I imagine many more people would check the entry for Beethoven if their were reports saying that ""Hitler was descended from Beethoven."" Even well-known figures can have their blip of fame though no fault of their own.I would imagine that the most popular queries on Wikipedia are on people who don't have full info on their lives. And of course, we all have fixed ideas of our own on who is the most popular with us. And until there are sections on Wikipedia for all famous people in all cultures of the world, it will never be a totally accurate barometer. The authors picked on what appears to be the best bet for now.I think this book will be popular, nonetheless. Just be aware of its shortcomings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6LBVWKIWMU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107041376#wasThisHelpful","RZ6LBVWKIWMU1","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received two books this month to review, and they could learn from each other. Each one of them tries to put human catastrophes and human beings in some sort of order. This book starts off with an interesting premise â that the overall effects of certain disasters turn out to be on the positive side. Author Lomborg makes the case that the effects of El NiÃ±o a few years ago turn out to be positive.While the damages in this case were estimated at $4 billion, the benefits were as high as $19 billion. The benefits figure comes from estimating the positive effects of increased temperatures, leading to fewer deaths through cold and reduced heating bills. Other benefits of El NiÃ±o include reduced spring flood damage and fewer Atlantic hurricanes.Looked at in this way, it pays to look at calamities from all sides. Lomborg uses the gross domestic product of countries to arrive at a close figure of the positive and negative effects of events we see mainly from the minus side. Most of the areas he picks have a negative affect overall, so he thinks we should see the impact on a 150 year old period.He chooses the period from 1900 to 2050. Obviously the latter figure means that people have to project from current numbers. The news is generally pretty good. We are slowly but surely cutting out a lot of the reasons for people not realizing their potential, through illness or other problems. Yet we have to keep working at these issues.Bill Gates, in his 2014 letter from the Gates Foundation, says âI am optimistic enough about this that I am willing to make a prediction. By 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world. (I mean by our current definition of poor.) Almost all countries will be what we now call lower-middle income or richer.â Such countries will be more ready to look at the first world and demand their share of its riches.But Gates also says âCalculating GDP is an inexact science with a lot of room for error and disagreement.â Lomborg tries to be very evenhanded with this, but his book eventually turns into a huge parade of charts and tables (often both on the same page). If youâre prepared to read the text (and avoid a few equations) you will get the message. Unfortunately, a quick glance at the book would convince most people that it is too academic to be understood.Thatâs a pity, because if this editor had taken a look at my other book to review called âWhoâs Bigger,â the message might have come through very clearly. This book ranks historical figures by their exposure on Wikipedia. The highest number of references puts them at the top of their rank. While authors Skiena and Ward acknowledge that this method may not be perfect, they quickly provide tables of popularity.Both books are published by Cambridge University press, but âWhoâs Biggerâ is clearly aimed at the most popular market. I think that had âHow much have Global Problems cost the World?â dropped its sights from academia to the general public, it would have attracted much more attention. And unfortunately, ecological problems deserve the widest audience.So if youâre the sort of reader who will occasionally plow through a book, you will get a lot of benefit here. Itâs just a pity that this book will probably remain obscure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10MGCVLPYM314/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107679338#wasThisHelpful","R10MGCVLPYM314","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edison was one of the foremost inventors of our time, and while subsequent inventions have changed the world, later inventors had the ability to succeed in only one area. That's to be expected given the explosion of knowledge, but to Edison each problem was a challenge that he could solve.The range of interests he had has probably never been surpassed. We know of his work with electric light and sound recording, but Edison's growing plants for artificial rubber and his manufacture of Portland Cement were unknown to me until I read this book. It's one thing to say, ""Oh, that can probably be improved,"" and another thing altogether to invest large amounts of time and money as Edison did.Why I missed the last star for this book was because it steered well clear of controversy. I imagine that it will be sold in the gift shops of Edison-related sites, where people will be more interested in what the Man did, rather than the few areas where he failed. Author DeGraff has spent most of his life working on cataloging Edison's inventions, which is both an asset and a liability.The book fails to deal adequately with ""The War of the Currents,"" which is largely presented as arguments on the best method of electrocuting rogue animals and criminals. The discussion and ramifications of AC versus DC generation of electricity are mainly ignored. Look up ""The War of the Currents"" on Wikipedia to get a truer idea of the issues involved.DeGraff does point out that Edison often believed that Technical Excellence would be more important than public opinion, which is why the records he produced for his gramophone (with no-name artists at excellent quality) were doomed compared to RCA's use of famous artists.The book is well-written, well-illustrated, and well produced. It certainly opened my mind to the lesser-know parts of Edison's inventing life, and makes it perfectly clear that he was not a lone inventor, but relied on his assistants.It's an interesting story, and one that every American should know.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRI80BLQPOB7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402767366#wasThisHelpful","RRI80BLQPOB7C","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A friend of mine who is a well-known author recommended this book to me and Ginny was kind enough to send it. Unfortunately it landed on the mess that is my desk and vanished from site and thought for too long.Now Iâve rediscovered it and wished Iâd never lost it. This book is for everyone who writes, not just for the web. Iâm interested in writing presentations, and it works very well for that. Many books Iâve seen give vague instructions on how to engage your readers, but Ginny goes far deeper than that. She encourages you to think of how your audience is taking what they read.An example is the Mint website, where sheâs constantly reminding you of what your audiences think. People have many questions as they navigate the site, and you should be constantly aware to provide answers. Confused readers will eventually leave the website, still with questions. Similarly, presentation audiences will tune out if things arenât clear.Early on, Ginny points out the necessity of having personas, or sketches of the typical people who will be reading or hearing what you wrote. For each persona, you should consider how they feel after each of your statements. As your argument progresses, so should their thinking - in ways you can predict.But itâs not just general writing â Ginny explains in considerable detail what works on a website. All too often, sites assume that people will read large amounts of text and click buttons that say âMore Infoâ with no explanation why. Maybe you can recall when you stopped reading a website because it wasnât saying what you needed to know.As you can imagine, this is a very easy book to read. There are lots of illustrations that show both good and bad ways of imparting information. But the writing is so straightforward that you almost donât need the illustrations.This book is so important that I recommend it along with the two other books that Iâve relied on over the last few years. One is Bob Blyâs The Copywriter's Handbook, and the other is Steve Stockmanâs How to shoot Video that doesn't Suck. Both books, like Ginnyâs, give you vital guidance on things you probably didnât even think were important. Best to get all three books, and keep them where you work. You will definitely get your moneyâs worth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30K0ZFBIM1E67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0123859301#wasThisHelpful","R30K0ZFBIM1E67","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have considerable praise for this book. We have all kinds of strange ideas about creativity, and Burkus skewers them all. I guess I've seen some exposed before, but this is a comprehensive exposure of what too many people believe about creativity.However, I've only given the book four stars. Burkus needs to write a book called ""The TRUTHS of creativity."" He does refer to successful creative practices in places in the book, but once you read about the myths you need a direction to go in.The book is easy to read and understand, but at the end you may well be charged up to avoid creativity myths, but now you want to know what works. Burkus gives a lot of information about creativity at the Gore company, and a similar section in each chapter would help a great deal.So I hope the book sells well, and the publisher invites him to write a sequel to it.

"This is one of the best books I've read in the last couple of years, and I've read some pretty good ones.If you're an armchair scientist like myself, imagine being invited to a dinner party. After the meal, dozens of scientists tell you how they feel on a particular issue, one after the other. At this party they tell you what scientific theory theory they like, and why. And they rarely use any deep scientific jargon, and if they do, you can pick it up from the context.You finish reading this book and thinking ""Wow!"" You learn that there are people light-years ahead of you in intelligence yet they can make it clear in a few pages what they're thinking about. Some people don't even need a page to express themselves. Just about every few pages you come across ideas that will blow your mind.This book comes from John Brockman, who runs a website called Edge.org. He uses the site to solicit responses to his question of the year. The answers come from people who are usually college professors and have written books, But there are other, better-known people, like Richard Dawkins, Jared Diamond, and Sherry Turkle, along with Nobel prizewinners like Frank Wilczek and Eric Kandel. The standard is uniformly excellent.Going back to that Dinner party - Brockman has done this before, and each time a book was made from it. You can read the contents of everything he's published on his web site, but I prefer reading a book.And I think you will too. Get this or one of Brockman's earlier books.

"Like many others here, I received this battery charger in exchange for a review. And of course, the moment I received it I had to go into hospital.I came back to find the opened package, so i was unsure of how to use it - especially since the ""instructions"" leaflet had no instructions.But here's how to use it. Plug your charger into the side input. When the battery is charged, take the same USB cord and plug the large end into the bottom. Plug the other end into your device. That's all.It's a great idea, because it's so small to carry that you'll never fear your device losing its charge. Sometimes it has more charge than the best-charged device.I wasn't put off by the sticker on the back. I see there's a smaller sticker on the actual charger that's sold.

In the meantime, our cats go out without damaging anything and almost rub noses with other cats and even wild turkeys.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4JBNHVB66MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQM433Y#wasThisHelpful","R2B4JBNHVB66MN","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have written several reviews of travel books on places I've never been to.But this book is different. Around 1992 I took off from Los Angeles direct (or so I thought) to Melbourne, Australia. The 747 was packed, and sleep was difficult. That's why I was annoyed when we were told that we'd stopping at Auckland. It turns out that they wanted to spray the inside of the plane to get rid of any bugs we might have brought.So we were deplaned and went into part of the Auckland terminal. This was a an area about 50 by 100 feet, surrounded by shops and stores - none of which were open. We sat there for about half an hour in the dawn. I looked out and maybe saw a perimeter fence - in the dark and mist it was impossible to tell. When we left I still couldn't see anything.Thus I count this visit as my qualifications for discussing New Zealand, All I can say is that the place was worth visiting after reading this book. It deals with the three main reasons for going there, like a bunch of places that appealed to the frugal traveler in me. There's also a lot about The Hobbit movies, and the home of the world's best Sauvignon Blanc wine. The combinations of climates, and the strong Maori influence made me wish we could have spent a few days there.National Geographic has produced a guidebook that looks like a backpacker's guide, but it appeals to pretty much all kinds of travelers. There are plenty of color photographs and the intimation that you'll enjoy the place if you're prepared to be active. Many places need a hike to see them best.A nod of the head to Maureen, the Kiwi who was a roommate of mine in London. She introduced me to New Zealand pronunciation - the book gives some examples, like ""Fush and Chups"" for Fish and Chips. But she went ever further, referring to her friend ""Pp."" That's right, Pip lost her vowel. You breathed out and then closed your lips quickly.Kiwis strike me as similar to Aussies. Most have a good sense of humor (especially self-deprecatory) and are often very upbeat. So why not take a trip to New Zealand and see what it's like?Just make sure you get out of the airport.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18XG4DMD8GFUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426211619#wasThisHelpful","R18XG4DMD8GFUC","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had to go into hospital suddenly (OK now) and came home to find someone had opened this package. I wasn't sure whether I had all the instructions and parts. After spending a couple of hours trying to set the speakers up, I realized that I needed a power supply,and finally found the one supplied.Sound finally flowed out of the speakers. My guess is that this sounds slightly better than the average, typical of Logitech products. Things are clear at the volumes I'm using (I have the speakers either side of my monitor) and I guess if you're looking for a speaker system at this price this is worth taking a look.My preference is for systems with a subwoofer (three boxes, in a 2.1 configuration) and the deep bass is missing from this system. However, for a few dollars more you can get a subwoofer system from Logitech. I'd advise that, unless you have little space for speakers, or you want something to tote along with a laptop.Logitech sells a range of computer add-ons and upgrades, and I find their stuff to be generally good. So take a listen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JC9KZD2E9ZWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ9XKCM#wasThisHelpful","R1JC9KZD2E9ZWG","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, at a MacWorld, I met David Pogue, and attended an off-floor demonstration of HPâs first inkjets. The results were not very good. Pictures looked like the image on the front of a T-shirt that had been washed 500 times. I received a small teddy bear with its HP shirt for my attendance.These days we expect inkjets to give a pretty good representation of what we send to them. We expect them to be fast and accurate. We also expect them to have a scanner and copier built-in, and sell for considerably less than the early attempts. Many people are happy with printers that cost less than $50.As far as I can remember most of the inkjet and laser printers of the time used Canon mechanisms, and as time went on the inks and printer mechanisms improved. Of course, when printer manufacturers discovered that selling ink for a large amount meant that they could cut the initial cost of the printer, made it possible to pay much less.Incidentally, I see in one of the reviews here that the reviewer claimed that he never bought new ink cartridges, but rather a whole new printer. That was on the grounds that a set of replacement cartridges often cost more than half of a new printer.This might be a good plan except that most printers come with âstarterâ ink cartridges, which hold considerably less than full cartridges. If a starter cartridge gives you only a quarter of the ink in a full cartridge, then this method is a false economy. You end up buying four printers to get as much ink as you get in a full cartridge.So if you pay $60 for a new printer against $35 for a set of full ink cartridges, you end up spending $240 against $95 for buying new cartridges. Yes, you have three printers, but without ink cartridges theyâre basically worth nothing. So take that into account before choosing how to plan your purchases.This printer has a couple of things that I didnât expect in a machine costing under $100. First of all, it has duplex printing, which means you print on both sides of the paper at once. Thus if you have a 30 page document it will print on 15 sheets of paper. The other thing, apart from the growing use of Wi-Fi is the Air Print standard, which lets you print direct from your phone or tablet.Canon has raised the bar with this printer. Just like a printer without copier and scanner is getting to be a rarity these days, I think that duplex and Air Print will be necessary on all printers of this price. The performance in basic printer abilities is well up to par, and duplex at least will be used by just about every purchaser.My only criticism is that Canon says you will save up to 50% of your paper costs by using duplex. Only 50%? They could at least have printers that print on the edges of the paper to save you even more.But other than that, this is a good investment. Yes youâll have to pay for new ink cartridges eventually, but at least youâll be getting the same quality and not have a house filled with ink-less printers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CC20WP5PPWA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1XI900#wasThisHelpful","R2CC20WP5PPWA4","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Time was, Lonely Planet books were in everybody's backpack as people found their way around the little traveled parts of the world. But lately, Lonely Planet has expanded its range to the armchair traveler with books that will never see a cockroach.The books that I've seen recently are aimed at the more affluent traveler, although the back-packers guides still exist. Some of these are simply upmarket versions for people who will arrange their trip long before their travel, and will stay in Western-style hotels.But this book is a coffee table book, yet it still has the ability of other Lonely Planet books to make you want to get up and go. There are dozens of photographs of the world, both natural and man-made, but with very little text. Some people will read a book like this and decide to take a trip to the sites that appeal to them, but most will just browse through the pictures.The pictures are very good. They may well be better than other pictures you seen of the same subject. They will appeal to people of all age groups. Some photos take up far more space than you see elsewhere.So yes, it's a coffee table book, but it may not be an end in itself. Some people will decide that they actually have to go to the places, but even if you don't, it's a very enjoyable read. If guests come and pick up this book from your coffee table, you will have a hard time getting them to put it down.I think you'll agree with me that this is a great book and well worth getting or giving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LRTPGVCRTJVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=174321717X#wasThisHelpful","R1LRTPGVCRTJVS","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a 50-year veteran of not being able to play the guitar. I started in my late teens and have moments where I can play a bunch of chords, but I've never been able to get up on stage.That's why I was interested in reviewing this product. The trouble is, it's like reviewing seed packets. You have a month to say what's good and bad about things. Obviously, seeds take a while to grow, and it takes a while to build up the motor skills to play guitar.Rocksmith claims that 1,500,000 guitarists have learned to play through their method. I wouldn't be surprised - the method is well thought through and is light years ahead of what I was used to 50 years ago. 50 years ago you had to learn to read music, according to most books, and only then could you go on to learn to play ancient tunes that were out of copyright.Rocksmith has gone the other way. They recognize that most people who pick up an electric guitar these days want to play the songs their heroes play. That's why they include over 50 songs from the catalog of famous rock songs - no ""Danny Boy"" here. I think we can say goodbye to Mel Bay and Bert Weedon.And the advantage of computer learning is that it is much more interactive than paper books. Rocksmith tries to match your skills with its lessons. I'm hoping that it will understand my spotty knowledge and keep me working on the things I need. Since it includes a method of tuning your guitar, it seems suitable for the rank beginner.I won't be around my computers and guitars for the next two or three weeks, but when I return I really want to start the program properly. It definitely looks good, and there's a five week plan which I think I can manage, so when I return I'll be practicing and I'll report back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V5BXZSXS49QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6PTMHI#wasThisHelpful","R1V5BXZSXS49QC","A3OIMUR42XIOFQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OIMUR42XIOFQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
