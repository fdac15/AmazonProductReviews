"So after owning some truly high end speakers from Sonus Faber (Guarneri Evolution and Amati Futura) I HAD to listen to these due to all the hype and reviews. I mean, look at the reviews here, or in the media. No speaker in recent memory has had this much hype.Seeing that I have high end amplification (McIntosh MA8000 and MHA 100) and cables (Nordost Red Dawn and Heimdall) I figured why not try these for giggles. I sold my Sonus Fabers a while ago and have been enjoying the budget Wharfedale Denton's (which are a MUST BUY at $499 if you love rich warm rocking music BTW) so when these became available locally by me for an insane deal new in box I went for it.BURN IN IS NEEDED FOR AT LEAST 5 HOURS.. they will change dramatically after this.When I first hooked them up and they sounded good, but could not match my $500 Dentons in sound quality. The mids were recessed, the highs were brittle and the bass was TOO deep, but sounded like one note. I let them run in for many hours and checked back in..They already opened up dramatically with a huge soundstage, a nice warm character to the sound and the highs became tamer and very sweet. Detail was there but not to the level many make it out to be. For the retail cost of these, they are a deal and a steal. I would say these sound better than most $5000 speakers, and to be honest, when these were hooked up to my McIntosh MA8000 (300 WPC integrated amp) these sounded better in my dedicated room than my past Amati and Evolution speakers which were both 5 figure speakers). In fact, these little guys are now my reference, and yes, with the MA8000 the bass is HUGE, DEEP and tighter than my old Sonus Fabers.Between these and my old Sonus Faber Evolutions that cost me $25k, I do get the same soundtage and imaging effects from these but these are slightly smaller sounding, but better sounding to me. With these we have amazing midband clarity yet they are never ever thin (unless you are running them from a receiver or cheaper amp, these need MASSIVE current to come alive). With my little McIntosh MHA100, which has a 50 WPC amp, they sounded great, fantastic. With the MA8000 they became a new beast..huge open sound, huge bass, delicious midrange, again, for sound they beat my old VERY expensive Sonus Faber (only with the MA8000 amp though).The 50WPC drove them but not to the level to realize how good these are. If you are not getting huge hug sound, a wide open soundstage, amazing clarity and a nice warm full signature then your amp and speaker cables are the weak link.From the aggressive design to the heft of each speaker, they are built very well. They look odd at 1st with the copper colored UniQ driver but with sound, sitting in my sweet spot after more break in they are magical. Simply the most magical speaker I have ever heard.Yep, if you love vocals, jazz, acoustic guitar or drums, or ambient music, bluegrass...hell, most music..you will find out that these can deliver an experience that used to only be reserved for speakers $5k and up to 20-30k. While they do not have huge mid bass, which makes them anemic on cheaper recievers or amps, they do scale amazingly well and will keep on improving with each amp upgrade. For me, the combo of these, a good stand (good solid STANDS ARE MANDATORY for amazing sound to come from these), the MA8000 and my digital and vinyl source are an end game for me. I have never heard better. I have heard bigger, I have SEEN better, but when it comes to reproducing the soul of the music, swirling around you filling your room with amazing details and imaging magic, these do not disappoint. Well worthy of their Class A rating in Stereophile. Again, if you are not getting this from these you have the wrong amp hooked up. Even changing from copper wire to Nordost Red Dawn resulted in a HUGE HUGE difference, night and day. So these deserve the best you can give them in the amp and cable department.The little LS50's give some of the best vocal reproduction I have heard since my older Sonus Faber Guarneri Homage. That is saying something for these being $1500.One weakness I found... No real loud head banging with these really, so metal heads apply elsewhere. (due to non exaggerated mid bass). With that said, as I write this I have some Five Finger Death Punch playing and WOW, filling my room with a huge fat sound...but with the air and detail associated with higher end designs. Amazing.For the money other speakers that are also as good in their own ways and I really enjoy them (though can not get to the magic of the Ls50)Dynaudio X14 (less expensive, more bass and a bigger sound, but less refined, detailed and magical)Wharfedale Denton 80th Anniversary (now on clearance for $500, these are the best bang for the buck in speakers ever - if you want warm, fat and that vintage sound, these are it)So be sure to take a look at these LS50's especially if you love vocals, acoustic, jazz or even ambient music. They excel here like a $10-20k speaker. For rock, pop and others they are still fantastic but you may miss that mid bass that rock and metal needs to really have a driving force.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0Y5B65VEV79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPDMDZ8#wasThisHelpful","R2I0Y5B65VEV79","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. I bought these expecting to return them due to shoddy build, dull sound, muffled sound or just being a crappy speaker. I am a 20+ year audiophile and I have owned systems ranging from $1k to $35k. My last serious speaker that I adored was the $25,000 Sonus Faber Guarneri Evolution. The best stand mounted monitor I have ever owned or heard or seen. Should be for that money. (they are now gone as I could not live with myself spending that kind of cash on them, even with getting a deal)Since I had to sell those a while ago I have been listening to various monitors in the $1k to $3k range.I loved the looks and vintage style of these so I took the chance and bought them at the $499 price. (half off). I was trying areas models in my listening room (Dynaudio, KEF, Wharfedale, Harbeth and more)When they arrived the box and packaging was something I only saw in HiFi speakers costing $3k and up. Each speaker was protected in a baggie, white gloves were given and a beautiful booklet describing the history of the company and why these are so special.Long story short, I hooked them into my main system and the 1st hour it was bad. Closed in, muffled, dark, and raggedy in the treble.I let them run overnight while not listening and came back the next day.WHAT?!?!?!? I was blown away by these and no matter what I played through them...audiophile music, rock, metal, vocals, jazz, blues, bluegrass..they sounded rich, full, and gentle and organic. NEVER harsh. TONS of quality bass, never boomy and the treble was sweet and just sounded GOOD. There was a mid bass bloom there that gave these a warm signature, just like I remember from back in the day growing up. Big fat warm sound.No fatigue after I sat there mesmerized for 6 hours listening to song after song.Now, at $500 I can not say they beat my old $25k Sonus Fabers, but they did give me 70% of that sound. With the right gear (GREAT amp and cables) and source these SING as good as any high end speaker I have heard but they sound like MUSIC. Not far off from the Harbeth P3ESR, really. Even though these are $500, they will scale up to better amps, to a point.Give these quality amp and source, good cables (I use the latest Nordost Red Dawn) and you will be rewarded with an incredible experience. Anyone who says these are no good just has not used them in the right setting. With an AV receiver these will sound flat, thin and no soundstage to speak of.With a cheap amp they will sound decent but I am telling you, if you have a nice hugh end system buy a pair of these to try out ad you will be amazed after they run in for 40-50 hours (mine have about 60 on them and sound so BIG, full, detailed and like music. Never analytical but also never leaves me wanting for detail.My only niggle is that some times you can tell they are a tad dark in the midrange. There is a mid bass presence to give these a very full big sound but this makes them, at times, if yo really concentrate on it, slightly dark in the midband area. Bass is tremendous but never sloppy, which is amazing for the price point.Either way, I have not heard a speaker at this price that can even get close to this for build, sound or pride of ownership.the Denton's have a little more MOJO. It's crazy for a speaker of this price to be this good.It is also a shame most audiophiles will disregard these due to brand and price. They truly are special and i bet after these are all sold out and gone, a good used set will go for more than $500. They are destined to be classics IMO. Wait and see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROEF5X15TYZ18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDMZJ9U#wasThisHelpful","ROEF5X15TYZ18","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the looks as they appear to be constructed on the level of some $3000 cables i have seen. When I opened the box I was blown away by the weight, appearance and size of these cables. I assumed these would be amazing, and for the price I did not expect such quality of construction.I am running a nice setup. Macintosh gear, KEF & Sonus Faber speakers, VPI turntable, clear audio cart, etc. I have been into HiFi for 20 years. I know what I like.After taking out the borrowed Nordost Red Dawn from my system and placing these in I was sickened. If you think cables make no difference, think again. Once these were in the bass vanished, the mids were sucked in and the highs were harsh. Sound was flat, sounded like my system was now using $100 speakers instead of $20k speakers. I then switched in the little KEF LS50's and the same effect. With the Red Dawns the soundstage was HUGE, details were there, bass was huge and full and the sound was coherent, natural and gorgeous. With these cables the sound just fell flat, was harsh and the bass VANISHED.Now, not sure if the cable has an issue, but while they look amazing, the sound is not up to par even with a $25 cheap cable from Best Buy.Tried this on three systems, all the same.if you want to kill your sound then buy these. Worst speaker cables I have ever heard. They are going back tomorrow.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKKYP5K3LR0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7IZBVS#wasThisHelpful","R3CKKYP5K3LR0D","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the money, this thing ROCKS harder than ANY phono stage up to $500. I have owned phono pre amps from $100 to $2000 and while there are some out there for $10-$20k, this little $200+ wonder sounds amazing with my VPI Scout 1.1. While it is not the last name in resolution, it does offer a big fat warm sound with nice details and small soundstage.I have tried this in a $15k system and it does well.There is much better but be prepared to spend $1000+ for it. Using this phono stage takes me back to my teen years as it sounds like that big fat analog sound I remember.A no brainer at the price. Seriously, and this is coming from a hardcore audiophile. Even though I crave the great gear, this is something that surprised me in a huge way.I am running stock tubes as well and this is fabulous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17DB53D5EPG2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQW4NYO#wasThisHelpful","R17DB53D5EPG2T","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow. Bought these as I was so so curious as to what a $3000 headphone would sound like. I mean, I already have a set of LCD-X and EL-8's, not too shabby...or so I thought! When these arrived the build, feel and fit were the best I have seen in a headphone.In the past I have owned or tested Sennheiser HD800 ($1500), Audeze LCD-X ($1700) and Audeze LCD-3 ($1900). I have all owned many headphones in the $200-$600 range so I feel I am OK to write about these high end headphones as I have heard high end sound, and been involved in high end audio for 20 years.1st off, My amp is an ALO Audio Studio 6 with the Studio 6 Phono Stage. I use a Yamaha 2100 SCD player/DAC for my digital source ($3000).I have a nice setup but it is not the be all end all of course, I would say my setup is mid level. I have heard TONS of high end gear from $10k systems to $200k systems, even a million dollar system on one occasion (not mine of course).NO, I am not rich, not even close. I just buy the things in life that I get enjoyment from. I am not a fan of RV's, Expensive watches, Fancy cars, boats or large houses. So I buy things like this as I get massive life enjoyment from them, just how I live life..I concentrate on what I love and enjoy.With that out of the way, these headphones are the best I have ever heard, period. Not even close either. Compared to my LCD-X, the HE-1000's are on another level entirely for presentation, flow, organic richness, huge soundstage. clarity, detail, imaging. In fact, I loved my LCD-X. After the HE 1000 it is very tough to go back to them. The LCD-X have the thump, drive and slam but they lack the finesse, amazing holographic sound and creamy silky mids of the HE 1000.Voices sound eerily real. Music...each instrument has its place in the soundstage. The sound is not IN your head, it is WAY OUTSIDE of the head. Close your eyes, dim the light and you are THERE.I would say this Headphone competes with 2 channel speaker systems upwards of $40k. They are that good. so max. I feel there could be more slam and impact (dynamics). The HE 1000 is very natural (not neutral) and lacks massive slam and kick. EI would say this Headphone competes with 2 channel speaker systems upwards of $40k. They are that good.verything is just a tad ""soft"" but this is awesome as it makes everything sound so so good. Unheard of good. As in you probably never heard anything like this on your ears.So congrats to HiFiman. They succeeded in draining $3k from my wallet. The LCD-X are now going bye bye and these are staying.These sound  good with ALL music but if you want aggressive kick, slam and music that POUNDS, this is not your headphone. This is for those who enjoy a glass of scotch, lights out, fire on, and HE 1000's on your head as you seriously get lost in the music, with performers coming right into your room.Thinly headphones that can compete with these are the STAX SR009 but that is a huge investment and from what I hear, they lack the body of the HE 1000, so I would probably much prefer the HE 1000. This is a masterpiece in design and sound quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCJRYR6WUZHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9XT3SE#wasThisHelpful","R3BCJRYR6WUZHI","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I want one like in the photo. With some white in it as my TT is all black. Black table, black mat, black platter, black arm. I thought the white and black would mix it up. So I bought this for the looks and novelty only. Since they sent an ALL BLACK mat I am returning it, so just beware you may not get anything like what is pictured. I did put it on my TT (I have a high end system) and it did change the sound slightly, with more treble energy.

"This is an amazing player. I will state I am an audiophile and have been enjoying amazing sound for 20+ years. I have owned $40k systems and $2000 systems. I know good sound. I have a few players..iPod, iPhone 6+, Pono and this player, the Ak120II.Between all, this player excels in all areas. Build is off the charts..you feel like  you have a $1600 product in your hand. Sound is refined, and no sign of digital ick. The amp is very competent and has driven all phones I have tried besides HD800's (they do not sound good with this player alone).Yes this is expensive, but it is made for audiophiles who spend thousands, tens of thousands and some hundreds of thousands on their home systems.It is not for the every day joe who is used to a $200 best buy stereo. That person would not appreciate this player.I can give this one 5 stars. Bought from ALO Audio while I was in Portland. NO REGRETS.I am returning the Pono this week that I bought as it doesn't even get close to the AK 120II in build, sound or usability.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZY1QNBWD8N7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3NAW42#wasThisHelpful","R1CZY1QNBWD8N7","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this locally in Phx AZ and after all the hype I caved. When I opened the box at home I was shocked at how cheaply this was built. It feels hollow, like there is nothing inside. The yellow color screams construction site and the user interface is not so hot. As for the sound, to be 100% honest, I prefer my iPhone 6+ over the Pono, that is with using headphones ranging from $400 to $1300. As for music players I have a few. This one, my iPhone and iPods and the Astell and Kern AK120 II, which is INCREDIBLE.Between the Pono and Ak 120II, it was NO contest. The AK 120 II killed the Pono for sound quality The AK had a delicacy and analogues to it that was beautiful. The Pono in comparison is a bit hard and in your face.NOW, for the price, the Pono is not so bad, though if you have an iPhone 6 or 6+, stick with that unless you want high res files. I downloaded $50 worth from the pono store (two albums) and was not impressed. Yes, there is a slight difference but 98% of normal people would not hear the difference with this player.With the AK 120 II it is EASY to hear the differences. Night and Day.So I am returning the Pono to the store this week. It's made cheap, the design is ugly and not very portable like and the UI needs a major rework. This feels like a beta product at best. Prototype.I gave it 2 stars as it is the lowest price high res player out there, but if you treasure amazing sound, and are an audiophile at heart go with an Astell and Kern player, they sound, feel and work so much better. YOU DO get what you pay for, and that is just me being honest. With the Ak 120 II you FEEL like you have a $1700 product in your hand. With the Pono, you feel like you have a $50 product in your hand.The sound difference between the higher end players and the Pono is really there. Much more refined on the higher end players with NO HINT of digital ""sound"". Not so with the Pono. I had high hopes, and was vey disappointed in this player.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UTT6O7ACTDUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBS32K4#wasThisHelpful","R1UTT6O7ACTDUG","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Sony A7II is here and I have had one for about a week before they were released and shipped. I have been using it every day and run a large camera review website where I use ALL cameras made but review only what I like and would use or recommend. I have noticed a couple of reviews here with mis information so decided to write up a short review before my huge full review on my website.First, the A7II is built to just about pro level specs. The camera is a huge step up in build from the A7, A7R and A7s. It feels solid and hefty, much like a Leica M 240 with a grip and while the grip makes it larger than the previous A7, it is in no way as large as any Nikon DSLR. It is also smaller than the Nikon Df (as well as better with IQ).The IQ has been improved even though it uses the same A7 sensor. There is much better AWB, Color, pop and overall quality to the files that is just about the best I have ever tested for real work photos. The camera is about 30% faster than the A7 with Af but is a little slower than my A7s. But focus is not an issue.What makes this camera special is the fact that it is a full frame camera that is just about near Pro Level build and feel, has 5- Axis Image Stabilization which NO OTHER full frame camera has, and it is the best IS you can get. It works with EVERY lens, EVERY lens and is groundbreaking. It will also give you 3 Axis IS with Leica lenses or any adapted lens.The buttons feel fantastic, the dials feel fantastic and compared to my A7s, it feels MUCH MUCH better, in another league better.The images I have been getting with the A7II beat out my A7, A7r and A7s images when it comes to color, sharpness, micro contrast and overall image quality. It's the best of the A7 lot for all out IQ though the A7s beats it in low light. This will not do what the A7s can do in low light or high ISO.With those points out of the way, this camera with the Sony/Zeiss 35 2.8 and 55 1.8 is phenomenal. Those two lenses are must owns but I would skip the kit zoom as it is large, soft and will not show what the camera can do. Why Sony includes it is beyond me as it cripples the cameras output.At $1698 this is the deal of the century as you are getting a camera just as capable as some $3000+ cameras all in a well made camera with loads of lenses to mount. Sony/Zess, Leica, Zeiss ZM, Voigtlander, Nikon and Canon..all of these lenses can be mounted with the correct adapter. I use Leica lenses and for me, 35mm and up are better on the A7II than my Leica M 240.This camera is for those who value IQ, great build, fast speed, the best IS you can get, the ability to mount ANY lens you want and superb manual focus capabilities. The EVF is a joy to use and quite large and the only thing I can say negative about this camera is that its AF is not blazing for continuous or sports but it has improved greatly, and its focus accuracy is SPOT ON.For me, this beats my Leica M 240, my Olympus E-M1, ANY Fuji on the market and even my A7s for all out IQ (though not low light). This and the A7s has become my main cameras and I bought my own A7II just hours after getting my review sample. It is that good.If you do not like this camera then not much will please you, or you are just a fan of huge fat ugly DSLR's.This camera is smaller than ANY DSLR made, and much thinner. Smaller than the Nikon Df, D750, yet more capable and versatile. The video is some of the best you can get as well and with the 5 Axis IS, video footage is almost ""steady shot like"" - awesome.The buttons and dials are great and in no way at all feel cheap. This is one of the most solid cameras I have seen all year and for me, takes the cake for best of 2014. This camera should have come in at $2495 but Sony put it out at $1698 to show that YES THEY CAN.5 Stars from me on the Sony A7II. My full HUGE review with tons of samples will be up on my website.

"This is the 1st KISS album I ever heard. At Age 9 (I am now 45) I rented this from my local Library after seeing the cover and these four guys with makeup on. The 1st side, the 1st listen..I WAS HOOKED. THIS is the album that made me a life long KISS fan. I ended up having y Mom buy me this album when I was 10 and I wore out the grooves over the many years I played it. Digital came, CD's came and the CD's never sounded the same as my initial LP.With this remaster, the sound is back. Heavy, full, and BIG! The bass is back that was missing from the CD and on my turntable today this sounds so much nicer than the digital versions.It may be a LITTLE dark but it is better than the thin bright CD.My fave KISS album ever, and now on Vinyl again, remastered and sounding just like it did in the 70's, I am so happy to own it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18XXHUSHVNVBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU3S8WK#wasThisHelpful","R18XXHUSHVNVBP","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought a few of these, were way too small, even when ordering a large (I normally wear a small). Sent them all back except one. Amazon refunded me before they even got back to them. When they did get my box back they claimed only one shirt was in the box when there were six sent back, so they recharged me for all of them. Either someone at Amazon stole the shirts or they couldn't count. So I will never buy clothing from Amazon again, ever.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGWJXJE0JFA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVYI5YU#wasThisHelpful","R2QGWJXJE0JFA4","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this and I actually have two older versions of this album (Not Mobile Fidelity versions) and they sound 100% superior to this so called superior and more expensive transfer. I have a high end setup - really high end. This version sounds flat, dull, muffled and NOT good. So bad in fact that I would never listen to this version when the one I picked up for $1 at my used recored shop sounds much much better.

"Was happy to find this item and the price was right compared to the $150 for the VPI weight I wanted for my VPI table. Wheni t arrived i was surprised at how tiny this is. Its SMALL. Hefty but small. I have owned several record weights and clamps in my lifetime, and this is the smallest one I have seen. Covers just a small part of the label instead of the whole label like many weights do. So with this the price is not great but about right. You get what you pay for. I do not feel it is wide enough to help flatten records that are slightly warped. So, because of this I will probably return mine. Well made, heavy and looks nice..just to small to get the job done IMO.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVAVBHZSR0442/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043KJAK4#wasThisHelpful","RVAVBHZSR0442","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nikon Df has been in my hands for only a couple of days and I will be doing a full extended review on my website (some of you may know where that is). I am not a DSLR fan, and have not owned one since the D700 when it was launched quite a few years ago. One thing I did not like about the D700 and future D800 and D3, D4, etc was the huge size and weight. New mirror less cameras have been arriving that can meet and exceed some DSLRs (Sony RX1R for one).But the Df, with its retro build and style captured my heart when I saw it. I shoot with a Leica M and a Sony RX1. When I saw the images of the Df I was taken back to the 70's when Nikon REALLY made cameras that stood the test of time in looks, design, functionality and build quality.I did not think i would like the Df as it looked huge to me in photos. Last thing I want is a heavy and large bulky DSLR. But when the camera arrived I was shocked at how light it was. In fact, my Leica M with tiny 35 Summaron felt heftier and was. The Df looks tough but feels a little cheap but I believe Nikon did this to solve the weight issue. I mean, C.mon..the D800 and D4 are TANKS and for everyday shooting they are not ideal, especially once you get a taste of those small HQ mirror less cameras.I would never buy a D800 or D4 for everyday snaps. Pro work? yes. Daily shooters? No way Jose. Just not enjoyable, and a camera has to be enjoyable for me to want to shoot with it. One  reason I love my Leica so much.As for the kit 50 1.8 SE lens, it is average. Soft wide open, very light, nothing like a classic Nikon lens. Probably worth the $100 but this camera deserves a high quality fast 50mm prime.The D4 sensor is the king of the night of any full frame cameras. I tested it at 6400 and 12,800 and saw no noise in my prints or web sized images. Astounding. The Sony A7, A7r or Leica M can not do this.I have much more shooting to do but I commend Nikon on the Df. It is handsome, rugged, lightweight and offers some of the best Full Frame IQ you can get. Pair it with some HQ fast primes, even classic AI primes, and you are all set.As for manual focus, I had no issues whatsoever manually focusing a 50 1.2. AT all.AF is fast but not as fast as my Olympus E-M1 and I still prefer a nice HQ EVF to an optical but the Df is a joy to shoot due to the smaller size, lower weight, and it inspires confidence in the manual controls and design.As for those dials, they are great. For those that want to LEARN, set it to manual and all controls are easily accessible without having to menu dive. Brilliant. Those who are complaining about the dials are just not up for shooting a manual camera. But the cool part is that you can also shoot it in full auto.Love it. THIS is my favorite Nikon camera but I have to decide if I want to keep the black or silver. :)My review samples are in and I will be testing these with various lenses over the next 3 weeks. It is a camera that gets me excited to go out and shoot, and that just does not happen for me with DSLR's. That right there tells me this is something special.I gave it 4 stars because I do feel the price point should have hit $2500 with the lens. Also, it is not as sturdy feeling as I had hoped (then again, that could have added to the weight).Some key points from my 1st use:Battery Life is amazing  - best I have seenD4 quality in a small body. Enough said,Build could be sturdier.Feels good in the hand though grip is small.AF is fast, Manual Focus is easy.Dials are superb, love them.IQ with the kit lens is good but not WOW. The kit lens is soft/average.Best low light I have seen besides the D4Light as my Leica M in real useTo those complaining about the cost (I did a little but as well) think about it... To those who do not WANT a huge DSLR like the D800 or an ugly D600 and want top class low light performance (best in class) - with the flagship sensor...$2700 is not a bad buy. You have to buy what you will WANT to shoot with. Me, if a D4, D800 and the Df was offered to me for free..just had to pick one..it would be the Df. Why? Because due to the size, weight and look of  the others I would never take them out. The Df is a daily shooter and that is what Nikon had in mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q64FQKGRO9Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GD1KCAI#wasThisHelpful","R2Q64FQKGRO9Y2","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ordered a Nikon Df and this lens came with it. It has been a while since I shot with a Nikon and this lens is the same as I remember it. Pretty soft wide open and doesn't get really sharp until f/2.5. This is an average 50mm lens and I'd pay $100 for it but not $279. Looks wise it has a silver ring but is still cheap in the build and feel. Nothing special at all here  - Id go with the normal 50 1.8 if buying this lens.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SA5ZQ1JASC9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GD1KEEC#wasThisHelpful","R2SA5ZQ1JASC9T","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge Halloween fan. Have been since age 10. Halloween II has been my fave of the series and when I saw this mask, I had to have it, especially after reading the rave reviews. When it arrived I was disappointed. The mask that shipped direct to me via Amazon prime did not look nearly as good as the image in the description. It looked cheaper and not nearly as detailed. BUT with that said, it was still cool. Until I tried it on. I have a large head and I swim in this mask. I cant even see through it due to the mask being so large around my head. So IMO, you will have to tape up the back to tighten it on your head if you want to wear it.I enjoy high quality masks and this one is just a teeny tiny step up from retail store masks though I bought one of the best masks ever at a store last week for $20. Amazing quality that beats this one easily in fit and form.This may be nice as a display in your home if you are a true Michael Myers and Halloween II fan but to wear it, do not expect AMAZING, expect better than average.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX7P4Q87MK3AQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097B6SYU#wasThisHelpful","RX7P4Q87MK3AQ","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have thoroughly used and reviewed this camera over the past several weeks (review sample from Olympus) and have been wowed, shocked and surprised at the results. I originally thought this would be an E-M5 with a better build, feel and faster AF and at the end of the day I found it to be much more. Due to the lack of an AA filter, the IQ has indeed been enhanced. Images are sharper/crisper and the high ISO has also been improved. I have written 5700 words on this camera and shared a ton of images as well as a comparison against a Leica M. At the end of the day this camera is so good, I ordered one from Amazon for myself.Below is my ""FInal Conclusion"" from the full review I posted on my website on the E-M1:Well here we are in 2013 and the choices for all of us crazy enthusiasts are plentiful and excellent. We finally have a definitive Micro 4/3 camera body that is pro level and can do just about anything one needs it to do and do it in any weather. As always, I review cameras from an enthusiasts point of view in a real world way. There are things I do not even get into like Flash, because I have not used a flash in 14 years. I am anti-flash even though I know it is good to have on some occasions. But as an enthusiast and a passionate photographer who has seen it all and used them all, I can say with confidence that the OM-D E-M1 is one of the best cameras ""as a whole"" that I have ever reviewed. It is superb. Yes, there are others with better overall IQ and others with better high ISO but as a whole, speaking of the whole package, nothing else has come close.You have seen me rant and rave about a few different camera models over the year. Leica's and Sony's for the most part. Well as of today there is a new camera in town that offers the perfect mix of speed, usability, build, image quality, cost and lenses to place it at the top of the heap in the world of mirrorless cameras. Someone asked me today if I would take a Canon 6D and 85L or an E-M1 and 25 1.4. For me that choice is easy. The E-M1 only because it would go with me everywhere when the 6D would be left behind. It is just too large, too bulky and too heavy and the lenses, while fantastic are just too much weight wise for everyday use.The image quality of the E-M1 is an improvement over the E-M5 due to the new processor and lack of an AA filter. The files pop more and I feel they also have slightly different color that I prefer. Crisp. Beautiful. The exposure metering is fantastic, the AWB is fantastic, the out of camera colors are beautiful.There will always be naysayers no matter what towards this Micro 4/3 system. But those who disregard or trash Micro 4/3 or the E-M1 have no idea what they are doing or saying. There is simply nothing to trash and that is fact.It will not match full frame like the RX1 or M in all out flat out IQ but it will meet head to head ANY APS-C mirrorless and beat them on build, speed, and every other area usability area with ease. What it boils down to for me is..Olympus E-M1 or Full Frame? The answer for me is BOTH. One all out IQ monster and one usability and IQ monster. :)Also, let us not forget the lenses. Micro 4/3 has some of the best lenses made for any system, period. There are many highly recommended jewels in the lineup.  At the end of the day this camera gets my highest recommendation. Buy the E-M1 and a couple of nice fast primes and go out and use it and it will be hard to put it down. The Olympus E-M1 has the charm, the soul and the goods to Be my pick for Camera of the Year 2013. Not sure if it will as I hear Sony has something on the way but as it stands now, the E-M1 is at the top of the list. :)As of this writing (October 12th 2013) I can say that for me, the Olympus E-M1 is the best Mirrorless camera on the market today when looking at the ""Whole Picture"" of cost, size, build, speed, toughness, EVF, performance, features and lenses available. No one else even comes close and I should know, I have used EVERYTHING out there. Well done Olympus, you have indeed created a mirrorless masterpiece!Which would I take?Panasonic GX7 or E-M1: E-M1 no contest.E-M1 or Fuji X Body: E-M1 no contest.E-M1 or new rumored Sony Full Frame: BOTH, one for the Full Frame IQ and look and one for all that I have raved about.E-M1 or NEX-6: E-M1 due to the lenses and speed and build and IQ.E-M1 or Fuji X100s: Close, but for me, E-M1E-M1 or Pentax K3? The new Pentax looks amazing on Paper, but is still a DSLR. I can not say until I test the K3 :)E-M1 or Leica M: Two different cameras for different audiences. End of story, so BOTH :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEKNE2UCKG5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQ07PG2#wasThisHelpful","RSEKNE2UCKG5Z","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For under $120 this trail camera is quite amazing for what it can do. While not the fastest trigger, and not the best resolution or night distance, the wide angle lens makes this camera. I tried the 990i and returned it. This one came in, tested it and bought a 2nd one. I use these for different applications but found that the wide angle lens makes it perfect for my use. Have had no issues with the use or operation and with an aiming LCD screen and video capability, hard to complain. If you want amazing quality, buy a reconyx for speed and long term durability. If you want to capture more of the scene and have ease of use and nice night vision video or photo, this guy rocks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8ZGHNGB7Q4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AU6DSUI#wasThisHelpful","RF8ZGHNGB7Q4K","A8XBR09J4Z421","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8XBR09J4Z421?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beware, there seems to have been a mix up at Amazon. I ordered this pedal and instead they sent me some sort of eventide pitch shifter pedal. I read on another eventide pedal review of the same thing happening so Amazon must have mixed up stock placing SPACE pedals in a place that was meant for a different pedal. I sent it back, was refunded, so all is well. I then ordered this pedal elsewhere and received it A-OK. As for the Pedal, it is a 5 star pedal all the way. I have had the Hall Of Fame, Stereo WET and Hardwire Reverb. This literally kills them all. Lush, organic, and HUGE. No noise. It is a high quality effect and it shows.

"Was excited to receive my Ena Micro 1. I used to own a ENA 5 and it was a wonderful machine that is still going strong almost 5 years on. Unfortunately the ENA 5 is in a new home so I wanted once again to buy a Jura.Tried Nespresso but the the pod costs are too high these days and I am not a huge fan of the nespresso ""taste""So I ordered the Micro 1 from Amazon Prime and it was delivered within one business day.I opened it up, set it on my countertop, followed the step by step instructions for set up but something was wrong. As soon as I put the water tank back on it instantly just poured out of the bottom of the unit. Would not pump water as it was leaking FAST right back out, pouring all over my counter and floor.Tried again, same thing.SO was DOA. At $799, there should have been better quality control.In any case I initiated a refund through Amazon and now will take a week and a half to get my money back due to the fact that it will take 6 days to ship back to them via Ground.IN the meantime I went to Sur La Table and splurged for an Impressa F7, the new 2013 model.This one works like a charm, perfectly and Sur La Table gives a ONE YEAR return policy in case it gives me issues over the 1st year.So if you order this and it leaks, you got a DOA Lemon. I am sure when it works it is great, as are mostly all Jura products.

"The dockStubz case adapter is a perfect solution for any annoying problem with external devices that aren't designed with a long enough Lightning connector. A year ago I purchased an iHome radio at Costco that has a built-in Lightning connector for charging an iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, there is no way to charge either device without removing the case because the connector isn't long enough to make up for the extra depth. I have my phone in a thin Case-Mate case and it still wouldn't fit on the iHome's Lightning connector. That meant I had to remove the case every night in order to charge it, which became a nuisance.I stumbled across the dockStubz adapter on Amazon, and while I thought it was a bit pricey (it actually costs more than the Case-Mate case itself!) I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did, as it's a perfect solution for this annoying issue. This device is very well designed and resolves the problem completely. It installs in an instant and the Lightning connector is now long enough to easily penetrate the depth of the case and fit solidly into the phone.The dockStubz adapter comes in two pieces in order to accommodate cases with different depths. With my Case-Mate, I snapped the two pieces together and had enough length on the connector for my iPhone 6 plus. If you have a phone with a heavier case, like an Otterbox, which makes the Lightning port even deeper, remove the spacer and the dockStubz provides additional length. I don't have an Otterbox case and haven't tested it personally, but in just looking at mine, I feel confident this would solve the problem for those owners.The dockStubz is a bit pricey, but I suspect that licensing costs from Apple are what drives the cost up. This adapter doesn't interfere with any of the iHome's functions, like setting the alarm from an app on the phone, or listening to music through the radio. Cheaper cables and adapters that aren't licensed will only provide power and no other services, however this adapter is fully functional with no limitations.I have only two minor quibbles. First, the dockStubz can easily come off the iHome Lightning connector when removing the iPhone or iPad and then needs to be reinstalled. I don't consider this a big problem, and it is way easier than taking the case off and having to reinstall it every night. Also, if you hold the adapter with the other hand as you remove your phone, the adapter stays in place.Second, the phone is a bit less stable using the dockStubz than it is when resting on the iHome itself. This is because the phone is being supported by the adapter and not the bumpers on the radio. Again, not a big problem. The iPhone is held firmly enough that there doesn't seem any danger about the phone falling off, even when setting the alarm via an app, or using the phone to select music, but there is a bit less stability using the adapter.If the truth be known, I blame the designers at iHome for this problem. Had the radio been manufactured with a slightly longer Lightning connector, this issue wouldn't exist. It would have been so simple for them to do this, but I guess no one thought about charging the phone with a case, or the folks at iHome simply didn't care.In summary, the dockStubz is a clever (although pricey) solution to a design issue of external devices with a Lightning connector that is too short to accommodate an iPhone or iPad while in a case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D7IJUNYJAHHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KH08E1A#wasThisHelpful","R1D7IJUNYJAHHG","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In order to orient the plug correctly, I needed to use a small adapter to plug the power supply into. It causes the two to project about 3 1/2 inches from the base. On the other side I'm using a remote to turn the outlet on and off. The lights that they control are plugged into that.The receptacle comes with enough parts that you can configure it any way that your situation requires. There are lots of additional plates that allow the use of outlets, switches, etc. In addition, there are knockouts to allow for both rounded outlets (as shown in the photo) or the more modern type square outlet. You'll need a good needle nose pliers to remove the knockouts and a screwdriver for mounting the receptacle of whatever surface you've chosen. The box has a padded back which allows it to fit tightly over an irregular surface, like stucco.All in all an excellent product that is designed to protect electrical outlets from the weather and provide enough depth to make even unwieldy power supplies fit correctly. It installed easily and fits my needs perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17RK2JEQKCJW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JEPX6C#wasThisHelpful","R17RK2JEQKCJW7","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my use, this drive is just perfect, and the price was great for a 2TB capacity storage device, even better pricing at Amazon than Costco! I'm using this with a mid-2010 MacBook Pro as a backup drive. I've partitioned the drive into two 1TB partitions. I use Carbon Copy Backup to back up my drive. I alternate partitions which allows me to keep 2 copies of the last known-good configurations of my computer. I do a lot of beta testing for Apple and this allows me to be a bit more fearless than if I had only one backup.This drive was easy to work with out of the box. My MacBook Pro can't make use of USB 3, but this drive is backward compatible with USB 2 and performs perfectly fine for my usage. I like the idea that one day, when I upgrade, this drive will give me the maximum speed available via USB.I once had a Seagate drive that went bad after a few years, and I contacted the manufacturer to exercise the warranty. The drive was promptly replaced, without any questions or hassle. It's made me a loyal Seagate customer to know that they stand behind their products.If you're looking for a portable drive with 2TB, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Seagate Expansion Portable External Hard Drive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCV32AQRZD6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILALU9G#wasThisHelpful","R2FCV32AQRZD6P","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These short extension cords are just about ideal for connecting a bulky power supply into a power strip without blocking the adjacent plugs. The only objection I have, and the reason I'm deducting one star, is the LED light in the connector (female) side of the plug. With 3 of these in use, they create a constant glow of three different colors that can prove annoying. They are certainly well manufactured and meet UL specifications. I would have prefered if they didn't have the LEDs, but this short size is hard to find, and I'd rather put up with the light than a longer extension cord.All in all, a well manufactured product that is perfect for its intended use. I just wish the light had been left out, but it's not a show-stopper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PN2AVBH39FMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GLWL0O#wasThisHelpful","R2PN2AVBH39FMY","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this case, but find have three issues with it. First, it's a bit bulky. Second, the cutout in the back for the Apple logo allows dirt and dust to enter the case. Third, the stand has a tendency to revert back into the case and requires the user to disassemble the interior from the case to reset it.The Apple iPhone 6+ is light and thin, and this case makes it feel bulky and large. It certainly does a good job of protecting the phone (except for the hole in the back), but at the cost of the ergonomics of the 6+. In addition, I don't understand the hole. I know that Spigen is not the only manufacturer to do this, but what's the point of a hole that allows dirt and dust to enter into the back of the case? I get it that the idea is to expose the Apple logo so that everyone knows you have an iPhone, but frankly, that's unimportant to me. I'd prefer the protection over the ego boost.The stand is a nice feature, but it can be pretty easily dislodged. That requires you to separate the internal rubber liner from the exterior case and reset the stand. It's easy enough to do, but it's an annoying feature of this case. I also found that with my style of usage, the stand was less useful than I originally thought. You might feel differently depending on how you use your iPhone.One last point: if you own an iHome radio with a charging port on top, you will have to remove the case in order to charge the phone with that port. The bottom of this case, as with most iPhone cases, is too thick to allow the Lightning connector to connect to the phone and requires the phone to be charged with a cable or to remove the case each day to use the top port.I subsequently purchased a Case-Mate clear plastic case (also available on Amazon) and I'm much happier with it. It is less bulky, doesn't have the cutout on the back, and maintains the ergonomics of the phone better than this Spigen case. It, too, has the same problem with the iHome radio charging port.In summary, an OK case that is a bit bulky, has a cutout in the back that compromises the protection of the iPhone, and a troublesome stand that, at least in my usage, was less helpful than I thought when I purchased this case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWEVJR70IDDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JH83DU0#wasThisHelpful","R2EWEVJR70IDDM","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a heavy beard and shaving in the shower is the easiest and most comfortable way for me to shave. Unfortunately, when I travel, I can't do it because I've never come across a hotel or motel that has a shower mirror. After returning from a trip, I decided to check Amazon to see if there was a solution to this, and I came across this product from the Shave Well Company.The mirror is simplicity itself and is perfect for traveling. It comes with a suction cup that is easy to install and easy to remove. The mirror hangs on a hook attached to the suction cup. Simply run the mirror under the shower for a few seconds to get the temperature equalized to the shower, hang it on the hook, and you have a fog-free mirror, perfect for shaving!The mirror is not made of glass so it's safe to pack, and it's very compact and takes up virtually no room in my bag.

"I originally found a pair of these pants at Sears and really liked the fit and feel of them. Dockers, in general, fit me well. To give a bit of perspective, I am 5' 11"" and weigh 170 lbs. Unfortunately, Sears doesn't carry these pants in many colors, even through they're available, but Amazon has them all. Since I knew my size, I just ordered them from Amazon. They arrived, fit perfectly, and are exactly the color I was expecting.Two additional pluses for these pants are that they have a built-in elastic expansion waistband, so that they are extremely comfortable to wear, and the pants are cut high to wear above the waist. The pockets are deep so even my iPhone 6+ fits in them comfortably. The one cargo pocket on the right leg is opened and closed with a zipper and is roomy enough to throw in keys, a folded map, or whatever it is that you can't put in a normal pocket.If you're looking for an inexpensive pair of pants that has an extra cargo-style pocket, these pants are perfect. My only quibble, and it's minor, is that there is no center crease on the leg, so while these pants might be acceptable for the weekend, they probably are too casual for some situations. For me, they're ideal and I now own a few pair and wear them regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1INIVDLV9U7OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AWYNDA#wasThisHelpful","R1INIVDLV9U7OY","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wireless remote control switch is perfect for what I needed. I have a set of decorative lights on the outside of my house that are plugged into a hard to reach outlet in the eave of the house. The same electrical circuit also controls security lights, connected to a timer, which I want to turn on and off, uninterrupted, on a daily basis. In the past we'd use a broom to move a handle mounted next to the outlet to turn these decorative lights on or off. Now, I simply use this remote control to turn the switch on and off. This allows the security lighting to behave normally and these decorative lights to be turned on or off depending on whether we're entertaining or dining in the yard. Perfect! No more broom handle.The switch was ready to use out of the box and needed no programming. I simply plugged the adapter into the outlet in the eave, plugged the decorative lights into it, and voil, I can now turn the lights on and off as needed with the remote with no programming. Since the switch doesn't use infrared, it works right through our hurricane glass slider door, something I found amazing! The manufacturer says it will work from as far as 100 feet, although I haven't personally tested that feature. The battery for the remote is an odd size, but a spare one is provided in the package and replacement batteries are readily available at either Home Depot, Lowes or Amazon.The remote can handle up to three switches which would allow me to expand this system at a later time by purchasing additional adapters. It would not require a separate remote for each one. Very smart. They also make a model that controls up to five switches, although that is way more than I need.There is one downside, albeit minor, that you should think about before buying the Etekcity remote. The switch is oriented so that the the top part of it goes well above the outlet, leaving the bottom outlet available for another electrical plug. That's fine where you have room, like indoors on a switch above a baseboard, but outside where space is limited, or where the outlet is contained in a weatherproof box, will require you to install it upside down so that the second outlet is blocked. In my case that's OK as I'm not using the outlet for anything but these lights, but keep it in mind depending on your application and needs.I'm really delighted with this device. It's one of those things that is well designed, inexpensive, and for me, solved a problem that was driving me crazy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G30S2N1JA5OJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAIIBBW#wasThisHelpful","R1G30S2N1JA5OJ","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered two of these cameras to replace older Panasonic BB series cameras. I was looking for the infrared feature as well as an improved picture. These cameras fit the bill for both price and function.Setup of these cameras is not for the faint of heart. If you don't have some technical ""chops"" or an understanding of networking, you're going to be very frustrated getting these cameras up and running. I'm an IT guy who has a good understanding of technology and it took me awhile to configure them properly. We have Uverse as our Internet provider, and their gateway modem does not support Universal Plug 'n Play (UPnP). That means that all network settings for these cameras have to be entered manually, and as I note later in this review, creates a problem with using Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for accessing the cameras while away from your home or office unless you manually configure your modem or router.Once the cameras are up and running, they work extremely well. The picture quality is excellent and the IR feature in near zero light is nothing short of amazing. In the past, when we were traveling, we'd leave the lights on in our bedroom 24/7 so the camera could ""see."" Now, with the Foscam IR feature set to automatic, the lamps are on timers and the camera still shows a great picture of the room.There are, however, downsides to these cameras that you should consider before you finalize your purchase.1. I'm on a Mac. The only browser the camera will work with (as of this writing) is Safari. I happen to be a Chrome user and there is no plug-in for it, or for Firefox. Without that plug-in you can't configure the camera. You must use Safari. For the Windows users reading this, I believe the only browser you can use is Internet Explorer, but I haven't tested it.2. There is a function called DDNS which allows you to access the cameras outside of your home or office. According to the Status page, these are configured correctly, but I have yet to be able to get them to work. I have been using a third-party application called EvoCam to manage my cameras which I prefer, but DDNS should work, and it does not appear to be easy to configure.3. The lights on the back of the camera cannot be shut off or put into privacy mode. If you use wireless, the status light on the back of the camera will blink, indicating a connection. In addition there is a red power light. In a dark room these two lights are like a beacon. If you put the camera on a surface near a wall, the lights are very visible as they reflect against any surface. This draws attention to the camera and is the opposite of it being a stealth device. The Panasonics I owned prior to these had a setting where I could enter privacy mode and shut down all status lights. That feature is missing on the Foscam camera and imho is sorely needed. (Hey, intruder, I'm over here recording you!) If you use an SD card in the camera for recording, an intruder would take the camera and smash it and you'd have no idea who had entered your home or office. Since I use third-party software to manage and record my cameras, it's not an issue for me as I'd have a picture of the person approaching and disconnecting the camera. Nonetheless, these lights should be able to be turned off once the camera is configured.So, all-in-all, a very high quality security camera for the price. It needs broader compatibility with other popular browsers, a more robust DDNS function, and a way to shut off the status lights on the device. Hey, the devil's in the details!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOFZALZSV8OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3KWZW8#wasThisHelpful","R2SOFZALZSV8OG","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a simple timer to control the bedroom lamps when we're traveling. These fit the bill functionally and price wise. I've read that other reviewers think the setup is complicated and I have to disagree. You do need to read and follow the enclosed directions, but they are hardly hard or confusing. You start by setting the time of day and then the time you'd like the lamp or appliance to go on and off. You can have up to two cycles, e.g., on at two different times of the day, then off at two different times. You can also ignore the second cycle and simply have one on/off cycle per day. The timers can be set to Auto (they turn the device on and off per your settings), On (which simply enables the outlet) or Off (which disables the outlet.)I also like that they're silent! I've tried mechanical timers and eventually you start hearing the little motor that turns the timer wheel. In a dark, quiet room, that's like a dripping faucet. These timers are completely electronic and hence silent.My only criticism, and hence one less star, is that it isn't easy to override these timers without unplugging them and turning the ""Auto"" feature to permanently off or on. In addition, there is no backlighting to make seeing these displays easier.Looking at their functionality alone, if you're looking for an inexpensive timer to turn a lamp or other appliance on and off once or twice a day, the Woods timers are an excellent idea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29R37G8J74XCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WQIDHY#wasThisHelpful","R29R37G8J74XCO","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is an excellent little handheld vacuum cleaner. It seems to have enough power to clean crumbs and other minor debris off our tile floor and area carpets using the floor attachment. I wouldn't recommend this as a replacement for a large, powerful vacuum cleaner, but for small jobs and quick clean-ups, it does the job.I deducted one star as storing the vacuum cleaner with the floor stick requires two locations. In other words, you can't charge the vacuum and have the floor stick attached. You'll need to detach it, store it someplace, and then charge the vacuum.Emptying the dust bin is straight forward, but like most units, you should do it over a garbage can so it doesn't spill onto the floor. Washing and replacing the filter is straightforward and doesn't need to be done too often.Lastly, note that this isn't a wet vacuum. It shouldn't be used for spills or any other liquids. For that you'll still need a shop vacuum.All in all a good appliance for quick clean-ups but charging the vacuum with the floor stick attached can't be done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5BICSN2S5LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JILGZOC#wasThisHelpful","RO5BICSN2S5LG","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this camera for my wife for a recent extended trip to Europe. She absolutely loved it. This is much more than just a simple point-and-shoot camera. It has the ability to go completely automatic or manual, and the presets for scenes or portraits are both handy and well programmed. 20.4 megapixels is a bit of overkill, but it gives you an idea of just how good the pictures are that this camera takes.I was particularly impressed with its performance in low light. Most of the time she kept the flash off and got stunning pictures of the interiors of things that would have been impossible with a less versatile camera.I deducted one star for ergonomics. The programming dial is very easy to turn inadvertently while using the camera which will change the mode of the camera without the user realizing they've done so. In addition, there is a multiple shot feature with the HX50V that is a bit difficult to use. My wife often found herself taking three or four shots of a scene instead of one, and it was because the close proximity of the controls on the back of the camera allow for this setting to be engaged without realizing it. Once she was aware of what she was doing, and made sure her hands were placed properly, she had much better luck with this feature.While you can use this camera out of the box, you'll need to read the manual if you intend to take advantage of many of the camera's advanced features. If you take the time to do so, you'll be amazed at what is packed into this small marvel!Battery time is good. Without using the flash, my wife routinely could take 100-200 pictures a day and only needed to charge the battery every other day. I would assume that using the flash would diminish the battery life, but as I said earlier, almost every picture she took was without the flash.So, in summary, a terrific camera that is packed with features and does extremely well in low light. The controls are a bit confusing, but a short time with the manual will yield amazing results!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15QNZJM2878IK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDIK48U#wasThisHelpful","R15QNZJM2878IK","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's good news and bad news with the Karcher K 5.65. Starting with the good: this unit is a great pressure washer for around the home. Our primary use is cleaning pavement and walkways of mold. We live in S. Florida and mold is a way of life here and needs to be periodically cleaned. This pressure washer is easy to use and, at 2000 psi, does a great job of removing the mold. We used it for over 6 hours cleaning up our sidewalk, driveway and backyard patio. It never quit, overheated, or stopped cleaning. That alone makes it a dependable and worthy unit for your purchasing attention. The power cord and hoses are sufficiently long that we never had to use an extension cord for either power or the handle. Your needs may dictate otherwise, but for our needs on a 1/4 plot of land, the hose and cords were of sufficient length. We also have several choices for outdoor outlets, which definitely figures in to my assessment.The bad news is that many of the outside parts of this washer, like the wheels, simply don't work as designed. I tried installing the wheel assemblies more than once, and could never get the wheels to turn when the machine was erect and being pulled by the handle. I called Karcher's warranty service, and they very kindly sent me a new set of wheels. When they arrived and were installed, it was the same problem. It is a mystery how professional engineers can go to college, study, get a degree and finally come to work for Karcher and still design a set of wheels that don't turn when the power washer is moved. Surely someone in QA noticed this before the machine was released to manufacturing. Oh well, be prepared that the best you'll get is dragging this unit from one location to the other with the wheels frozen in place.I'd also like to comment that the assembly instructions are not for the faint of heart. I'm sure if you've put these machines together in the past that this would be a piece of cake, but for two adults who are good with tools, this was a much longer project than it needed to be. There is a link to a Karcher website in the instructions to get more detail on assembly, but the link has long been disabled and now takes you to a non-relevant page on their site.In summary, I'm very pleased with the way this machine cleans and it's usability. What I'm not pleased about is that this machine sets the invention of the wheel back 5,000 years. You'd be better off buying this from a small hardware store that assembles it for you. This isn't Amazon's fault, it's Karcher's. If you're comfortable futzing with this power washer through the assembly process, you'll be rewarded with a unit that works very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VMN8GPX9Y9M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFSUL9K#wasThisHelpful","R2VMN8GPX9Y9M4","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm writing this review while I'm in Italy using the adapters. They are perfect for converting American type plugs for use with the Italian electrical system. Each adapter can handle two plugs, but only one with a grounding pin. For me this works fine as the plug for my MacBook Pro is a three-pin plug and the charger for my iPhone doesn't require a ground.I'd offer only one small piece of advice. First, and most important, these adapters do not convert 220v to 110v. Some appliances will not work correctly at 220v, like the hair clipper I brought along. Most computer and phone adapters will automatically convert 110v to 220v and visa versa, so no worry charging your electronics, or at least Apple products.The second thing is that these adapters require a 3-prong Italian plug, which is what you'll find most of the time. Occasionally you'll come across a two-prong plug (no ground) and these adapters won't fit.If you need a Type L adapter, these are a great product at a great price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UI02XK17X53O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JCVGT0#wasThisHelpful","R2UI02XK17X53O","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, a disclaimer that while I'm an avid Amazon customer, I purchased this safe on sale at Costco where it was significantly less expensive than on-line.The only reason I deducted one star is that the safe isn't fireproof, but neither does Sentry claim it is. Other than that, I find it almost exactly like the safes you find in a hotel room. I used the predrilled holes for mounting this safe so it can't be easily carted off. Setting a numerical combination is straightforward, but needs to be reset every time you open the safe. There is no way to enter the combination permanently. There is also the option to use a credit or debit cardin fact any card with a magnetic stripein place of the 4-digit security code. It is equally easy to configure.I'm aware that this is not one of those safes that is 100% unbeatable for thieves, but I do believe that this would slow them down considerably, especially since the safe is permanently mounted. The room where it lives is protected by a security camera, so all-in-all, I feel pretty good regarding the security it offers.It is big enough to easily hold my 15"" MacBook Pro and has a piece of fabric to protect it from the steel bottom of the safe. For my money and use, this safe fit the bill perfectly. As I said earlier, the one thing it isn't is fireproof, and the front door of the safe is classified as tamper resistant, not tamper-proof. To me that means that if the safe was somehow stolen, a determined thief would be able to use a crowbar to eventually gain access to it. Since I'm not leaving anything irreplaceable in it, I'm perfectly OK with those limitations. A visit to the SentrySafe website will show you that they have an extensive line of safes, so each user should consider their needs and buy accordingly. In my case, I knew what I was getting, especially since I'd seen this class of safes in just about every hotel room where I've stayed.I would also recommend this model as a gun safe. If you use your credit or debit card as the security for opening the door, then go to work or leave the house with that card, no one else (your kids) will be able to open the door without the card. This safe would easily hold a few handguns.The safe comes with two override keys and an external battery back which would be used in the event that the 4 batteries that power the door should die. The manual for this safe is, thoughtfully, provided on-line at the Sentry website.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UV7IF6EYHZGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006H6KTWA#wasThisHelpful","R3UV7IF6EYHZGM","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Revos. I think they hands down make the best sunglasses. I purchased my first pair 10 years ago in Los Angeles. The salesperson told me that the graphite color is what cinematographers choose because they are so true to natural colors. I bought that pair and many others since, and indeed they have amazing color clarity and fidelity.I usually go to a place like Sunglass Hut because Revo's are not carried everywhere. When I needed a new pair (I lost my old ones while hawking for golf balls) I decided to check Amazon, and was delighted that they had such a large selection of Revo's. This pair was sold by an Amazon partner, but they were offered with free shipping, even though they weren't eligible for Prime, and arrived two days earlier than originally projected. The price was on a par with a retail shop, but no tax and free shipping clinched the deal!I have excellent eyesight (20-20) so I'm conscious of when my vision is distorted by a cheap pair of sunglasses. The color fidelity on the lens of the Revo Descend is as good as I've ever experienced, and it's polarized to boot! It is frameless so they are extremely lightweight on your face. I live in South Florida where the sun is extremely strong, and these glasses take away the squint, even in the brightest conditions, like the beach. They are very comfortable to wear, with or without a cap. (With a cap, the sidepiece goes on the outside of the hat.)I've tried Maui Jim and Ray Ban, but for me, nothing compares to Revo when you really want a great pair of polarized sunglasses that offer superb color fidelity. I understand that Revo has recently been purchased by Oakley, and I hope they don't decide to change the recipe. Revo's are really the Mercedes of sunglasses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NM799POC32ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBSPN48#wasThisHelpful","R3NM799POC32ZA","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid that doesn't have a built-in way to access Siri on my iPhone 5. This product from Mobile Home is an excellent way to keep your phone in your pocket and still be able to access Siri when your phone is connected via Bluetooth. It works exactly as if you were using the home button on your phone except you use the built-in speakers and microphone in your car to communicate with this device.So why not 5 stars? First, the setup described in the accompanying brochure contradicts what I experienced with the device itself. When pairing the device, the instructions say to expect a green LED to come on to indicate pairing mode. Instead, the lights flash yellow and red which, by the usual association with these colors, insinuates you've done something terribly wrong.  It took me a few minutes to realize that my unit, for whatever reason, left the factory with different color LEDs.My second issue is that it takes two taps on the device the each time you use it. The first is to wake up the Bluetooth connection and the second engages Siri. After the first usage, it remains paired for awhile, then disconnects. I understand that the purpose of this is to conserve battery power (the manufacturer supplies a second battery with the device) but it is distracting during usage, especially when driving.Third, and the least troublesome, is that the manual is not available as a PDF on their website. I like to get rid of packaging and documentation and keep the instructions electronically. I've done this from minor items to major appliances. Just about everyone has their documentation on their website ready for download, but not Mobile Home.In summary, very good device for being able to access Siri while your iPhone is safely tucked away in your pocket. Just ignore some of the documentation and you'll be on your way to using it successfully.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33KBWVQM7LKUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WRNSF6#wasThisHelpful","R33KBWVQM7LKUM","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an older ex-runner who is now an avid walker in Florida. I go out in the morning for about 4 miles. In South Florida, the summer heat can be upwards of 85-90 with 70-85% humidity, so it's very important to stay hydrated. I really hate carrying a water bottle or having it hang from my waistband. I'd heard about Camelbak line of water carriers and thought I'd give one a try.The hydration system works as advertised and keeps the temperature of the water nice and cold. Unfortunately the fit of the Hydropak seems to be less than ideal, at least for me. I believe that the model I purchased, the Hydropak, has been discontinued and maybe this problem is solved in newer models. Unfortunately the Camelbak I now own isn't all that comfortable to wear, making it less than ideal to use during my long walks.I chose the Camelbak Hydropak based on price and water capacity. The Hydropak holds 1.5 litres of liquid, more than enough for my 1 hour walk. It's easy to fill with ice water from the refrigerator and it keeps it nice and cold. The Hydropak is easy to drink from using the built-in straw. When I'm finished with my walk, I simply empty any remaining water and let it air dry for the next day. If the bladder needs cleaning, it's easily removed and reinstalled.The gripe I have with the Hydropak is with the fit and location of the shoulder straps and adjustment clips. The straps have plastic adjusters to customize the fit, just like regular backpacks. These adjustment clips, unlike regular backpacks, are mounted just below the armpit. With the Camelbak on and adjusted, the buckles lie right on the side of my rib cage and rub against my arms during the normal motion of walking. It's really annoying and uncomfortable.This might be less annoying if I were wearing a traditional t-shirt, but in the summer, because of the heat and humidity, I wear a sleeveless performance shirt and the adjustment clips rub directly against the inside of my arms.It would definitely help if there was a sternum strap. That would allow the adjustment clips to be pulled slightly forward and away from where my arm brushes against my rib cage. As it is now, I am constantly aware of the buckles as my arms swing back and forth during the normal motion of walking.Another minor quibble is that the Camelbak ships with no instructions. I had no idea what the open or closed position was of the yellow shutoff valve on the mouthpiece. In fact, I had no idea it was a shutoff valve. It also took some experimenting to see how the bladder came out of the carrier so that it could be cleaned and/or dried. An additional tag on the bag with this information would have been a big help, but I guess the manufacturer feels that it is so obvious and simple that no instructions are needed. I'm pretty technically savvy and can usually figure out how things work, so spending some time with the Hydropak and a search or two on Google got me filled in on the basics. It would have been so-o simple for Camelbak to include this information, especially about the shutoff valve and bladder, that I'm a bit mystified as to why Camelbak doesn't do it.My 2 of advice is if you decide to purchase the Hydropak, try it on first, without filling it with liquid, to confirm the comfort of the fit and the location of the adjustment straps and buckles. If you have the same problem I have, you'll be able to return it to Amazon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TLEXDPHN6VG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPGSIAE#wasThisHelpful","R2TLEXDPHN6VG7","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this golf watch as a birthday gift and while I enjoy using it on the golf course, not so much with my computer.I have yet to be able to sync this GPS with Garmin Connect. It always fails. Worse, the watch will not work with Safari or Chrome when plugged into your computer. The only browser I've found that works with it is Firefox. Absolutely ridiculous considering Garmin has created custom software specifically for the Mac. For Garmin Connect to then not work with Safari is beyond stupid.Another problem with the software is that it will not start automatically when the watch is connected to my laptop, even though the checkbox for this function is checked. In other words, this software is actually pretty bad.If you're looking for a convenient GPS solely to measure distance for your golf shots, the S4 isn't a bad choice, but don't expect anything to work with either the Garmin Connect software or your browser, especially if you're a Mac user.I also have to comment on viewing your golf score. The only way to do it is to connect the watch, then look for scorecard.html in Finder. The Garmin S4 looks like a drive to the operating system, and the scorecard is in the root.Forget double-clicking to open it. You need either Firefox or IE to view this information. Again, absolutely ridiculous.The watch itself is touch sensitive, but that doesn't mean that every gesture actually works. When you start the watch and try and get to the menu from the watch in order to reach the Start Round menu you're given a graphic that says to swipe your finger to the left on the surface of the phone. Good luck with that. It takes a minimum of 4-5 swipes (if you're lucky) to allow you to get to the Start Round menu. There's also no way to shut that feature off. Why if heavens name would I want the watch locked from the time screen to the golf menu??!!If you are not a techie or comfortable with technology, pass this item by. You'll just be frustrated, especially after spending all of that money on this device. I've owned a few Garmin devices and they always seem to get both the user interface and accompanying software wrong. There are better golf GPS products out there and for less money. Buy this item at your own peril!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VGTHQPT8XC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNK8TWS#wasThisHelpful","R17VGTHQPT8XC9","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already had one WeMo switch to control a lamp in our living room. I wanted another one that I could use with our Bona Vita coffee maker that I could control with my iPhone. The WeMo Insight switch was on sale at Amazon and is significantly smaller than the original one I already owned. I decided to get one.Since I don't get up each morning at the same time I don't want the coffee to start when I'm still sleeping. With the WeMo Insight switch, I set up the coffee the night before, turn the coffee maker to the ""on"" position and then when I get up, launch the WeMo app on my iPhone to turn the WeMo on. Coffee starts brewing and by the time I get to the kitchen, it is fresh and piping hot!I have the switch programmed to shut itself off at 3:00 PM so that if I want an additional cup of coffee during the day the coffee maker will work without having to manually engage the switch. I also have it programmed to turn ""on"" on Fridays only at a specific time since that one day I volunteer at a local park and know when I have to get up.I'm a fan of these devices, but they do have some problems that Belkin needs to work on. Occasionally, in order for the app to work on my phone, I need to ""kill"" the app and relaunch it. I have a couple wireless routers in the house, all on the same network, but the Belkin seems to get confused as it passes from one to the other. Once it's found the switches, it works perfectly.The big difference between the original Belkin WeMo switch and the WeMo Insight is size, with the Insight being significantly smaller. This works much better in an area where the switch is visible, in this case on my kitchen counter. It's also well designed to allow the use of the second plug in an outlet if the Insight is plugged into the bottom outlet.The Insight also has the ability to give you a lot of details about how much power you're using with whatever device you're controlling. In fairness, I don't use that feature, but if you're powering a device where you need that information, the Insight has a detailed report. You can see what it looks like on Belkin's website.These Belkin switches are a bit pricey, but really do the job, day in and day out. I've had the two mine for some time, and they're very reliable. You can easily set a device to come on or turn off at a specific day, at a specific time, at sunrise or sunset, or manually. The rule is stored in the device which remembers it even during a power outage or it the device is unplugged. You can also trigger these devices from outside your home. When properly set up, you can control them on your phone from anywhere.With the WeMo Insight, you can also see how much electricity you're using on the outlet where it's connected and potentially program whatever device you're controlling to lower usage and hence cost. This isn't a feature I'm using, but if you need or want that information, the Insight gives very detailed usage stats.I'd judge that the initial setup to be pretty straight-forward. You will need to know your wireless router's name and password. Setup joins the switch to your wireless network in order for you to control it. In my case, I use WPA2 Personal and had no problems getting the switches to function. Like most devices, there is a reset switch in case you need to move them to a new network. You then create rules for the switch which dictate how it will function. To do this, you need a free phone app that is available for both iPhones and Android phones.I really like this product and find it much more functional than just putting a timer on an electrical outlet. They're a  bit pricey but appear to be very durable. I've owned my original WeMo switch for three years and it hasn't hiccuped yet. Ive owned the Insight for about nine months, and it, too, has been reliable.I think of these as more than just a gadget. If you're looking to take control of an appliance or lamp or what-have-you, this is the product to consider.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CMHZTFZ17OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOEDJ9W#wasThisHelpful","R10CMHZTFZ17OP","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did a job on my shoulder that requires physical therapy.

My only gripe is a bit picayune. They only come in pink, which makes me feel like a bit of a wimp when I use them. On the other hand, I also ordered two and three pound weights which came in purple and green respectively. I think pink is a standard color for one pound weights as my physical therapists has these from a different company and they, too, are the same color as mine.If you need a small weight for exercise or PT, definitely put the Da Vinci Neoprene Dumbbells on your short list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZELFH8DVFGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BERBYCG#wasThisHelpful","R1OZELFH8DVFGS","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first got into using a slant board for this stretch when I went to physical therapy after back surgery. I had always done this lower leg stretch after running with both my feet planted level on the ground. My PT therapist had a slant board, and so I understood just how effective it can be to use a slant board instead of what I had been doing. I've wanted to buy one of these, but the price of the wooden ones is just too much money for me.I came across this item while browsing Amazon and decided that the price was right and that I'd give it a try. In short, this is a perfect slant board for a lower leg stretch. Yes, it's only a black foam slab cut on a bias, but it supports my body just fine and doesn't break or become misshapen. I think this product will be very durable and I can't imagine it not lasting for at least a few years, if not longer.While you get two slant boards with this product, I'm only using one. The picture shows this product to be a bit narrower than it is in reality. I position the slant board about 2 feet away from the wall, put both feet on it, and then lean forward, using the wall as support. You can immediately feel the stretch in your lower leg. I do three sets of 30 seconds each.The product stores easily and is as light as a feather. If you're a runner or need physical therapy that includes this stretch, consider this product. This is one of those times when less expensive is actually better! I'm not sure how this would hold up to day-in and day-out use in a commercial setting like a physical therapist's office, but for an individual or family, this is an excellent  product that does the job at a very affordable price.There are no instructions that come with it, and I'm not aware of any other use for it other than this stretch. If you live in a small apartment, storage might be an issue you need to think about. If, however, you have the room to put it away after each use, it is ideal for its purpose.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXLSHAFBOYQBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C9IMVQ#wasThisHelpful","RXLSHAFBOYQBR","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has trouble hearing dialog on the TV clearly. Our purpose with this purchase was to replace a set of TV Ears that were uncomfortable for her to wear and that required infrared to work. This Sennheiser headset fills this purpose beyond our expectations!Without going into a lot of technical mumbo jumbo, this device is easy to set up and sounds great. Even better, it works independently of the TV sound. I can turn the volume up or down on the TV without affecting the volume in the headphones. They are lightweight, comfortable to wear, sound great and are easy to use.This headphone uses rechargeable batteries located in each earpiece. (The batteries are provided in the box.) The ear pad turns counterclockwise to remove it and reveal the battery location. When they stop being functional, which based on my experience with rechargeable batteries will be a very long time, they can be easily and inexpensively replaced.The other thing I really appreciate is that these headphones use a technology called Kleer, which at the time of purchase I was unfamiliar with. They do not use or need infrared. That means they work perfectly in our entertainment center, even with the glass door closed! That's a major improvement over TV Ears.I can't speak to how the sound compares to, say, Beats, but for our purpose, which was to allow my wife to listen to the TV clearly, they score 100%.

"I ordered this item because we're putting in new countertops and wanted to spruce up the kitchen a bit. We only have 18 inches of wall space near the cutting board, and the 18 inch magnetic knife bars are actually longer. The length refers to the usable space, not the total space necessary to mount the device.I chose the 15 inch MIU based on the excellent reviews, and they werent wrong. First, it was easy to mount on the wall. You simply remove the two black plastic plugs on the ends, screw the device onto the wall, and reinsert the plugs. While the MIU comes with two screws and plastic wall anchors, in my case the knife bar mounting holes were directly over studs, so I discarded their hardware and used two wood screws instead. I used a small carpenters level to make sure the bar was straight, but you could use the level app for an iPhone to do the same thing.I have 8 knives ""stuck"" to the MIU. One 10 inch chefs knife, one 8 inch chefs knife, 4 paring knives, 1 utility knife and a 12 inch serrated bread knife. They're on there solidly and easily detachable when needed. The magnet is more than sufficient to hold all of these knives, and the stainless steel fits in perfectly with our appliances.It's an excellent value for the price and if you can't accommodate a larger knife bar, the MIU will hold an awful lot of knives very solidly. I'd definitely make this purchase again if I needed to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDJB17V5GLNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006IVY7E#wasThisHelpful","R3NDJB17V5GLNI","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased a SanDisk 480GB SSD for my 2009 iMac while the drive was on sale at Amazon. I installed it using an optical drive bay adapter which leaves me with both the original hard drive and my new SSD. That left me with the original (and still perfectly functional) optical drive but no way to use it.I searched Amazon and found this very reasonably priced external drive enclosure for a 12.7mm optical drive, exactly what I had taken out of my iMac. Drives of a similar ilk were almost twice as much on other websites. It arrived today and it is exactly what I had hoped it would be. The drive installed easily with only a small Phillips screwdriver required to take off the the back panel. The optical drive simply slides into the enclosure's plastic insert and the rear panel is then reinstalled. The drive connects to a USB port on my computer and requires no other external power.My only criticism, and hence the 4 start rating, is that my drive is a slot drive, not a drawer type that would have its own front bezel. Without the bezel, the enclosure is very unfinished looking. It's too bad that the manufacturer didn't provide a simple piece of plastic that users of slot drives could use to cosmetically make the drive more attractive, giving it a more finished look.Having gotten that off my chest, the enclosure is solid brushed aluminum finished in black and looks and feels great. It is sold with a ""Y"" USB 2 connector. In my case, I plugged the enclosure directly into an open port on my iMac using only one of the USB plugs and had sufficient power. It you find you need more juice, you use the second USB connector to supply more power.There are no additional drivers needed for a Mac, so it is truly plug-and-play. Now I have my original drive, my new SSD drive and an external enclosure for the original optical drive. I use the optical drive so rarely that I'm perfectly happy to have it as a USB external device.If you have a drawer-based optical drive you're planning on using with this enclosure, consider my review to be 5 stars. If you own a Mac and/or are using a slot-based drive, keep in mind that the front of this enclosure will look quite unfinished, although the drive will function perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T5UGHI62FXQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GSCS2G#wasThisHelpful","R1T5UGHI62FXQS","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Bonavita BV1800TH to replace a Cuisinart DCC 1400 thermal coffee maker that began to spill coffee all over my kitchen counter. After a couple of days using the Bonavita, I'm very pleased. It's a simple coffee maker that doesn't have any bells or whistles, but makes a truly excellent cup of coffee.I should set the tone of this review by stating that I love good coffee, but wouldn't describe myself as a purist like some of the other reviewers. I buy House Blend from Costco most of the time, and occasionally will treat myself to Sumatran coffee if it's available at a good price. I grind the coffee in batches using a Cuisinart burr grinder and keep it in an airtight jar for a couple days until I need to grind another small batch. I only drink coffee in the morning, or make coffee after a dinner party.The design of this German coffee maker couldn't be simpler. You put coffee into the v-shaped cone, put it over the pot, fill the reservoir with water and hit the on switch. Five minutes later you have very hot, perfectly brewed coffee. There is no pause capability. There's also no timer for setting up the coffee the night before (more on a workaround further on in this review), and you need to manually replace the brew cone with the thermal cover in order to serve the coffee.For me, this last feature is an advantage. The Cuisinart thermal pot's cover stays in place during the brew, and coffee drips from the brew cone, through the cover and into the pot. When it works, it's fine, but over time the cover gets clogged with residue and coffee can't flow into the pot quickly enough. That causes it to flow off the cover, onto the kitchen counter, and make a complete mess. Meh!The Bonavita brew cone is simplicity itself. It is made of thicker plastic than the Cuisinart brew cone and simply holds a filter (gold or paper) filed with coffee which it then let's flow out a hole in the bottom into the pot. The filter cone sits directly on top of the thermal carafe and coffee flows directly into it. Since the hole in the brew cone is easily cleaned, the problem of overflowing onto the counter is almost impossible. The one exception I could envision would be if you use too fine a grind and the coffee backs up in the cone. Otherwise, this is foolproof.One of the big claims of the Bonavita is that it uses the correct temperature to brew coffee. I can attest that the coffee is piping hot-hotter than the Cuisinart-and extracts all of the flavor from the coffee. It's really delicious. The brew cone serves as the top to the coffee maker until you replace it with the thermal top. In my limited use, the coffee stays very hot this way for 5-10 minutes until I get to the pot to put on the top. I disagree with some reviewers who say this ""...lets the coffee get cold."" That's simply not true. If you left it that way for an extended period of time, maybe so, but not if you let the Bonavita finish brewing and then put the top on in a reasonable amount of time, reasonable being defined as 10 minutes.The Bonavita has a thermal container which is glass lined as opposed to the Cuisinart thermal container which is all metal. Bonavita includes a ""special brush"" with the coffeemaker in order to clean it and avoid scratches. The brew cone is dishwasher safe, but not the thermal container. To avoid any residual taste of soap in my coffee, I usually just rinse out the pot, rarely cleaning it with soap and water . I don't care if the inside of the thermal container gets stained, but it you clean yours every day, know that you need to use a very soft brush, like the one that's included with the coffee maker, to avoid scratching it. You should also handle this carafe a bit more gently than the Cuisinart as I think the glass could be more prone to breakage.The Bonavita has a mechanical on-off switch, as opposed to the toggle switch used on Cuisinarts. The switch returns itself to the off position automatically after 15 minutes, or manually anytime you want to switch the unit off. That gave me an idea of how to work around the problem of the lack of a timer on this model. (To avoid heart palpitations, coffee purists can stop reading my review at this point.)I like coffee as soon as I hit the kitchen in the morning. Many coffeemakers have a timer for setting up coffee the night before and having the appliance come on at a specified time. I often use this feature, especially if I have an early morning. It was the one feature the Bonavita didn't have that gave me pause about buying it. When it arrived and I realized it had a mechanical switch, I had an epiphany on how to add this feature! I have an unused Belkin WeMo switch that turns an outlet on and off. This switch comes with an iPhone app that controls the switch over a wireless network. I can manually turn the outlet on and off from my phone, or program the WeMo as a traditional timer to turn the outlet on or off at a specific time. I plugged the WeMo into the outlet near the coffeemaker, and then the coffeepot into the WeMo. Now, I prepare the coffeemaker the night before and put the Bonavita power switch in the on position with the WeMo off. When I get up, I use the app to turn on the WeMo and coffee is ready 5 minutes later. When I arrive in the kitchen, I replace the brew cone with the thermal cover and I'm ready for my coffee. Using this method means that I can turn the coffee machine on from the bedroom when I awake. If I sleep in one day, the coffee doesn't brew at a specific time and get cold. Instead, I set the brew in motion only when I wake up. This satisfies both my need for hot, delicious coffee and my inner geek! Of course, I can always set the WeMo to act as a timer it I'm getting up at a specific time and want my coffee brewed and ready. The mechanical switch on the Bonavita is the enabling feature here, and I've turned the lack of a self-timer on the coffeemaker into an asset by taking advantage of it.I get that not everyone has an unused WeMo switch, but a simple, inexpensive electronic switch timer will also serve to automate turning the Bonavita on and off if that's a feature you need. These are readily available on Amazon and very inexpensive.Last to discuss is the price. This isn't an inexpensive coffeemaker and it does lack some basic features that many people will expect. It's big claim-to-fame is that it has a 1400 watt heating element that insures the coffee is brewed at the correct temperature, just below the boiling point of water, which allows it to extract all of the flavor from your coffee. If you use Maxwell House or Folgers, pass this model by as it's total overkill for that grade of coffee. If, however, you use good coffee beans and grind them yourself, then consider this an investment in a quality coffeemaker. There's a two-year warranty on it, much better than Cuisinart, Black and Decker or the other popular brands, so I expect it to be durable. I certainly expect it not to turn my kitchen counter into a complete mess as the Cuisinart did on a regular basis. Consumer Reports rates this model very low, but they're comparing price versus features with other mass market brewers. IMHO, this coffeemaker is a good investment, lacking only a self-timer, a limitation that can be easily remedied if it's a requirement.My requirement was simple. I want great coffee in a reliable brewer without making me clean up a mess. For me, the Bonavita Thermal Coffeemaker fits the bill. I'm delighted with my purchase and look forward to years of using this appliance. I'll be sure to report back if that ends up not being the case!UPDATE Saturday, January 24, 2015: I wanted to update everyone on the excellent customer service of this company. The automatic Off-On switch suddenly started to misbehave on my Bonavita. It worked just fine manually, but when the 15 minute period came for it to shut off automatically, I'd just hear it click, as if it couldn't move the switch. I reported it to Bonavita, and within a week had a brand new coffeemaker, with no fuss. Thank you Bonavita for standing behind your product. I still love this coffeemaker and this is just one more reason I'd recommend it to anyone serious about brewing coffee!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2349X1RL0KH5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005YQZNO8#wasThisHelpful","R2349X1RL0KH5Q","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keep one in the car and you'll always have a clean interior. These are great, lintless polishing cloths and are perfect for windows, interior surfaces, glass tops and anything where you'd normally use a paper towel. They don't scratch or leave any residue or lint behind because they're microfiber. They wash perfectly and are ready for use all over again. I found these on sale at Amazon during a flash sale and they are a great value and really cut down on our use of paper towels.I also sell a lot of used electronics and other equipment on Ebay. These cloths are perfect for cleaning up an item before sale. They won't scratch, and they make things look spotless. I really think these cleaning cloths are far better than rags, and last a very long time. They can stain over time, but the problem is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the utility of the cloth at all.Highly recommended, especially when they're on sale!

"I wanted to use these gloves when handling hot food and still have the use of my fingers, as when cutting a hot chicken. My problem is that they get very slippery making it difficult to hold food and try and cut or pare it. A bit of chicken grease on these gloves will make a chicken hard to cut, certainly with a paring knife. Grabbing a leg or thigh off a well-cooked chicken and trying to pull it off the body is hard because the gloves are so slippery.On the other hand, they certainly work for picking up food off the BBQ, like a chicken, pork butt or brisket, and they're long enough that you won't burn your wrists over the fire.They aren't very tactile, so I'm not sure there's an advantage to having fingers rather than a traditional mitt design. This is thick rubber, so you don't really get any feedback as you would with a thinner glove, and because the glove is very loose fitting, I found  it a bit hard to use if you're handling food.Clean-up is the same as washing your hands, which I think is a good thing. Simply put some hand soap on them, and ""wash your hands"" and the gloves are clean and ready for the next use.In summary, I like 'em, but after using them a couple times, wouldn't buy them again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5EY3XKKU1OGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007ZGURK#wasThisHelpful","R5EY3XKKU1OGD","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When our original Toto toilet seat needed replacing, I first purchased another brand from Home Depot. It fit the toilet, but with the lid down, it protruded slightly from the edge of the toilet. In other words, the cover was designed to enclose the seat, not just cover it.  Unfortunately, because clearance is tight in our powder room, the door would skim against the toilet seat, driving my wife crazy.The Toto seat's cover does not protrude over the seat, and therefore fits the space perfectly. The cover sits on top of the toilet seat, and doesn't protrude over it. Mechanically, it operates exactly as expected: flipping the seat down from the up position allows it to lower slowly and noiselessly. The color match was perfect to the porcelain color of the Toto itself.If you're looking for an exact replacement for a Toto oblong toilet seat, this one is worth the money. I would add that if you have the room, as in a full bathroom, the Home Depot solution would be fine, and at a significantly lower price. If, however, space is an issue, as it was with me, then the Toto replacement toilet seat is the way to go because the seat and cover are the same size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VNBAON3LML50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DEJ5SA#wasThisHelpful","R1VNBAON3LML50","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I replaced an inefficient, all-aluminum commercial stock pot with this Winware stainless steel cooker and the difference is night and day. I first came across this series of pots at a restaurant supply chain and was very impressed. The price on Amazon was better than what I saw in the store, plus no tax and free 2-day shipping as a Prime customer.This pot heats quickly and evenly, then retains heat with its thick, clad aluminum bottom. I was able to keep my burner on low for the three hours I needed to simmer my cook, and the heat was distributed evenly, with a uniform low bubble. The pot stayed flat against the cooktop and didn't warp or wobble with heat. This was such an improvement over what I'd been using that I knew after the first time I used it that I'd have this pot for a very long time! This is excellent cookware, and the clad bottom goes a long way to maintaining an even heat for the type of cooking you'd expect to do in a stockpot.The pot is shaped slightly different than a traditional stock pot in that it's a bit squatter. For me, this wasn't a problem as it fit perfectly on my large KitchenAid stovetop burner. I also tried it on my DSC two-burner outdoor stove and the flame covered the bottom perfectly. For me, the shape is ideal.Clean-up was easy and typical of good stainless steel. If you burn something on, you'll need to soak the pot for awhile, but all-in-all, it cleaned up exactly as I expected.I wanted to address the issue some have raised about the handles. There is NO way those handles are going to come off or loosen. This criticism is picayune. I agree that they're spot welded rather than riveted, but IMHO, it's just fine. There are actually two big advantages to this method. First, it leaves the inside surface of the pot completely smooth, with no protruding rivets where the handles attach. It makes clean-up that much easier as food and debris can't get trapped around the rivets. The second is that the handles are cool to the touch, even when the pot is hot. This was true of both the lid and the pot, and I found that I could lift the pot from the stove to the counter without mitts. Lastly, I'm not a metallurgist, but it's my understanding that a weld is actually stronger than the original metal, hence my opinion that these handles are just fine and will most likely outlast me.In summary, I think this 8-quart stockpot is an excellent value, will last a long time, cooks great, and is a good value. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who likes to cook. I'd even consider giving it as a wedding gift! It's a fine piece of cookware, whether you're making chicken stock or chili!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3QMF3MHBXCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ASCU7W#wasThisHelpful","RS3QMF3MHBXCS","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned a few variations of Bluetooth headsets that I've used while exercising, including the Motorola S-9 and S-10 and the Jaybird Freedoms. The new LG Tone 700 may look a bit strange, but it quickly became my favorite Bluetooth headset for exercise and general use.The 700 fits around your neck, and is light enough that you really don't know you're wearing them. The only caveat I'd add regarding comfort is that if you're wearing a collarless shirt, like a tee shirt when running, you will feel the headset's thin band on the back of your neck. This doesn't bother me since the Jaybirds have a wire connecting the two earbuds that also rides the back of our neck, and the Motorola headsets have a heavy, think band that goes back and over your ears. When evaluating comfort, also keep in mind that a regular wired headset or earbuds have a wire that's flapping around. On balance, the LG headset is really the most comfortable and least noticeable of those I've tried.Surprisingly, the LG's stay in place, even when running. Unlike the Jaybirds, which have some weight to them that helps to dislodge them from your ear, the LG earbuds are featherweight and stay put. After the first few minutes of wearing them, I didn't even notice that I had them on, they're really that comfortable. With a collared shirt, like a polo, I didn't feel the headband at all. It's like they're not there!The LG's have the best battery life by far of any of the Bluetooth headsets I've owned. I tried an experiment with the LG's where I used them on two 1-hour runs, then took them to the golf course where I volunteer once a week and listened to them for 6 hours straight. The battery didn't quit and still had enough juice to keep running. The Jaybirds and the Motorolas would both have died after about 3 to 4 hours of use.The built-in phone works great, and no one I talked to with the LG's complained about the sound, even though I was outdoors. I often got complaints with the Jaybirds that people had trouble hearing me.I will concede that the Jaybirds have better sound and noticeably better fidelity than the LG's. The LG can be adjusted to boost the bass response, but they don't match the Jaybirds for sound. On the other hand, the Jaybirds can't compete with the battery life of the LG, so you'll have to decide what's most important to you. I mostly listen to audiobooks while I exercise so a small loss of fidelity, while disappointing, isn't a deal breaker for me.There is a newer version of this headset, the 730, but after reading the reviews, I thought I'd stick with the 700. There are reports that the 730 is less stable holding onto a Bluetooth signal, although I can't verify those reports. I can say that the 700 is rock solid and doesn't drop the audio stream even when the phone is in my pocket of backpack.The bottom line is that I think the LG's are a great value for the price. The Motorola S-9's LED burned out on me after a year, and the S10 wasn't nearly as comfortable as its sibling. The Jaybird Freedom slips out of my ear, even with all of their adapters, so I'm constantly fiddling with them as I run. In addition, the Jaybird Freedoms have limited controls for your iPhone or iPod. Stop, start and volume are about all you can do, as well as answer a call. With the LG you can fast forward or reverse as well as jump tracks. Another plus in this area for the LG is that it can tell you it's remaining battery life via its LED, which the Jaybirds can't.Compared to these products, the LG Bluetooth Stereo Headset is my new benchmark for audio. They do look a bit weird, but they really are well designed to deliver maximum battery life, a strong Bluetooth connection, and all the controls you need to manipulate your iPhone or Android device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNMPDWVIDH9ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052YFYFK#wasThisHelpful","RNMPDWVIDH9ZK","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a terrible problem with nasal polyps and have even had surgery to allow me to breathe. Before I used the NeilMed system for a sinus rinse, I was on steroids at least twice a year to allow me to unplug the swelling in my nose. Since I've used a sinus rinse, the problem occurs far, far less frequently. I swear by using the NeilMed sinus rinse system. I feel pretty confident that any device that mimics a Nettie Pot would work well, but you still have to add baking soda and salt to get the right pH for your sinuses. That's where these packets come in.They give the perfect pH to the water and are totally non-irritating to your sinuses. I also add a few drops of Johnson's Baby Shampoo to help with mucus build-up and the combination is a life changer. I almost never get stuffed any longer, and if I do, it is far less severe than it has been in the past. (You can Google the thing about Johnson's Baby Shampoo and sinus rinses if you're skeptical about its use.)I'd certainly check with my ENT doctor before I'd start using this product, but for me, it has been a god-send and I make sure I always have a supply of these pre-mixed packets on hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL473982OF20C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7QMYE#wasThisHelpful","RL473982OF20C","A11P105WVK5240","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11P105WVK5240?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, my family has lived in Boston since the 1630s. I am descended from 12 Revolutionary War patriots and am named after one of them. Ever since I was a kid, growing up with the long rifle and powder horn from the Battle of Bunker Hill over our fireplace mantle, I was understandably fascinated by what went on during those early days of the revolution. In the decades since my youth I have read quite a lot about what went on in Boston during those times. This book is now absolutely my favorite, as it is a finely detailed story of not only what really happened (as opposed to the saccharine glorification of events we usually see) but also a clear picture of what the patriots were really like and what their motives really were (more to do with money than liberty, I'm afraid).What sets the book apart is its thorough detail of the 15 years leading up to the events we know so well (the Boston Tea Party, Boston Massacre, Paul Revere's Ride, etc.). The author paints a very colorful, lively picture of what life was really like in 1760s' Boston - a picture I thought I knew but was surprised by. This is the human genesis of the American Revolution in Boston, not a list of events; you get the 'feel' for what it was like to be there and I don't think there's a greater compliment of an historian and his book than that.We see the environment, the society in which John Hancock, Paul Revere, the Adamses and others grew up in. We see that they are real men, not icons, and that they resided in a small seaside society of just 16,000 people. Out of this small community, the world was changed. This is the fascinating social history of how that came to be. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FMMWEUHY9R89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594161755#wasThisHelpful","R1FMMWEUHY9R89","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one who has always been fascinated by psychology, yet not formally educated in it (beyond a few college courses) and not inclined to read dry textbooks on the subject, this book is a treat. It blends the latest research in individual and social psychology with funny anecdotes and insights into why we behave the way we do. Don't be put off by the title if it seems a bit frivolous: this is a serious, thought-provoking book (though quite humorous and entertaining, as well).This is more or less a continuation of the author's previous book, ""You Are Not So Smart"", but you need not feel compelled to read the former: you don't really need to know the themes and ideas of the first book to read this one. In essence, the book shows us how knowledge and understanding of our self-delusions can be used to help us become, well, 'less dumb'. Using recent discoveries and research into behavior to help us see that we are not the objective observers of our lives we believe ourselves to be, but, rather, delusional lemmings stuck on autopilot, the author gives us 17 examples of how we fool ourselves in life.Each example is brilliantly written and fascinating, incorporating science, funny anecdotes and trivia. But don't get the idea that this is just a whimsical 'pop psychology' book; this is a serious study of our irrational unconscious selves, yet presented in a highly entertaining way (much like how Richard Feynman could make quantum physics accessible and understandable to the average person, as Carl Sagan did with cosmology - complicated science explained in an engaging manner).The author's central theme is that scientific method has saved - and continues to save - mankind from it's delusional dumbness. While you may deny that had you lived a few centuries ago you would have believed geese grew on trees, don't be so sure. In the example of 'Popular Belief', we learn that even today, myths and popular delusions abound: people in Korea - including highly-educated people - ""know"" that electric fans cause death, invisibly: If you leave a fan on when you leave the house, all of your pets will be dead when you return. But, not to worry, science will eventually save the Koreans from this delusion:""When you believe in something, you rarely seek out evidence to the contrary to see how it matches up with your assumptions. That's the source of urban legends, folklore, superstitions, and all the rest. Skepticism is not your strong suit. In the background, while you crochet and golf and browse cat videos, people using science are fighting against your stupidity.""Thank God.You will definitely be enlightened as to the nature of your own existence and the society you inhabit; it's that good of a book. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRC880G2W9QCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408052#wasThisHelpful","RRC880G2W9QCP","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not an in-depth investigation into Washington corruption; it is, rather, a panoramic view of the culture of Washington, the fertile soil in which the corruption grows and flourishes. Presented in a lively, humorous manner, it is rather enjoyable to read. So much so that one tends to lose sight of the fact that these are people - Washington insiders, that is - who enrich themselves with money taxpayers are forced to send to the government. You get the sense that these people always have a smirk on their faces, laughing at the stupid people - everyone outside of the Beltway - who support their little aristocracy upon the Potomac ('The Club', as it's referred to). The author, Mark Leibovich, doesn't draw conclusions for us, he presents the rather corrupt underbelly of Washington - politicians and their minions as they really are - and let's us decide just how bad it really is.The remarkable aspect of the book is the author's ability to not take sides, politically: most books on politics end up offending readers from one side or the other but here both sides are equally hoisted on their own petards. Democrats may outnumber Republicans but only because Leibovich is writing about the last several years, with much of the book centered upon the 2012 elections. But, as a New York Times reporter, the author certainly isn't anti-liberal, by any means; he's simply giving an honest account of what he has seen behind the curtains.That honesty, however, has its limits and this is my main criticism of the book. Leibovich shies away from exposing true corruption and seems to want to be friends with these people. I suppose a political reporter needs friends and allies in Washington and is disinclined to burn too many bridges by exposing the true breadth and depth of the decadence of 'The Club'. However, it's often like a member of the club - which the author certainly is - having had a few drinks too many is giving us a verbal sneak peek of how Washington works behind the scenes, but giving us only a few quick glances behind the curtain before closing it again (lest he risk his membership for exposing too much). But, to his credit, Leibovich does expose the way-too-cozy relationship between politicians and the media people who cover them, which seems to be the reason why Washington never changes: the public rarely gets the whole truth.Overall, the book is an amusing and insightful view of Washington that most people never see. Full of unflattering anecdotes about top politicians, but more so a view of the culture that breeds such people and the constellation of enablers which surrounds them. If nothing else, it's a very entertaining book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVHQ4HMYD8SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399161309#wasThisHelpful","R2QVHQ4HMYD8SA","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this, I really did. With a history in law and a penchant for funny legal stories, the book seemed perfect for me. Well, not so much.These are short (2 pages at most) snippets of famous, infamous and little-known legal cases and crimes. You would think that the writer would at least get his facts straight in such short descriptions but he doesn't - on several occasions. It seems the author is trying too hard to be funny and is editing the actual court cases towards that purpose (including changing the facts). The humor is, by the way, mostly of the Jerry Lewis/Adam Sandler level of comedy.Not that it isn't funny and interesting in places, it is. However, as a book-length collection of stories, the bad far outweighs the good. This is more like a 'People Magazine's Funniest Legal Stories Ever!' sort of thing, rather than a well-written collection of strange legal stories.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BL7WG1X02EYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1905798288#wasThisHelpful","R3BL7WG1X02EYC","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have ever seen good exploded-view diagrams, the best of which are found usually in color visual dictionaries, you will be amazed by this book. These are not diagrams, they are color photographs of painstakingly disassembled iconic objects such as the iPad, the SLR camera (both a 1973 version and a 2012 DSLR), a Blackberry, a chainsaw, an early 1980s Walkman, a 1980s Raleigh 10-speed bike, an early Apple Macintosh (the cover photo), a 1960 blender, and much more.The photographs of the disassembled objects, laid flat, are fascinating in themselves: often you cannot even tell what the object is from looking at an array of hundreds of parts. But the truly stunning photography is of the same objects actually ""exploding"" on the page: the author/photographer actually captured each part in mid-air, then combined all of these stills to make a VERY realistic photo of an early Macintosh computer, for example, exploding in mid-air. These are mind-blowing photographs - accomplished by what must have been an incredible amount of work.The masterpiece of the book is an entire airplane, the Zenith CH-650, disassembled and displayed in a 3-page foldout.There are 50 objects in all, each with the flat layout photo and the 'exploded' photo. The number of parts for each object is also included. At the back of the book there are four essays on topics related to the disassembly of objects. The great value of the book, however, is in its photography: nothing less than spectacular.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NJEWPBWEE0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0500516766#wasThisHelpful","R34NJEWPBWEE0G","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a 'power user' of computer equipment and always have more devices than outlet receptacles on your battery back-up (even if it's a large UPS), this is the type of power strip that you want to connect to that UPS, NOT a regular power strip.Millions of people probably use regular power strips on UPS battery back-ups and they are risking their equipment by doing so, in the mistaken belief that the surge suppression on the UPS totally protects that equipment. It does, from surges, but you can also damage equipment with uneven and inadequate amps as well, and this is what regular power strips plugged into a UPS will do - send inadequate power to some receptacles on the strip. These Tripp Lite strips send an even amount of power to each receptacle, preventing such damage. This is how I found Tripp Lite strips in the first place: having run out of outlets on the UPS (even though it is a large tower), I wondered about using a regular power strip to expand. NOT recommended, as I found out.These strips are pro-quality all around: heavy-duty metal housing, a 15-amp breaker, heavy-duty 15-foot cord, a lighted on/off switch with clear cover to prevent accidental shut off, plenty of space between the 12 outlets (about 2 1/2 inches), and hardware to mount the strip in almost any configuration.

"This is more than you might expect. It's not a ""how great I was"" autobiography nor a ""tell-all"" book filled with shocking stories of the sordid events in a famous tennis star's life; it is perhaps a bit of both of those to some degree but generally it's a real story of a real outsider who conquered the tennis world. Not that Connors is always straight-forward and endearing as he tells his story: he has many axes to grind (with fellow tennis stars and others) and tends to put himself in the most favorable light of most contentious events he was a part of, but, in general, he seems quite honest about his life and mistakes and is not unduly proud of his accomplishments. He's a likeable guy. Jimmy Connors did come from humble roots in East St. Louis, Illinois, coached by his mother to be good enough at 16 for him to venture out to California at that age - alone - to receive professional coaching. The fact that his mother remained an important force in his tennis career caused many in pro tennis circles (including tennis media people) to deem Connors as a 'momma's boy' and to be highly critical of his mother. We get at the heart of Connors as he writes of the importance of his mother in his life and his anger at how she was treated:""Why was it OK for Joe Montana's dad to teach his son football or Wayne Gretzky's dad to teach him hockey but it wasn't OK for Gloria Connors to teach her son tennis?""Indeed.There are plenty of salacious passages about his wild years on the tennis circuit, a wealth of insider information about that world behind the facade of Wimbledon and the US Open (including why he loathes the All-England Club, for example), his almost-marriage to Chris Evert, pot-shots at John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Arthur Ashe and other players, his occasionally-difficult but long-lasting marriage to his Playboy Playmate wife, Patti, and much more. It's a very interesting read if you lived through those years where Connors was the original 'bad boy' of tennis. Whether Connors intends it or not, you get the sense that Jimmy Connors was only temporarily a ""star"", and remained just a driven, talented - but somewhat flawed (as we all are) - regular guy from East St. Louis, Illinois.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7FDEIIIKL3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061242993#wasThisHelpful","R2F7FDEIIIKL3H","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one who considers David Sedaris as the leading American humorist of this era, I honestly wished I had liked this collection more. Not that it is bad - you will probably love many of these pieces - but it is, overall, rather disappointing. Sometimes, as a reviewer, I wonder if my take on a book is ""off"" (perhaps I was in a bad mood when reading the book) and check to see what professional reviewers have to say. I was relieved to see that most had the same attitude towards this book. None gave the book anywhere close to a gushing and glowing 5-star review (then again, they don't care that on Amazon gushing 5-star reviews usually receive the most 'helpful' votes - as opposed to some Amazon reviewers).It's been a long five years since David's last book of essays. This makes the new book more difficult to please: our expectations are so high, our desire to be amused so great, that anything less than than terrific is disappointing. I certainly wouldn't say that this collection is terrific. Nor is it nearly as good as his previous essay collections. Some of the essays are, in fact, excellent, but more than a few I felt were in the 'tortured-premise/contrived' category, and others were just bland.Let's get the lesser essays out of the way first. What Sedaris does best is observational humor - seeing the hilarity in the details in life. Topical humor is usually the purview of lesser writers: having a topical premise for humor and torturing it (spreading it out) over a ten-page essay. Sadly, Sedaris takes a current topic, same-sex marriage, throws in a redneck, and ... hilarity ensues. Not. It's a contrived piece. And several of the pieces are not essays but entirely fictional short stories. It's as if David has exhausted his supply of hysterical anecdotes and observations from his life and is straining to fill the pages of a book. A rather long essay on the trials and travails of using Pimsleur foreign language programs in his travels is particularly bland. But, again, out of the 26 pieces, I would say that a slight majority are quite good.The vast majority of pieces play to Sedaris' strengths: aspects of his childhood in North Carolina, the quirks of his adult life (his first colonoscopy), and the absurdities that the traveler encounters on his trails (buying a taxidermied owl in London). Several comic gems are among these essays: 'Rubbish', his relentless pursuit to tidy up the littered country roads in the part of England he resides in; 'Understanding Understanding Owls', his somewhat gruesome adventures in that London taxidermy shop; and the best, in my opinion, 'Laugh, Kookaburra', a funny yet profound and moving piece set in Australia. Others are excellent as well and make this collection worth your while to acquire and enjoy, even though it is not David's best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K4T0ZTD4LOS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316154695#wasThisHelpful","R2K4T0ZTD4LOS4","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Flex is fairly good - IF you understand its limitations. And it has a lot of them. This is a 1.0 version, the first wrist-based tracker Fitbit has produced. There are good reasons why there are so many negative reviews of the Flex. I strongly suggest that you wait for the technology to be refined by Fitbit (and others) before spending $100 or more on this.I also suggest that you tune out the 5-star ""this is AWESOME!"" reviewers. I've had the Flex for 6 months now (acquired at CES 2013, long before retail availability) and initially I too was impressed by the technology. However, with long-term use, I think its inaccuracies make it nothing more than a pedometer with sleep analysis added in (and the usefulness of the latter is dubious as well). The IDEA of it all is excellent: to track your activities and see your progress over time via the great software that Fitbit has developed. However, all of this is predicated on the device accurately tracking your movements. If it fails in that aspect - and unfortunately it does, to a moderate degree - then all of the data and impressive charts and graphs are rather useless. The ""awesome!"" reviewers don't realize this (yet) and just assume what they're seeing is real; it isn't.The underlying technological problem, as I see it, is in the placement of the tracker. Up until now, Fitbit trackers were to be placed on the torso. Now, it must be placed on the wrist (yes, the tracker itself can be taken out of the wristband and put into your pocket but all of Fitbit's calibrations and algorithms are designed for that wrist placement and you are making the problem worse by not having it on your wrist). So, if your wrist movement is ANYTHING other than the usual movement of either running or walking, your step count/mileage is going to be off - often way, way off.Fitbit markets the Flex as an ""activity monitor"", implying that it is capable of keeping stats on your physical activities. Well, because of the wrist location issue and the basic design structure of using two stride lengths for all calculations (your walking and running stride lengths), pretty much any activity that is NOT walking or running cannot be accurately monitored: the accelerometer senses whether you are walking or running and multiplies the appropriate stride length by the number of steps sensed (and arrives at a mileage distance). Any activity outside of that limited ability of the Flex, your stats are innacurate. This includes stair-climbing, hiking, tennis, golf, biking, working out, and pretty much every other ""activity"" that is not walking or running. The Flex is not really an ""activity monitor""; it's an expensive pedometer (albeit one with ""sleep analysis"", which is actually only a record of how much wrist movement you had during the night: i.e., 2 hours of no movement = deep sleep, an hour of sporadic movement = restless sleep).There are, however, aspects of the Flex that are quite good: it does accurately keep track of your walking and running, it does keep track of your sleeping patterns, and it also wakes you with a silent vibration on your wrist at the time you set to get up in the morning. And once out of bed and into the shower, there's no need to take the Flex off: it's almost completely waterproof (pressurized water being the exception). But the best, perhaps life-enhancing aspect of the Flex is its ability to keep you focused on your exercise goals (which is the main reason why, overall, I like the device and its software - to a point): if you DO consider it only a pedometer with cool software, which is what I consider it to be, you will not be disappointed (though the price may not seem worth it to others).First, there's the 'onboard' function to keep you aware of your progress towards your daily goals (total distance traveled, number of steps taken, or calories burned): each light on the row of 5 small LED lights on the band represents 20% of your goal and a quick glance and a tap on the band will tell you how you're doing. Secondly, for the actual stats of your progress (or reviewing your daily, weekly or longer stats), you can view them in real time on your phone via the Fitbit App for iPhone and Android, or on your tablet or PC/Mac with the Fitbit 'Dashboard'. This is where you set your daily and longer-term goals, view not only your stats but see them represented in charts and graphs, and log other information such as weight, weight changes, and food consumed. You can go further, but personally I would feel a bit silly setting goals where I would receive 'badges' for reaching them. But that's just me. Overall though, the software is very good and keeps you aware - along with the band's LEDs - of whether or not you are staying on track of exercise goals. But, again, just keep in mind that the wrist placement of the device gives the Flex an inherent flaw as to the accuracy of all this data - UNLESS you are using it only to monitor and analyze walking and running stats, as I do.If you're like me and the term ""highly-motivated"" (or ""disciplined"") and your name rarely appear in the same sentence, the Flex is a great help in that regard: it makes you keenly aware of whether you're succeeding or failing in your exercise regimen, which I find to be a great help in discipline and motivation. The Flex is a good motivator because you do not want to have today's exercise stats look inferior to yesterday's - or this week's less than last week's - or this month's less than last month's: you can graphically SEE all this on a color graph, your success or failure staring you right in the face. And who wants to stare at his or her failure or laziness? We want to see improvement, to see success. And, for me, this is why the Flex is a valuable tool: an ever-present motivator. I personally use it for running and I find that I really push myself to prevent the present week's stats (total mileage, etc.) from failing to outdo last week's. Seeing the charts and color graphs of several months of steady progress, there's a real feeling of accomplishment and a strong motivation to continue. It is this visual presentation of your exercise efforts that sets the Flex (and other Fitbit models) apart, in my opinion.Is the Flex a miracle device that will accurately detail your every movement, every calorie burned, throughout your day? No, it's an accelerometer/pedometer based on your stride lengths and your wrist movement; there are many activities where it is impossible for such a device to determine steps, etc. Fitbit's marketing of the device was overblown, calling the Flex an ""activity monitor/tracker"", implying - to many - that all activities could be measured for steps/mileage/calories, which is not the case. Further, Fitbit should not be marketing it as a calorie monitor because an accelerometer alone (which is what the Flex is) cannot possibly count calories burned with any real accuracy.So, overall, I would give the Flex 2 stars, based on the way it's marketed to the general public. It does fail to live up to many buyers' expectations (read the many 1- and 2-star raging reviews). The technology required to do what Fitbit infers the Flex can do - tracking and monitoring most physical activities - is probably a few years away. Someday there may be a Flex with integrated GPS, heart-rate monitor and an accurate altimeter: THEN we can expect steps/mileage/calories counts to be done for many more activities. For now, this Flex (""Flex 1.0"") is basically a pedometer (with a few other features) and its accuracy is limited to a narrow range of activity. My personal needs happen to fall into that narrow range: I use it only for running and walking exercise and in analyzing, graphically, my fitness history and progress via the Dashboard, and it's a great motivational tool. For my personal needs, I'd probably have to give it 3 stars (but this would be misleading to the average Amazon buyer). Unless your personal needs are as narrow as mine, I would hold off on buying the Flex until improvements are made. You can duplicate this model's limited abilities with a decent pedometer and freeware/shareware to manually input and analyze the stats.----------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEThere have been so many good questions about aspects of the Flex that I didn't cover originally that it's probably best that I expand the review:LOCATION OF TRACKER: Early questions asked about whether or not you can wear the tracker outside of the band or with the band around your ankle, etc. (earlier Fitbits could be worn anywhere on the torso). It is only accurate on your wrist (or, rather, it is most accurate on your wrist, its overall accuracy pretty questionable).ACCURACY OVERALL: For usual activities like walking and running, if you see inaccuracies in mileage or number of steps, probably your stride measurements are not like the average person for your height (which is what Fitbit uses for default strides, your height entered when you set up your account). In your account settings, you can change 'Stride Length' and 'Running Stride Length' in order to calibrate the accuracy. Ignore the reviewer who states that you can't calibrate the Flex: you can; all the tracker is doing is counting steps (and multiplying those steps for mileage amounts); since you can adjust your stride lengths, you can calibrate the Flex to your exact needs. The device has a walking step (stride) and a running step and counts them (and converts your steps to mileage). The only way to have accurate mileage is for the Flex to KNOW your two stride distances and to have the wrist tracker sense whether you're walking or running; if you mess with those dynamics (irregular steps, irregular wrist movement), you mess with accuracy, simple as that.There is an additional tweak to minimize wrist movement inaccuracies: you CAN go into your dashboard settings and change the location of the wristband from 'dominate hand' to 'non-dominate', but I've found that this to be of little use: the Flex is only reliable when walking and running AND having normal wrist activity while doing so. Instances where one wrist is more active than the other are not likely to be in walking and running activities.WATERPROOF: It is not entirely waterproof. You can wear it in the shower or along the surface of a pool. However, it's not rated to withstand water at depth - water where there's pressure.STAIRS: Unlike its predecessors like the One, the Flex does not have an altimeter and therefore cannot count stairs climbed. From what I read, Fitbit did away with it because it was inherently inaccurate.BANDS: The Flex comes with both a small and a large band. The large band goes from about 6 1/4"" to 8 1/4"" and the small, 5 1/2"" to almost 7"" and both are fully adjustable between those lengths. Putting on the band is difficult the first week or so - the rubber is a bit stiff - but then it becomes looser and easier to put on.TREADMILLS: Your 'Running Stride Length' on a treadmill may be shorter than on the road (no forward momentum). See above about tweaking stride lengths.HEART RATE: No, there is no heart rate monitor.CALORIE COUNTS: The Flex really should NOT be marketed as a calorie-burning monitor. No device without a heart-rate monitor can accurately determine calorie burning. But when using the Flex to simply analyze a run or a long walk, it can 'ballpark' calories burned fairly well; expecting it to tell you how many calories you burned in the past 24 hours - not so much.SUBSCRIPTION: For your normal account there is no additional charge for anything but for a 'Premium Account', which gives additional analysis and tips (such as a 'Fitbit Trainer' 12-week plan, more data analysis, a 'peer ranking', etc.), it is $49.95 per year. The Premium doesn't really seem worth it, to me, but then again it's only $4 a month or so for someone who wants to get more from the Flex.SLEEP MODE: There are two options for sleep mode. One is automatic and does not require you to ""tell"" the Flex that you are going to sleep, like the Up and and other competing models; however, you do need to log your sleep hours on your dashboard; at the next sync your sleep data will be visible. Alternatively you can fast tap the band when going to bed and do the same when you wake up. Personally, I prefer the dashboard method as I would probably forget quite often to tap the band. The Flex determines amounts of restful vs. wakeful/restless sleep simply by wrist movement (i.e., no movement for 2 hours = restful sleep). The novelty of being able to analyze your sleep patterns soon wears off, at least in my case; the usefulness of the data seems questionable.ANDROID COMPATIBILITY: You need Bluetooth 4 for real time syncing.CHARGING: It takes about 2 hours to fully charge using the dedicated USB cord. The battery lasts about a week.OVERALL OPINION: I did use the thing for months: it kept me motivated by being able to compare walking and running stats over time via the software interface. Otherwise, it was no better than a decent pedometer (and triple the cost). It fell apart after 3 months, like it seems to do quite commonly. Remember that this is the 1.0 version of the Flex, so enhanced capabilities - and better quality overall - may not be too far away. Perhaps the Flex 2.0 will be worth the list price if improvements are made but this 1.0 version is really not be worth it for most people. Read the many 1- and 2-star reviews as evidence of this. And, again, do not trust the mountain of 5-star reviews: if you look at them, 90% are 5 words or less ('Love my Fitbit!'), written by people who have no idea as to whether all the shiny color graphs and step counts are accurate or not. They are not, for reasons explained above.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31RH7W0AX7OJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGO0Q9O#wasThisHelpful","R31RH7W0AX7OJA","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The major focus of this book is centered upon the changing roles of the CIA and the US military, in the wake of 9/11, and it is a fascinating story.Who knew that the now-famous Navy SEAL Team 6 which took out Osama Bin Laden was temporarily inducted into the CIA just before the mission (""sheep-dipped"" is the insider term), because Pakistan is, on paper, an ally, and the US military cannot - by law - engage in such missions. Or that all of the spectacular drone strikes taking out other Al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders - seemingly military actions - were made by the CIA (and that the CIA now conducts tactical military operations all over the world). Conversely, much of the intelligence-gathering done on Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and other threats is now done by US military Special Operations forces, not the CIA. To further complicate the lines of responsibility, there has been an exponential increase in private intelligence-gathering firms used by the US government.It is a sometimes confusing, often breathtaking story (especially the inside stories on many kill operations), as to how our country now wages war and the politics behind it. Though this quantum shift away from the highly-visible and costly invade-and-occupy military tactics of recent years, towards this stealthy ""way of the knife"" method has been effective, it also has caused many problems.

The authors run the renowned Eleven Madison Park restaurant in Manhattan and have a special enthusiasm for - and expertise in - New York cuisine. They start with the ingredients available from over 50 farms in the greater-NYC area, including a fascinating history of farming traditions in the area over the past centuries. Ingredients are not limited to farms and are also obtained from the land, sea and air around New York: venison and ham, black sea bass and trout, chicken and duck.The recipes derived from these ingredients showcase the depth and breadth of ethnic influence on what is now considered 'New York' cuisine: Dutch, German, English, Jewish, Asian, Italian and other ethnicities all gave to New York meals, entrees, snacks, desserts and drinks now associated with the area. Many of these recipes with New York roots are well known: Manhattan Clam Chowder, the Egg Cream, and the Bloody Mary, for example. Others are lesser known: Clam Toast? Cranberry Bread Pudding? Beer-Battered Apples? Duck Fat French Fries? Common and simple favorites are also here: the lobster roll, roasted chestnuts, and so on. Vegetarians will also be pleased, with many delicious-sounding salads and a pasta dish I'd really like to make, 'Butternut Squash Tortellini with Sage Brown Butter'.Though some may consider this a fairly expensive cookbook, it is not only amazingly comprehensive [13 different types of vinaigrette alone (Brown Butter Vinaigrette sounds pretty good though I may pass on the Trout Roe Vinaigrette)], it has an impressive presentation of recipes, etc. as well, with high-quality photographs throughout and easy-to-read recipe instructions. It is a beautiful book - and huge (512 pages and over 5 pounds).If you are hoping for a true compendium of New York recipes, unfortunately this is not it. There are curious - and glaring - omissions in the book: The Waldorf Salad is far more famous and quintessentially New York than the 20 salads that are included; the Reuben is New York's most famous sandwich (or so I thought); Eggs Benedict doesn't appear; neither does New York City's greatest contribution to Asian-American cuisine, General Tso's Chicken, which has now even become popular in China itself; Vichyssoise is not from France, it was invented at the Ritz-Carlton in New York - and also does not appear; Lobster Newberg is nowhere to be found either. So, the volume cannot be described as the authoritative compendium of New York cuisine. Aside from this, it is a wonderful book and deserves 5 stars: the authors never state that they are presenting an all-inclusive collection of New York recipes and it would be unfair to knock a star off for that; it was simply my hope, upon seeing the prodigious size of the book, that it would include these famous New York dishes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R117FX1NQ94CDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607744406#wasThisHelpful","R117FX1NQ94CDL","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every 3 or 4 years I have to buy a high-back leather executive chair. The reason: the seat flattens out and becomes uncomfortable; otherwise the chair is fine. So, this time around, I wondered if a higher-quality seat cushion could ""save"" the chair and the reviews on this item seemed promising. At least in my situation, I would say it's a fairly good product, not a great one. But this may be due to my chair, my weight (215), and other factors, not particularly the product itself.It does provide a thin layer of cushion between me and the now-hard seat of the chair, once the hard foam gets pressed down. However, the cushion is rather narrow, at least for an executive chair (a regular office chair may be a better fit) and if you spread your legs at all, the edges of the cushion (rather hard) dig into your thighs a bit. Also, once the foam is pressed down, it becomes a hard surface, and this makes your under-thigh area uncomfortable, even if you don't spread your legs (this is worse than the original chair padding, which tends to retain the padding in the thigh area, the loss of cushioning being in the back tailbone area).These problems may have an underlying cause: if your chair is a high-quality, ergonomically-designed chair, slapping this dense, heavy slab of memory foam on the seat screws up those ergonomics. A standard chair may be better for this cushion.Bottom line: not as good as I had hoped.UPDATE May 11, 2013: I've continued to use this, trying to avoid giving up and having to shell out for another expensive chair. However, a problem I didn't notice at first has made it impossible to continue using it: though I did say the cushion screwed up the chair's ergonomics, I wasn't thinking of lumbar support. It is now causing serious back problems because it raises your lower spine above the curvature of the chair's back for lumbar support; not by much, but over time the small difference causes a big problem.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRTYR7I6T0O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001MS70GQ#wasThisHelpful","RKRTYR7I6T0O1","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this book seemed promising - a clever premise of the 'history of the world' in tweets of 140 characters or less. The promise soon turns to disappointment, I'm afraid.Writing comedy is known to be the most difficult of writing, outside of poetry (well, at least good poetry). A finished work should not be 10% funny, 90% mildly amusing or unfunny, and this is sadly the case with this book. I looked at the authors' previous works after being taken aback at how bad this book was, and comedy is just not their thing: from one, pop biographies of Justin Bieber, Adele and other celebs-of-the-moment, and the other, one other book - a book so unfunny and unpopular that it has zero reviews since its release in 2006.Save your money and avoid this book. Look at the front cover enlarged: these are the tweets they considered so funny that they should be on the cover. They are painfully unfunny.

"Murder mysteries are pretty rare here in New Hampshire, which is almost last in violent crime rates by state (47th). The murder of Edith ""Pen"" Meyer was not only shocking, it was especially difficult to solve (no body, blood or other DNA evidence). The story the authors weave is absolutely riveting and this is no exaggeration. As one who liked ""true crime"" writing many years ago but who became numb to it after the explosive growth of the genre, I read this book only because of its local connection (and the fact that, as a bookseller, I was able to obtain an advance copy, gratis). It is an engrossing story with truly fascinating and complicated twists and turns, and deep biographical/psychological profiles of the victim, her murderer and those who brought him to justice after a long struggle.I prefer not to reveal too much about the book's contents, as most readers would prefer to discover the facts themselves, but as far as the quality of the writing and the intensity of the story are concerned, you will not be disappointed. This is an excellent book, a real 'page-turner'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Z2C59FNXZ3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425258769#wasThisHelpful","R3Z2C59FNXZ3S","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use AC current for 95% of my photographs (mini-studio shots of books and antiques for my business). Having recently switched from Canon to Nikon cameras, this design is a bit of an annoyance: instead of a simple plug port on the side of the camera like Canon, this requires you to open the bottom battery-access door, take out the battery, then stick the battery-shaped connector into the battery slot - and then have to keep the access door open while you use it.This begs the question: How many Nikon engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb? Answer: 3; 1 to hold the bulb and 2 to turn the one holding it round and round. Canon design: a tiny port to plug in to within a second. Nikon design: a bunch of complicated nonsense. WHY?If you have certain Nikon cameras, you have no choice but to learn to live with this design. Once you get used to it, it's okay I guess. At least the cords are long and the adapter block reaches the floor, rather than dangling in mid-air, pulling downwards, like other adapters (the greatest annoyance of AC adapters for cameras).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9MV2EDQ9MRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DNZ1UM#wasThisHelpful","R1X9MV2EDQ9MRI","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, a confession: as a one-time movie fanatic (I have a life now, and watch much less), my favorite films of all time were screwball comedies: Bringing Up Baby, Arsenic and Old Lace, etcetera. So, I bring an enthusiasm for the subject that perhaps the casual reader may not have. Not to worry, this book is much, much more than an ode to Frank Capra and Howard Hawks. It has a depth and breadth far beyond the films we know so well.In addition to the fascinating story of WHY screwball comedies were made (as an endroute around increasing censorship, creating 'sex comedies without the sex'), and a thorough analysis of the films, stars, directors and movie studios, we get a wealth of very interesting 'back story' information on such varied subjects as remakes, scandals (including several murders), and the effects of World War II on the genre. Finally, there is an in-depth exploration of more modern films carrying on the screwball tradition and of sub-genres within that tradition. Includes a bibliography and an excellent index.Perhaps a bit pricey for a paperback but, for the film buff, an excellent book for the cost of one DVD. This is a larger, 6"" x 9"" trade softcover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZHLO045GBFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786467819#wasThisHelpful","R1UZHLO045GBFO","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a bookseller and fan of Royal Barry Wills, I have every printing of 'Houses for Good Living' (first published in 1940). Usually, one desires the first printing most. However, this most recent printing is actually a revised edition and is far better than any previous edition/printing, with excellent paper and printing, bringing out the details of the photographs. I'm not quite sure it's worth the sky-high prices that it has been bringing for several years now, but it is a fine book.Wills was preeminent in bringing the classic American Colonial into the 20th century, keeping as many of the basic design features as possible while accommodating the modern lifestyle with modifications not incongruous with the elegance of earlier classics. He was an important American architect who deserves to be remembered.

All in all, it's a fair deal: a decent set of lenses, a nice lightweight visor, a bit fragile where the lenses are attached, but for the money, very good.Attaching and detaching the lenses is this set's only flaw: it's a tight fit and you are always afraid of snapping the plastic holder when either putting the lenses on or taking them off.

"You would think that this book is awful, from the first and only review, made by a doctor. I'm not a doctor, I'm an antiquarian bookseller; I have 30 or more books on book repair and bookbinding; I say this is an excellent book of the basics (which are not easy to master). The good doctor should stick to reviewing medical textbooks perhaps.Actually, this is one of the best basic guides a beginner-to-intermediate book repairer can use, with clear instructions, lists of materials to use, and even brand names of products (which makes acquiring the tools and materials you'll need much easier). The large-format softcover wraps (covers) are even laminated, so heavy use of the book will not require the book itself to be repaired. No, the photos are not glossy color as one would find in a $235 medical textbook, but the b&w photos are large and clearly illustrate each repair technique.This is an excellent guide for basic book repair. I was looking for another book on bookbinding and just happened to see a photo of this book and a 1-star rating next to it. My reaction was 'What?!? That's a great book', which is why I felt compelled to write a review (I do own a copy).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Q8BR4VOAVQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1563087006#wasThisHelpful","R29Q8BR4VOAVQH","A1N3HHWQH225GB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N3HHWQH225GB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't use superlatives lightly, especially when it comes to books. I've been an antiquarian book dealer for many years and, at 51, have owned and read more books than you could possibly imagine. This is quite possibly the most important book I have ever read, no exaggeration.Although the subject matter is one which is off-putting to the modern intelligent mind - even a hint of the 'paranormal' deemed the purview of lesser, gullible minds - a personal experience when I was younger allowed me to be open to such ideas.The thing that pulled me into reading the book in the first place is the author's astounding rsum (Columbia/Yale Med/35+ published papers in psychiatry/head of a prestigious psychiatry teaching hospital): this is the last man in America who would want to sully his sterling reputation and career with a book on the subject of reincarnation. If you really grasp what went on here with this man, you understand where, in the Epilogue, he acknowledges the risks he took with revealing what happened with 'Catherine', that he decided that telling the world about it was far more important than his career.In this book nothing less than the true meaning of life is revealed. Depending upon your age and life experiences, you may or may not be skeptical of all that you read in the book. So, here's a shortcut to truth: Catherine reveals to Dr. Weiss facts about the deaths of the doctor's infant son and his father, very specific facts Catherine could not possibly know. Therefore, you have two choices: either Dr. Weiss is lying about that event, or he isn't, and, by extension, either the entire book is true or false.

"You actually need not go further than the cover of the book to see the agenda and tactics of the author: not only does he (and/or the publisher) make Sacco & Vanzetti - the poster boys and 'martyrs' of the Massachusetts anti-death penalty crowd - the cover photo, but the signs in the photo are heavily airbrushed in order to make clear the underlying 'message' that - along with the words 'Death Penalty' in blood red ink - says ""DEATH PENALTY BAD: INNOCENT PEOPLE EXECUTED"".First of all, the author seems oblivious to the now-famous revelation that Sacco and Vanzetti were, in fact, guilty as sin, a fact the world knew in 2005 (papers showing that S&V's own attorney admitted to Upton Sinclair - the one person responsible for making their case famous - that he had fabricated S&V's alibis and that his clients were absolutely guilty).Secondly, regarding the author's obvious applause for the corrupt SJC's ruling of the 'unconstitutionality' of the death penalty in 1980, he could have at least PRETENDED to give a fair analysis of that ridiculous, intellectually dishonest ruling. But no, not a word about how the framers of the Mass. Constitution were the same men who helped frame the US Constitution (John Adams, John Hancock, et al.) and that they certainly DID approve of the death penalty, especially for murder and treason.Judicial activism didn't start with the current slate of corrupt SJC justices (who have infamously decreed that Adams and Hancock ALSO ""intended"" that two men should be able to ""marry"", just as a man and woman); it was alive and well in Massachusetts in 1980 as well.The author's intellectual integrity matches that of the SJC, and that is all you need to know about the book.

"My husbands has a buddy that fully put this Wild Willie's beard Elixir.As he tested for a few weeks.The first thing he mentioned is a little truly goes a long way. He applies it before going to bed because it weighs down his beard a lot. He also mentioned that it does have a heavy scent of tea tree oil another reason he applies it at night!He also said... it does apply a good shine but weighs down his beard. So its not something he applies daily.So based on the details he provided he mentioned it would categorize as a 4 star.I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PDKPE1NRV1IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2O0SL4#wasThisHelpful","R1PDKPE1NRV1IE","A1O16CJA41TRDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O16CJA41TRDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having three kids in school you can imagine pencils break like mad around here.All the handheld manual ones are honestly such a waste of money. You may get a good couple weeks of use with them but after that they end up in the trash. At least around here they do.This little electric sharpener is AMAZING! I have it plugged into the USB port on my Desktop and the kids can use it and get on with their homework. Whats great about this sharpener. Its small (doesn't take up much room) its really quick with sharpening a pencil, and  you can even use batteries to operate it. It comes with a tiny screw driver to remove the screws to where the batteries are. It does require 4 double A batteries that aren't included.The catch tray fits snug on the sharpener and slides out without hassle.NOTE.... You do not need to add much pressure while sharpening the pencils. You do however have to hold the sharpener with your other hand to keep it from spinning and moving all over the place. Suction cups would be fantastic for this or even a double sided tape!I absolutely recommend this electric pencil sharpener. Its perfect for your desk OR your kids bedroom!I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

"We have had this fly swatter for a few weeks now.We use it in the garage for when the pesky bugs come out at night or even during the day. Mosquitoes and flies are absolutely horrendous here in SWFL.I think my husband has enjoyed this the most. We had a BBQ this past weekend and the flies were out of control. This fly swatter was so helpful.  As soon as any sort of bug gets smacked with this. You are for sure going to hear it. I will say... That when a fly is caught... Peee youuuu it stinks.It is highly effective. Super safe to use. My kids even use it.This does require 2 double A batteries that are not included.I'll also add... how light this racket is carrying it around is rather easy. There is also a button that has to be pressed for the racket to zap the bugs. Super safe and WAY better than having all the yucky chemicals that come with most bug repellents!Great Product!

"This tennis bracelet is absolutely beautiful.The stones are perfectly placed, awesome quality. The sparkle and shine this bracelet has is absolutely amazing!It can be dressed up or down. It can be worn with anything from a evening dress to a pair of holy jeans and a cute T.You know what my biggest pet peeve is? Is costume jewelry that turns my skin green or has me broke out in a irritation. This one I wore for 2 sold days straight enough time to see if it would in fact turn my wrist green or irritate it.Nothing. In fact I was so impressed with how expensive this piece looks even after wearing it for awhile.

"I have personally been a HUGE fan of Radha beauty products for awhile now. I was really eager to try the lash serum.What happened first!?Well, I recommend applying the lash serum before bed at night and before applying your make-up for the day.I have been using this for a couple of weeks just at bed time as I do not wear all that much make-up.I have had no irritation what so ever.I did accidentally have too much serum on the brush and some dripped into my eye. Not really a big deal it did burn just a little.So far I am loving it.

" 0:30 Mins When the mirror came in it was package good and well protected to keep it from breaking. The mirror had to be put together. It came with a tool to put it together and was easy to do so. The bottom has a disk that sticks to the bottom to keep it from sliding easy. This mirror is made good and it really nice. It is not heavy and easy to move around. The mirror flips with ease and is mirrored on both sides. One side is a regular mirror and the other side is magnified by 5x. Both side was easy to view myself. It would be great for a makeup mirror or a shaving mirror for men. I would recommend this 6 inch Two Sided Vanity Mirror by Oak Leaf.

" 2:07 MinsAt 11 inches tall this 1/4 scale beauty is by far the largest figure I own as of this review. She's also one  of the cutest as well. There are many Fate Testarossa figures out there to choose from but none as large as this one I believe. This is a very young version of her in a skimpy bathing suit sporting her trade mark twin tail hair style. I adore her swim suit. I like the design and color of it as well as the skirt she is removing as she seams to be walking toward the beach. The skirt  was a little hard to place into her little hands but well worth it. You can display her with or with out it but I plan on doing the former. I also plan on displaying her with the golden triangle thing (?) in her mouth. I like how they mirrored this triangle in a way on the back of her bathing suit bottom. It's a detail that's easy to miss. The overall detail of the figure is remarkable though not totally perfect. It's hard to see with the naked eye but there are some small paint issues here and there.Well I could go on but I will just say that if you are a fan of Fate or of really cute anime figures then you can't go wrong with this. I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1GWU641CMXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B17DIRS#wasThisHelpful","RL1GWU641CMXO","A184SGTNWVK3AX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A184SGTNWVK3AX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:40 MinsBased on a online game called Dragon Nest this is the sorceress character. I've personally never played it but I have seen videos of it being played. So I don't know too much about her but I can adore her anyways. I was attracted to her pretty face and interesting outfit when I first saw her. I love her eyes and how her face is framed by her cute pink hair and the gold crown with a red jewel. There is also a blue jewel held by the neck piece of her top. And then there are two more jewels in the staff she holds as well. Of course none of them are the real thing but they really look cool. Her outfit is interesting for sure. Besides helping to grant her some sex appeal it also helps her to look a little like her bat like mascot that's perched on her out stretched right arm. She has the hood with bat like ears and she also has tiny wings on her back. Her little bat mascot is funny looking with its yellow bowtie and body scars with staples keeping it together. So in short this figure has cast a spell on me. This is an excellent figure from Good Smile Company and I can recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GR4DENTSJ7DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSHXVLO#wasThisHelpful","R2GR4DENTSJ7DF","A184SGTNWVK3AX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A184SGTNWVK3AX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:43 MinsThis is a pretty sweet folding knife. I would say it's geared toward an EMT being that it has a O2 tank wrench / thumb hole built into the blade. I am not an EMT so I couldn't say whether or not this functions as stated. I am just a knife / sword collector and this knife is just unique enough looking to stick out in my growing collection of neat looking knives. It's pretty for sure but it's also a completely functional knife. The blade itself is very sharp. I only wish that it was serrated the same on both sides. It's completely flat on one side as you will see in my video. I love the curved shape of it. I also love the 'emergency orange' color of the handle. It comes with an allen wrench and some extra screws in case you need to fix it as well to use to switch the pocket clip to which ever side your hand dictates. It's a cool folding knife that I can recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OMDNKOWP9RKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIRFUSA#wasThisHelpful","R3OMDNKOWP9RKN","A184SGTNWVK3AX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A184SGTNWVK3AX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:07 MinsI got this to go along with the other Mega Bloks CAT set that I got to go with the construction site theme I've got in mind. It was incredibly easy to put together and took no longer than a half hour to do so. The parts were all there with a few extras and they fit together perfectly. I fond no flaws with this set. There's not much to it and the only function really is the bucket that moves up and down. I like the little traffic safety cones and safety barrier as well. The Mega Bloks brand is just as good as Lego in my opinion.

" 2:36 MinsThis is a great little set for a great price (19.99 plus tax at the time of this review). My favorite thing about the set would be the back hoe but the asphalt roller is really cool. They were both real easy to put together and all the pieces were there. The construction workers are cool and more pose-able than any Lego mini fig but they are about a quarter of an inch taller too. I recommend it.I've said it before in other reviews. Lego is the king sure but Mega Bloks is the queen, OK I laughed a little after typing that last sentence but what I'm saying is that Mega Bloks are just as good as Legos. Better if you take the cost per piece into account.

" 2:50 MinsThis is one of those prize figures that you play the 'claw' game to win in Japan. That being said you should know not to expect a masterpiece when buying one of these. I've seen this on Ami Ami for as cheap as 1500 yen used (under 15 dollars) but you also have to pay at least 1900 yen (a little under 19 dollars) for the cheapest and longest shipping and handling. So add that up and you will pay a little under 34 dollars total. This is why when I saw it on Amazon new for 34 dollars with free Prime shipping I jumped on it. I think it's very much worth that and instead of waiting two weeks for it I got it in three days.It's a very well done prize figure. If you look close enough you will find flaws but it didn't cost a lot so who cares. She will fit in quite well with my more expensive figures. I'm not too sure about the scale of the figure as it is not listed on the box but if I had to guess I would say it's 1/9th since it's bigger than my 1/10th scale figures and a little smaller than my 1/8th scale figures.I like her and recommend a purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132AUYUD3JEOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ7XFQ2#wasThisHelpful","R132AUYUD3JEOS","A184SGTNWVK3AX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A184SGTNWVK3AX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can't complain since it's a inexpensive knife but I can't really throw much praise on it either. It's really just a plain looking folding knife. The blade on mine is very sharp. The handle is a black plastic (GRN?) which really makes it seem cheap.

" 3:21 MinsThis is a figure of Yoko the main heroine from the anime series Gurren Lagann. If you're checking out this figure I'm sure that you know this so I wont go on and on about it. This is a pretty awesome figure that is obviously a prize from one of those Sega prize machines in Japan. It's a good one too. I like how Boota is hanging onto Yoko's top by his teeth. It makes this figure unique amongst the many, many, many other ones of Yoko out there. Also the base is unique. It is the hand of the Gurren Lagann. She does wiggle a little if you move her around but she's pretty secure in the hand of Gurren Lagann. The actual base of mine is different than the one pictured in that instead of the anniversary symbol it has a symbol of Yoko's skull shaped hair barrette. She's not a perfect figure since you can see some of her mold lines but she didn't cost that much and they're not that noticeable.

" 1:57 MinsThis is my second set of throwing knives. I like my first set but I really like this set much more. I love the size of them and the red cord wrapped around the handles. They are around 8 inches long and very sharp. They came out of the box with some oily residue on them but it easily wiped off. What I don't like is the sheath they come with. While it 'works' I think it's too small for all three knives. Not a big deal though.

"There are any number of post-apocalyptic films out there with greatly varying degrees of quality. For my dollar this was one of the better.Here's the scoop. Set in Barcelona a biologically based type of agoraphobia is slowly seizing the city (the world?). If people attempt to go outside they die. Marco, a programmer specializing in cyber security is being interviewed by Enrique who specializes in firing people. As the disease spreads the two are forced into an uneasy alliance. Marco wants to find his pregnant girlfriend. Enrique needs to get to his disabled father. It's a rough journey.The internet is replete with quips on how the younger generation is a sicker lot because they don't play outside in the dirt, step in dog doo-doo or drink from the garden hose. This film uses that idea as a basis for the disease. Even these middle somethings don't experience life directly. They see things through windows, TV screens and computer screens. So it were as though the outside world simply said ""to hell with you."" The journey between the two is arduous. They meet all kind of people, both good and bad, with their own problems and agendas.This is a very good film and one of the best of the genre. The acting, sets, set decoration, editing and such make the viewer believe what they're seeing. There's a battle in a super market that is truly horrifying. It is directed with a seriously fluid camera which adds to the sense of immediacy. The story arc and developing relationship between Marco and Enrique I found unique. I can't say they come to actually like one another but they get to respect one another. The post script is cool as well. I won't spoil it but I think all who see it should take heart.I saw the directors' previous effort ""Carriers"" which is very similar in that it deals more with the human side of the situation than the situation itself. I liked that well enough but they show a more deft hand in the directing here. I'll look forward to their next effort.If you're at all disposed toward this type of movie this is a good bet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNFAN4N2ESQRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK7QSGE#wasThisHelpful","RNFAN4N2ESQRB","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part drama. Part love story. This film falls somewhere in between but satisfies neither genre.Here's the scoop. Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been taking care of her father (Anthony Hopkins) who was once a brilliant mathematician but has gone round the bend over resent years. A younger math geek (Jake Gyllenhaal) has been living in the house and gleaning whatever wisdom he can from pops. Dad passes away and sister Claire (Hope Davis) flies in from New York to try and help. A seemingly brilliant math proof emerges but who is the author? Is it dad's or Catherine's?There's a lot to like in this flick. Paltrow is as good as I've seen her. She wears no makeup and looks somewhere between haunted and exhausted. She's worried she might have caught dad's crazy gene and can't finisher her math studies. She can't concentrate and knuckle down. Hope Davis doesn't get ti. She's been doing the successful New York business thing and stuff that is important to her seems trivial in light over everything else that is happening. Gyllenhaal isn't really putting himself out here. He's stretched a lot more in other recent outings. Hopkins is his usual great self and Hope Davis is at the top of her game. She means well and is sincere, but she just doesn't get it.The math speak sounds authentic. David Auburn, who wrote the script from his original play, either knows math well or did some serious research. The sets, directing, music and such are all befitting of the project. I guess the problem lies in the tug of war between Paltrow's struggling with her own demons and the developing relationship between her and Gyllenhaal. Neither has a very impactful climax. You see it. It's there. But you don't feel it. The final scene says the two might get there but it was too soft for my dollar.The average rating here from users is 3 1/2 stars and that's a safe bet. I went to the four because it deserves to be seen. Three stars might keep people from seeing a very worthwhile effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CAQSGCM9S5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUDQ22#wasThisHelpful","R10CAQSGCM9S5Z","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hadn't seen this in a long (long) time. Thought I'd revisit. The ride was absolutely worth the fare.Here's the scoop. Frank Galvin (Paul Newman), a once prominent lawyer, is now crawling deeper and deeper into a whiskey bottle. He's lost the few cases he's had. His office is crappy and he wallows in self pity. A case comes up regarding a woman who was put into a coma during a botched operating procedure. The hospital will settle but something in him awakens and tells him to go to trial. The odds are stacked high against him so he needs to reach way down to to win this one.The script for this was derived from a book and the outline was so good it seemed it could have written itself. Galvin is up against a crack, high priced law firm. His resources, Jack Warden, are tiny. The opposition is playing dirty and, like in a Hitchcock flick, you wonder how the hero can dig himself out of this enormous hole. Director Sidney Lumet was already well seasoned when he helmed this outing. David Mamet penned the script. Though only his third outing in film he shows a deft hand. The viewer gets queezy watching the noose tighten around Galvin's neck. And, of course, you get the the tiny glimmer of light that brings hope to the entire scenario.Newman is as good as he's ever been. Jack Warden plays the loyal buddy well. He walks the fine line of being a friend but not letting Galvin stray to far. James Mason, Milo O'Shea, Lindsay Crouse and Charlotte Rampling all do stand up jobs. All the areas areas of production are likewise top shelf. This is a solid piece all the way around.Some might complain this is too cookie cutter. I can't say I'd disagree but it's so well done I couldn't care. If you like a good courtroom drama, have at it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KHLCQHLF5E7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O77SPY#wasThisHelpful","R2KHLCQHLF5E7M","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is more evidence that crime/mystery series fro TV have gotten so much better over the years.Here's the scoop. In a small-ish town in norther France, someone is digging up recently buried bodies form cemeteries and displaying them in model homes as though they were a family. A middle aged mother and father along with a child. A female detective Sandra Winckler (with more than a bit of personal baggage) is brought in on the case. An ex department detective (her mentor from 8 years prior) also joins the case. The case somehow involves him and she needs to try to work the mystery of the case as well as the mystery of her new partner.This is a a very involved plot. The clues are meted out evenly but the answers still manage to elude the viewer. The sub-plots of Sandra and he boyfriend, her partner's mysterious ""car accident"" help flesh out the character side of things. She's got pretty severe OCD but they drop this fairly early on in the proceedings. But it's curious she would have that need for control but still wear ridiculously high heeled boots on the job. That being said, the characters are generally well written. The music score and sound design are very cool. They quietly underline the creep factor building up. And the end isn't quite the end. Not in a cheap way. The viewer realizes there is more than one story happening here.If you are a fan of ""The Killing,"" ""The Bridge,"" or Broadchurch,"" this should be right up your alley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21U2PGCEDSQED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH1G3UQ#wasThisHelpful","R21U2PGCEDSQED","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of the first two Mad Max movies and viewed both of them in anticipation of going to see ""Fury Road."" Unfortunately, it wasn't the experience I'd hoped it would be.Here's the scoop. Max gets captured by some thugs and given a glimpse of their stronghold overseen by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his minions. He oversees a huge population and keeps them in line by meting out small amounts of water and food. He also keeps a cache of young women, known as ""breeders."" herein lies the rub. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) Is supposed to be on a fuel run. She is, in fact, spiriting away the breeders so they can find a better life. She and Max become unlikely allies.On the good side is the excess. This is so over the top you can't see the top. All the costumes, cars, weapons, etc. are a visual feast. You don't believe it but it's still really cool. The action is unbelievable. At the conceptual level it's remarkable. On the execution level it's even more remarkable. You simply cannot believe what you're seeing. Some stunts seem actual, some must have been CG but the blend is seamless so it's impossible to tell the difference.On the downside is the story. It's pretty thin. Just enough outline to get you from one action scene to the next. Then there's the Max character. I'm not certain why Tom Hardy took the gig. They try to couch his wanting to help the women in terms of redemption for people he tried but failed to help in the past. It's too vague and carries no emotional punch. Max has way too few lines so there is a hole where Max should be.That being said, this is still a heck of a watch. It's as exciting a movie as you are likely to see and, for my dollar, is better the ""Beyond Thunderdome."" It's probably better than the three stars I gave it but shy of four. If you're a fan, indulge yourself. If not......","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O3UVG4I356F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ141W8#wasThisHelpful","R3O3UVG4I356F8","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Horror anthologies pop up every now and then and all seem to be a combo of hit and miss. Employing different writers and directors in any given project must, by nature, yield varying results. This is no different.Here's the scoop. Not unlike 1001 Arabian Nights this starts with Deborah Harry who is going to kill and cook a young boy she has imprisoned. He figures to stay his execution by reading her the better stories in the book ""Tales From the Darkside."" She does become intrigued and listens patiently as he reads to her.Unlike other anthologies this employs different writers but only one director, John Harrison, who directed the TV series of the same name. It's in a similar vein as ""Tales From the Crypt."" On the good side is seeing actors like Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore and Christian Slater in the earlier parts of their careers. On the not as good side are the stories themselves. Story number one involves Buscemi getting revenge on a couple of trust fund nogoodniks who cheated him out of an academic high spot. It barely decent with an ironic-ish ending containing little effect. Story number two involves William hickey, head of a pharmaceutical empire, hiring a hitman to kill his cat who he thinks is out to get him. Thi si better than the previous story but only marginally so. And, again, the irony in the ending just isn't that good. Story three is the best. It has the greatest depth and is, by far, more interesting. And....I didn't see the end coming which is a good thing. It involves a starving artist (James Remar) who witnesses a demon murdering someone. But he must keep it hush hush or his life will be forfeit.This is modestly budgeted and is an okay watch. Just don't expect any real scares or great depths of thought. Get our beer and pizza and relax.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD4I1TK8WCII4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTYPW7C#wasThisHelpful","RD4I1TK8WCII4","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why am I writing this? This movie is twelve years old at the time I'm writing this. When I first saw it I liked it quite a bit some something seemed wrong. Something about it irked me. Upon viewing it again it occurred to me what felt wrong. Can a movie be too perfect?Here's the scoop. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) was a post Civil War officer haunted by his involvement in the senseless slaughter of native Americans. Now he's on a road tour hawking Winchester rifles for the company. He drinks too much and has terrible nightmares. The Japanese are working to close a trade deal with the U.S. as they become more westernized. The more traditional Japanese are opposing this and will fight for their beliefs. Algren is hired by the government to train Japanese troops to put down the uprising. As Algren gets captured by the opposition, he gets to realize a different destiny.This is an epic film in all ways. Great, sprawling landscapes. A huge climactic battle involving serious numbers of extras and a big story. But, as I mentioned, it might be too perfect. It were as though they honed the script with a fine tooth comb, laid out every shot and edit and went made it without a second thought. Given the subject matter I would figure it would have more fire but it didn't. Even the beautifully choreographed fight and battle sequences needed a bit more umph. The script looks as though it could have written itself. Once you have the outline it's a matter of filling in the blanks. Don't get me wrong. I liked it....a lot. But again, I needed some surprises. Some something that just wasn't there.All the key actors, Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tim Spall et al do a stand-up job. For my dollar there is no weak link in this entire film.

"I, like many of the of the mainland Americans, never took the ukelele seriously. I had no idea of its stature in Hawaii, Seeing the likes of Tiny Tim and others use it as light accompaniment to their singing seemed to reduce its status to a baby guitar. That all changed in a heartbeat while viewing this documentary.Here's the scoop. This film chronicles the life of Jake Shimabukuro roughly from his beginning to play the ukelele at age four to his entering the entertainment industry and beyond.This is a truly remarkable eye opener. Never have I seen the ukelele played like this. And to hear it adapt itself to so many types of music. Jake plays rock, classical, jazz, blues and on. He plays effortlessly, beautifully and with such emotion I was awed that such a range of expression could be had from such a small instrument sporting only two octaves. And his evolution of thinking about his playing when he began to realize how much can be said in the space between the notes.He is shown through all the times of his career. Early episodes with him playing in the band ""Pure Heart"" and on with all types of bands as well as accompanying noted singers. He was (is?) the go to guy (much like The Chieftans) for many in the music field. He himself is very engaging. He seems like a genuinely nice person and loves to perform. He is by no means a quiet performer. But listening to him talk you realize he has no boundaries. He will constantly reexamine his instrument and expand/adapt it to all styles of music.I realize it might be difficult to impart how wonderful it is to see him play what might have been considered a minor instrument. But, believe me, it's like watching a violin virtuoso. I know whose CDS are going on my next birthday list.This is as good a documentary as I've ever seen. Dig it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQ0INHP1TEIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C888OQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1NQ0INHP1TEIB","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Lynch, right from the get go with ""Eraserhead"", has proven himself one of the more ""outside"" and elusive directors of our time. He may often leave one scratching one's head but his films are always intriguing. ""Blue Velvet"" might be one of his more accessible endeavors.Here's the scoop. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is in town to help out at his father's hardware store during dad's stay in the hospital. He finds a human ear in a field and gives it to the police. He befriends the chief detective's daughter (Laura Dern) who tips him off to some of the case. he two want to find out what they can on their own which leads them into the underbelly of their seemingly idyllic, middle American, town. Danger ensues.This is a crazy, scarey flick. Much of the scare comes from Kyle and Laura entering a world inhabited by true nut-jobs such as Frank (Dennis Hopper) and Ben (Dean Stockwell). Frank in particular is like a bomb that can go off at any time. You want to be as far away from him as possible. And they ARE dangerous. They are in with crooked cops in plots that involve drugs and kidnapping. The juxtaposition between these two near innocents and the likes of the bad guys is striking. And as Jeffrey gets drawn deeper in, and finds himself doing things he would never have dreamed doing, his unraveling is painful. But he is determined to help the nightclub singer (Isabella Rossallini) get her son back.I can't say I understood everything going on here. But the dark underbelly and bug subtext, the homo-erotic underpinnings are fairly constant and help add to the sense of menace. The opening scene with the red, white and blue color scape, the white picket fence and camera digging to ground level where you see the bugs in all their violent glory pretty much tell the viewer where he's headed.If you're at all a Lynch fan this should do you well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUPFC7K4RKF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HT400A#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUPFC7K4RKF6","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been a few movies over the decades dealing with a virulent disease, being loosed on a large population, that needs to be dealt with sooner than later. Some, such as the zombie laden ""World War Z"" or ""Contagion"" are among the better. ""Flu"", for my dollar, is right up there.Here's the scoop. A guy, locked in a shipping container with many others being smuggled into Korea, is really sick. By the time they are set loose all his fellow containees are dead. Only he survives while the virus begins infecting the city in record time. Meanwhile, a first time responder rescues a doctor from her car which is about to plummet into an underground labyrinth. To his chagrin, she doesn't seem all that grateful. But soon he, the doctor and her young daughter are in a race to find a cure for the virus before the entire city becomes history.This is a really cool flick. It is densely and cleverly plotted which brings visions of Hollywood producers scrambling for their version of it. You have the search for the survivor, by the medical community, as he holds the key to the cure. But he's also hunted by the brother of a guy killed by the disease. Then there are the authorities trying to find the cure while keeping a quarter of a million people quarantined who are frightened to levels bordering on mass panic. Then you have the first responder who is trying to keep the doctor's daughter safe because she might be proof the cure works. And the clock is ticking. The story factions all work well. The characters a good. The hero has a comic side-kick to help things from becoming too overwrought. There are some key scenes involving large numbers of citizens beginning to riot which are staged very well. There are also scenes of what is becoming a mass grave that are quite eerie. There are other serious aspects of the story happening too numerous to note here, but let it be said, this all culminates in a very rousing climax. The split second timing of said climax might put some off and rightfully so, but it's still a heck of a ride.The directing of some of the scenes seemed a bit rushed but most were directed spot on. The main characters were generally good though they do paint the American medical authorities as being a bit too hard-edged. What really is happening here is the plotting. It's a cool story told really well.I'm not necessarily given to these types of flicks but this is about as good as I've seen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N07Y17O3WVO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4IR3JC#wasThisHelpful","R2N07Y17O3WVO7","A2IY9M330NKBW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IY9M330NKBW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Groucho Marx's long-running quiz show ""You Bet Your Life"" was broadcast both on TV and on radio. This cassette contains two episodes of the radio version. If you're not familiar with Groucho's quiz show, it was a very entertaining show which typically devoted more time to Groucho chatting with the contestants and making funny quips than it did to the actual game.On one of the episodes on this cassette, TV comedy legend Ernie Kovacs is a guest. In the other episode, Groucho's guests are two 9-year-old girls. One of them is future ""Murphy Brown"" star Candice Bergen (Then only known as the daughter of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen), and the other is Melinda Marx, Groucho's daughter.The episodes seem to be complete but without commercials. They only run about 23 minutes each, so the entire cassette only runs 46 minutes. If you can find these same episodes included in a larger collection on CD or in MP3 format, that might be a better option. However, for the low price of this cassette, I can't imagine anyone would regret buying it. I am recommending it for both entertainment value and historical value. However, I could not give it the maximum 5-star rating due to its relatively short total running time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5U03XD8HR3L5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FW7E6K#wasThisHelpful","R5U03XD8HR3L5","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not the only time someone re-did non-classical songs in a classical style. There have been multiple volumes of Beatles songs done in classical style under the title ""Beatles Symphonic"", and various orchestras and conductors have done classical-style renditions of songs by pop musicians such as Bob Dylan, Whitney Houston, and others.I usually enjoy listening to these ""converted to classical"" albums, but among all that I've heard, this one is the best! Conductor Grant Gershon has shown tremendous talent in fleshing out these songs, and faithfully emulating the styles of various old-time composers. He doesn't merely have his orchestra play the familiar tunes on classical instruments; he expands on and fleshes out each song, adding atmosphere and power to the new renditions; he elevates them to the level of classical masterpieces.If you enjoy great classical music but want to hear something brand new, I give this CD my highest recommendation.I only wish there was a second volume to follow this CD. There are many more TV theme songs that would lend themselves very well to classical adaptations. For instance, how about the ""Dragnet"" theme played in the style of Beethoven? (I've always found the ""Dragnet"" theme to be a bit reminiscent of the first part of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2N932DRNLT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000714#wasThisHelpful","R3J2N932DRNLT0","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this mower two years ago. It still functions as well as it did when I first bought it.There is no gasoline to deal with. You just plug the detachable battery into a charger until it's fully charged. On one charge, there is enough power to mow about two-thirds of my lawn. Then I have to re-charge it and mow the rest of the lawn the next day. (I don't know what my yard's size is in acres, but I'd say it's about average size.) Someone with a smaller than average yard should be able to mow their entire lawn on one charge. If you have a huge and spacious yard this might not be the best mower for you.It's good for mowing lawn that is at a normal ""needs mowing"" length, but if you have some spots with super-thick/high lawn, the motor shuts off. Just go through the thick spots quickly and you can still get them.The Black and Decker CM1936 mower is not perfect, but I'm pleased with it overall. I will probably continue to use it for several more years to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9CQG5IXZVQAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YK4UZU#wasThisHelpful","R9CQG5IXZVQAM","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this videotaped stage show from 1982, Gabe Kaplan (best known for playing Mister Kotter on ""Welcome Back Kotter"") does a terrific job of playing Groucho Marx at various stages of his life.Groucho tells his life story to the audience. At regular intervals, Kaplan and Michael Tucci as Chico faithfully (and hilariously) re-create some classic bits of dialogue from several Marx Brothers stage shows, films, and from a long-forgotten Marx Brothers radio program called ""Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel"".This production was co-written by Groucho's son, Arthur Marx, so you can safely assume most of the facts are accurate. The behind-the-scenes information about Groucho and his brothers are fascinating and surprising. This play does a great job of simultaneously entertaining while informing.Like most of us, Groucho had his share of tragedies and setbacks in his long life, but the play never allows you to be sad for too long, as another hilarious Groucho zinger always comes promptly to lift the briefly somber mood.One complaint: For no apparent reason, there is no actor playing Harpo. Harpo is represented by periodic off-stage horn honks.Despite that one imperfection, I would highly recommend this taped performance to any fan of the Marx Brothers.P.S. There is an alternate version of this same show available on DVD called ""Groucho - A Life in Revue"" starring Frank Ferrante as Groucho. I have not seen that version, so I cannot do any comparisons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCOCKNY10FKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BI5YTS#wasThisHelpful","R2SCOCKNY10FKT","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First the good points: It's BPA free, and it holds 32 ounces of water, a lot more than most sports water bottles hold.Unfortunately, this water bottle is awful for use in a car. First, it's too wide to fit in a standard car's cup holder. Second, if placed on a car floor, it tips over very easily, and whenever it does, the top almost always pops open and the water spills all over the place.If you plan to use exclusively at home, you don't need to worry about knocking it over so much, so in that case I would recommend it.

"One of the most ridiculous and inept movies ever made, comparable to Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Unless you've seen either that film or this one, you have never seen just how bad a motion picture can be. The worst films most of us have ever seen still have a basic level of professionalism to them that ""The Creeping Terror"" lacks.A shaggy, faceless monster from a distant planet crawls very slowly and eats people so that aliens can collect data from it to learn about earth people so they can invade the earth. The ""monster"" is played by a group of people wearing a large shag rug. It moves very slowly, and its many victims just sit still and wait to be eaten. There is extensive narration to cover for a soundtrack that was somehow lost during filming, but that only adds to this film's campiness and ineptitude.It's astonishing that this film was actually released to movie theaters. I don't think a five-year-old could find this monstrosity scary. ""The Creeping Terror"" is a total failure as a horror film, but it's an unintentional success as a comedy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGIUJA0IDJY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JKQDIA#wasThisHelpful","R3UGIUJA0IDJY5","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laurel and Hardy were the funniest comedy duo of all time. Their films are just as hilarious today as they were when they were made.This set has many of their greatest films, and is accurately called ""The Essential Collection"" but not ""The Complete Collection"".A complete collection at this point in time is impossible, as a small handful of earlier L&H films are missing or partially missing.The rights to L&H films are owned by various companies, and two of their full-length features ""The Flying Deuces"" and ""Utopia"" are in the public domain and owned by everyone.To obtain as complete a collection of L&H films as is currently possible, I highly recommend buying, in addition to this set:  > The Lost Films of Laurel and Hardy, Volumes 1 - 9 (Out of print but available used; consists of all existing silent L&H films, plus numerous solo films)  > TCM Archives: The Laurel and Hardy Collection (The Devil's Brother / Bonnie Scotland)  > March of the Wooden Soldiers (Colorized / Black & White)  > The Flying Deuces (Restored Edition)  > Laurel and Hardy Collection, Vol. 1 (Great Guns / Jitterbugs / The Big Noise)  > Laurel and Hardy Collection, Vol. 2 (A Haunting we Will Go / Dancing Masters / Bullfighters)  > Laurel and Hardy: Air Raid Wardens / Nothing But Trouble (2006)  > UtopiaLaurel and Hardy made a number of silent films between 1927 and 1929, and most of these were released on DVD a number years ago in 9 volumes. These are now out of print, and a set of all 9 volumes is, as of right now, super-expensive. So, to obtain as complete a collection as possible, wait for these films to be re-released or buy them on VHS.As for ""The Essential Collection"", each film is restored to the best condition possible, and many of the L&H films that exist in more than one version have both versions included. (European versions sometimes had more footage or alternate endings.)Although colorized versions of several Laurel & Hardy films have been done, none are included here, which I think is good because including colorized versions along with the black & white originals would have resulted in a much larger, bulkier and pricier set.There are approximately 50 films included in this collection. (Thank you, Scott MacGillivray, for listing the contents in your review!) While some are better than others, all of them are good. If you're not familiar with Laurel & Hardy's work, don't worry about deciding which film to watch first. You can pop in any disc in the set at random, and you're sure to see a great comedy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DJOJTM0L06K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BYBZKY#wasThisHelpful","R5DJOJTM0L06K","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I think Bob Hope was somewhat overrated as a comedian, I enjoyed some of his earlier movies, and I admire him for flying overseas to do USO shows in four separate wars.I caught this movie several years ago when it was shown unedited on TV, and I expected to enjoy it, but there was not a single funny moment in it at all.Besides being unfunny, it's possibly the most racially insensitive movie since ""Birth of a Nation"" in 1915. American Indians are depicted as non-humans. The main premise of the movie is that Calamity Jane shoots a lot of Indians, and lets Bob Hope take the credit. Bob Hope is lauded as a hero by the townspeople for wiping out all those Indians. American Indians are repeatedly shot dead on sight just because they're Indians, and this is depicted as an act of great heroism.Normally, I'm pretty tolerant of ethnic stereotyping in old movies because I'm able to understand such films' historical contexts (for example, the stereotyping of Japanese people in films made during World War II). And I can generally enjoy a good 1930's comedy film that has one or two brief scenes of ethnic stereotyping.In ""The Paleface"", the degrading depictions are not just one scene but a major part of the movie's plot. Moreover, it's beyond mere stereotyping to suggest that it's noble to go around blowing away every American Indian in sight.I'll probably be berated by Bob Hope fans for being overly ""PC"", but this film's depiction of American Indians as the equivalent of cockroaches is hard for me to overlook. To those who are planning to say, ""It's only a movie"", ask yourself how you would feel about a comedy that treated all Irish or Jewish people as vermin that should all be blown away. Would you still say ""It's only a movie""?Even aside from all the Indian killing, I don't remember a single funny gag at any point in this film.If you want to see a good western comedy, try ""Way Out West"", ""Cat Ballou"" or ""Blazing Saddles"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21KT6EF0W2TQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005UMF6#wasThisHelpful","R21KT6EF0W2TQ7","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is technically not a movie, but a movie-length TV special that originally aired in the late 1970's. Milton Berle introduces a series of very well-chosen excerpts from Abbott & Costello's TV series (not their movies). Additional commentaries by Joe Besser and Steve Allen are also included.Many of the best burlesque comedy skits ever performed are featured in their entirety: ""Slowly I Turn"", ""Herd of Cows"", ""Floogle Street"", ""Who's On First"", and many others. (It's not quite complete, however. I wish it included the ""Mudder and Fodder"" routine, but you can't have everything.)The narration by Milton Berle is dull, but fortunately, there's only a small amount of it. Aside from that, this DVD is a non-stop laugh riot all the way through! Abbott & Costello made many good movies through the 1940's and 1950's, but in my opinion even the best of them fall short of the laugh quotient of this superb compilation. With this disc, you don't have to sit through plot-advancing scenes or musical numbers while you wait for the funny parts.

"I consider this to be one of L&H's funniest films. Liberty and most other L&H short films are easily worth buying at the same price you would normally pay for a full-length film, because there are more laughs in 20 minutes than there are in most full-length comedies.The plot has L&H escaping from prison, and they quickly change out of their striped prison uniforms and into their regular clothes while being chased by police. In their haste, each one accidentally puts on the other's pants. They look for a place to change their pants, while inadvertently being caught repeatedly with their pants down in public places.One of several places they duck into to change is the elevator to a building under construction, where Stan accidentally hits the lever, bringing them up to the top floor.There are very few comedy films of any era that can compare to those of Laurel and Hardy, and this is one of their best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOVYZ1AOJORV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6303198104#wasThisHelpful","R1DOVYZ1AOJORV","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this item to make homemade french fries. All you need to do is fill the fryer with oil, dice several potatoes and toss them in. In about an hour, you'll have the best french fries you've ever tasted.The basket is large enough to hold a lot of fries, and they come out great. The homemade fries made with this fryer taste better than any restaurant's fries.I NEVER add ketchup to the fries I cook in this fryer, as it would only drown out the great flavor they have.Side note: I only use olive oil when I deep-fry, as I've heard it does not clog one's arteries like most other cooking oils. Also, fries cooked in pure olive oil tend to taste better, as the potato slices absorb the olive flavor while cooking.SAFETY PRECAUTIONS: There is a potential fire risk when cooking oil gets too hot. From what I've heard, olive oil is a somewhat greater fire risk than other cooking oils because it's ""flash point"" heat level is somewhat lower. The maximum heating level becomes even lower when the same olive oil has been re-used several times. Therefore, it is important to always dump out the olive oil after a few uses and replace it with fresh oil, and never keep your stove above a MEDIUM level. The fries will take some time to cook, but be patient.

To anyone who appreciates good instrumental music that differs from the standard run-of-the-mill hit rock songs that dominate the radio airwaves, I would very highly recommend ""Pretty Kitty"" in whatever format you can get it in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQP1PUFSIS4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BKSTCQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQP1PUFSIS4V","A252GNMB3PIZA8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A252GNMB3PIZA8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only edition of this book as of this writing is a ""2007"" edition, actually published in 2006. A lot more TV series and TV seasons have been released on DVD in the four years since its publication.It's great to have this book to tell you which DVD sets include complete episodes and which have altered or truncated episodes; which sets scramble the order of episodes (so you have to skip around to go from part 1 to part 2 of a 2-part episode); and what extras, if any, are included.However, no two people are going to agree on which TV series were good and which were lousy, so when the author praises or pans a particular TV series, you can take his opinions with a grain of salt. You already know what you like and dislike. People who buy a TV series on DVD (as opposed to movies) are usually very familiar with whatever series they're buying.Besides authorized studio releases, this book also reviews some of the budget-priced public domain TV series releases, and lets readers know about the picture quality and the entertainment level of the episodes included. (Public domain DVDs select only episodes that are not copyrighted, and these can be any combination of the best or the worst episodes of a given TV series.)If this book could be updated to reflect every major TV series release on DVD as of 2010, I would rate it 5 stars.

"A fairly good story, especially for a Big Little Book. It's one of the Flip-Books, though, so nearly a quarter of each page of art has a chunk out of it with a little pic of Bugs Bunny doing a magic trick. The art's okay, but in black-and-white.The one problem with the story is that Bugs is a complete jerk from the first page, instead of getting haughty in reaction to something. I thought it was out of character for him, as Bugs Bunny needs to have a more sympathetic start in order for him to come out on top of the bad guys properly.

"The only reason I really bought this particular Marvel Masterworks was that it was only $5 on Amazon, and I had really been wanting to see how they handled the trade paperback version of the series. I have to say that they did a pretty good job, and I'll probably start getting some of the TPB volumes if I see them really cheap again.This one reprints the first half of the Human Torch's solo series that was originally in Strange Tales. It features the first appearances of the Wizard, Paste-Pot Pete, the Plantman, along with the Sandman, Sub-Mariner, and the first modern appearance of Captain America (albeit an ersatz one).The book is predominated with artwork of the great Dick Ayers, who inks or pencils nearly every story. He does a very interesting version of the Thing that I kinda like. Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko handle the art on the Strange Tales Annual reprint with Spider-Man, and there are even two stories by a fella named Joe Carter, who the world remembers better as Jerry Siegel, the co-creator of Superman.This volume is a good, solid Silver Age read - nothing too monumental, it's a good start for the first solo series of any member of the Fantastic Four.

"This is one of those books that immediately falls into the category ""They reprinted that?"" I thought the same thing when I saw Skull the Slayer and Omega the Unknown get reprint volumes, and I'm just as astonished and glad they did.This single volume reprints the 12-issue Saga of the Sub-Mariner and the 4-issue Saga of the Original Human Torch from the mid-eighties. Roy Thomas once again comes through in glorious style, retelling the life stories of Marvel Comics' two oldest characters (much like he did with the JSA in the America Vs. the Justice Society limited series (also recently reprinted in TPB form). Naturally, the histories are incomplete, only going up to the time of the Torch's second demise (in Fantastic Four Annual #5) and Namor's second modern series (by John Byrne), but each are a midget history of Marvel Comics. Particularly, the Sub-Mariner story gives you a lot of information that you might not have gleaned before by just reading the individual stories, and covers a lot of the grey area of Namor's history, such as the time period between the end of the Golden Age and his first modern appearance in FF #4.While the stories are basically history lessons, they're still very good comic book tales, with excellent pacing and just enough action to keep you interested in the ""heavy reading"". The artwork is pencilled by comic legend Rich Buckler, one of the few artists that should always rank up there with Kirby, Ditko, and Buscema in the Marvel Pantheon.WARNING: These are NOT decompressed stories like most modern readers are used to; you'll have to actually READ the stories to know what's going on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1AQAM9XNTRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785190481#wasThisHelpful","R2O1AQAM9XNTRH","A1CM83OHE53Z5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CM83OHE53Z5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An interesting, if a tad overblown, look at the making of the original Godzilla movie, covering both the original Japanese production and the US version with Raymond Burr. The detail the work goes into on the original film is amazing and welcome; I actually learned quite a bit that I hadn't known about the genesis of the character.As with the author's other book on Japanese fantasy, the e-book has severe formatting issues; it's readable, but many sections may give you a headache. If you're going to charge $4.99 for an e-book, it has to be properly FORMATTED! You can't just use the print file and expect it to look the same. I wish authors would understand this.The length of the e-book proper is only about 60% of the file, as there are numerous appendices, some useful (the shot list of both movies) and some pointless (complete credits for the file anyone could get off IMDB).I can't quite recommend the e-book, but I'm assuming the print book would be easier to read, so if you're a kaiju or Japanese cinema fan, try that one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHN95KRXS5LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCXFJWY#wasThisHelpful","RHN95KRXS5LB","A1CM83OHE53Z5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CM83OHE53Z5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boy, you can't help but get intrigued by what appears to be several typos in a book's title in an Amazon listing. Especially when it gets picked up by one of the various e-book promo services - it tells you a lot about what promo service NOT to use (Readers in the Know apparently doesn't have the same standards as a lot of the places that actually get things done).Be that as it may, one has to look at a title that has the phrase ""The Oricle"" (sic) in it as all kinds of wrong. It's ""The Oracle"". Sorry, but that's just the way it is. After reading the book and finally encountering the ""Oricle"", yeah, the situation ""fortells"" (sic) that yes, it should've been ""OrAcle"". Person in mists giving advice? Yep. OrAcle. Spelling it ""OrIcle"" only makes your whole book look like a typographical error. Tolkien, this is not.According to the Amazon blurb, this book is ""the first in a series, this Novel is best described as an Erotic fantasy-adventure,"" I guess it might be. There are dragons, and strange creatures, an Oricle, and whatnot. ""Erotic"" it isn't. It's about an erotic as ""The Shaggy D.A."" or an episode of ""How It's Made"". Rated G. And dull. You can have lots of things wrong with your book, but if it's dull, there's no way in hell to fix it. And this one, is dreadfully boring.

Many are based on folk tales and legends, but it covers people right up through modern times.

"A very good hard science fiction novel, but it doesn't live up to the promise of the title and the somewhat lurid covers I've seen; most average readers (and probably some genre readers as well) will find it a bit dull, as nothing happens, at least action-wise. There is some top notch exploration of what I would call speculative anthropology and archaeology though; In those terms, this book is right up there with Asimov and Clarke for the descriptive scientific extrapolation of an alien culture. It also pulls in a few cult or near-conspiracy theories about the moon in a very logical way.The book is extremely well-written, but the characters are a bit boring and stereotypical.

"For most any other author, this would have been your standard post-nuclear war survival novel - quite possibly the most cliched plot in the SF book. But with Philip K. Dick, you have a tale that rivals Alas Babylon or Earth Abides, or even a The Day After.This story is written very realistically and isn't nearly as dated as most post-apocalyptic tales from modern authors today. It actually answers a lot of questions and covers some of the more mundane problems that communities would face after a nuclear war. And, of course, there's some strangeness thrown into the mix, with a Thalidomide survivor with arcane powers, and a man stuck in orbit giving the new world's it's only news and entertainment.The story reads like it was written during the Cold War years (which it was), and one-ups it with a previous nuclear accident that one of the characters was responsible for. People also might find the initial setting a very strange place: An appliance (particularly TV) repair shop - now there's an anachronism today!  The book is populated by Dick's standard quirky but well-drawn characters - nearly everyone has more than one facet to their personality, and several secrets.My only complaint about the story is that the actual climax is written in a kind of ""off-screen"" (or ""off-scene"") manner - we don't actually see it; we just get to read about it. I found that a bit odd, but the book as a whole was a very satisfying read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Q3NDV04XNC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572522#wasThisHelpful","R17Q3NDV04XNC7","A1CM83OHE53Z5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CM83OHE53Z5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***4.1 Review as posted on KindleObsessed blog***When I was a teenager (and I use that term lightly because I believe the tradition started when I was something like 12) my mother and I used to take mini-breaks to the coast. The trips werent so much about mother/daughter bonding time (though that tended to be an inevitable factor towards the end of the weekend) as they were about total relaxation (which pains me to admit I actually needed at the ripe old age of 12.) Anyhow, these trips always followed the same routine.1) Pack just enough clothing that you dont appear homeless incase you are forced to set foot anywhere that the floor isnt made of sand.2) Locate any and all Harlequin romance novels within a 5 mile radius and shove them in the bag.The reasoning behind the industrial sized bag of Harlequins was a simple one. You could read them in one sitting. They were intriguing enough to keep your mind engaged. They were full of tension and they ALWAYS had a happy ending. (ie: all of the mandatory requirements for beachside reading.)Now, Ill be honestI dont find myself picking up too many Harlequins these day (not that there is anything wrong with them what-so-ever) but I have noticed that my vacation packing tendencies havent changed all that much in 22 years. I still bring very little clothing and I still bring more books than common sense allows, BUT NOWits a special handful of authors (not a specific publisher) that always get dragged along.And since there is nothing more fun than stating the obvious, one of those authors in Jennifer L. Armentrout. Mother of Tension.Its no big secret that I fawn over pretty much everything Jenn puts out, she has a way of building a story that just seems to get under my skin. But what you may not know? Im a little harder on Jenns books than most (authors) BECAUSE I expect to get that same breath-catching, heart-pounding feeling with everything she writes or Im disappointed. Its not really fair, but there you have it.Fortunately, Jenns standard or writing always lives up to my lofty expectations and we both live happily ever after. Her latest Fall With Me is no exception.""Eleven months ago, bartender and weird-shirt-wearing extraordinaire Roxy and Officer Reece Anders had a one night stand. Well, kind of. Shes been in love with him since she was fifteen, and he wishes that night they shared never happened. Shes sworn him off forever, but the past and future collide, forcing her to rely on the one man who broke her heart not once, but twice.Her best friend since birth has been in a long-term care facility since he became a victim of a hate crime years ago, and the person who put him in there is out of prison and wanting to make amends with him and Roxy. Shes not sure she has room for forgiveness in her and when she begins to receive frightening messages and is on the receiving end of escalating violence, she thinks she knows who is to blame. The man who already destroyed one life already.But Reece isnt convinced. The threats are too personal, and even if Roxy doesnt believe him, hes not willing to let anyone hurt her. Including himself. Hes already messed up more than once when it comes to Roxy and hes not going to let history repeat itself.""As I stated above, one of the things I love most about Jenns writing is her unique ability to create tension. Whether its between lovers and takes place in a storeroom, or in the simplest objects (like a remote control) being moved from place to place without the protagonists knowledge, there is a ledge Jenn creates with her writing and she loves to dangle her readers off the side of it. Fall With Me (which happened to blur the lines of N/A and Romantic Suspense) was heavy with these moments, and thankfully so.With so many N/A novels out there (most of which, unfortunately, start to sound the same after a while) it was nice to read a story that drummed up excitement without the use of a battered past. Do Roxy and Reece have demons in their closet? Of coursewho doesnt? But instead of it being demons created by the act of sayrape (as an example) they are demons created by their own minds. Guilt (for one) is a major conflict with both characters, and the exploration of how they deal with it makes for some pretty fantastic character building.Speaking of characters (*ding* two points for a killer segue) there are a LOT of them in this book. IF you have read books 1-3 in the Wait for You series the abundance of introductions will (most likely) give you warm fuzzies. (Seeing as how they are the main characters from the first three books in the series) but anyone picking up the series halfway throughmight think the information dump is a tad unnecessary. That said (cause theres always a qualifier isnt there) the 2 sentence backgrounds (for all of the supporting characters) do strike a modicum of intrigue for those who HAVENT read the first 3 AND allows this book to be read as a stand-alone if that is more to your liking.To add kindling to the already raging fire that is the plot inside of Fall With Me the storyline is multifaceted. Meaning: its not all about Girl A and Boy B hooking up (though there are plenty of saucy moments to keep your lusty minds satisfied.) Its also about them making a life for THEMSELVES (in spite of the trials they have personally experienced.) Discovering what makes them strong, WHO to let go of, and WHAT to hang on to. Its a rollercoaster of REAL life, survivors guilt, and PTSD.The kicker? The suspense that wraps itself around the entire story, and the knowledge that something nefarious lurks around every corner adds edge, propels the story forward, and its freaking creepy. (Take that eloquence!)In two sentences, it was everything I expected an Armentrout book to be. It had heart, suffering, tension and one heck of a nail biting, crowbar smacking ending.If you are looking for a book with N/A bones and a substantial sub-plot to back it uplook no further.Get it, live it, love itpass it on.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: its important to live life for YOURSELF as well as the people in it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZK25M9SMSU3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEYF0T2#wasThisHelpful","RZK25M9SMSU3H","AFUQ93IMBSVR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFUQ93IMBSVR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Anker lighting cable is a must have if you are looking for a replacement or (like me) just need an extra one for around the house/at the office/or in the car.The quality of the cable is amazing!#1 - It's not made from cheap plastic (like the ones you find perched precariously on the counter at your local drugstore.) From the looks of it (or at the very least the best that I can tell) the end connector is injection molded which creates a firm connector.#2 - The cable quality itself is also firm (not soft like most Ive used) so it doesn't feel like it will fall apart with constant use.#3 - The contact points on the head of the lightning connector are solidly built . This is a major selling point for me because it allows me to calm my anxiety that cheaply manufactured connectors will fry my phone.#4 - The size of the lightning connector head is spot on, and fits perfectly into all of the cases I currently own.(Note: this cable is a tad shorter than the lightning cables that come directly from Apple. My Apple cable measures at 41"" and the Anker cable measures: 36""  --- To me this isn't a deal breaker (especially since this is the length they advertise) but I can see where it might be a tad irritating if you are expecting a longer cable. Just keep that in mind.)In short, I have no complaints.I have purchased cheap knockoffs in the past, this will never happen again thanks to Anker.Quality product.**I received this product complimentary in exchange for a fair and honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MY8P5ACRN01P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGH9S0O#wasThisHelpful","R2MY8P5ACRN01P","AFUQ93IMBSVR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFUQ93IMBSVR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a cool idea for a coffee mug, especially for someone who loves photography...like myself. It holds the perfect amount of coffee or tea (i.e.: the 12 oz setting on my coffee maker) for a quick morning, afternoon, or (as is more often the case in my household) midnight drink. The lens detailing is significantly more realistic than I originally expected, and the build quality is...nice. (Although I have yet to toss it in the dishwasher and see how it holds up.) It keeps my drink warm for as long as it takes me to drink it, and it makes a great conversational piece. (Though that could be a drawback if you are an introvert.) The only real issue I noticed...the mouth piece slider leaks if the mug is tipped over. (AKA don't expect to knock this puppy over and not make a mess.) The lid might lessen the AMOUNT of coffee that ends up on your brown leather couch, but you're still gonna have a sticky situation on your hands.Overall (and despite of the lid) I still love this mug AND think it would make a great gift for photography nuts and those who abhor your everyday 'ordinary' coffee mug.Pros:Realistic LookKeeps coffee warmSize of mugCons:Leaks around mouth spout when slide is closed**I received this item for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.**","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R249DAMRNFF1SU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQEEAJ4#wasThisHelpful","R249DAMRNFF1SU","AFUQ93IMBSVR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFUQ93IMBSVR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** A 3.3 Review as posted on KindleObsessed blog **When someone hands me a book with a title like Playlist For The Dead a cacophony of thoughts run through my head.#1. Can I read this book in public? Not because Im embarrassed about said book (as a general rule I dont give a flying rats posterior about WHAT people see me reading, at least Im readingnot playing Candy Crush) but I refuse to ugly cry in a Starbucks.#2. Can I handle the inevitability of sadness? (Am I feeling emotionally stable today?)And #3. Will I be able to write a review about the book without sounding like a self-help pamphlet? (The jury is still out on that one, just FYI.)In short: books like Playlist For The Dead take commitment. Something I often struggle with.Thats not to say that books like this arent good or as is the case with Playlistcompletely unexpected, BUT it IS about suicide, and the repercussion of such a selfish act can be a traumatic thing to read about. So, be prepared for that.But first, let me back up the train a little bit and tell you what the book is all about.""A teenage boy tries to understand his best friends suicide by listening to the playlist of songs he left behind in this smart, voice-driven debut novel.Heres what Sam knows: There was a party. There was a fight. The next morning, his best friend, Hayden, was dead. And all he left Sam was a playlist of songs, and a suicide note: For Samlisten and youll understand.As he listens to song after song, Sam tries to face up to what happened the night Hayden killed himself. But its only by taking out his earbuds and opening his eyes to the people around him that he will finally be able to piece together his best friends story. And maybe have a chance to change his own.""Heres the thing, I dont want to spend the next two hours writing and editing a review that dwells solely on the negative plot aspects of this book (ie: the emotional backlash of teenage suicide) so instead Im going to focus on what my inner geek found utterly compelling. Michelle Falkoffs attention to (cultish) pop culture. From Donnie Darko to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon and Captain Mal to Star Wars and Mage Warfare, Playlist was a magical trot through a perfectly structured geekdom library. I found this writing quirk engaging in a way that should be embarrassing on some level (full disclosure: I highlighted every reference) but Im not. Instead, I found myself impressed by the way these references painted pictures between the characters.For example: Chapter 4 is titled Invisible (which is a song by Skylar Gray.) If you take the time to Youtube/Spotify/Google the song, you will discover that the lyrics are a reflection of what Hayden was feeling before he took his own life.Chorus""Even when Im walking on a wireEven when I set myself on fireWhy do I always feel invisible, invisibleEveryday I try to look my bestEven though inside Im such a messWhy do I always feel invisible, invisible""Quite frankly, its a genius way to character build and captivate a reader without having to spell everything out on the page. Especially for a character that is a very big part of the story without actually being IN the story. Or, to be more accurate, to build the character that is a catalyst for MULTIPLE characters journey to self discovery. (Oh man, here comes the self-help mumbo-jumbo.) Though the book is ABOUT Hayden, the plot itself (aside for the question of Why?) has very little to do with him. Instead, its about his BFF Sam. How he handles loss (sleep deprivation) and guilt (hallucinations.) Its about Astrid (a once poster perfect cheerleader turned emo chick) who struggles with anger. Its about Eric (the hipster boy who lives on a farm and wear clickity shoes) and the bully trifecta (who fail to realize the impact their actions have on impressionable peers.) Its about the AFTER, the What now? The gut wrenching probability that one of them might hold the answers to Haydens choice.It isthe perfect combination of nerd and heart.All that said, its not a very FAST moving book, and the mystery? Sorry, but its not all that mysterious. (Not that I expected it to be anyways.) What I did expect? To cry. Much like I did with Stephen Chboskys The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Tim Tharps The Spectacular Now (Both of which make appearances in the synopsis for this novel.) SurprisinglyI didnt. (Not that Im at all complaining about a lack of salt and snot running down my face.) Though sad, its not a blabber fest type of book. Think of it more as an internal reflection spread out over 279 pages.With a narrative that resides in the eclectic, I will hazard a guess that this book isnt for everyone. BUTit will find a loving home in the hands of YA Contemporary fans, John Green enthusiast, and Jay Asher aficionados. If that is you, runrun like the wind my friend.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: People are going to say a lot of things. And some of it will be helpful, and some of it will be annoying, and lots of it will get on your nerves. But theyre saying it because they found it helpful when they lost someone. They mean well.

"--- This review is for the 18k Whtie Gold Plated Cubic Zirconia Twist Rings Drop Earrings *I received these earrings for free in exchange for an honest review*Unlike another pair of Orrous Legacy Collection earrings I own (in which I had an issue with the backers) I have ZERO complaints about this truly unique and beautiful pair of earrings. I just flat out LOVE them!Let me begin by saying that what you see is NOT what you get. When I first looked at the pictures I saw a fun, short, sassy pair of earrings, but when I opened the box I found a myself short of breath. THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL!! Nothing like I expected. (Which is a fantastic surprise.) Yes, they were still fun and sassy, but they were also delicate, sparkly, and almost 2 inches long. (Which I would have already known if I had read the description more carefully. Shame on me.)They can be worn with dressier outfits without looking cheap (which is sometimes a problem with zirconia once it passes the 3 carat mark - these are 6.5) but also with everyday wear without looking out of place. (You know, in case you need to class up a hoodie...like I do...3 days a week.) They come with a pair of rubber backers, which I didn't expect, but was a nice treat. And came packaged in a very pretty black jewelry box. (Perfect for those of you that are planning to give these as a gift.)The description says: ""Delicate french wires make it easy to customize your earrings by granting the freedom to simply slide on your favorite ORROUS dangle charms."" Which I'm sure is an added feature for those of you that like to make things versatile, but for me...I think they are perfect just the way they came.Oh, and for those of you that have small children and are concerned that those ""delicate french wires"" might break if man-handled by little hands, don't worry too much about it...my child tried her hardest to removed both my earlobe AND the earrings a few weeks ago with no visible damage. (Though my ear might disagree.)I have had a load of compliments and am incredibly pleased. For me, that spells winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34K4G0DCPLQQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKWM3BK#wasThisHelpful","R34K4G0DCPLQQW","AFUQ93IMBSVR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFUQ93IMBSVR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"--- This is a review of the 18k White Gold Plated Cubic Zirconia stud earrings. *I was offered a free pair for an honest review*I'll be honest, when I first agreed to review Orrous's Legacy Collection I wasn't really expecting much. I was convinced that the price alone (which rivals those of accessory stores found in malls) was an obvious tell of their quality. I was wrong. In fact, I was not only happy with this beautiful pair of earnings I found waiting for me on my doorstep one day (in a pretty black jewelry box) I was impressed with them.First, lets talk about size. They are 1.9 carats which in layman's terms means they are roughly a quarter of an inch in diameter. Yes, I know...that sounds small when you put it that way, but I assure you...these puppies aren't tiny. I have what I like to refer to as giganto-lobes and this pair of earrings adequately covers them. (I've attached a picture so you can get a better feel for the size.)The cut of the stone is especially nice (though I couldn't tell you what it is called to save my life...go figure) what I CAN tell you? It allows maximum sparkle. Which, incidentally, draws everyone's eye. I have had more compliments on this one pair of earring than ANY other pair I have ever purchased. (Even the ones I've thrown down some serious dough for.) They are just that pretty.The only real flaw I found was with the backs. They come with a pair of friction backs (aka: the little metal backs found on 70% of posts.) Normally, I don't have an issue with them (despite the fact that they aren't my favorite) but the pair of backs I received REFUSED to hold. (Even after pinching them a little) I went so far as to speculate that it was just my abnormally large earlobes causing the problem, but nope...the posts themselves are plenty long. The fact of the matter was, they were just plain crap. (I lost both in the first week.) BUT...never you fear...I took a pair of rubber backers (my personal favorite) off of another pair of Orrous earring I received and the problem was solved. (I stimulating game of ring-a-round the backers never hurt anyone right? Right!)At the end of the day, I love these earrings. They are a great size, lightweight, sparkly and eye catching. Just what a pair of earrings should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V6JKZY5VVAH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OF8VU#wasThisHelpful","R1V6JKZY5VVAH5","AFUQ93IMBSVR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFUQ93IMBSVR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A must have singing in the shower accessory!I love having this little speaker in the shower with me in the morning. I can listen to music OR my audio books while getting ready for my day? Sign me up!First, the speaker is a good size to fit on a (single) tile in the shower OR on your shower door. (Not too big, not too small.) It IS waterproof (as advertised) but I'm pretty sure that excludes dunking it under water. (Note: they actually tell you not to do that in the description.) Guess it could happen if you use it in the bathtub though. (So be careful.)The controls (on the front panel) are easy to use and have (surprisingly) a variety of options. (Volume, previous / next track, power, and phone.) The speaker has a soft rubber like texture, and a suction cup (on the back) big enough to keep it stuck to the wall without having to worry about it falling off.The audio quality is good for the size and the volume level can be turned up pretty loud before it starts to distort. Being in the shower does create an echo off the walls so (thankfully) you don't have to turn it up very loud. The call function in the shower is neat but I don't think I would like to talk to my clients or my mom while standing in my birthday suit in the shower. (More power to you however, if that is your thing.)Just to check its versatility I let a friend borrow it, and despite it being advertised as a shower speaker he used it in his car as a hands free device to talk on his phone while driving. He just stuck it to his window and Bam! You could even use it in the kitchen if you wanted to as long as you have a flat surface to stick it to. (Like the fridge or a microwave.) Pretty universal if you ask me.The only MAJOR issue I had with it is that the charging adaptor is proprietary with means...I can't just use any old charger I have lying around the house.

"This speaker has amazing sound quality for the size! The second I opened the package I was skeptical until I paired it with my phone and played music through it. My eyes about popped out of my head. The music was crystal clear and there is zero distortion in sound. I took the speaker to my kids outside field day and some of the parents approached me and said they thought it was coming from a full sized boom box. The pair function is very easy to use just hold down the center button on the top and it will make a audible tone and the light on the front will start blinking multi color connect the phone and your done!

"**As Posted on KindleObsessed Blog**When I was a little girl, one of my favorite quotes came from Lewis Carrolls Alices Adventures in Wonderland. It said:Why, sometimes Ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.For me it wasnt a quote about insanity, or words scribbled across the page simply meant to illustrate the perils of Alices journey. To meit was about the miraculous ability to believe the impossible. That dragons could be real, or that flowers can hold an intelligent conversation about the weather. It was about ALL of the spectacular sparkly things that allow books to come to life. Without the ability to suspend reality, or believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast I was limiting myself to one life instead of many.Or..if you are reading a novel like Heather Lyons The Hidden Library limiting yourself to the idea that only ONE story can be told between the pages of ONE book.Last year, I had the pleasure (and yes, I honestly do mean pleasure) of reading the first novel in this series; The Collectors Society. It was engaging, witty, and above all else refreshing. It was an idea I had yet to stumble upon and the calculated yet simple brilliance of taking characters from classic lit (whether it be from the likes of Austen or Twain) and then weaving them in and out of other [novels] timelines took my breath away. I not only loved it, but I legitimately fangirled over it. (Which I am reluctant to admit since it makes me sound 15 vs 34.)When I was approached a little over a month ago about reviewing its sequel, I was ecstatic. The Collectors Society was a book that had stuck to my bones. The strong characters had not only prompted many a debate among my book loving friends, but they had also left a rather large indention on my heart. They were the characters of my childhood, born again into a life worth not only living, but telling about. And they had returned hometo me.""Sometimes, the rabbit hole is deeper than expected . . .Alice Reeve and Finn Van Brunt have tumbled into a life of secrets. Some secrets they share, such as their employment by the clandestine organization known as The Collectors Society. Other secrets they carry within them, fighting to keep buried the things that could change everything they think they know.On the hunt for an elusive villain who is hell-bent on destroying legacies, Alice, Finn, and the rest of the Society are desperate to unravel the mysteries surrounding them. But the farther they spiral down this rabbit hole, the deeper they fall into secrets that will test their loyalties and pit them against enemies both new and old.Secrets, they come to find, can reveal the deadliest of truths.""In the interest of saving time, Im not going to rehash the complexities of the series. (If you are THAT interested, you are welcome to read my TCS review. I pretty much spell it all out for you there.) But I do want to point out a few things I noticed in The Hidden Library.First, the characters.By the end of TCS, we have a pretty solid idea of who everyone is and how their personalities react towards each-other. Alice is (to be blunt) a total badass. She can wield a sword, bring multiple men to their knees (romantically speaking) and isnt afraid to admit that she might, indeed, be just a tad bit off her rocker. The Hidden Library changes none of that, but insteadtakes it to a whole other level. Alice gets stronger, both emotionally and physically. She also becomes ground zero for stability. You easily believe every word that springs from her mouth, whether it be threats of demise or loving declarations. She is the rock, and everyone around her is starting to understand that. Finn becomes much more vulnerable as we step inside his past. We discover what fuels his lust for adventure as well as ignites his violent (oh holy sucker punch) tendencies. Victor becomes increasingly more manic. The Librarianmore compassionate. Sweeny Todd more deplorable. The White King, more admirable. Each and every character GROWS in this book. Their walls break down. Their insecurities start to blossom and before you know itthey are REAL. They are no long fictional characters trying desperately to save timelines, they are PEOPLE trying to save OTHER PEOPLE. It is a beautiful thing to behold.Second, the plot.Much like its predecessor, THL hops from story to story. Wuthering Heights makes an appearance. Cats by Satsume Soseki! Dr. Heideggers Experiment, Sense and Sensibility, even Journey to the Center of the Earth. They all interweave to tell an incredible tale. The plot is fast, much like the first novel, but still slow enough to become emotionally invested. There is action as well as romance. Horror and well as racism. Comedy as well as a fair amount of self deprecation. The Hidden Library makes no exceptions and takes no prisoners. ESPECIALLY in the last chapter. And the villains (once a bit of an afterthought) ultimately CONTROL the flow of this novel, and THAT ALONE makes it one hell of an interesting ride.I wish I could tell you more. Elaborate on the twists and turns that kill some while sparing others. I wish I could elaborate on the mystery that is Gabe. I wish I could tell you that I didnt laugh when a particular character got shot in the man junk. But I cant. Sometimes the best reviews are those that leave the bulk of the book to the imagination, refrain from spelling it all for you. Which is why Im going to stop talking now. Wellalmost now.If you read (and enjoyed) the first novel, you are going to LOVE this novel. If you enjoy classic lit, romance, mystery and deception, you are going to LOVE this novel. AND lastly if you enjoy shows like The Librarians this book will blow your mind.This series is without a doubt becoming one of my favorites. Pleaseread it. And then come talk to me about it. (You wont be sorry.)Get it, live it, love itpass it on!Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember:Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.

"** A 2.9 Review as posted on KindleObsessed Blog **I can deal with a lot of nonsense when it comes to books. Weak characters, repetition in verbiage, even the occasional meaningless chapter. But there is one thing that I find tough to swallowweak plots. One of the reasons I read is to be swept away. I want to live the extra life literature has afforded me. Get lost in an alternate world. (Even if that world is based around the off-kilter mind of a serial killer.) Unfortunately, that particular goal is difficult to accomplish when a story lacks focus.That is the problem with Hoags Cold Cold Heart. No focus.""Dana Nolan was a promising young TV reporter until a notorious serial killer tried to add her to his list of victims. Nearly a year has passed since surviving her ordeal, but the physical, emotional, and psychological scars run deep. Struggling with the torment of post-traumatic stress syndrome, plagued by flashbacks and nightmares as dark as the heart of a killer, Dana returns to her hometown in an attempt to begin to put her life back together. But home doesnt provide the comfort she expects.Danas harrowing story and her return to small town life have rekindled police and media interest in the unsolved case of her childhood best friend, Casey Grant, who disappeared without a trace the summer after their graduation from high school. Terrified of truths long-buried, Dana reluctantly begins to look back at her past. Viewed through the dark filter of PTSD, old friends and loved ones become suspects and enemies. Questioning everything she knows, refusing to be defined by the traumas of her past and struggling against excruciating odds, Dana seeks out a truth that may prove too terrible to be believed.""Having only ready one other Hoag novel to date (The 9th Girl) Ill happily admit that I am NOT an expert on her writing style. (As some of you probably are.) That said, I did notice a significant difference between her last attempt (which I actually enjoyed and rated a 4) and this one. The most notable being arbitrary plot lines.Instead of reading like a thriller/mystery novel, CCH read more like a novel of self-discovery. Honestly, I have no problem with that. Strong character development (especially when it comes to the psyche of a brutal crime survivor) can be an interesting journey. However, its important for an author not to try and manipulate a story into something its not.Here is what I meanDana has suffered a significant brain injury. One that has not only caused a major change in character (ie: used to be nice, now is snarky) but also memory loss. The first half of the book focuses on Danas recovery and her adaptation to her new reality. It is appropriately intriguing. (Tries to remember what happened, becomes combative with family members, seeks independence.) BUT at the halfway mark (around page 200) a new character is introduced. His name is John and he killed Danas best-friend (Casey) from High School. Or at least thats what she screams at him when he tries to deliver a pizza to her home. The appearance of John is the turning point of the novel. After, the novel tries (not so subtly) to morph into a murder mystery of a girl Dana cant even remember. She becomes obsessed. Distracted. And the holes begin to appear. Plot lines are thrown about half-heartedly. (Rogers unnecessary rage towards Dana.) Questions are asked but never answered. (What actually happened to Danas dad?) People are painted in a peculiar light for no other reason than to add suspicion to a story that no one is suspicious of. (The retired detective.) To be blunt, its sloppy. (I meanHello! She solved the crime by reading her old diary? Pfft!)Not once did I believe in Danas conviction to find her deceased friends murderer. Instead I felt like I was reading an attempt to push blame. Make someone else the victim for a while, orat the very leastassuage her own gilt for past behavior.I will say one thing. The amount of research Hoag must have done on PTSD and brain injuries is impressive. At no point did I feel the need to Google a passage for accuracy (thank you OCD) which leads me to believe that the Hoag I read in The 9th Girl is still there, just a little distracted. The characters were well developed (meaning I had no issue establishing their intent) and the ending wasnt bad. (Though I had pegged the killer well before the reveal.)At the end of the day, I guess you could sayI was just hoping for more.More Liska and Kovac (which only appeared in the first few chapters.) More twists. More heart.Instead, I got a book that wasnt bad, but not great. A novel whose potential never delivered.Statistically speaking (if that is even the right word to use) Cold Cold Heart can be read as a standalone novel. Though it was nice to have a running knowledge of The 9th Girl it wasnt necessary for THIS novel to be a success. WHICH MEANS the same can probably be said about the next. Read it if you feel this overwhelming need to, but I say just skip it. Wait until the next novel and hope for the best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38N5YFXWRE59A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L1CTI#wasThisHelpful","R38N5YFXWRE59A","AFUQ93IMBSVR4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFUQ93IMBSVR4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nice to be back with the gentle hippie vampire that is Jane.  Tongue in cheek reminder that taking drugs is bad when she eats a meth laden bully attempting to frighten and probably kill an old Vietnam veteran by the name of Old Man Kevin.During this moment of hunger and moral outrage she saves Kevin, incurring the wrath of his gang which catches up with her much later in the story.I felt this story was much darker than the first with the horrific flashbacks to the war as told by Kevin, such a sad story. However, this allows Jane to also share sad and horrifying stories.Whilst the ending was sad I really feel like I understand Jane a little better, and even if a vampire she is a better human than me being so kind to those she encounters after her horrible life.Not as much humour in this story, but still enjoy the writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12EM8G9C90TYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9D19PG#wasThisHelpful","R12EM8G9C90TYN","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Audio & Ebook versions:Wind Walker consists of three short stories; one is stand alone and the last two are linked by a character.  All of them have a similar feel and theme; death, apocalyptic, cannibalism and monsters.I found the writing style to be very dark but exceptionally descriptive, add in the clipped, direct narration of Carrie Buchanan and I kept rewinding to ensure I had heard what she said; the ewww moments were really horrifying.The first story is Wind Walkers; a man learns he is the harbinger/catalyst for monsters to rise on a snowy mountain side in Wales.  His inner monologue of fears and memories interspersed with the dialogue with his children allowed for characterisation and a connection with them as a family.I really liked the cool velvet explanation of calm after intense pain. My only negative would be the alternating of PoV was a little confusing when listening to the audio version, but when read I was able to slow and repeat paragraphs.The second two stories were linked by a character; the narrator is left alone in a shopping mall whilst the world outside is filled with monsters. I did wonder if they were all linked as the season is winter with snow and ice and both talk of a rift.Sam the floating corpse will stay with me for a while, she was so vivid, even in death NB gave her a brilliant back story.  Another negative amongst all this praise would be the use of diapers; clearly set in the UK why use an American word?There is an abundance of flesh, blood and gore, eyeballs hanging and bits being cleaved or munched off. The shock value is obviously there but NB writes with such substance and palpability that even the simplest of phrases made me wince eg the eye ball stalk!All the endings were very sorrowful and pessimistic, no happy endings here, horah for some dirty horror. Loved the gruesome, creepy unrelenting nature of these stories and cannot wait to read more from this author!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAX7BXAU5U1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPFMELE#wasThisHelpful","R1LAX7BXAU5U1C","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very atmospheric opening paragraph; all chills and eerie sounds. Then a snap to reality which is actually much sadder than the chilly dreamscape.Michael is a Bereaved Partner. Having lost his beloved Nicola, he is now in the limbo land of insomnia and perpetual tiredness that grief can bring.  The well of emotions that MW is able to convey really left me feeling a little bereft at the loss of a woman I never knew. At one point I was sobbing my heart out at his memories of her.MW does well to evoke the sad, lonely place that is a church community centre and the poor souls that go they seeking some sort of comfort or answers.Then there are those dreams, dark dreams, the Mil calling him. Lets be clear I dont believe in ghosts but this started to freak me out a little. The lights went on as I was getting a goosebumps.The rollercoaster rush of all the emotions, fears, could-bes and oh-nos came crashing to the finale and I was left shocked and numb.

"The crux of the story is a couple, who are thrown together, get chased by a car full of thugs and the terror that brings.It felt like a quick read but I was surprised to see it took over an hour, so lots of bang for your buck, not to mention being absorbed by the story.Novellas and shorts are a tough gig for authors to let the reader feel anything for the characters as story content has to take prime placement above characterisation, usually. However, MW is one of those special authors that can embed a characters personality with a few simple lines of dialogue and how they interact with others.Many other reviewers have commented on MWs style of emotional writing and I was a bit dubious as this can often be a cover for over gooeyness and fluff, I was very happy to find this not to be true, in fact I found myself thinking of this story for a few hours after, wondering about the characters and feeling a little anxious about my next drive to work in the dark.I did wonder how MW was going to portray the womans feelings/emotions in a potential rape situation, IMO he pulled it off. There was a good amount of tension/terror without the female (Nat) going into a jelly like melt down, this would not have stayed true to her previous character. I was pleased MW wrote her with some gumption and fight.Equally the main male character (David) was not all bravado and kung fu panda, instead he had worries, nerves, doubts and sweaty moments. No get out of jail free Ex Machina here.Not all high praise from me though; I really wanted a different ending, more guts and blood? Or a massive twist? Just something a bit more but actually its the slow creep that is now giving me the willies (but several different endings are always welcome in my world!). So overall a 3.5 from me but a definite 4 for potential.On with the good stuff however, I was impressed with the relentless pace of the story, no let up, no rest for the reader. Yes, there were moments where I relaxed and thought phew now they are safe only to have that car and thugs show up again. It reminded me of a childhood hid behind the sofa waiting for Worzal (Gummidge) to take his head off, I knew it would happen at some point and it was the waiting that terrified me.I am really looking forward to a longer novel by MW and have my eye on In The Rain With The Dead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DXEXVMXXJP3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLP0XCW#wasThisHelpful","R1DXEXVMXXJP3T","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Poor Frank (aka Trigg, son of the off on his jollies Devil) has descended into abject grief at the loss of his Karra and inability to care for Abigail, their daughter.Breaking his already shattered heart he leaves Abigail to his Angel cousin Scarlett and her Vampire lover Katon, not forgetting Chatterbox my favourite zombie head as lead baby entertainer.Sat in a bar in the middle sucksville he is trying to get drunk or high, neither possible for a demon, but when he thinks he witnesses the end of the world ala atomic bomb his attitude is thrust into his begrudging yet caring, protecting demeanour.No obvious horror moments just a steady slew of gory descriptions as this chapter of the series rushes along never leaving me a moment to put this book down until the finale, which is another rush of excitement as TM brings all the clues and elements together at the end for a thrilling and fulfilling ending, but of course always left open for the next instalment.I loved the little reminder phrases that TM puts in so they dont overload the avid reader but do refresh those that need it! (ahem!)Whilst there has always been an element of religion wrapped in these books TM really poses some serious questions in this one, ones I really liked.As always Triggs story is never truly over but another disaster has been averted; for now.I really missed Chatterbox in this book but enjoyed the expansion of so many other characters.On a down point there were tiny errors in the editing which upset my flow of reading so were irritating but not devastating, the odd missing letter/s which changed the word or phrasing.Bonus feature at the end of Clandestine Daze first chapter!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4NU7UVMS0YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144RH7Y6#wasThisHelpful","R2F4NU7UVMS0YU","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Plagued Book 1 by Eden CrowneExcellent start with a really brief history with a surprising twist. Skylar is the readers narrator and she is also a Negative with level ups or enhancements.This is a world post bird flu in what the survivors call the Plague. What remains of the split are negatives which are immune and positives that dont seem to last very long, add in the army and some militants and the usual corrupt politics and you soon have an intriguing storyline.In this new post-apocalyptic world Negatives all have enhanced senses although our little hero/narrator as the usual set of enhancements, Sky has so much more than most and she needs to know why.When she starts to notice and fall for Hugo the gorgeous Brit boy, his appearance in her life starts a strange chain reaction of coincidences and intrigue starts to unfold.Loved all the British poke at humour. Although the odd vernacular was missed which did start to distract once it stopped being funny. Zucchine is a British yellow courgette not a marrow but hey ho!The odd spelling mistake or missing word along with the rushed compact and baffling explanation for various things made me feel that things were rushed on the this book and not the usual polished perfection from this (journalist) author.Whilst the ending left me on a cliff-hanger Im not sure I liked the story or the (obvious) characters enough to want to read a sequel, I just dont care about them enough like I usually do in her other storylines or characters.Also there was a general lack of tongue in cheek humour that I have come to expect. It took me a long time to get into and then to finish, but EC is still an amazing author and her Avenging Angel series is awesome.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0FYMMFC5SAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSDX74W#wasThisHelpful","R1T0FYMMFC5SAM","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenny is a troubled girl but she has found salvation and a haven at Children of Light church, when Apollyon the demon comes into her life things start to become a little more complex for this untapped, talented shape shifter.Not only is Apollyon a First Knight of Hell, an expert in torture and right hand helper to Lucifer (Lucy to her friends!), she is on a mission to a catch a djinn (very bad but lesser demon of hell) and find out who is stealing all the souls from both Heaven and Hell.Drew is the final heroine that make up the (dont say it  Charlies Angels!) trio, as a succubus you would think her life as a working girl would be perfect, but she is on the wagon and going cold turkey, much to the disgust of her demon pimp the purple fedora wearing J.D.Hershel aka Father is a charismatic leader, and true believer, and he is willing to sacrifice to bring about the cleansing of the sin upon the earth. With his devout followers not being quite what they appear is Hell about to unleash on the world??  So what is going on the basement?This book has some seriously powerful female characters, great ideas and interesting thoughts regarding humanity and the whole theory of Heaven vs Hell. It turns a few myths on their heads in some very amusing ways; I would love more of Polly and Lucys beginnings and journey.Along with the splattering, then gushing of gore were some giggle inducing moments and some snort out loud lines too.Whilst I found the beginning a little slow, the laying out of all the characters is steady and easily followed then the story starts to gather pace, I could not find a good place to stop as each chapter just leaves you on a knife edge of questions or battle.Some of the character thoughts, sayings and ideals are a bit sugary and more YA in texture than the others but the gore element and subject matter soon take care of that. There was also some over repeating of the ""Fall"" explanation, not really done in a differing enough PoV in my opinion to be different enough, but by the middle of the book I was hooked and thought the overall story with the gore and great characters made up for any doubts in the start.These authors rock individually with their own novels and characters but together they have blown me away!

"As Mike, Jack and Trip further their journey to Atlantis they try to figure out why they are there.Mike with his usual humour and Trip just being Trip, I was unsure of Jacks character at first, being new to JOBs work but I am really starting to like him, he has none of the humour of Talbot but he is much more practical, which takes some getting used to, he also has a real sentimental side when thinking of family/friends which is endearing.The difference in writing is a bit more obvious in this book as author MT goes for fast paced humour laden scenes and author JOB tends to pull out his scenes with lengthy tension inducing scenes, both end in fight scenes usually.The mental image of Talbot doing the River Dance had me giggling and snorting. As for Trip and his antics, they bring some much needed humour to a terrifying situation.There is enough zombie, guns n ammo, gore and weird goings on for all hard-core horror fans, plus a few brave sci-fi ones too.The pace never lets up with the switcheroo telling of the same tale. A constant battle for life that never seems to let up, the threats from the zombies, night runners and whistlers are still there but a new happening is occurring and its a little worrying. And what is so special about Atlantis?Lots of theories are thrown into the mix, I was a bit upset that just as the book gets somewhere it stops. But book 3 is on its way!Not sure about the cover picture as not sure I had the mental vision  of Trip being that with it looking, he looks too clean and intense for my liking but woo hoo at the sexy looking MT!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GRH8MPTMO3D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SXOHZG#wasThisHelpful","R2GRH8MPTMO3D8","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Midnight is a Pirilian, she is purple with yellow eyes and indigo hair. She was incarcerated by the Skelkiens, a predator race, but she escaped and is now on earth searching for a saviour, with a blazing fire fight with a starry setting this is how the book explodes in your face.These Skelkiens are bad news and not just to Midnight, after they destroyed her world they are desperate to see her torn to shreds so that they can access her magic as their energy source.Back on Earth is Riff, a blue musician who manages to annoy the local cult leaders (Skelkiens) who previously murdered his mother (told you they are bad news), after a particularly bad music set in the bar he lives in a magical, cryptic note is left by his magician father.Riff and an ex-girlfriend, Romy, who happens to be a warrior, his brother who is also an ex Knight manage to buy a weird spaceship that looks like a dragon and comes with two even stranger crew, set off to find Midnight who has been prophesised to them by Riffs father, and so the story begins!The topic allows the author to really put some amazing critters, ideas, cults, myths and characters in. It also allows for a lot of leeway as this is set many thousands of years into the future.I did get fed up with all the repeated information in the story as DA kept reiterating the past, the characters and plotline which was really unnecessary. There are also some issues with copied work (I wont say plagiarism as thats a bit strong) and the lack of actual science, some of the characters are so clich as to be bad, but not so bad as to be funny.That said this is full of humour and lots of goings on, with some unlikely heroes and lots of fun, danger and excitement.

"The story starts off with a group of survivors stuck in a restaurant toilet being taunted by a group of zombies, one of those people is Mitchell, who eventually opens the door to The Lich Lord and listens to his proposal. AR is very clever in almost summing up the last four books in one little speech from this fella.This continues to be a zompoc with a difference as this particular zombie keeps getting faster, more cunning, nastier and definitely smarter, not to mention shifting his appetite preferences.  The Lich Lord is expanding not only his empire but his abilities but what is his end goal?Back in the Daytona Beach camp Veronica is working hard on keeping things running whilst loathing and doubting Jeff, so is Claude who is promoted to refugee coordinator; a job that sounds, from Jeffs version, very much like the Third Reichs ideal sorting plan. Jeff is a horrific character but totally believable, sadly.Our heroine Darlene continues to recover from her horrific birth and loss. With a lot of help from an unexpected source. Her baby is not yet safe and so many factions have plans for him.There are some really harsh deaths in this book, especially as I had started to care about them, clever writing AR but cruel.The ending is climactic but of course leaves you wanting more, bring it on.Initially I will be the first to admit I was very unsure of this series with its hard than diamond girls, their thongs and the sexually rampant zombies BUT AR has evolved (like his zombies) and his writing is much more articulate, eloquent, plot stuffed, character laden and all manner of other wonderful things, so yes, I am now a huge fan of these books and the author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0DT2WSWIYGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXK9PSA#wasThisHelpful","R1W0DT2WSWIYGG","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hello Again by Megan Tregler:I found MT so descriptive I could almost taste the colours she was describing, her style of writing was beautiful.Jackson is mourning the rapid, recent and strange death of his wife. As he looks out of the pond in which her buried her ripples start to appear and those among us who understand the way the zompoc works knows what is coming up from the depths.The difference to this beginning of the apocalypse (and those are always my favourite) is that MT puts so much emotion into their previous relationship with little comments or flashbacks that the love and horror combine.Add to that the final line and its shudder worthy. I also really enjoyed Jackson as a character.Twisted Words by Andrew Stockton:Antony is an English book dealer and the story starts with him visiting a wealthy collector to purchase some items; I am always bias to love stories that are set in my own country. Although I am at loss as to why if you lived in the Highlands you would crack open an Irish (whiskey).As his host gives him a guided tour of the estate he lives in they come upon a twisted tree that has an unusual story. A story within a story, hard to pull off but done very well in this instance.The following description of love, torment and decay is very palpable not to mention heart wrenching.  As the story unfolds and then reaches a climax I was impressed that the ending did not fail the brilliant story.Everything I know about Zombies I learned from Star Trek by Sam Christopher:With a title like that I was really interested, however, it turned out to be far to disjointed for my liking. The majority of the time the language was incomprehensible and I finally gave up after three pages of confusion.BUT thats the great thing about anthologies, to others this story will be brilliant.Once Bitten, Twice Shy by Dillon Cox:Ah, that age old start to the apocalypse; the military and their marvellous experiments, I do love a classic.Lori and her baby brother, Zack, could be out for a road trip if they were not running from the undead! Nothing really felt strained, hard or dangerous for these two.In addition, Lori is stunningly beautiful and the chap they meet happens to be an upstanding, military trained hunk, with a fully functional off the grid hideaway etc etcI was a bit concerned that Zack was sleeping the whole time and was also waiting for the gore/horror to start. Whilst the writing was good the story IMO was not.Just Another Day by Chantel Boudreaux:Margot has a busy job, a needy family and she is trying to become an author or at least plagiarise her currently compromised husbands work.I love the way that CB writes with such humour, the explanation for her families circumstances are brilliant and almost believable.CB is always a joy to read.Inland by Martin Milhomme:Jake is surving the zompoc on a boat in the Florida Keys  when happens upon a traumatised, nearly eaten Angela. However this initially good story took a nose dive when she went from the screaming abdabs to offering a fun afternoon in the space of 24hrs not to mention said fun was had post an amputation, medications, a blow torch incident and alcohol!At that point I gave up, yes zompoc is fictional (currently) but I need to believe they could be true.Hes not Heavy by Rebecca Snow:WOW this was my favourite story.Well thought out with a twist I did not see coming. I really enjoyed the build-up and the characters were spot on with great back stories, really all crammed into a small story.Bravo  an author I intend to look up.As I Watch Her Walk Away by Dave Minyard:So sad but also so funny, at least I hope thats how it was intended.A happy young man describes his demise at the start of the zompoc, it all felt very real and very fast.  I really enjoyed this one.Things Worse Than Death by Bryan Vogt:Poor Peter has a unique on several survivors as they crash through various rooms trying to escape the oncoming horde.Cleverly written with a brilliant twist at the end. Another author to look out for (for me!)Death by Dad by Lisa Conger:Not sure how I felt about this story as it sorted flitted about a bit.Whilst the writing was clear there was just something wrong; lack of character in the characters and the story kind of went nowhere IMO.Forgive me Father for I have a .. Burp by Michael J Evans:A zombie yet to lose all his brain power is over wrought by the desire to confess post eating his wife.Whilst the writing was and the story a good one it really lacked some humour, this could have been a gigglefest with some extra input to make it lip smackingly good, which is a shame.The Overpass by John Lemut:I was totally engrossed in this story, the characters felt rounded and the timeline jogged along really well and then just as it got really intense it stopped!I do hope this is part of a larger novel elsewhere, otherwise Im stumped.At the end are some footnotes regarding the authors, personally I would have liked these at the end of each chapter.Overall I liked this anthology as a couple of stories were fantastic and others I would have chucked, but thats the joy of them, its like a mixed bag of sweets!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IE1OFDNA9H82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OR1GU8#wasThisHelpful","R2IE1OFDNA9H82","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erry was left alone by her father, gone to sea many say and a mother who killed herself living Erry all alone.  A sad story but after you read it a dozen times in the first chapter I started to lose all sympathy.For all her pitiful existence Erry is a dragon but the new King of the land has forbidden magic, magic that must be used to change her human form to dragon, so she must stay hidden or invite punishment.Erry is a complex character full of hate, but with great potential.I was not sure if I liked this story or not. I was intrigued by all the things that were hinted at and eluded too but I found the repetitive comments annoying but then realised it was supposed to be an inner dialogue.Whilst this is a standalone book there are strong references to other DS works which works well as advertisement. Ultimately its more of a prequel than stand alone to his Dragon War Trilogy.I will be picking up the first of the trilogy as my interest is roused, the writing style is easy to read and who doesnt love Dragons!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWX7NVZR9CMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X597SXU#wasThisHelpful","R2MWX7NVZR9CMA","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DEAD (7): RebornJust a small word of warning if you have not read books 1-6 then don't bother with this one!!A not so gentle reintroduction to the main groups, there is so much loss and grief still abound in this new chapter of the DEAD series, it's almost heartbreaking.TW Brown does brilliantly well with pulling at your emotions whilst giving you a good gorefest; there are some really happy moments too so don't think it's all doom and gloom.The change in mood from Steve to Billy is refreshing as a new ""eye"" is cast over the situation; almost a naivety.It is hard to review what is going on with each group without giving some of the suspense away as it is so packed with action and the rotation style of writing (a beautiful nod to George R.R.Martin) kept me riveted to my seat which was just as well with all the cliffhangers that TWB throws at you.I am loving the new editions of Katrina and Simon, please don't let them be bad guys or get killed off too quickly.I have so many questions!What's with the creepy kid zombies, are they evolving? If so, into what? And why!And the whole ""nukes on a train"" thing....Ohmergerd at Kevin at the end, the ultimate white knuckle grip on my poor Kindle.I am always amazed at the dystopian world that is painted by the zompoc authors, nothing goes well, no one finds any happiness, the constant struggle, the unending flood of human depravity, how strong is the will to survive? And for what? I guess that's why I really stopped to think when the London, UK, crew stop for a drink and talk about happy memories.The books must be getting shorter as I managed to munch my way through this in a six hour sitting! write faster!My parting shot has to be.... What is it with cats and zombie writers?DEAD (8): Darkness before DawnWhat is it with zombie writers and cats??Again, we are introduced to each group and each of their stories moves along in their own unique way, with so many threads now  I am finding that my mind is boggling trying to work out who to route for and who to worry about. So many different personalities to deal with TB really makes his own hard work, but rises to the challenge exceptionally well as each person is so well defined.Loved the occasional nod to books and movies, it was fun to try and work them out, but that's the only fun bit about this book, the usual humour is missing as this is truly the chapter that is Darkness Before Dawn.Its nice to see Billy growing but It's also interesting to see/witness Billy struggle with the need for ""boss man"" in others.  I would like to see Dr Zahn get a love interest, for herself and someone to love her back. But with what they are up to lately Im not so sure I like her all that much at the moment, means do not always justify the ends.Juan, is so not my favourite character, I find him to jivey/rough, but I am warming to him now that he is chilling out and being less ""street"", and he does have a really hard time in this chapter of the series, my heart was in my mouth, but mostly for poor gentle Mackenzie than him, but you have to say he is one tough hombre.Have to love how the British group have fortified their little farm house. I liked them before I knew them! I am always impressed with how an American can grasp the British element so well.Chad and Ronnies plight and ""journey"" started to get on my pip after a while. But then I remembered that there has to be time to breathe and feel the  emotions, otherwise what are they fighting to stay alive for.The groups are really starting to get inventive now with some of their defenses and I did have toThe poor Geeks and Kids seem to have met every bad guy in USA, I love Rose (rosie) what a tough little cookie, but with a heart of gold really. Now why do I like her but not Juan... hmmm.  Also Deanna and her back story. I just want to hug these kids.Its nice that some of the stories slowed down a bit to give some back histories, hard to care about a character when all you see is the here and now and not how they got there.A few more sad deaths to contend with, but then this is the apocalypse!There are lots of twists and turns, revelations and some backward stepping, I found this a very sad and heavy hearted chapter in the Dead series.Maybe because there is a lack of Steve & Melissa but I really miss Thalia.As always this is well written, hard to put down and perfectly edited. The wait is on again for the next chapter, what well happen when I finally reach no.12 and find there are no more..... thank fully TW Brown has many other stories up his very large sleeves!DEAD (9): SpringStraight back into the action, which if you are reading back to back makes for spectacular flow, but if waiting (months!) desperately for each installment then you can get a little bamboozled with how intense the jump back in is.Some clever references that made me smirk!Cats that eat zombies? What do zombie/horror authors have against cats?? LI felt some real sadness for certain characters, especially Emily-zombie but caught myself frowning at certain things she did, they felt just a little too contrived for my liking. However, I am intrigued to see where TWB is going to take this particular story line, especially as all the groups are noticing the same issues.Love the fact that Billy has a much stronger voice and is not living in anyones shadow anymore. This book has a big chunk dedicated to his, and his traveling groups, story; which is great as it allows you to really get to know all the new characters.Had to laugh at the British group and Vix wanting a word with the zombie writers for getting stuff wrong whilst in the midst of battle. Credit to TWB for getting the locations so spot on and a special pat on the back for the colloquialism achievement!I did get a little bogged down with Cynthias story but her life/animal views really gave me a reason to love her and then I found myself routing for her.Now on to the moans and niggles: New characters generally  so many of them and to each group! This got a bit confusing for me.Why are there so many beefy characters in these apocalypse stories, TWB is by no means unique in his characters that are huge in stature, full of muscle etc but how is this still possible? How are they finding enough food to maintain this bulk??Also Kevin seems to have grown back his frost bitten foot as he can now run with no limp impediment despite obviously losing his prosthetic one when being (spoiler alert!) captured and fleeing for his life.Not happy that so many animals are getting killed, humans you can blast to where ever, but please leave the furries alone LWhat has happened to the Egypt group?Ok, back to good stuff!I am really looking forward to the next installment and what happens in this next phase, I think one all the completed books are out (I believe 12) I will treat myself to a full read through of all of them or maybe read all the separate stories.This chapter ties up a few loose ends but also leaves the groups on positive notes which I think was needed as not all the people left in the Zompoc can be horrific all day every day? Scheming and slaughtering must get boring after a while and human nature says we want to be loved and need comfort; dont even the nastiest of characters love somebody?","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQPE8HAQ5JIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSSPGW8#wasThisHelpful","R2EQPE8HAQ5JIY","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zomblog (1)I loved the way this book was written; like a diary but with some real live action thrown in.The depravity of human nature that is described was so sad, as it felt so real. The zombies were almost the second monsters.....TW Brown does not bother with the whys and hows but the feelings and day to day survival.I became attached to the main characters and really felt for them for the horrors that came their way.... Has a weird twist at 2/3 which I did not see coming and brought tears to my eyes.Cant wait to carry on..Zomblog (2)I love the way TW Brown writes... zombies are my current (and long term) love. His characters are believable as they have some dramatic and plausible faults! and it is a work of fiction (we hope!) some literary licence in how we heal, mental and physical, has to be given.It is an unusual style, with it being a diary type/1st person style but the switching between characters allows for differing points of view without forsaking the style.Meredith is my kind of girl, yes she is self-centred but so she should be, altruism seems to only get you so far in the Zompoc.the heinous things that happen along the ""adventure"" that she has made me shudder and wonder at humanity in general... but TW Brown does make you think.... would we/could we be any different, I hope we are.More puppies and happy moments too though please!! or am I getting soft!Zomblog: The Final Entry (3)I do hope this is NOT the final entry as so want to know what happens in this ZPOC world....I cried twice, once when a well-loved character died and then at the end for two reasons, it WAS the end and also the actual ending.... and this was a horror novel!Meredith is my new hero this girl has super-sized (very pink & non hairy) b*alls....A new world adventurer.... certainly with fear as she often piddles her pants, probably so would I faced with the horrors she comes across.She makes some tough decisions and has some sad, but negative, insight into herself, which along with her story telling makes up the way this novel is written.TW Brown manages to stay within the confines of the diary style exceptionally well, I felt like I was reading history but along for the ride.I want to find out what happens to Snoe... so please write more!Zomblog: Snoe (4)I have to say upfront HORAH to TWB for diving straight back into the story and Im so glad I hounded for a finish to the story.TWB gets you straight back to the action, no beating around the bush with long prologues etc. For those that didnt start with the first trilogy of Zomblog this story leaps forward two decades and we are now shadowing the lovely Snoe, daughter of Steve and Meredith, love or loathe them; personally I loved them both; so if you missed Zomblog go back and find/read it first!So many elements to this new story, intriguing to see how post the Zompoc our trivial lives maybe viewed and how quickly humanity slips back into ""normality"" ignoring the horrors around them (bit like the present really).TWB really gets inside the teenage Snoes' head and manages to portray how conflicted most young girls seem to be in their lives, desperately wanting to be different to their parents. A strong case for nurture vs nature. Snoe is an opinionated young lady with certain views of the world, as she struggles to emerge from her infamous parents shadow and carve a place for herself she gets into all sorts of trouble, but then a lot of it is NOT her fault as certain bad elements seek her out.Her world is not one we would currently recognise and whilst I find it sad in many ways the simplicity is welcoming, albeit at a horrifying price. That said Snoe loves her world and is confused by things I would miss, its a hard concept for me to understand but even more difficult for the author to have written no doubt, so kudos to TWB.A possible start for the Zompoc is briefly touched on and shows the power of Chinese whispers!The ""scream scale"" has elements of the Carry On films albeit with a demented view; new allies are made and old enemies reappear.I would love to read the EEF manual (this is my next campaign).A brilliant read throughout, hard to put down and then it ends on a cliff-hanger that left me turning my kindle over to see if there was another secret page.... My favourite all time line from a book is ""roasted Snoe in a sweat sauce"" made me giggle several times throughout the day.Snoes War (Zomblog 5)Ok, so this is the shortest of the books with That Ghoul Ava (brilliant) tagged on the end, so a little disappointing in the length but certainly NOT the story.Whilst harrowing and nasty, something TWB does exquisitely well, I found Snoe to be brave, if a little stupid sometimes, and I was rooting for her the whole way.Nobody is safe in TWB worlds and I have to say I was left bereft at some of the deaths, so prepare yourself. As for the whole Dominque situation, well it felt a bit quick and easy IMO; like a much wanted balloon animal that slowly deflates and is left all soggy and wrinkles.There are some great reveals and twists in this book, which excites me for the final instalment.Snoes Journey (6)TWB has a unique perspective on the zompoc, his books tend to be more about humanity with some serious issues picked up and his views expressed, most of which make sense.His characters have always been believable which makes it hard to let go of them. Some die, some fade away and others you just lose track of in the melee that is Zomblog; but many stay with me. It was great that TWB brought in the odd background character to show that all people matter in life.I think another reviewer commented that maybe the titles are the wrong way around and I have to agree! Whilst the last book seemed to fizzle out slightly this one almost tried too hard in tying up loose ends. Maybe TWB really doesnt want this series to carry on and has put a bitter after taste in!All that said I would not have missed out on it for the world, lots of really great ideas, twists, turns, gore, human depravity (now I sound like a weirdo) and some good answers to burning questions.This is a six book series and I would advise anyone to block out a weekend and crack on from the beginning!If you like these you will love DEAD and That Ghoul Ava, both long and (currently) ongoing series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9ZV6UKFP2X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MG6B7V2#wasThisHelpful","R2I9ZV6UKFP2X8","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"That Ghoul Ava (1) A little novella that sparkles from the beginning...Great look at the underworld from a new addition! TWB has excelled himself with this character.Ava is a great narrator and introduces you to the darker side of life... with little quips and witty observations, shark grin!Brilliant concept loved this story and really looking forward to more episodes!That Ghoul Ava & the Queen of the Zombies (2)Love the little catch up comments... not too much for the faithful reader but enough to refresh a memory too...Bucket loads of new monsters, characters and friends. A second novel in what is no doubt going to be a truly amazing series! The humour is so wonderfully subtle you find yourself smirking and snorting through the gore and slime.No actual comedic moments... just the run of the mill everyday stuff is seen in the colour of comedy... like an excellent comedian Todd manages to point that out... giving you great snorting moments. Such as the ghost writer!Some really clever movie references..... and omg how funny at Mark Tufo (Zombie Fallout) ref!I want that story about the not real dead seeking cats!That Ghoul Ava kicks some Fairie A**e! (3)No dicing around here, straight in there with the action.  Some brief catch up notes, so you can read this as a stand-alone story if you wanted but works best as part of the series.I really enjoyed all the little nods to reality. TWB has outdone himself with the clever chapter titles and the Spotify link. Really gave a holistic feel to the whole thing.In this episode of Avas unlife we find her trying to bulldoze her way through battling fairies and discover what has got their panties in a bunch. It is a complex world that Ava lives in and nothing is what it seems; who needs politics when you have supernaturals!The humour has really been ramped up in this one, M. Knight Shamalammadingdong had me giggling for ages! The fight scene in the fairies house was brilliant; only TWB could write with Star Trek theme music and a Daffy Duck voice over and still make me feel tense.I will be ordering the Unnatural Grimoire from Amazon.su.ukMore monsters, some great connections, a few really lovely heart touching moments regarding friendship and I absolutely loved the Nessie comments!(Just a little side comment, yes I DO beta read for TWB but I ALWAYS buy all of his books; I believe THAT much in his work I wish to continue to support him. If I hate a concept or part of a book, or character I tell him at that stage, he is the talent so if that bit stays - I moan about it in the review!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29P3O58CIYF9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3HVQDY#wasThisHelpful","R29P3O58CIYF9Z","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ava is back with SASS! and a multitude of pop culture references; which are great to work out or memory joggers.When she meets a tall dark stranger, with knobs on! in the park another adventure begins.This time she is whisked off to Texas with some new and strange critters, I love the way TWB brings his own version of things to current ""fictional"" creaturesShe also discovers a new skill as her head starts to fill with voices. This, of course, brings its own hilarity.However, there is an underlying darkness to her situation and even through Ava thinks of herself as more the butter than the sharp knife she is great at sporting out problems that seem to surround and gravitate towards her.Not quite left on a precipice but I was left staring down the mountain of a cliff-hanger; I am thankful I have the next instalment to hand.The flashbacks to movies, songs and tv programmes are a hoot and the chapter titles are a joy all their own.RARARARA thats me shaking my pompoms for this brilliant series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NYE1XB8SIJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9PHF9W#wasThisHelpful","R6NYE1XB8SIJK","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ketty & Max are on the road travelling to visit her Mum when they decide, well Ketty decides and Max acquises, to the scenic route, however this soon gets them lost.After two long days traveling and two spooky nights in horrid motels with only dorritos for dinner, nightmares which fuel a lack of sleep, stinky covers and bed bugs, one of their nightmares come true.Totally loved the ending! what a surprise! and watch out for the frog on the anthill (made me snort!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGZY20XPB51L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCSD8PQ#wasThisHelpful","RZGZY20XPB51L","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And will her identity remain a mystery.Throw into the mix the evil Emperor Valtore who is the only other force against the Necrolords and holds a strange but compelling box. He is also keeps the company of Sorel the priest of Graff with his familiar, Mistress Rava.  Graff is the God of the underworld; Infernus.Dirge soon has the pleasure of meeting the Lord High Executioner of the Obsidian Order, Tyril, who is protecting a Necrolord but craves so much more. And is Baron Rand an ally or an enemy?Such attention to detail and in a few pages I was absorbed by this new world. TM takes on zombies (undead ghouls) in this mash up with sorcery and sword fighting and delivers this amazing story.There is no humour or lightness to this tale as with other TM novels, this is a dark and harrowing work but with all the intricacies of a thriller, some gruesome horror scenes thrown, his signature amazing fight sequences and huge element of supernatural. Full of intrigue, skullduggary, double crosses and sinister plots of revenge and power play.Little and large critters thrown in; some cute some not so much.Whilst this was neatly finished off there was a glimmer of a second story hinted at with several threads left hanging. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this new dark twist in writing skills that TM has demonstrated and look forward to more of this world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SYF1GLQG5L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR2S8YU#wasThisHelpful","R32SYF1GLQG5L0","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We find MT, Baily and Oggie back on the hill where Tommy died, now buried, they are dealing with their grief when a visitor arrives and hands them more weapons and more hell; with a reluctant Bailey, MT sets off to hunt down the Lycan and destroy them.I really enjoyed all the little snide comments laced with the obvious love that MT cant help but have for his fellow companions. His internal and usually external Talbotisms still reign supreme! Even amongst the gore (and there is a lot) and the heartache (again a lot) I still had moments where I literally snorted or laughed out loud at the one liners.Loved the little flash backs to the old life.  Bear..that is all.It is soon obvious that not all is well in the realm of the Lycans, Xaviers plans are not liked by all; many have gone rogue.  The werewolf change scenes are impressive and the fight scenes terrifying, I found myself holding my breath.Matheiu. There is an element of ZardOz to his home.Baily and Azile are still high profile but in the background.The watchers are also back as the Lycans mount their attack on the townships.

"I dont know about every Southern cook mastering but these recipes and how LC describes them make a Brit cook want to indulge and master.LC has a fantastic way of breaking the recipe down and putting it into easy to follow steps whilst injecting her own enthusiasm for the dish, dinner parties at her house must be wonderful.I love the way she gives practical information at the start of the book re tools and utensils, in a totally non condescending way, which some chefs have a habit of doing. She even provides a conversion table link for us not USA folk.LC starts off with the simplest of meals; roast chicken  but puts her own twist on it and produces something mouth-watering just reading the ingredients. She then adjusts her timings etc to fit most fowl commercially available, a feature which I really enjoyed in her last book.Next up is the humble Mac N Cheese which she manages to turn into a gourmet dish and with four different ways of doing it, it soon becomes a repetitive dish without becoming boring.Pork, Ham and Ribs then get the LC treatment and I cant wait to try them out; my only little niggle here was I was expecting a secret BBQ sauce or dry rub recipe (not shop bought).Chicken and dumplings then get a seeing too, with various ways to make your dumplings more wow!Pudding then ends this great book and she brilliantly gives simple definitions to cobblers, crisps and crumbles, again with that friendly attitude that left me feeling like my mum/nan were giving me a cooking lesson in a warm homely, kitchen environment.I would really like to see the next in this series break out and have some pictures in it, preferably NOT of picture perfect dishes but of her own creations, possibly with the odd demonstrations of the more awkward elements of her dishes.Overall another smash hit with me! LC does well to not be TOO American in her writing or recipe style, although a possible UK/Europe/Oz version would probably go down very well; maybe she could look at some other world recipes and give her brilliant and eye and taste to?","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MF3JVSVW5LIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R22ZFA4#wasThisHelpful","R2MF3JVSVW5LIA","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Totally love the fact that GJ does NOT apologise for being an English author and uses all the correct spellings!He is the master of short, sharp stories and excels at it in this set. Each of the stories are based around residents in a block of flats, GJ cleverly links them all but you can read each one individually, but I challenge you just to read one and not be drawn into finishing the entire set.GJ has pulled a master stroke in managing to link every single story to each other, places, times, people, relevant news items.Really enjoyed all the prologue chatsThe Insomniac:Oh dear, poor obese Trevor is so tired keeping up with demand in his chip shop that he makes a fatal error, his efforts to make good dont go as planned.GJ Manages to do the inner dialogue perfectly giving a great view of the chippy on a Friday night with all its bawdy customers and of Trevor and how he feels about life, family, love and everything really!Then the desire for late night french fries occurs add in a little slip and an incident involving some cling film, mix in some mud and finally a twig!I did not know whether to laugh or cry at the ending, it was so beautifully thought out and executed, this author just blows me away.The Taxidermist:Fred has a disturbingly disgusting desire to start practising on his neighbours cats. Thankfully they decide to not be cooperative.I despise all animal cruelty, even in fictional stories, it was fairly obvious where this story was going but as I follow this author on FB I note that he too is an animal lover and trusted him with my emotions. I was not disappointed although the story made me feel glad in one way it still irked my heart.The horror is slow and painful to endure and made me squirm but ultimately it was the gore that made me cheer.The Butcher:GJ does clich and stereo type so well its wonderfully kitsch!Anton the Russian has been upto naughty things and tension is high in the preparation room but when Anton is giving a promotion he refuses and bloody hell reigns, how do you say no to a drug baron.GJ does well to make you like what should be an unlikable man, then feel his pain at his demise, in a rather unique fashion.The Florist:Elena is just trying to make her orchids grow the best when it all goes a bit wrong.GJ pays such attention to detail I could not help but be drawn into the story. The way he interconnects the characters is charmed, having learnt about Jimmy in The Insomniac and the sister we now meet her in all her weird glory.Elena and her son Jimmy have been busy installing a watering system and she has added a special fertilising ingredient she has found in the Sky High shop.As she gets a good dousing of the newly enhanced misting spray strangeness ensures  riveting reading all the way to the crescendo.The Lovers:Nalin and Isaac seem to have a perfect life until something random happens to change things for them.Having already met the characters I felt like I slipped into their lives unwatched and with the brilliantly researched and factual back history of Nalins life I was engrossed, and sad at the worlds history.During some amazingly erotic love making something awful (and funny) happens and I was left heartbroken at the ending.The Animal Lover:Gertrude cant fit out her apartment door but her animals keep her company.Whilst I love animals the description of the smell in her flat and what the various animals did was enough to make me gag! Over all her cruelty was far worse than Fred the Taxidermists. The ever so accurate portrayal of obesity was both sickening and fascinating.As Gertrude teeters on the edge of a heart attack on her trek around her flat to find her inhaler I found myself breath holding and waiting for the inevitable.  Her finale demise was very slap stick in what appears to be GJ signature way of killing people off, most amusing.The Agoraphobic:Gordon is the building manager with a nice money making side-line involving hidden cameras, so all the goings on are being watched, recorded and broadcast.It is in fact his best night ever with all his regularly voyeurs logging on to watch the mayhem going on in the building, and the revolting Gordon is just watching it all with  signs dancing in his eyes.It was a brilliant way to catch up on what was happening in each flat from another perspective, the time line alone was magnificent in its perfection. In a few sentences GJ summed up the night of horror.When he gets a knock on the door the person on the other side is not who he expected.The Foreigner:GJ launches from one dead body to another, and does it with superb style.Samira is a covert spy and assassin, but she also a complex and sad past, however now is the time she must make a quick escape as Gordons little internet business has alerted authorities to her.GJ could easily write thrillers as he clearly has all the knowledge and skill to lead readers down a dark path of intrigue then set them on fire with the truth.Another amazing little snippet of the bigger story, another sad ending but with that little hint of a giggle.The Geek:Poor schoolboy Benedict is often bullied and left alone by his hard working (and playing) mother, but he has been working hard on his school project and he has a dream.I loved the way GJ interjects all these little comments that just speed you make to other scenes, this would make a brilliant Tarantino style film.In the Epilogue he really rounded up the horror and giggles, tying up every loose end and give an incredible to ride to his readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8QLFORN47W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQMJ7UE#wasThisHelpful","R2D8QLFORN47W7","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a first time collaboration between Mark Tufo and John O'Brien, two authors that are known for their own zompoc series of books, Zombie Fallout for MT and A New World for JOB and it's here in Whistlers that their two main characters both crash land into this strange new world where the worst of their two worlds collide.Michael Talbot, Trip ( aka John the Tripper) and Jack Walker.As I have only read the ZF books (its my hubby that loves Jack Walker) I can say that both writers put their character across easily and leave no guess work.If you haven't already done so I would recommend reading both MT and JOBs books before hand to get some background on the characters and their individual stories, however this IS intended to be a standalone series so more maybe revealed as the books progress.Trip is still my favourite character in almost every book I read barring a few, fantasy novels; and I think he would fit right in there too. He seems to have been given more visionary skills, whereas Mike and Jack have retained their new enhancements from their old worlds.Although I think that some sort of explanation as to why the two have super powers might have helped the newbie reader.Both authors have certainly honed their writing skills now and are able to produce a story line that gels, excels, excites and is basically worth every penny spent. They mash up together very well.I was curious (and worried) as to how two such strong characters (and authors) would be able to blend but its like peas in a pod/flip sides of a coin (yes, yes I know they arent the same!! See, what I did there though!)Fabulous way to introduce the three lunatics to the rest of the world.They have distinctive voices and styles that worked really well with the alternating chapters and PoV, I loved the way a thing would happen to one character and then you would get a different view of the same thing from the other.Left on a knife edge I cannot wait until the next book is released in what, I hope, will be a long series.Negatives; there is a lot of dialogue in here BUT that does allow the characters to merge and the new readers to get to know them, however, it could get tedious for current fans.If you dont like a certain authors style then their character may get on your nerves a bit, personally I dont like all the over egged military stuff so tend not to read about every little nuance regarding guns, bullets and kick backs, again got tedious for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T845I8ZDNUTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHTPPDE#wasThisHelpful","R2T845I8ZDNUTA","A2J6MDUDK4EHWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J6MDUDK4EHWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had so much fun! This magnetic bumper sticker went on my husbands truck. The flexible magnet is 8""x 3.5"" . Brown background, with BIG POOP letters! I had a hard time not laughing as we drove to town. People were laughing, honking their horns, and pointing. He simply couldn't figure out what was going on until we stopped. As he walked around the truck, he spotted it. I just played like I had no idea where it came from. This magnetic bumper sign is 35 mil thick, and super durable.

No more cracked into shards from the metal tray. This silicone ice cube tray makes perfect ice cubes.  Perfect. They even release from the mold perfectly.

"This is a very pretty pillar candle. The candle is 6"" x 3"", and is scent less and smokeless. I am going to place the candle in my Christmas table top decoration. The stark white will look great against the red and green of the arrangement. This has a cotton wick, and burns evenly. I also like that the candle is drip less, I don't have to worry about wax dripping on my arrangement or tablecloth.  The surface is smooth, with no decoration, but no misplaced wax either. This candle will be handy if my power ever goes out. Hopefully I won't have to find that much out!  Definitely a quality made candle.

"I have heard a lot about Stevia. This is a great alternative to regular table sugar.  Sweeteners like aspartame, acesulfame, and sucralose are all made of artificial chemicals and are suspected of promoting serious health disorders.  This Mommy Knows Best Stevia powder is free of all artificial ingredients, fillers and binders. Stevia is a light powder, and a little goes a very long way. I actually was curious, and I tasted the powder.....VERY sweet.  (Stated at 300x as sweet. )  There is an aftertaste, but it isn't as bad as some other artificial sweeteners. This 1.5 oz. container of Stevia powder will go a very long way. For a 2 qt. pitcher, I would only use maybe one or two teaspoons.  But, if you cannot have regular sugar in your diet, this may be a small way to get a little sweetness.

"These black velvet bags are just cute! Each bag is 3"" x 4"", and you get 50 of them with the particular order.  I am tickled!!  These velvet bags are great for anyone that makes jewelry for a craft, or as I am going to use them, a small Christmas gift of maybe a pair of earrings, or a necklace. EVERYTHING will seem more expensive when presented as a gift in the black velvet bag. They top is closed with a nice drawstring. I have looked through each of the 50 bags. Every single one is well made, all the seams are properly stitched, and there was not even ONE that I could complain about. I also paint rocks with cute patterns, (in the summer), and these would be great too send the rocks home with, from the craft shows. Keepsakes, necklaces, rings, earrings, just so many uses! I also think this is a great idea to place jewelry in while traveling. I never take a lot, but the jewelry I do bring, will remain all in one place.

"I love the way Shea butter leaves my hands and skin feeling so soft. This LiveFresh Organic Shea Butter hand cream is awesome! I loved the fragrance as I opened the jar. It comes very nicely packaged. Unscrewing the lid, the jar cover even has a tab for lifting it off the jar, which impresses me, as I don't have to get cream all over trying to use the contents. The organic share butter is a nice white color, and a good, thick cream. (Even holding the jar upside down, the contents didn't budge! )  Rubbing a little onto my hands, arms, and especially my rough elbows, the cream spreads very easily. It absorbed into my skin quickly, and left no greasy or oily feeling, just super soft skin. Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, and Aloe Vera work together to heal and soften my rough, over dry cold weather skin.

"This is a nice starter MANUAL food chopper and processor. PremiumFoodTech has a nice, sturdy product. I ordered this for my daughter. She has her own kitchen now, and I have been helping her stock it. This 3cup capacity manual chopper works well. We chopped a small onion and some tomatoes, which I did slice in half first. (Due to the space limit). It has a clear cup, so you can see what you are doing. There is one insert that has blades, and another that has whisk like attachments. The one with blades is very sharp. You first insert the middle, with whichever tool you need, then add the food. Place the top on, make sure it's tight, and pull the handle to activate the blade. It can be pulled as many times as needed, to get the results you desire. Then loosen the lid, remove the paddle, and use the included scraper to remove the food. So simple! Dishwasher safe too!

"Okay, to be honest, this would be even better with a high quality 100% cotton pillowcase, but this wedge, LIKE EVERY OTHER WEDGE WE OWN, has a thin, poly-cotton, nasty zip off cover. I'm reviewing this wedge for function, and compared to others like it on the market, not against a fantasy object that might be more perfect but doesn't seem to exist.First of all, we own three of these particular Hermell Products wedges (used like a headboard across a King size bed) at 4"" tall; one 12"" wedge for when someone's reflux is acting up (hardest to sleep on!); two 7.5"" wedges that we replaced with this size; and two very shallow wedges designed for a baby crib that are used side by side across the head of a Double bed. All of these wedges came with similar, thin, zip-off poly-cotton covers, except for the baby crib wedges, which have a plastic/waterproof exterior similar to that of standard crib mattresses. Dex Safe Lift Universal Crib WedgeWhy so many wedges? Well, it started because someone has reflux, and that can be very painful, especially when lying down, trying to sleep. I ordered the first wedge upon his doctor's advice. Then, later that year, when one of the kids caught cold, we realized the wedge was also helpful for easing breathing during respiratory infections. The really tall wedge often leads to kids slumping down and sleeping sideways across their beds, however, necessitating middle-of-the-night child re-orientation. (I ordered two lower-height 7"" wedges during that cold & flu season.)In between illnesses, where to store these large, ugly pillows (in their ugly, cheap poly-cotton covers?) I found myself flipping them up on the short, flat end and using them as a backrest in our bed. I discovered that ""Euro"" square shams would squeeze onto the 7"" wedges if I folded down about an inch of foam at the narrow end (and could tolerate a gap on the tie-side at the widest point. That looked almost intentional, but two wedges didn't stretch across the entire King bed, which offended my aesthetic sensibilities and also left a gap where stuff could fall behind the bed. I searched for--and found!--this 4"" wedge size, and they fit, UNFOLDED in matching Euro shams, cover the entire 6 feet width of the bed, and are always on hand if someone needs to turn them around to sleep with his or her head elevated.On two other beds in our home, we use the wedges UNDER the mattress to elevate the head of the bed, thus allowing the sleeper to use a regular pillow and case against the skin. On the double bed (using roughly 1.5"" baby crib wedges), you don't even notice the elevation of the head when you walk into the room. Using a 7"" wedge under a (latex) twin mattress results in an obviously elevated head of the bed, so that wouldn't work for someone who cares more about the appearance of the bed than the function.As a heavy user of these objects, I do zip off and wash the covers regularly (some shrink, most don't), but mostly we avoid sleeping directly on the cover, treating it more like a mattress pad than like a sheet. Most of us like our regular pillow, for softness, ON TOP of the wedge. For a kid who doesn't want that extra height, I'll put the wedge under the bedsheets, or tuck an extra flat sheet (or thicker blanket or even a towel if it's a stomach illness) around the wedge for extra protection.If you're going to use your wedge all the time and don't want to fuss with loose covers, try a Euro sham. Since that big square size is less popular, you can often find inexpensive ones in discount stores.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVG8UW3VF5QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KPN7WI#wasThisHelpful","R3VVG8UW3VF5QP","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My vest arrived and I charged up the battery and tested it at home. It seemed to work as expected.As far as fit, I have a tricky figure for most modern styles. I've got a short torso, but am also very hourglass shaped, with a slightly wider hip than bust now that I'm over 40. (I should wear a 10 across my back, but need a 12/14 top to accomodate the bust. My waist is a 10/12, but my hips usually need size 14.) Having read that a close fit was vital to heating effectiveness, I crossed my fingers and bought the medium, per the size chart. The medium does fit, and I can zip it fully closed, but it is just a touch closer than I'd prefer in the hip and at the fullest part of my bust, while the waist is loose. None of this is unexpected. I think this vest fits true to modern size, just not MY size.My purpose for this vest is an annual trip to an outdoor theatre festival in October where it typically dips down into the 40's at night. Last year, I froze, and my physical discomfort was the only negative in an otherwise marvelous experience. This year, I wore the heated ANSAI vest under my long, down coat. I was very comfortable, sometimes even opening the zipper on my top layer because I got too warm. I used the 25% heat setting most of the time (it was mild this year), bumping it up to 75% on the coldest night for the second act.Three hours at the theatre didn't even come close to running down the battery under my usage conditions.Personally, I would prefer a softer (no wind-proof outer shell) vest with a more fitted, hourglass silhouette, but this vest as is served my needs and added greatly to my comfort at my favorite event of the year. I'm very glad I bought it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BG1VUGQYDGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VWCMW8#wasThisHelpful","R21BG1VUGQYDGH","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got exactly what I wanted with this item, and felt the price was reasonable for the utility of the tub and the fairly small market in the USA for this type of product.For many years, I have thought that I would prefer a deeper tub that was less oblong and more square. Sometime along the way I learned that the Japanese use tubs of this shape. I imagined that I might someday remodel an American bathroom to have such a tub for myself. Then I grew up, got a job, got married, bought a house, had kids, and realized that remodeling is a nightmare and I may never do a total reno job like I watched on home & garden television in my youth. We did move from our first home--with a peeling, badly refinished cast iron tub that was too gross to sit in--to a home of Barbie Dream House proportions with a beautiful master bathroom containing... a tub the size of the entire bathroom at my old house. I mean seriously, you could put 4 adults in this giant whirlpool tub. That's when I read up on the biofilm that lives inside whirlpool jets, and I lost most of my interest in soaking in my beautiful new home's bloated tub.(I'm prone to long stories, so I'll mention that the enormous whirlpool also leaked into our kitchen due to a dried out seal on the drain the one and only time we filled it 1/3 way full and ran the jets. The faucet was also clogged with a ball of sediment. Basically, a tub this size is too ridiculous for anyone to actually fill and use, so it dried up and died in the mausoleum that is our beautiful marble master bathroom...)Back to my folding, portable bathtub!Due to some health issues that are causing me aching joints, I got to thinking about my dream tub again. I read about a portable (fiberglass, like a ""real"" built-in tub) ofuro in someone's blog. That one was only $900! Oh wait, I've never actually used such a tub. I just THINK I want one. $900 is ridiculous for a whim. Finally searching Amazon for ""ofuro"" lead me to this product listing a few a like it.A two figure price tag (less than 10% of the one from the blog) made this purchase an easy one for me. I could afford it, and I really wanted to try it.The box arrived in fine condition, taped shut, with all expected parts inside, and carefully labeled in a language I don't understand. I actually think I saw Korean characters, but that's a guess, not a fact. It is true that the instruction sheet was also in an Asian language I don't read. That said, the ""assembly"" process consisted of:* unfold the wadded up plastic tub until it is tub shaped, like a wider, shorter trash can* insert white PVC tubes into plastic sheaths built onto tub shaped tub with the ends that look like feet on the OUTSIDE* inflate the ring around the top so it stops toppling over under its own weightI had a little fight with the cheap plastic pump included in the package. (My yoga balls and other fitness gear all came with the same style of cheap pump.) Then I realized this little ring of inflated stuff was not very big, so I just blew it up by mouth in about three breaths. The pump is NOT a deal break for assembly!Now I had a tub! It looked cheap. It smelled of stinky new plastic (and I am sensitive to such odors.) But it was in my bathroom, and it looked human sized. I let it air out by an open window for a couple of days before we filled it.Once again, I'm going to point out that my master bathroom is a little unusual in that it is the size of two bedrooms in my former 1910's home. The tub in its tiled surround is the size of New Jersey, there's lots of walking around room, the toilet has its own good-sized cubby, and the shower is a nice, extra deep, double-header. For my situation, employing the Folding Bathtub is very, VERY easy and I wasn't worried about leaks: the whole thing fits at one end of my shower enclosure and it doesn't even cover the center drain. (The 85 cm diameter top works out to about 33"" across, so this tub would definitely fit in a 36"" square shower stall, but that would be a very different experience for drainage, etc., than exists in my large shower.) If it had leaked or self-destructed once filled, all the water would've been contained in my case, making the experiment very easy for me. If I were using this outside of a ""wet room"" (room with a drain in the floor) or outdoors, I WOULD TEST IT OUTSIDE WITH THE HOSE before filling it on my living room carpet!That said, this tub is made of thick, sturdy plastic. The strong odor took about a week and a half to dissipate in a large bathroom at a time of year that windows could be left open most of the time. I also ran the shower exhaust fan for several hours at a time to aid in sucking the stink out of it. It does stink when new. The smell does decrease over time.My little son took the first bath in the tub. 1) He's been dying for a tub bath most of his life, and rarely got one after outgrowing his inflatable baby tub. 2) We didn't fill it very full in case it leaked, but that was plenty of water for a young grade-schooler. 3) I wasn't sure I would easily get in and out of this tall new tub with my joint issues, whereas the little guy can be lifted out by me (in a pinch) or my husband (no pinching required.)We've learned to fill the tub to about the user's knee level to have a nice, but not neck-level fill upon sitting down. Whomever is about to use the tub can stand in the shower stall and eyeball the water level, using the ""knee high"" test to decide when to shut off the shower flow. The little guy is impatient and usually gets in before the water is even at his knees. This gives him a bath level much like a standard Western tub. He has one boat that he takes in with him, and he has a good time. He uses water set at about 90 F. (Yeah, our fancy new house has showers that you turn on with the desired temp pre-set, too. It's really cool!)I make the little guy wash with soap on the other side of the shower (double-headed shower, see above) before taking his soak. When he's done, I turn the temp up to 110 F and fill the tub up to the tops of my knees to get the soaking temperature I've been dreaming of all these years. I am feeling really, REALLY much happier about our water usage knowing that we're at least getting two soaks out of a fill up of this tub, and also that the total volume of water is so much more reasonable than our giant built in one.The highest I've filled the water was at ""thigh high stocking"" level on my leg. (I got distracted.) I actually thought the tub would overflow when I sat down, but the water came up right under my lower lip. I will say, the sensation of weightlessness was vastly increased by this higher water level, but I didn't feel quite as relaxed as I do with water just above my shoulders. I highly recommend performing the experiment to see which water level relaxes you the most.Emptying the tub is really easy. There is an exterior valve with a twistable on-off handle that lets you drain all but the last few inches of water out the side. After that, we have room in our tub to tip it over and dump the last few inches. When I'm feeling normal to well, I can do this myself. If my joints are flaring, I ask my husband to do it. A normal woman (not physically challenged) should be able to dump the last bit of water. It isn't that heavy. IF YOUR SHOWER STALL IS VERY SMALL this might get tricky, and then the little plug in the bottom of the tub might be called for. I've never even opened that plug on my tub. (It is exactly like the one in all inflatable wading pools. Clear plastic, round, about the size of a US quarter and 1/4-1/2"" deep, pressing into a same-size open hole...)I want to speak to two very important aspects of this tub that concerned me before purchase in case my experience can help you decide:1) GETTING IN AND OUTI'm fortunate to have this in a tiled shower enclosure. If I need to, I can lean my weight on the adjoining wall when getting in and out. I don't have grab bars, however. Those would make this experience MORE SAFE. I do have an autoimmune disorder (although mild) and many tricky joints (pain, weakness.) Before my sickness, I was relatively fit and flexible, however, and I can rise up from sitting cross legged to standing without any support when my joints aren't too inflamed. Before using this tub, it would be wise to attempt this maneuver (rising from cross-legged without support) on a regular floor to see how you do. THE WATER PROVIDES ASSISTANCE with its buoyancy, so I find it very easy to stand up from the bottom of the tub, even when mildly inflamed, but I was able to do so very well within the past year or so without any outside help. Getting out of the tub is easier than getting up from the floor due to the water's buoyancy assist.All this said, I did have my husband stay nearby for my first few baths, just in case. Getting up out of a steamy tub can make me dizzy. My joints can surprise me (and not in that good, breakfast in bed way...) It hasn't been an issue for me, thank God, but I would strongly recommend considering safety if you try this tub and you have health issues.2) TUB SIZEI'm a plump but not obese, short (5' 3"") and short-torsoed woman. I bought this larger size because I wanted more room at the bottom for my (ahem) bottom. With the 85 cm diameter (at the top) tub, no part of me needs to touch the plastic sides of the tub. I was grossed out by the idea of touching slimy plastic, though, thus far, my tub isn't slimy. :) Sitting cross legged, I have about an inch of clearance around me on all sides in the bottom of the tub.The HEIGHT of this tub (I think 70cm? = 27.5 inch) is just a smidge higher than I'd prefer. I CAN (and usually do) pull down a bit on the inflated upper edge and use it as a neck pillow, leaning back slightly so that the tiled tub enclosure supports me with the inflated ring softening the experience. I can be claustrophobic, and would like this tub better if it were about 3"" shorter so my eyes were peeping out instead of just the top of my head being above the rim. It is big enough that I don't freak out. (Also, I dim the lights and take my baths in a fairly dark room, so that eases my visual discomfort.)IF I WERE TO BUY ANOTHER PORTABLE TUB, I might opt for a slightly longer, OVAL shape tub so I could opt to have my knees bent in front of me but not folded. I think a somewhat smaller radius for the end of the oval would be fine, but about another 10-12 inches in length, and almost as much depth, would be my ideal tub. I haven't had a major joint flare since I started using the tub, but I can imagine being in such bad shape that I couldn't bend enough to get cross-legged (criss cross applesauce sitting, known as ""Indian style"" when I was a child.)SHOULD YOU TRY THIS TUB?* If you've always thought you'd like a Japanese style, deep soaking tub (or ofuro) but never had a chance to experience one, this is good way to try it out.* If you crave a soak that gets your shoulders fully submerged and have no joint or balance issues that could make it tricky to get in or out, try this.* If you find it difficult to get in and out of a standard, built-in Western tub, this product is probably not safe for your use as it is at least as hard to enter or exit, and possibly harder, than a built-in tub.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJ40SAJK3BHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XSXQIO#wasThisHelpful","R1WJ40SAJK3BHQ","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is scholarly in format, and somewhat formal in tone. I expected that, and appreciated the citations and primary sources for the work.That said, I don't believe I've ever found a scholarly tome more readable--simply ENJOYABLE to read--than I did this book.I heard about this book on a website discussing seasonal affective disorder. That more medical site mentioned the pre-modern notion of ""first sleep"" followed by a brief waking period, and then the later stage of ""second sleep."" That was enough to make me seek out the book.I'll agree with another reviewer that Ekirch did circle back multiple times to similar themes, but I never found his prose wasted. There was always a point to the digression. If anything, I might describe it as a circling down, deeper and deeper, into the meat of each point with a slightly different slant each time.Perhaps this is a book that will only interest a more scholarly sort of reader? I'm sure it isn't for everyone, but I found it a thumping good read! I even nudged my husband once or twice to say, ""hey, you wouldn't believe how much I'm enjoying this book!"" I read often, and I read things I like, but every minute of this particular book had me in my happy place. It was full of new information for me to assimilate so I felt smart, but it went down easily even at the end of a busy day when my thoughts should've been turning to my own sleep.I would say this was definitely more scholarly than, say, ""How the Irish Saved Civilization,"" and yet every bit as smooth and easy to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FZPNIKHBAWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393329011#wasThisHelpful","R20FZPNIKHBAWN","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Especially when a product has no other reviews, I feel compelled to write one promptly and before I've thoroughly used the item. That's even trickier in this case, since I'm reviewing an instructor's book before our school year even begins.I'm a mom who has one child enrolled in school and another learning with me at home. The one in school is learning Spanish, although in a light, casual, once a week way (not immersion or anything like that.) My mother is fluent in Spanish, and I studied it for six years in school, so I'm familiar with the language, but not actively learning it myself. My home schooler is learning German and Russian, so I'm getting more mental exercise with those languages these days.This workbook seems like a nice elementary-level classroom resource for a professional teacher who likes to teach crafts and cooking. If I'd had a ""look inside"" view of this book, I might not have purchased it since I'm looking for something more academic to complement my child's artsy craftsy exposure to Spanish at school. I'm not lowering my review based upon lack of fit, however, as this book didn't promise anything that wasn't delivered in terms of format/structure.CULTUREAfter flipping through the whole book, I note that the majority of the activities are based upon Mexican culture (according to the notes for each project), with one each from Puerto Rico, Panama, la Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Guatemala. A few activities also reference ""Latin American"" culture and don't specify a more localized region. Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think the title promised just a bit more of a general ""Spanish"" culture when it is more accurate to say ""Latin American"" culture.ACTIVITIESThe activities seem to be mostly designed around affordable, easily found items being used to create ""in the style of"" Latin American artifacts. One example would be making a huipil (ladies' embroidered blouse) by embellishing a t-shirt with fabric markers according to traditional patterns. There's a similar activity using a large, adult size t-shirt to make a poncho. These are fine activities, but designed to bring attention to a native craft's existence while making a rather far-removed version for oneself.As a mom, I'd guess that my kids would enjoy and learn something from doing these activities. On the other hand, since I can work one on one with my own children and that also alleviates many budget pressures in our case, I would be more likely to engage in more authentic craft experiences (actual simple embroidery or a real pottery class) than something like painting a traditional pottery pattern onto a paper plate.The book is 52 pages long. My quick count shows 18 ""Exploring Spanish Through Art"" activities, 18 """"Exploring Spanish Through Cooking"" activities, and 11 ""Exploring Spanish Through Games"" activities. None of them seem to be essential duplicates or particularly unworthy. I did note that a game with a ""London Bridge is Falling Down"" type of game with a song (""A la vbora"") doesn't have any written music for the lyrics, so I would be forced to go to online to complete this activity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23Z29AU4378VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0974631302#wasThisHelpful","R23Z29AU4378VA","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went back and forth for a few minutes about whether to rate 4 or 5 stars. I ended up with 5 because these (I bought two) rugs are PRECISELY what I wanted for the balcony off of my kitchen. They arrived on time, in excellent condition, and in rather beautiful jute packaging, and they have held up for two months without any fading or deterioration.My new home is contemporary, and there is a long, narrow deck (balcony, actually) off of the kitchen. Both the kitchen and adjacent dining room have full walls of glass overlooking this balcony. Now, our house sat empty and unloved for over two years before we bought it, so we've got some exterior work to do, including replacing the deteriorating balcony. It is wood, and it is rotting/peeling/etc. Luckily, the railings are wood with aluminum and look fine. We're replacing our entire roof and many skylights in a VERY expensive project this summer, so the deck will have to wait. In the meantime, how do I enjoy my beautiful ocean view (okay, peek-a-boo view!) and gorgeous green landscape with rotting grey deck boards assaulting my eyes? The answer: these plastic rug/mats.I must add that my kitchen is very neutral, which is great (after our first home had a 1950's pink & aqua monstrosity of a kitchen) but kind of gets me down. I'm a deep, jewel-tone, color-everywhere kind of person. I've added a bunch of dark purple, mustard yellow & deep red accents, which help a lot with bringing the white-washed oak and white/black tile in line with my tastes, but seeing the deep purple and white Tangier-Plum & White rug through all that glass has made a big impact on my boring kitchen.I like these mats so much that I might buy a third to use under the kitchen table on the INSIDE! Yes, I totally agree that these are more of an outside rug product, but my children are messy little punks, and a rug I can hose off appeals to me a whole lot more than any fine Persian rug would at this stage of our family life.It is absolutely true that these are fairly lightweight. In our (coastal New England) climate, it is vital to have heavy object sitting somewhere on the rug to prevent it from blowing away when thunderstorms pass through. Since we have a couple of flower pots, an umbrella (in a heavy stand) and a table with chairs, this was a trivial problem for our situation.The best part about these rugs is how deep and intense the purple color is. I am NOT a lavender lady; I'm a Purple Person! This is exactly the shade that I hoped these rugs would be.Could they be cheaper and make me more happy? Yes, that would be great! However, I feel that I got exactly what I paid for, and I don't regret the purchase or the purchase price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RK05S948SQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZ183PC#wasThisHelpful","R11RK05S948SQI","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I struggled a bit with how to rate this show. I'll speak to my opinion of the entire first season.To begin with, I'm a serious theatre lover, and someone who hates musicals. I like foreign films and edgy comedy. I really like artsy, boundary-pushing shows. On the other hand, while there was a lot of very interesting stuff in Transparent, and Jeffrey Tambour gives an amazing performance, I didn't really enjoy watching this show. I don't find it funny very often. Mostly, I find it incredibly sad.I'm not troubled by the level of graphic sex in this show because of what it is, but I did feel while I was watching that I was watching *gratuitously* graphic sex. Much like levels of gore (*ahem* Quentin Tarantino) that seem like a lazy layer of icing on what could be a genius cake, it seemed to me that the characters in this show were so self-absorbed, so pathetic, so unlikeable, that the graphic sex acts as a yellow highlighter of selfishness smeared all over each fornicating character. Maybe, being so old-fashioned as to find sex a beautiful, natural act of love and joy, I'm just not hip enough to ""get it"" in this series?I also hold a very liberal position on adults making adult choices, alone or together. The part of this show that I did like was the fascinating process of Jeffrey Tambour's character finally blossoming into the woman he's always known was inside himself. This is sensitively done, and feels very honest, real, and, finally making the title ring true!--""Transparent!""Is it meant to be a metaphor that the father's years of hiding her true self from the world led to such insufferable consequences in the characters of her three children? This is the part I struggle with. The adult children are all vile. I can't enjoy any scene where they are the center of attention. No amount of interesting story line makes up for the pain I experience contemplating the existence of people like this.I wonder if this is why Middle America hates the coasts? I grew up in the Pacific NW, and I live in a liberal New England city, but I believe in morality (mostly as what one must live for oneself, not as a threat to hold up to the throat of others.) The very idea that these characters could seem believable to anyone leaves me reeling. I find them very hard to imagine as real.Toward the end of the season, there's an episode in which the youngest daughter has a bizarre, dis-associative date with a very butch lesbian. That storyline was one of the few I felt was actually pretty compelling and it has stuck in my mind for weeks. More character development like this, that seems like real, flawed human behavior instead of a sociopathic impulse to work as counter to human goodness as possible, could bring me back to give season two a chance.There is really good acting here, and an aggressively edgy script. I wish the totality of the subject matter made it worth watching for me. I am legitimately baffled as to what others find to love in it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3UJS8WJ92E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3MNF6S#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3UJS8WJ92E","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My order was fulfilled by TheNewMall in July 2015. I ordered ""Traumeel Pain Relief Gel"" and received T-Relief gel instead. I was disappointed, as I hoped the item name/description would be accurate. I'd read enough other reviews to know it was likely I would receive the new US distributed product instead.I've been using this on my hands several times a day for about a week now. It certainly isn't causing me any problems, but I'm unable to say for certain that it helps me, either. I'm inclined to say that it is not helping, or not helping very much. On the other hand, at least I have something that feels constructive to do when my pain flares. (My diagnosis is uncertain at this point, but it may be an autoimmune problem. My pain is almost constant and I'm also taking prescription medication for it. I'm using this for joint pain.)I will continue to use this as I don't see the harm and I will try almost anything at this point (that doesn't add side effects.) If I find over time that it helps enough to reorder this product, I will update my review and increase my rating. I'd say it is affordable enough that it is worth trying if you have pain.

"My son has a medical condition that makes wearing a medical ID bracelet a smart idea. First, I bought one designed just for kids, but he disliked it. It was this type: AllerMates Insect Sting Allergy Wristband Bizzzy. I thought he would enjoy the cartoonish design, but I think he found it babyish. (He was in kindergarten at the time.)He loves to wear a paracord bracelet, but I wasn't eager to spend a lot of money on an ID bracelet with engraving for a child who might 1) lose it or 2) outgrow the condition or change medications.This was a nice compromise. It was inexpensive. If he loses it, I won't be mad. This is soft enough and thin enough that it is fairly unobtrusive on his wrist. He insists that it go above his paracord bracelet because he says that ""feels better"" against his hand, but he's been willing to wear this.I like that I can write on it with a Sharpie and replace it several times before I approach the cost of an engraved model. I could even apply a label-maker printed sticker to update info temporarily, like with local contact info if we travel. I suspect a label would stick for at least several days on this smooth rubbery material.My needs were met at a fair price. I'm happy.*** EDIT after 4 months use ***I'm taking my review down from 5 to 4 stars. My son still really likes to wear this bracelet, but one of the snaps has broken and this is now quite tricky for him to remove or put on without the broken snap falling down and rolling away, necessitating a big production while we're trying to peacefully prepare for bed. Yes, he's worn it almost every day for a few months, and it is removed most evenings because he doesn't like the feeling of pulling sleeves over it. I think the snaps should hold up longer than this for me to be more satisfied. (Over a year, I suppose!)Also, the Sharpie writing wears off pretty quickly, eliminating its usefulness for a medical safety alert unless I check EVERY DAY to see that my son's vital information is still legible. I think it is wearing off more quickly now than in the beginning, but I'm not sure whether that's possible. Maybe I'm just more annoyed to re-write it now than in June? At any rate, I'm happier overall with the Small Adult - Teen Adjustable Medical Alert ID Bracelet~Charcoal velcro bracelet and its slip-out medical ID card. My son still likes his paracord bracelet the most (as a style statement) and this one second.Consider this bracelet if your kid isn't all that likely to need medical help without a knowing adult nearby, or if you've tried the other types and the kid won't wear them. You'll need to keep checking that the info is on this one, and you may need to replace it after a few months. It is affordable enough to be worth that bit of trouble, in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H3O54B7HTFFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW1PIHU#wasThisHelpful","R2H3O54B7HTFFB","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These underpants were bought in size 8 for a child who is just growing into that size. He's a younger sibling, so he's used to wearing hand-me-down Hanna Andersson undies in size Medium.

My child likes these perfectly well, and they cost a whole lot less than our usual brands (HA and Polarn O.

"Amazon tells me I bought this back in 2012.I'm a naturally lazy, geeky lady who only started exercising routinely around five years ago when life (and a couple of pregnancies) left me sore from normal daily activities like carrying groceries and/or my toddler. I have consistently done strength training 2-3x/week since then, however, and at least a couple of hours of vigorous cardio, too, so now I think I'm in the top 20% of activity for Americans! (That makes me sad, actually.)I bought the RumbleRoller when I realized that, sometimes, my strength training activities would cause knots (trigger points) that led to migraine headaches. Overall, my increased physical fitness has DECREASED my incidence of migraines (a condition I have suffered since age 9), but, if I've taken a vacation, the sudden return to intense activity can lead to painful consequences (i.e., migraines) that I'd prefer to avoid.The Rumble Roller is three years old, used moderately (several times per week between two adults of moderate size), and looks and feels exactly like new. It is an awesome tool for digging into tight muscles, and I'm glad we got it.The kids play with it. They step on it and toss it around. Sometimes, they even ""use"" it. My husband and I both grab it once in a while and actually use it as designed.I have other products made by ""TriggerPoint Therapy"" and I was really on the fence back in 2012 over which foam roller with nubs to purchase, but I'm still glad I opted for the Rumble Roller. I still doubt that the flatter nubs on the GRID roller would work quite so well. (That said, I'm also still glad I bought the ""Runner's Six"" set Trigger Point Performance Ultimate-6 Self-Myofascial Release and Deep Tissue Massage Kit with Guidebook (Updated and Revised) by them. It's great!)A plain (smooth) foam roller is better than no foam roller at all. I think The GRID Trigger Point Performance The Grid Revolutionary Foam Roller or the Rumble Roller are much better than plain foam rollers, at least for the kind of knots that I develop in my upper back and shoulders. If you have chronic muscle tension and pain, consider looking into trigger point therapy, by a professional or on your own. It can be pretty amazing stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9UN8HY9FIP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4YWDO4#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9UN8HY9FIP8","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm returning these shoes. I ordered two pairs of Propet shoes (Propet Women's Mary Lou Mary Jane Sneaker) and one pair of New Balance velcro sneakers New Balance Women's WW411H Health Walking Shoe at one time, looking for something comfortable enough for problem feet (must wear custom hard orthotic inserts at all times) with fasteners I can do up quickly and even on a day my fingers give me trouble.Now, in spite of my health conditions mentioned above, I'm active and 40 years old, not elderly or generally infirm. These were some of the cutest (cute in the realm of COMFORT SHOES) shoes I've tried on in quite a while. At least in the buff color, I think these can kind of disappear at the end of bare legs as a tolerable summer shoe for those of us with sensitive feet.However, I'm returning these because the RIGHT shoe fit perfectly, but the LEFT shoe felt much too small through the arch/instep. In order to fasten the velcro, I had to pull them much to tight to be comfortable. It could be that my left foot was swollen, except that I tried on all three pairs of shoes within the same half hour and didn't have this issue with any other pair. I believe the shoes were made poorly such that there was too much difference in size between left and right.My everyday shoes are Ahnu Sugarpine mesh sneakers/light hikers like theseAhnu Women's Sugarpine Air Mesh Hiking Shoe.

"I've used Persil detergent before, but I thought the tabs might be easier for me to store. They are, and I'd recommend them for people, like me, who use different detergents for different types of laundry. Laundry detergent powder becomes less effective after the box is opened and it is exposed to air. Closing the lid every time helps, but buying a big, economy box isn't always a good idea unless you will use the product up quickly.These tabs are wrapped with two to each cellophane package inside the cardboard box. The box is also shorter in height and wider than the usual tall/narrow detergent box. I think this is less likely to get tipped over as a result, and the wrapped tabs would prevent any mess if this box did get upended somehow.Persil has a distinct fragrance. It reminds me of the smell of Comet cleanser from my childhood, but it has been decades since I last smelled that, so it may not be similar except in my memory. I actually kind of like the smell, but perhaps only because it reminds me of my mother and therefore smells so very ""clean""! I usually choose Free & Clear detergents, and I don't use Persil on clothing that will be worn next-to-skin on my child with eczema. I use Persil for my cleaning towels and my white bathroom towels and any white clothing that has stubborn stains.When I've used Persil for stained clothing, it hasn't triggered a rash in my eczema-prone child yet, but I don't care to risk it for everyday use on his clothing or bedding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VHT4O3TZA70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVH14O4#wasThisHelpful","R10VHT4O3TZA70","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a child with allergies and eczema. His skin is easily irritated, and he ends up with painful, inflamed skin around his nose and upper lip every winter. Since I fare better using cloth vs. disposable paper/plastic products against my own sensitive skin, I decided to try handkerchiefs for him this year.I ordered two products from this company, these, and the Childs' Organic Cotton Handkerchiefs, Small 8""x8"", White (Set of 3). For a busy little boy, I figured it was safer to have at least a handful of hankies if I wanted him to get in the habit of reaching for them.Personally, I find the flannel hankies softer and more enticing than the smooth cotton (percale? sateen?) of these. My son, on the other hand, immediately declared that he wanted to carry the smooth woven ones. He also wants to wear a suit and tuck one into his breast pocket, but he's a bit of a fancy dresser. I explained that a pocket square and a functional handkerchief should probably be separate items, especially for a little boy who wants to play in the snow/mud/sand, but he still reaches for the smooth hankies first. Clearly, it is a matter of personal preference which hankie should be applied to one's nose!As far as nose-wiping goes, a handkerchief works just as well as a tissue. That point is pretty well proven by history.Some people have hygiene objections to using cloth. I will point out that:1) Many people now, and almost all people until this past generation, used, washed and re-used cloth diapers, even before the advent of modern hot water heaters and automatic washing machines. If those can be hygienically cleaned, a hankie is child's play!2) The argument that sticking a used hankie in your pocket is revolting completely ignores that fact that, while a used tissue can (and should) be dropped immediately into a waste container, they are OFTEN stuffed into pockets when no trash can is conveniently located. As a mom, I end up with my kids' used tissues in my hands/car/pockets, not even just my own. (Ick!) My kids leave tissues in their pockets and I end up with white fuzz all over the laundry. Hankies are no less gross than this, and will solve the laundry issue.In particular, I ordered two little washable pouches (Bumkins Reusable Snack Bag, Traffic & Gray Chevron, 2-count) to use as hankie-holders in little boy pockets. In retrospect, I realized that I really want a two-compartment (but tiny!) pouch to have a clean side and a dirty side for daily carrying, but that is something I would likely make use of, while my kids would mix up the clean with the dirty anyway.3) Learning to wash one's hands frequently, especially before eating, will alleviate most of the gross pocket problem anyway. I don't expect my kids to avoid touching dirt/trees/bugs, because they won't learn and grow nearly so well without those experiences, so hand-washing is a must. Focusing on that leaves me free to save a tree and use a handkerchief. It is likely to be the least disgusting thing in my son's pocket on wash day...","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCJ95KG4F4UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LR6NS2#wasThisHelpful","R2SCJ95KG4F4UV","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jim Weiss and his stories are very popular in our family. We've probably got a dozen of his recordings.""Treasure Island"" was a Hanukkah gift to my kids last year. My home schooled 5th grader read the book as part of his English curriculum, and sharing the audio book shortly thereafter both reinforced the story in his memory and allowed his little brother to share in and enjoy our discussion of the novel.This isn't my favorite classic novel, but it is certainly an enjoyable read. Weiss' version obviously isn't as complete as the unabridged book, and it wasn't too scary for my 7 year old. It is about pirates, however, who take over the ship belonging to the good guys (and get up to pirate mischief, including murder, which is reported but not TOO graphically.)

"I've got to agree with previous reviewers--these run about one size small. Normally, I order a size 8 in underpants, and these fit just right in size 9.Since I listened and got the right size, I can comment on comfort with a properly fitting garment!These are thicker/heftier cotton than Felina and Jockey cotton underwear I've bought in the past. I would agree that these can have some visible panty line as a result. The (not unattractive) lace border at the top only adds to the show-through. Since my clothing is pretty modest, this isn't a big issue for me, but these aren't my choice for, say, going to the gym where I might wear a legging and have some exposure.Neither the waistband nor the legs are binding or uncomfortable. Aside from being one size larger than I usually buy, these fit me very well. My weight is primarily in my hips but I'm not thin in the thighs, so I think the leg opening is standard FOR ONE SIZE SMALLER THAN THE PACKAGE STATES.Probably because of the sizing issue, the price on these was great.

I like the individual rolls of bags inside the large box, each one well sized to leave in the base of the household trash cans so it is quick and easy to replace the bag when the trash goes out.

"Like another reviewer, I bought these primarily for travel medication containers. The 4 mL bottle is really tiny, and perfect for carrying just a couple of pills in one's purse. My doctor told me to keep one prescription with me at all times, and this is much smaller than anything they could offer at my pharmacy. My pharmacy labels include a small, peel-off sticker with the basic Rx information which I taped around the vial in case any questions ever arise about what I'm carrying.It is worth noting that these are regular screw top bottles, and are therefore not child safe if storing dangerous medications. The user will have to take responsibility for keeping these away from little hands!My preference with travel toiletries is to use really, REALLY tiny bottles on short trips--just enough to get me through a couple of days, which means less than one ounce of shampoo and perhaps a vial this tiny for a facial toner or exfoliant that I use sparingly. The rigidity of these bottles makes them less convenient for very thick creams. For those, I prefer the screw top jars in 1 oz size.

"I'm rating this product for its convenient application and use as sun protection.I use sun protective clothing because I've never found a sunscreen that doesn't break my skin out terribly. All chemical sunscreens have an odor that gives me headaches. Even creams with minerals as the active ingredients are too heavy for my sensitive (yet primarily oily) skin. I have to be careful about shampoo, even, because my skin breaks out along the hairline.I'd tried mineral makeup before (Bare Escentuals and a small, locally made brand) but found something in them irritating. I now suspect bismuth oxy(?chloride?) but I'm not sure what the ingredient was that made me itch. (An Amazon listing for Colorscience Sunforgettable lists bismuth oxychloride for the product, but the brand website does not, so I can't give a definitive answer for whether that ingredient is in these products at this time.)I've added an exfoliation step (Paula's Choice Resist Daily Pore-Refining Treatment 2% BHA - 3 oz) to my skin care over the past six months or so, and, while I love what it is doing for my skin, I'm concerned that winter is over and my exfoliated facial skin needs more protection from the sun as UV levels increase into the summer. I'm trying two brands of powder mineral sunscreens in hope I will finally have a workable solution to regular sun protection that doesn't lead to pimples or painful allergic bumps.This product is hands down the easiest thing to apply. Untwist the cap, pull out the brush, rub on the powder.I applied this like eye shadow, and the color looks fine that way with no other makeup. My normal day face is washed, toned & exfoliated. I use lip balm, but usually that isn't even tinted. When I say NO MAKE UP, I mean zero cosmetics on top of my facial skin. I could wear this all alone in an eye shadow position and I wouldn't look weird.Brushed over the underye area, too, I felt the need to apply the other mineral sunscreen on top to even out the coverage. I bought a refill of the Colorscience brush on sun screen Colorescience Pro Sunforgettable SPF 50 Brush Refill-Tan and a less expensive, un-tinted formula Bee Sunny Sport SPF 35 Mineral Powder Sunscreen Zinc Oxide & Titanium Big Jar from Queen Bee to mix my own lighter shade and fill several small shakers to keep in every car and bathroom at home. After applying this home-mixed mineral sunscreen on top, I didn't look particularly made up and I didn't find the Eye Camoflage product noticeable anymore. Outdoors on a walk with my husband, he claimed my face looked ""normal"".Having just started with these products, it's a little early to tell if I will react badly, but my face isn't itchy at the end of the day as it was with Bare Escentuals makeup. I'll update this review if irritation develops after a couple of weeks' trial.I purchased these pots (Coastal Scents 10 Gram Round Sifter Jar (25 Pack)) and these brushes (Change Makeup Tools Foundation Brush Bamboo Handle Brush) for storing and applying my homemade mineral sunscreen mix. This combination gave me three full sets of brush-on sun screen for less than one applicator tube of the Sunforgettable product by Colorscience at its normal price. Adding the Queen Bee powder made my grand total around $61, which exceeds the retail price of the Colorscience applicator, but gives me at several times as much sunscreen product to apply. Consider buying a refill to test the Colorscience Sunforgettable first, too, if your skin is sensitive! Any clean make up brush can be used to apply.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SH6VCDEQFIXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00819SXF6#wasThisHelpful","R2SH6VCDEQFIXX","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I borrowed this book from my local library, read it all the way through, and just purchased a Kindle copy for my personal library.I don't have a diagnosis for my joint pain yet, but Rheumatoid Arthritis is a possibility. I've done quite a bit of reading on the internet, and I've met with a highly regarded rheumatologist at a Boston hospital. I would say that I came to this book already well-versed in the current understanding of RA and its treatments.I'm not sure that I learned very many totally new facts about RA, but I did find the presentation of information in this book to be excellent, and the comprehensiveness (in terms of details) really wonderful. I decided that purchase of the book was justified just by the chapters on exercise (including specifics) and medications/treatments.The exercise chapter covers what could be appropriate exercises for three broad categories of RA status: Very Inflamed Joints, Moderately Inflamed Joints and Controlled Joints. There's one chapter on overall activity and health, and another full of specific exercises, such as range of motion exercises (with illustrations.) This was far more helpful to me than advice to ""avoid damaging exercises"" that I've heard elsewhere! I've been doing strength training with weights for several years, and I wanted very clear, specific advice on what a good exercise program for a person diagnosed with RA might be if that's the diagnosis I end up with. I plan to show this chapter to my rheumatologist and confirm whether his advice matches the general advice Dr. Shlotzhauer offers in the book.Similarly, I've read descriptions of the various DMARDS and biologics on lots of websites, but here they are tidily packaged in one place, and the author has included a table of side effects (with their frequency of incidence) for each one. I could've printed all of this out from the internet, but this is a nice, and seemingly very complete, set of information for me to bring to my doctor visits.About the only thing missing from this book that I personally find really vital to my own choices in treatment options is information about costs. Yes, our system tends to rely upon insurance companies to pay for imaging and treatments (for those of us lucky enough to have good, comprehensive insurance), but that also means sometimes the insurance company's idea of the best first treatment for me might be based upon cost as opposed to outcomes. Knowing the cost of various tests and treatments helps me evaluate whether there might be a money motive I should know about. Consumer Reports did a report on biologics for RA in March 2013, and that document includes prices for those treatments. Elsewhere on the internet, I found a chart ""Comparison of Musculoskeletal Imaging Modalities"" in a scientific paper that offers a quick overview of Cost, Accuracy, Risk (radiation exposure) and Time (to do the procedure) for Radiography (X-Ray), Ultrasonography, MRI and CT scans. I realize costs vary wildly by geographic region, and the data would go out of date, but the RELATIVE costs are very important to know, and the variations in costs between medical establishments, even in the same geographic area, are frankly offensive when sick and injured people can't easily compare costs between institutions.My least favorite part of this book is the tone of the ""Coping with Emotions"" chapter. All of the information given is sound, but the author's tone got just a little too ""self help book"" for me in that section. Admittedly, I'm more data driven and I don't enjoy self-help books. I was also looking for physical/medical advice when I borrowed this book. No doubt the emotional component is vitally important for successful management of an autoimmune disease, but reading about it now (without a diagnosis) just made me kind of grumpy as I think I'd rather not think about it!Other useful sections of the book that I wanted but didn't know for sure I would find therein were:* alternative and complementary therapies* diet (including discussion of gluten-free, Mediterranean, paleo)* financial issues (insurance issues, medication costs issues)* travel with RAI'm grateful that this book was available at my local public library, and it was an easy decision to spend my own few dollars to purchase the Kindle version. If I find any issues with the formatting in the electronic version, I'll update my review. The paperback version was well-formatted and a great reference. The weight of the heavy (trade paperback size) book did present a reading challenge for me with the current state of my hand and wrist pain, however.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XXRJOQH89M7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0R6JKG#wasThisHelpful","R2XXRJOQH89M7","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I would prefer to buy an organic mattress for my child, but I'm also reluctant to spend huge amounts of money for a kid who is still young enough that accidents or illness could spoil a VERY expensive mattress.We did spring for an organic crib mattress way back when, and I never regretted it as it became a ""floor pillow"" later! Next step was a cheap IKEA toddler bed (for size reasons mainly) and I used an organic topper over the (probably toxic) cheap foam mattress. Now my son has been diagnosed with allergies, and his doctor said NO FOAM MATTRESSES (even though I used an allergen barrier cover.) I had to make a decision, and I opted to ""build my own"" mattress using an organic cotton allergen-impervious cover (Pure Rest brand, I believe) and this 6"" firm latex core with a 2"" medium latex topper zipped inside. If that doesn't feel comfortable for my son, I'll consider adding an organic wool topper later.So far, we've just gotten this piece and zipped it into the cover. Two adults and the child have all tested it out, and it feels like it would be a comfortable bed on its own. Until I've added the 2"" layer and ""filled up"" the outer cover so it won't shift, I'm not making up the bed or letting the child sleep on it.I would hesitate to use this as a mattress without ANY fabric covering. I think the edges could get ""worn"" and start to degrade. (I would expect this of ANY similar latex block.) I'm hoping the zippered encasement that I use will protect the latex core over time. I will probably add a second allergen barrier cover made of tougher man-made materials over the cotton cover to protect the mattress a little more from risk of tearing or excessive wear from being used (jumped on, etc.) by a little boy.I was very pleasantly surprised by the lack of dust or little ""pebbles"" of knocked off latex bits within the packing material. I assume that means this is a high quality latex product, because I've got other latex items (pillows and a topper), some of which have crumbled a bit, especially with age or rough handling.I would also like to add that I do have a contact allergy to latex (gloves, medical supplies) that has never been triggered by any latex BEDDING I've used in the past, including handling this mattress core before I got it in the cover. Research suggests an allergic reaction to this form of latex is unlikely, but I was still nervous about handling this big uncovered chunk for as much time as it took to carefully fit it into a cover just exactly the right size. My eczema-prone hands have shown no change in the past few days since handling the mattress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VBJEN8NFKQ19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4A8KP8#wasThisHelpful","R3VBJEN8NFKQ19","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My SurfacePad has been in place for about two months.Yes, it is a first-world problem, but my husband and I have almost identical laptops and he accidentally took the wrong one to work one day. Oops! I came to Amazon looking for something to make mine visibly unique. It couldn't be too subtle, or my husband might make the same mistake again. I added a folio style cover (Macally Protective Case Cover for 13-Inch MacBook Air (SlimFolio13P)) for the outside, and the SurfacePad to the inside. At this point, he'd have to be distracted, color blind, and maybe something worse to get the two MacBook Airs mixed up again.My product arrived in perfect shape to install--no crease. I didn't have any trouble applying it to the laptop.If I have a complaint, it is that I would prefer white or purple or even dark grey. I like red, but my outer cover is metallic lavender and didn't come in a vibrant color to go with red. I hate black accessories, and, besides, I wanted a color that would POP so even my husband would notice it.

"I was asked to write a review by the seller, but I appreciate very much that it was a polite email and did not ask for a ""positive review,"" just a review.As it happens, this polo shirt was very affordable and perfect for my needs. We used it as a tunic for a 10 year old boy's Halloween costume as Link from Legend of Zelda. I wanted a longer shirt (ordered a TALL size) but not necessarily a wider shirt. This worked very well for our needs.Compared to any commercial costume, this shirt was much higher quality and more comfortable to wear. It feels like typical knit material from a mass market store.

"I'm not (even close to being) a teenager anymore, but I never outgrew having moderately oily YET VERY SENSITIVE skin. I look for skin and haircare products with the fewest ingredients, and especially no unnecessary colors or fragrances. Even so, I've tried a lot of different things over the years and I rarely use up a bottle of anything. After a few weeks, most ""extra"" products lead to breakouts for my skin. For my adult life, I've focused on good but gentle cleansing and an occasional spot of the simplest moisture I could find (Aura Cacia Organic Skin Care Oil, Argan, 1-Fluid Ounce) with a dot of spot treatment (Acne.org 8 oz. Treatment (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide)) applied to my few blemishes as needed.I read the Paula's Choice website (and especially the Beautypedia reviews) over the past several years. I wanted to try the products, but I was skeptical of yet another ""we finally have the solution!"" company, although I always found the science at Paula's Choice more compelling than the average beauty site. My first step was to try the DRUGSTORE skin products that were recommended on Beautypedia. I found that many of them worked better than average (based upon past experience of buying from packaging claims) for me. The cost savings of finding a $10 drugstore brand that worked better than department store products is undeniably great. So from that experience, I learned that I can use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 20oz 2 pack (works OK) or CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, 12 Ounce and have a pretty good foundation of clean, not-too-stripped, NON-REACTIVE skin.I was off to a good start with the cleanser, but I didn't fare so well with the step Paula considers most important--exfoliation. My skin was definitely feeling different as I came to middle age, and I thought exfoliation was the missing step, too. I've always loved the results of mechanical exfoliation (those little beads or bits of coconut shell) but I would react later (from bits left on skin? from heavy ingredients?) and the argument made for AHA or BHA chemical exfoliation sounded compelling. I tried a few drugstore options, but even the most successful Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir felt too heavy on my skin and would lead to breakouts if I used it too often.Aside from a fear of noticeable aging of my skin (though I have no wrinkles yet and am just beginning to find my nasolabial folds/smile lines a bit too pronounced), my only on-going skin issue IF I STUCK WITH MY USUAL PRODUCTS was a steady stream of one or two painful pimples at my hairline. Usually these appeared on the back of my neck (my hair is long) or around my ears, but occasionally they would show up at my jawline or temple and make me curse having zits as an adult. Last summer, I finally decided that I'd gotten enough free good advice from the Paula's Choice website, and I would try the BHA liquid exfoliant that she recommends for skin like mine.I tried FIVE of the Paula's Choice BHA exfoliant variations, and this one, the Resist Daily Pore-Refining Treatment 2% BHA is my favorite, hands down. I'm almost done with my second bottle, and have re-ordered twice now. (A bottle lasts me about two months with daily use.) None of the Paula's Choice BHA treatments caused me an obvious breakout or reaction, but this one goes on easily with a swipe of a cotton pad. It feels lightest upon the face. It is the least sticky in texture.The defining reason I like this product so much is that I've only had two or three total hairline zits since I've started using it (or since the 2nd week or so that it had taken effect.) While I used to have one or two bumps going on at any given time, now I am almost always free of those bumps.Do I look better? Well, my husband says so, but he would ALWAYS say I look better than ever because he is such a nice guy. I think perhaps my skin has slightly better texture overall, but I don't have quantitative evidence of that. The measurable improvement is in the lack of breakouts.Paula's Choice offers sample packets at low prices of EVERY PRODUCT that they sell, so order a sample if you are sensitive. For me, this product is a tremendous winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZ7FTU527XAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOAMZCW#wasThisHelpful","RQZ7FTU527XAS","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We bought a sisal rug on sale from a higher-end chain store when we moved into our new house about a year ago. The rug pad from the store would've cost as much as the rug, so I just skipped it, hoping our beautiful hardwood floors would be okay with the sisal rug on top. Now, 16 months later the sisal rug STILL curls up at the corners, and I kept worrying about color transfer or other damage to the floors beneath.My 9x12 SUPREME 32 rug pad arrived yesterday and I opened it up to air out overnight. No stinky smell--hurray! (I'm pretty sensitive to chemical smells.) It is nice and thick, and it didn't shed any weird bits around my living room. The kids helped me to roll up the sisal rug and slide this into place. We needed to cut off about one inch in the narrow dimension (9' width) and about four inches off the long dimension (12' length) to make it fit. We started with our usual craft scissors, but switched to my son's newer school pair (still full sized shears) to finish the job. Using SHARP scissors made the job much easier; if yours are old and dull, they may not work at all. No special tools are necessary, however.Now that I have the rug pad underneath, I feel safe using Curl Stop Anti-Curling Rug System (Pack of 4 Corners) to stop the corners from curling. (Those are hard plastic, and might've scratched the hardwood without a rug pad between them and the floor.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195EOK0B8X6QZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00578M90Y#wasThisHelpful","R195EOK0B8X6QZ","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two kids in swim lessons at an indoor pool that is apparently kept cool for the competitive team swimmers. My older child looks fine, but my younger kid would sit on the side of the pool waiting his turn, blue-lipped, shivering, and looking for all the world like he was about to drop dead of hypothermia. He still loves swim lessons, but his dad really hates it when the kids are cold, so I turned to Amazon for a solution.This suit is just perfect for our needs. My kids both think it looks cool. The 10 year old is jealous that I can't get one in his size. The 7 year old just loves it, style, fit and he says it is the warmest suit we've tried.As far as sizing, I did opt for the size 8 for my child who wears US 6/7 clothes. (He's a small-ish kid, too.) He wears a Euro size 120 in his Hanna Andersen stuff, and the metric sizing on the company website size chart gave a Euro 128cm size. The suit looked small when I opened the package, but my child says it fits comfortably. My boys do have shorter torsos than average, however, so that may be a big factor in how well this suit fits your kid. (Did they outgrow car safety seats sooner by HEIGHT or by WEIGHT? That could help you decide about this suit... For example, my 10 year old can still fit in some car seats because his height is in his legs, not his trunk.)Realizing that our summer plans depended upon knowing the truth, I opted to use the delicate cycle (in my Miele washing machine, known for gentleness) to wash the Aqua Sphere Stingray Core Warmer, and it came out perfectly fine. Of course, I put it flat on a rack to dry--no machine drying for neoprene!The black torso portion of this suit IS neoprene. It feels thicker and rubbery-er than a normal swimsuit. The colorful arm and leg portions are the same weight as our other swimwear. I try to help my kiddo in and out of the suit because I fear that the stitching between disparate materials will be a weak point, but I haven't actually seen any evidence that we are putting too much tension on the seams, even when the 7 year old is yanking on it because he forgot to use the toilet before swim class!Our other swim suits include Solumbra/Sun Precautions full leg swim pants and long-sleeve zip-front swim top as well as standard swim trunks, so that's my comparison for fabric weight/warmth.According to the AquaSphere web site, this Core Warmer offers their maximum UVA/UVB protection as well as best breathability and quick-drying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YA8VGUQSAAQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Y7ZA3Y#wasThisHelpful","R1YA8VGUQSAAQ4","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Add me to the list of those who think Perwoll for Wool & Delicates has a very strong scent. It is fragrant, and the smell lingers around the laundry room (and the laundry) after use. I usually avoid all scented detergents and opt for ""Free & Clear"" versions, so take my opinion with that in mind. I decided to try the Perwoll based upon great reviews on some boards that I trust, and I do agree that it does a good job washing and, in spite of the smell, it doesn't seem to be aggravating my child's (or my) sensitive, eczema-prone skin. It is working out great (for washing performance) in my new Miele washing machine on swimwear, exercise clothes, and other delicate fabrics. I've had to reduce the suggested amount by about half to get good washing with a tolerable smell for our clothes.I will be able to use up this bottle, but I'm not positive I will buy more when it is done. I simply don't think adding smells to my laundry has any relationship to GETTING CLOTHES CLEAN. I just want clean clothing with a neutral scent. However effective Perwoll (and other European detergents I'm trying) may be, they seem just as enamored with adding smells as standard US detergents are. If I can get the same washing performance in a fragrance-free product, that will be my choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R357H6O8RECL1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046U9PBA#wasThisHelpful","R357H6O8RECL1Y","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank heavens someone is making some exercise bottoms that come up to the natural waist! These are not my perfect workout pants, but they are the best I've found yet. If you want low-riders, most other fitness pants will be more to your liking, at least, according to the 20 or so styles I've tried on in the past year...I'm in my 30's and I've had two kids. Aside from my personal preference for pants that come up the natural waist (perhaps because I have an hourglass figure and my hips hold my pants up?) I also now have some stretch marks that I'd rather keep to myself. Most fitness clothing is cut very straight/man-ish, and the current trend toward low-cut waistbands also means more styles that hang straight down. These clothes don't feel modest or supportive enough for me, and they also tend to slide right down my hips. When I'm in the gym, I want to get my work done and go home, not keep hitching up my pants.Though I'm a size 12, these fit me pretty well (but loose in the waist) in a Large. Ideally, I'd like the waist to fit about an inch smaller than these do, but, again, this is BY FAR the best I've managed to find yet to fit my shape. I would love to have compression in the waist AND hips for my workouts, but at least these compress my widest measurement (hip/derriere.) I'm thinking I'll try a compression top in combination with these to try to squish both bits at the same time.The fabric on these feels matte (not shiny), thick enough (like pants not tights), and supportive. They were also amongst the least expensive brands that I tried.

"I'm really glad I bought this little dryer, though I'm not even close to the target demographic. I have a full size laundry set on the lower level of my house (in a dedicated laundry room no less!), but we got the old machines when we bought the house last year, and they were not quite up to my modern laundry diva standards. I'm a terrible housekeeper, but laundry is the only one of the necessary evils of home care that I don't actually hate. My new house also has a little laundry closet upstairs off the master bedroom with room for a compact, stackable washer-dryer set. I bought a nice compact washer for upstairs, but I had two qualms about getting a matching dryer.1) Upstairs would be electric, not gas like the main laundry. Our utility rates are amongst the nation's highest, and I don't want to pay that much for drying clothing just because someone is too lazy to walk downstairs to the ""real"" machines.2) Upstairs also has the plastic dryer venting going from the closet, through the attic, and outside in an inconvient-to-access place. Eventually, I will replace the fire-hazard plastic venting material, but I don't have the budget to do it now with so many other projects crying out for attention in the new home. Using the 110-V mini Panda dryer must produce less heat, therefore less fire hazard, so so my thinking goes.I hang a lot of my laundry to dry for environmental reasons (and to save wear and tear on finer fabrics) and my intent was to exclusively line dry with the upstairs compact washer. When my inherited-with-the-house dryer died two weeks ago just as the school year ended, planned parties were about to happen, and my house filled with guests... I ordered the Panda dryer and hoped it could see me through a very busy time while I waited for new household units to arrive.I would never compare this little dryer to a full size unit. I don't know that it gets as hot, but it does get hot and dry clothing. I didn't try to cram every item I washed into it, but I did have the option to tumble/fluff the stiff-as-a-board items I'd line-dried previously, and it got the job done every time.Because it is small and less convenient, I don't think other family members will use this at all, and that suits me perfectly. It will take up less space in my laundry closet, leaving more room to put up a shelf for my detergents and letting me avoid storing those in my bedroom or bathroom.I also felt that the luxury of having this little guy meant that I could take my time when picking out my new full-sized machines, and it meant I could afford the extra time lag of ordering them from a less expensive source. With NO laundry options at home, I would've purchased any units available for immediate delivery, because I have two messy boys who spend a lot of time outdoors.I wish the lint filter was easier to clean, but it isn't actually difficult. My mother (one of those houseguests) tells me it is like the ones in the old Maytag dryers she remembers from decades ago.I wish the supplied venting was metal instead of plastic, but I'm happy that they included the pieces that they did. It was easy for me to set the Panda dryer up on my own and get the vent directed out a window so I could work on my laundry backlog without waiting for help to hang it on the wall where it properly goes.My unit came with a faint spot of rust on the exterior top at a seam. I found no evidence of interior rust (that would affect my clothing) so I just accepted it and got on with the laundry. I considered sending it back, but felt that the price was low enough, and my need intense enough, that I could deal with a non-function-impacting defect on the exterior.I don't usually use the Panda to fully dry wet clothing, but I have done so with lightweight and mid-weight items. I haven't tried to dry jeans from fully wet to bone dry. My expectations have been met. Air dry doesn't result in warm clothes, so I'd say it works as described. Warm, which I use most often, results in pleasantly warm items pulled out. I think I've only set the dryer to hot once, just to be sure the dial worked on every setting, so I don't have a lot to say about that setting.I wish the dial felt a little more robust, but any rotary dial strikes me as less likely to need repair than any electronic dryer.I miss the buzzer at the end of the cycle a little bit, but not very much since I'm almost never setting and forgetting laundry upstairs, but rather tumbling nearly dry items that I intend to fold immediately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACE83M8XMHF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAY540S#wasThisHelpful","R1ACE83M8XMHF6","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think I saw this movie about once a year during my elementary school years in the 1980s. Several scenes from it jumped immediately to mind when I found it while browsing for my own children. Watching it with them, I recalled quite a lot of it, and enjoyed every minute of the film. I think this movie does a good job bringing mathematical thought to a child's attention, and highlighting how much more there is to math than simply solving rows of equations on a piece of paper at one's desk.My kids are six and ten.

"I'm delighted that this detergent is finally available on Amazon with Prime shipping! I began buying this brand of laundry liquid when my younger child was in cloth diapers. He has very sensitive skin, and the detergent that cleaned plenty well enough to leave diapers fresh-smelling and visibly clean for his older brother resulted in painful diaper rash for him. He also tends to develop a rash wherever shift cuffs or necklines sit too firmly against his skin. Switching detergents reduced this kind of contact dermatitis reaction for him, though he remains very prone to skin rash and eczema. (An example of his sensitivity is that we must carry a silk ""sleep sack"" for him to use at hotels or other peoples' homes to avoid reacting to detergent or bleach residue when traveling.)Atsko sells the same detergent labeled ""Sensi-Clean"" (marketed to parents of infants) and ""Sport Wash"". I contacted the company when I first sampled the product to confirm the formulations are identical. You might find Sport Wash at your local sporting goods store, but I wasn't able to find either product locally. I've been buying several bottles at a time and paying shipping for about six years now.Most of my usage has been with a modern, front-loading, high efficiency washing machine. This product works very well and does not over-suds for an HE washer.We've moved to a new home with an older washer (top loader) and I have had to increase from one capful to two capsful to avoid skin reactions for my son. I think it is actually dirt/pollution from the rest of our laundry causing my child to get a rash right now, and the fact that the water is harder in our new town, but I think we've solved the problem and I don't believe this detergent is in any way related to his recent flares of skin rash.When I've run out Sensi-Clean, I've been able to use ""Charlie's Soap"" or ""Country Save Detergent"" with pretty good results for my sensitive child. Most other ""free and clear"" detergents from the grocery store or ""natural"" products from Whole Foods have not been gentle enough for us to safely use.As an aside, we've used Atsko's Sensi-Clean Shampoo & Body Gel, too, and it was a safe choice for my child. It can be a little drying, however, so we prefer some other, more moisturizing products for his regular use. If you are reacting to everything and struggling to get to a ""clean"" slate so you can introduce other ingredients and try to isolate your particular allergies, this brand is a good place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVDW02TJJ2YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQJDHOE#wasThisHelpful","R3AVDW02TJJ2YN","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I probably read this when it first came out in 1984. The fact that it dances into my mind once a month or so all these years later is pretty telling, I'd say. I'm wondering whether to dig up a copy of this book for my child, who is now about the age when I first encountered it, though I wonder if it will mean as much to a boy as it did to a girl...I do remember the part in this book where the disgusted protagonist notes that her ""exotic"" shampoo is made in New Zealand. It took me a minute, and probably a double take, to realize that New Zealand was BORING for her, not exotic... and thus I came to a new level of awareness in my own early life about relative perceptions.This is a great, supernatural story that can stay with a girl for decades, if my own experience is any guide.

"I got two bundle sets of these styli in three lengths to give as gifts this year. All the recipients seemed to like them, most of whom had never before tried using a stylus on their i-devices. I wanted to try a stylus instead of buying special gloves for winter use, and I am happy I gave these a try. They're also useful when I invariably want to look at something on my iPad right after applying hand lotion.The colors are cute. The quality seems very good. It is less than a month after the first were given for Christmas, but all styli are still working, so far as I know. It was interesting to see how different family members preferred the different stylus lengths. It turns out I like the tiny little stub size (about 2"") myself, but one of my kids likes these longest (5.3"") models, so it isn't just about hand size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16WUFHBAE5883/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMOFPD4#wasThisHelpful","R16WUFHBAE5883","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I felt like I must add a review for this book, because it seems to have been treated rather poorly by other reviewers, and I think it deserves quite a lot better.Our family is Jewish, so perhaps we have a different perspective from some of the others who've reviewed it. The child who read it is a very precocious reader, but not particularly above his age in maturity. I read this before offering it to him, and I think perhaps it is written at a higher reading level than ""children's edition"" would suggest. It was very accessible to my son, but that is no guide to how a typical 4th grader might respond to it. Content-wise, there was nothing in this book that made me pause before passing it along to my sensitive child.The fact that this book uses ""BCE/CE"" instead of ""BC/AD"" makes me like it better. I feel welcomed instead of excluded, though the author is a Christian, as is made plain in the text.The fact that this book references geologic time in the scientifically accepted way makes me like it better. As a person who studies to try to read the Bible in its original language, not an English translation (which was itself translated from the Greek, most likely, not the original!), I revere the word of God, while also seeing the language as poetic and often allegorical. I am not offended by what geology tells us about the age of the planet Earth.I enjoyed reading this book, and it made me interested in reading the (full/adult) original version myself. My child, who was born an engineer, and a questioner of all that he's told, was interested in this story, was brought into the idea of the magic of the Holy Land and imbued with an interest in what makes it special. I think this book stirred something spiritual for my son.We read this before a visit to see the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit at the local Museum of Science, and it added greatly to our experience. This was the best book on the topic that we read (according to both my son, and myself!)Read this if your reading level is middle school or above, if you are interested in the modern places that were once the real life setting for the stories of the Bible, and if you are open to the thoughts and experiences of another human being experiencing those places in a thoughtful way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IIXAYHKPCLXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060511176#wasThisHelpful","R3IIXAYHKPCLXZ","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was recommended in the teaching materials list provided on the Museum of Science website when the ""Dead Sea Scrolls"" exhibit was in our city. I couldn't find this at our local library, but it was available on Amazon for a ridiculously low price (less than I pay for a fancy espresso drink!) in library binding, so I just bought it.My nine year old son found a factual error when he read it. This was a few weeks ago, and I didn't note what the error was, but it was something I confirmed at the time, I think relating to whether the person who found the scrolls was alone or with another... It didn't render the entire book useless by any stretch, but he was very turned off by the mistake, and, based upon our other sources, it WAS a mistake. We are reading history with a very clear understanding of the fact that we learn more over time, understanding shifts with the uncovering of new information, etc., so I used it as a teaching moment. He liked the book less as a result, however.I'm dealing with a very precocious reader (probably comparable to an above average high school graduate?) who is not emotionally precocious, so he could easily have caught something that was meant to be a simplification for the intended audience. The book had nice photos, was generally well written, and mostly agreed with our other readings, so I think it is still worth reading if you are studying the Dead Sea Scrolls at an elementary school level.He enjoyed The Mystery of the Dead Sea Scrolls more (a novel), but his favorite reference for this topic was Walking the Bible (children's edition): An Illustrated Journey for Kids Through the Greatest Stories Ever Told.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJ2Y39H6JR1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0823962598#wasThisHelpful","R2KJ2Y39H6JR1A","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered and received 4 x 3-packs of these socket reducer bases last week. I use these to allow for the use of value-priced 3-packs of candelabra-based LED ""flame shaped"" bulbs (from my big warehouse/membership store) in my new home's gazillion overhead can lights. I find the light level more than adequate with a laughably reduced wattage going this route, but I've needed to buy a lot of socket reducers.The order before, I was able to buy ZITRADES(TM) UL listed 5PCS/Pack E26 Male to E12 Female Socket Adapter Conversion socket High quality fireproof material by ZITRADES instead, and those do feel like a higher quality product in the hand. They were not available when I came back to re-order, so I gave the KOR socket reducer a try.I have installed all 12 socket reducers, and all of them worked (and are working) just fine.I've since switched to ordering tiny LED ceiling fan bulbs with a standard (medium/E26) base instead Feit Electric BPA15/CL/LED/RP Accent LED A15 Bulb, Clear or G7 Power G7G16330 G16 3W 250 Lumen LED Light Bulb, as the price is only a bit higher for a slightly lower level of lumens, but without my lingering fear of having a bunch of adapters all over my house perhaps being a fire hazard...","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RN3BCI2WDZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CH7FQQM#wasThisHelpful","R25RN3BCI2WDZ3","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love these lights. I bought this set, plus a larger set of the longer panels NEW Designer Series SIX 18"" COOL WHITE LED Panels, 2 power supplies, 2 dimmers and I'm using them in three locations around my house, but with a mixture of short (10"") and long (18"") panels in each place.The best part about this system, in my opinion, is the modularity. You can mix and match COOL vs WARM, 10"" or 18"" panels, and presumably ""designer"" (these have a plastic deflector/cover over the LEDS) or the basic uncovered strips. I bought a couple of shorter connector cords, too, and I mixed and matched all the bits from my few purchases to accomplish what I wanted.It is worth noting that, if you buy these directly from the maker's site, you can specify different cord lengths than those offered by default in the Amazon kits. I thought about going that route, but I opted to first purchase from a known entity (Amazon) that I already trust. If I go back for more, I may well order direct from the manufacturer. Unlike some reviewers, I totally understand that it costs almost as much to make a short cord as a long one, so I'm not going to rant about the relatively high cost of the four inch connector cord that I wanted 4"" (Four Inch) Interconnect Cable for use with Inspired LED Lighting Systems to complement the parts I got in my two kits. (I do wish it had been cheaper, but I think the price is fair considering the scale of production.)I'm using these in two rooms with a motion sensor plug Westek MLC4BC Indoor Plug-In Motion Activated Light Control and it is simply plugged in at the third location. I would prefer a light sensor/motion sensor combo plug, but this is adequate for now. Eventually, I may have the electrician hard-wire the kitchen location. For right now, I've got the energy efficient lighting that I wanted in exactly the locations I desired, and I was THRILLED to have the option to purchase parts as I did.When I remodeled my kitchen in 2007, I spent more for two LED strips than I did this time for nine strips of higher quality with more LEDs. The time has come for the masses to at least give LED lights a try. Prices are now quite fair.Personally, I am a huge fan of widely dispersed light at a fairly low level of lumens. (That means I like the light level low, but spread out, so everything is visible but nothing is bright.) These products work GREAT for my purposes. My husband prefers a much brighter light source... almost everywhere! While he wouldn't use LED strips in as many locations as I prefer them, even he admits that they are working great in our new kitchen. We have a five foot wide industrial hood. As ""cool"" and high end as this thing is... it had no built in task light when we moved in. With the kitchen overhead lights on, your shadow landed on the stove. I used two 10"" strips and three 18"" strips to add even illumination along the rolled metal edge of the hood, bringing the power cord down one side to a nearby outlet. Now we can clearly see what we are cooking. While my husband might wish this were a 400 Watt halogen fixture, he is happier to have this much light than no light at all.I like COOL white light, so that is what I got. I haven't tried Inspired LED's WARM white color to offer a comparison.If money were no object, I would have already ordered these to install in my closet, under the toe kick in every bathroom, under the toe kick in the kitchen, and up on a ledge we have in a light-well beneath a skylight... I will get those eventually, but the kitchen is probably the ideal place for most consumers to start. It is amazing what a few strips of these little lights can do in a small, dark kitchen. I speak from experience on that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6R8UOH4DFW49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JH3WUA#wasThisHelpful","R6R8UOH4DFW49","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've just purchased a second unit of this item for our home use. I prefer to buy from an art supply store that is an Amazon partner, both because I love art supply companies, and because they have the best price I've found. It is worth an internet search when buying this product if price matters to you.Our last purchase was two and a half years ago, and our most recent use (last week) of the Model Magic was still soft and pliable, so the sealed packets do last a very long time. I saw no evidence of drying out, so assume AT LEAST three years' shelf life.For my family, this ""classroom"" pack has been the best way to purchase Model Magic. We like to use several colors at a time, but we don't need huge quantities of each color each time. I can open up one little packet of each primary color, split them between my two boys, and everyone gets to use every color (even if in a very small quantity.) When someone wants to make a specific (larger) object, I might open multiple packets of a given color. Larger packs might be a better value for those projects, but, more often, we are just playing.Admittedly, now that my kids are older (both elementary aged) and one of my son's is being home schooled, this time around I've purchased some larger packs of the earth tone colors in addition to another Class Pack-Assorted Colors. We are studying ancient history, and both of us keep thinking of fun art/craft projects that can be made with Terra Cotta or Earthtone Model Magic.For younger kids, I think these primary (plus white) packets in the Class Pack-Assorted Colors are the best combination of value and fun. For occasional use, these packets will keep for YEARS and are easy to grab and use without waste. If traveling, these small packets are ""TSA compliant"" and can be packed in your ""liquids"" bag to entertain kids in the air. (I don't KNOW if they would otherwise be confiscated, but I'm a cautious traveler.)We are about to try another product called Cloud Clay that is made by AMACO to see if we like it as well as Model Magic.

"I bought two of these one foot (12 inch) cables, actually, and both of them work exactly as they should.I agree that the price seems steep for a little bit of cable, but I suspect that producing the cable costs more than the materials, so a short cord is not cheaper than a long cord.It is worth noting that one can order products directly from the manufacturer and request different cable lengths than those supplied in Amazon kits. I thought about doing that, and may purchase direct in the future when I inevitably expand my use of LED lights, but I often prefer to go through Amazon on a purchase from a new supplier like this one, enjoy my Prime shipping, know the return policy, etc.I love these lights. When I bought LED strip lights for a kitchen remodel in 2007, I paid more two pieces (less bright than these) than I did for a total of nine light strips and three power sources here and now. I am a huge fan of dispersed lighting at low levels, and this company offered the total flexibility that I wanted. I think these are a solid buy, even at this price for a cable.The cheapest place I know of to purchase LED strips is the big Swedish boxed furniture chain, but there is zero flexibility with those!

"We were able to borrow this from our local library. All told, I found it to be worth spending about an hour of our home school study time with this video and subsequent discussion.It was made around 1998, and that shows in the production values. For the first few minutes, I was afraid the whole video would be simply a classroom lecture by a slightly odd teacher (dressed in an archaeologist costume!) There were SOME on location shots of historic sites and artifacts, so it was better than my initial impression. Very little is re-enacted, which I'm actually happy about.A more recent ""Discovery Channel"" video will probably be more slick and fancy than this video series. On the other hand, this is designed for children, so there is no risk of some kind of ""racy"" adult information about an ancient culture popping up... (I'm willing to deal with radical departures from our personal morals when explaining history, but not all parents will want to explain Egyptian royal incest, etc.)This video covers the possibility that an inland lake on modern Santorini is the actual site of the lost continent of Atlantis, the Minoan civilization, and the Mycenaen civilization. I have been reading about a dozen elementary level books on these topics in the past couple of weeks, and there were no obvious errors on the video that I caught. That's actually a pretty good track record from what I've found elsewhere.

"Our family has listened to the The Classical Kids Collection: Volume 2: Tales of Enchantment and Classical Music for four years now, and we love the combination of music and storytelling. I went to the library looking for anything similar to those. A closer match is the lovely Peggy's Violin a Butterfly in Time, but I brought this one home, too. (If you are only buying one story/music combo, I'd recommend the former over this CD, but this is still a fun and useful collection!)If my children were 2.5, I would certainly play them the first track, which is a charming take on this classic American poem, and I think the before and after version of the Come Little Rabbit song would also resonate. For children so young, the remaining tracks would be unlikely to catch their interest. By around age 4 or 5, I think, many kids could hear the composers explanation of how different musical sounds bring characters to life, and they would absorb a fair bit, if largely through the emotional component of the sounds.What I REALLY liked about this disc was the chance for my older child (age 9) to hear the composer talk us through the process of creating a meaningful musical accompaniment to the poem. I think it underscores some important points about poetry and music in a way that was more fun and approachable than a lecture from mom!I believe that I, the adult, was the most interested in the background story of ""Casey at the Bat."" I remember it from school, I've always liked it, and I wanted to introduce this lighthearted poem to my kids. After the second listen to the disc, however, I would skip the background story. I think I've gotten all I need from that.We are a home schooling family, so I appreciated the free poetics/music lesson for my child. Even if my kids were both still in school, I would've been happy to have heard this CD with my kids. I hardly think it should be relegated only to the ""educational"" pile. Let's not forget how very easy it is to skip a track on these modern CD's. :)My kids find the poem quite fun to listen to, and, when my violin-playing son gets more skilled, he may well be able to play along with the Suzuki-taught children on one of the tracks where the conductor suggests children join in. Our Michael Clay Thompson language arts curriculum emphasizes poetics (The Music of the Hemispheres: Teacher Manual) and we feel strongly enough about music education that our kids attend private lessons, so that is my perspective to help you decide if my opinions are relevant to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PX5E2T86HQAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007VDF5E#wasThisHelpful","R2PX5E2T86HQAD","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had ""Robolina"" a few weeks, and she's my first robot vacuum, so that's where I'm coming from.Instead of Amazon, I bought my Moneual Rydis from my membership warehouse. They carry three robot vacuums right now--one iRobot, one Neat-o, and this one. Here's why I chose the Moneual from this selection:1) I prefer the more environmentally friendly Lithium Iron Phosphate battery, offered by the Moneual only2) If using a robot vacuum works for my family, I will buy a DIFFERENT model for our carpeted rooms. Having a machine that works better on HARD FLOORS ONLY was a plus for my situation.3) People said the Moneual Rydis had the easiest dust compartment to empty4) I thought the remote control would be fun for my kids.As it turns out, the remote control *IS* fun for my kids. Most of the time, one of them (as a treat!) or I will manually drive Robolina to the area of the room that we most want cleaned, then we hit the ""Auto"" button. We have a very large (over 1200 sq ft) great room with hardwood floors and a couple of area rugs, and this is where we've primarily been testing Robolina's usefulness. After Robolina's inaugural run--the same day my housekeeper had been over and both vacuumed (central vac) and dry mopped (Swiffer) the entire place--AND THE DUST BIN WAS FULL OF CRUD, I knew I was a permanent convert to the robot vacuum. In a similar vein, we broke a glass in the kitchen several weeks ago, and have vacuumed, mopped, and I even wiped the whole area by hand with damp paper towel before I let my kids back in. After Robolina's first pass at it, I found a shard of glass we'd missed when I emptied her bin.I really hate the vacuum. I hate fiddling with the cord, plugging and re-plugging as I move around the house. I actually hate the central vacuum at my new house even more, because the hose is so enormous, heavy, and unwieldy. I pull out a broom and dustpan several times a day, but I almost never get around to the vacuuming, or I beg my overworked husband to do it when he gets home. I hate the dust kicked up, the noise, all of it.I am emptying Robolina's dust catcher at least once every day, but doing that annoys me less than using the regular vacuum would. I have had to unwind a few strings from her wheels, but that is still less bother than I find the big vacuum. For me, using a robot is a no brainer. You'll need to assess your own temperament to decide if you would feel the same way. I don't expect Robolina to get my floors deep cleaned, just to reduce the dirt in between regular vacuuming on the same schedule we had before (once or twice a week.) It is pretty obvious that we are removing more dirt and dust now, because Robolina runs at least once a day when I think of it (and I would NOT have been vacuuming at these times), plus she runs another time, most days, when one of my kids asks if the robot can come out to play. How could it not be an improvement?The level of light bumping against furniture that Robolina does is very well within my comfort level. I've seen her nudge a lightweight object, but nothing even close to worrisome has occurred in our home. (Admittedly, I only have one antique piece, and I have kids, so assess your own standards here, too!) The noise level is significantly less than I find any of our regular vacuums, maybe even less than the central vac? I leave the room when someone is vacuuming, usually, but I can stay in the room while Robolina works, especially because she wanders nearer, then farther, then under the couch where she's muffled... The volume strikes me as less intense overall.If I hadn't just bought an expensive new house, I'd probably already have purchased a second robot vacuum for the two other levels in my home. I'm already that intensely sold on this method of cleaning. I may still try out a Neato or iRobot product, however, especially for the upstairs which is entirely carpeted, and reviews suggest iRobot might be the best for that situation. If I come to decide any failure on the Moneual Rydis' part is a reason to switch brands (as opposed to my love of trying every option!) I'll update this review.*** UPDATE: 8 months later ***I still love having a robot vacuum. People who come over often notice it docked in our great room and ask my opinion. I still think you need to assess your own cleaning habits and temperament to decide if one is right for you. For those of us who have sensory issues around noise, the robot vacuum fills a unique niche.I use Robolina primarily in my kitchen and my great room. These two rooms are the easiest for our family to keep ""robot safe"" on a regular basis. By this, I mean no little toys or tangling strings on the floor, and few delicate items left in harm's way to manually pick up before letting the robot out. For us, the kitchen floor is the easiest to keep clutter-free, therefore the robot runs most often there. In the great room, I often assign the job of robot-tending to my ten year old son. He plays nearby and comes running if Robolina sounds different or asks for help.Today, Robolina asked for help with her brush. I read the manual 8 months ago, but haven't looked at it since. I double checked that it was okay to pull off the plastic brush surround (yes) and how to remove the brush itself (a simple tug from the correct end) and discovered that there was quite a twist of hair (mostly mine) around both ends of the brush and under each of the spinning sweeper brushes to boot. I probably should have unscrewed the spinners and pulled out the brush before this and removed the hair, but that's how long our robot was able to go about her business before this chore was required in a household with no pets, one long-haired female, and use primarily for kitchen dirt on tile and dust on hardwood.Emptying Robolina's dustbin is easy and I don't mind doing it. Sometimes I need a toothpick to get a wad of dust out. I am ordering a second filter for the dustbin today because you are supposed to rinse it between uses and you have to wait for it to dry thoroughly. I often run Robolina in one room, empty the bin, then wish to immediately clean the second area without that wait.Our mopping head and ""guard"" got yanked off at some point and the double stick tape (IIRC) that held it on was no longer viable so we've simply stopped using this feature. It certainly showed some dirt, meaning it picked some up, but I don't see a visible difference in how this affects the cleanliness of my floors.Our charging STATION failed, so now I manually plug Robolina into the power cord after use. Since she regularly needed help docking correctly, and since I'm carrying her up two steps to one of my two regular cleaning areas, this isn't annoying to me, aside from wishing the docking station were of higher quality in principle.While I've never timed Robolina's run time, after eight months, I don't ""feel"" like she runs for any less time than before. I am satisfied with the battery strength and life.My children are no longer excited enough about the vacuum to ask to use it, but their visiting friends often ask if they can watch the robot go, and my kids enjoy showing off how it works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z006U9YJ3I11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A215WGO#wasThisHelpful","R2Z006U9YJ3I11","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My boys both wore permethrin-treated Columbia pants in a different style every school day above 40 F last year. Our area has endemic Lyme disease, and their school is in the woods, and stresses lots of outdoor time in all weather. Classmates had a tick almost every day, but we never found one on either of our kids after school when we checked.I got them each one pair of this style recently. Compared to the pant-sized olive green design from last year (size 10), these (M 10/12) are looser and seem a bit shorter in the inseam. We're short, so that's less hemming for me to do! The kids find these faster/easier to put on, and are happy about that. The sized pants with button/zip fly looked a touch better since they fit more closely, but their zip-off legs made that a moot point in my view.All in all, I like this style better, and I think my kids both do, too. Unless they care about fashion, pull-on elastic waist pants seem much more popular with the elementary aged boys I know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELU0EK7QF3BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LWPB1E#wasThisHelpful","RELU0EK7QF3BA","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was thrilled to find these comfortable (full elastic waist), thin (much lighter than typical chino pants), 100% cotton pants for my child to use when we travel. Poly/nylon are quicker to dry when washed in a hotel room sink, but I prefer for my kids to travel in natural fibers in case we are ever in a plane crash since synthetics can melt into one's skin under those terrible conditions.My own travel wardrobe consists of lightweight, color-coordinated, quick-drying basics. It is surprisingly hard to find similar pieces for kids! I want to teach them to travel light, which I define as carry-on only. (That means one bag only, not a full size rolling bag plus a huge daypack.) Finding the right items to pack is part of the process. Since they carry their own bags, and kids should only tote 5-10% of their body weight, lighter fabrics really help.We layer thin pants over thin (silk) long johns to keep warm, and the long johns double as pajamas. At home, worn over thermal long johns, these pants work all year 'round, even in New England.The description should specify that these are thin pants--I'd compare the fabric to a crisp safari SHIRT weight. The fact that they are thin does not make them worse pants, but they won't suit everyone's needs. These are wearing well so far for us, but I wouldn't expect them to handle too much abrasion (rocks/asphalt.)The style is a fairly full cut. They look a touch baggy on my normal-weight child. He cares more that they are comfortable, though, and is not particularly interested in fashion. I can dress these up while we are traveling, but would not choose them first for dress-up wear at home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJ9MZ8N438M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HHPA3E#wasThisHelpful","R1GJ9MZ8N438M9","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wouldn't write a review so soon after receiving a book like this--I haven't even used it with my home schooling son yet as we're covering grammar before moving on to literature later this year. However, the other review for this book is very negative, and I believe those criticisms to be unwarranted.I am an educated parent and new home educator, not a teacher. I read about the Suppose the Wolf Were an Octopus guides on the publisher's website, but wanted it used, so I came to Amazon. From my quick perusal of the titles available, the edition with fairy tales is for much younger students, and is also available here on Amazon.This edition is for grades 5-6. My son is only in the fourth grade, but he reads at a college level (technically.) I was hoping this guide would help me to advance his understanding of books written close to his emotional maturity level.There are about fifty books listed in the table of contents, and I counted 28 that I know from my own childhood (most of which I've read.) This is perfect for me, since I may not re-read every novel that I assign to my son, but, in that case, I will certainly be able to lead him through a thoughtful analysis better with the help of this book. A couple of examples of very well known titles are: Black Beauty, From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, A Wrinkle in Time, Bridge to Terabithia, The Call of the Wild, and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.My edition of this book is (c) 1995, just in case there are different editions out there with different contents. I'm posting the table of contents here to help other parents/teachers assess whether this book contains titles with which they want to work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPRN5WO0WTXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0880922494#wasThisHelpful","R3GPRN5WO0WTXN","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While I don't think the handwriting that results is the most beautiful style, I do love seeing the huge improvement in my son's ability to express himself on paper!We've left our previous school and switched to home schooling for this year, and my son actually requested that I order more of this paper after our first week of formal lessons using the basic filler paper from the office supply megastore.

"I'm baffled by the ridiculously high cost of basic bookends. Unless I buy a bulk package of dozens for almost a hundred dollars, they cost about ten bucks a pair! We are home schooling this year, and, as an addicted book-hound, that has meant a lot of new volumes flowing into our home, many of them bulky textbooks, and most of them toppling over off of our newly designed ""school"" workstation wall. When I recovered from the faint induced by shopping for bookends, I found this Safco metal mesh divider at my favorite ""bulk warehouse"" store website and bought one right away.Wow, is this perfect for my needs. It keeps even heavy textbooks upright, and it lets me divide up the books by subject matter with less chance of accidental rearrangement by my elementary aged kid. It is at least as attractive as regular bookends, too, and far less likely to be tipped over. The warehouse store only sold a couple of these pieces, and I noticed an intriguing smaller size Safco Products Onyx 5 Upright Sections, Black (3256BL) in the product photo that I couldn't buy there... Naturally, I came to Amazon, and discovered I could've saved a few dollars by shopping here first. I bought my five section organizer here, and am about ready to spring for a second one of the 8-section I bought originally. (I'm integrating a decade of the results of a bibliophile buying children's nonfiction books. Most normal people could probably use one of these 8-section organizers for all of their texts.)I'm really happy to have our books staying upright, on the shelves, and no longer fear that they will topple onto my children's heads. (The bookshelves are above their desks.) The increase in organization makes me happy. These are coated metal, look pretty good, and show no signs of bending under heavy loads. I am very happy with this line of products, and expect to buy several more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNV5BUEUZKS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GRBMOU#wasThisHelpful","R3HNV5BUEUZKS0","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're starting up our 4th grade home school year now, and I decided to start us off with PRE-History before we carry on with our chronological study of human history from the ancient world onwards. This book was already in our library of children's non-fiction, but it was precisely what I was looking for.At 61 pages (ours is a 1983 edition), it took my son less than an hour to read in its entirety. He did stop to ask a few questions along the way. He is a very strong reader, so I'm a poor one to comment on how the language in this book would be for a more typical 9 year old. The content, however, is perfect. As I read through the book before giving it to him, I didn't feel ""talked down to"". This is not a simple picture book like the DK ones with a lot of ""sound bites"" surrounding a minimal narrative. Instead, this reads like a simplified textbook for a grade school child. Perfect!I did supplement this book with a more recent chart of human evolution from a different (more current) source. It was easy to explain this to my son, because  All About Prehistoric Man discusses how scientists were debating whether to classify  Homo habilis as Homo or Australopithecus habilis. I'm not looking for my son to memorize our probable human ancestors at this point in his education, but I do appreciate his learning more about how working anthropologists learn more, adjust their own understanding and recategorize that information for the rest of us. He learned something about real human knowledge as adults use it as compared to typical children's textbooks which can make topics seem quite static and ""dead"".At its original full price, a book like this might be better suited to a school library, but it was precisely what I wanted and well worth the typical used price for my home school purposes. Even if ""known facts"" change, a book like this can still form a basis from which the educated parent can teach a child about the general path of human evolution and prehistoric man.  The discussion of why we now know something different than what the ""best expert"" of the past once said is invaluable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGCZ3NRPDWUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0831771364#wasThisHelpful","R3UGCZ3NRPDWUE","A5XG0KDFX4WMI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5XG0KDFX4WMI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I began to read this novel, I wondered if it was just idly pleasant reading, or if it was ever going to ""go somewhere."" You'll need a bit of patience to get through the introductory section, although it artfully rendered a world I found alluring right from the start.I would have enjoyed this book simply for the ""character study"" of the Mathic world on Arbre. Once the adventure bit began, however, I started nudging my (sleeping) husband to tell him he's got to read this book... As an educated and intelligent person who's opted to stay home with the kiddos for the past many years, I positively reveled in the theorics discussions peppered throughout. This kind of exploration of ideas represents the very best that science fiction can be.I really enjoyed Anathem! On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend it to just anybody.

"This review is written from the perspective of someone that is not tech savy, such as a senior.I just provided this phone to someone that has been successfully using a Verizon Samsung phone very similar to the Jitterbug and am disappointed with the misleading opening screen. It is VERY confusing for seniors - the exact opposite of the intent to make it easier to use for older people. You get a screen that has a scrolling option on it, every time you turn it on, and it has the question: ""Select?"" at the bottom of the screen. I can't tell you how many times the user pushes the ""Yes"" button and is then directed to whatever option they accidentally have on the screen. I say ""accidentally"" because the two arrow buttons and the ""No"" button will scroll to different screen options, compounding the confusion. This cannot be changed, since GreatCall's management has decided that users should not be able to choose their own screen settings. It is nothing like any other cell phone to which you are accustomed. The user does not realize that he must ignore whatever the screen says - a counter-intuitive process - and just start dialing.There is a phonebook, which is part of that confusing scroll screen and, once you program it, you can use the number buttons for speed dial. In the phone book, in the upper right corner of the screen, you will see the button number assigned to the phone number. However, to use the speed dial, you can't just press the corresponding number button to dial (unlike all other cell phones I've owned). You will have to press the button number corresponding to the phone number in your phone book. The button number then appears on your screen. You then press the ""Yes"" button and it will start dialing and then it will display the phone number being dialed. I am explaining all of this because the speed dial function is completely missing in the user manual sent with the phone.You will see, in the user manual, instructions on using voice dialing, which is active when the opening menu is scrolled correctly to ""Voice Dial"" instead of a permanent setting option. However, even though it is in the manual, the ""Voice Dial"" menu option does not appear on your phone initially. You must call GreatCall customer service to have them activate it (takes 2 hours for it to appear on your phone after they activate it). I mention this because there is no instruction in the manual explaining why it doesn't appear on your phone when you first receive it. Additionally - now this is TOP SECRET - you can have the phone start with voice dial as the default screen whenever you open the phone to make a call. This is a much better option than the confusing scroll screen. This info is nowhere in the manual and only one customer service agent, out of five, accidentally mentioned it to me.Other shortcomings and tips:- Speaker function does not have an identifiable ""speaker"" button. To use the speaker function, you must have already dialed your number and then you can press the up arrow button to turn the speaker on and off, but it does not remain in the 'on' position after you hang up and you will have to repeat this process with every phone call. Too cumbersome for a senior.- Neither a battery strength or signal strength indicator appear anywhere on either screen (what device have you ever owned that didn't show battery strength?). It is buried inside one of those scroll functions on the opening screen. It does flash a warning when you are running low on battery charge, but nothing is easily viewed before that critical warning.- If you are switching from one Greatcall device to a new Greatcall device, be prepared to have to set up an entirely new account and filling in all of the information you already have in your old account. Further, you will need a new email address, since Greatcall will not allow the same email address to be used twice, even though you are deleting your old account. Believe me, Greatcall's management are not bright. I am at two weeks of nearly daily calls to customer service agents that are ineffective at implementing what they say they will do and are not generally knowledgeable about their products or systems.- When first setting this up, be prepared to spend a week or two on daily (many times a day) calls to customer service. ANYTHING that you need added/updated to your new phone will take many attempts for GreatCall to get it right. You will also get conflicting instructions from each agent but, with enough patience on your part, eventually they get it right. The only thing they got right the first time, was taking my money.All in all, this is a device that does not conform to other cell phone standards and is prone to confusing older folks. If many of the options could be permanently set by the user, instead of having to be selected each time, including the option to eliminate that opening scrolling mess, the rating would jump substantially.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I7CTMRJ86FUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCWE8K4#wasThisHelpful","R1I7CTMRJ86FUD","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unlike most other big brand crabgrass preventers, such as Scott's, this contains Dimension, which is the trade-name of a pre-emergent utilizing dithiopyr that works both as a pre-emergent and post-emergent for recently sprouted plants. That means that you can apply it later in the season because it kills crabgrass that has already emerged (unlike other pre-emergents) and it lasts longer.It is a pre-emergent ONLY (no fertilizer). You shouldn't put fertilizer down in the early spring anyway. It encourages top growth at the expense of root growth. Apply your fertilizer in late fall (after Thanksgiving), when the grass is dormant, and it will be there for the roots next spring.

Earthway will replace the red tub, but that means that you are responsible for disassembling the spreader and putting all of those parts back together again ...and it is difficult. you will need to call them back to get instructionsThe problem is that the shut off plate that opens and closes to allow metered dispensing is retained on the tub by plastic hooks that are part of the tub. Earthway's engineers (term used losely) do not understand that plastics are sensitive to 90 degree angles (they break easily at the angle) and that is exactly how these retainers are designed. As you open and close the fertilizer release mechanism, you gradually stress those angled retainers until they finally break. When you consider that the plastic used is the same as the low-quality plastic used in your kitchen garbage can, you can depend upon these breaking before you get much use out of it.You can't do worse by trying Scott's spreaders, which is what I'll do when Earthway refuses to send me more replacement tubs whenever the hooks break.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCNAAQCZ5CX99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XS3EFW#wasThisHelpful","RCNAAQCZ5CX99","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Look at the pattern in the reviews: these don't last. Of the the three, one has failed after two months of use. The LED industry claims LED's last 20 years. Theoretically, the LED source might, in the lab, make it that long according to the accelerated tests they use, but this is not real world testing. LED's are not as simple as the tried-and-true incandescent bulbs. LED's require complex and sensitive electronics behind that light you see. It is those electronics that are so finicky and prone to failure.This is a poor value. Perhaps, if they were $5 a bulb, it MIGHT be justifiable, assuming the other two don't fail in the next 6 months. However, at almost double that price, it's not a good deal. If you need this size bulb, go to Home Depot or Lowes and buy the cheapest LED's you can find - they can't be any worse than this. Then, when those fail, you won't be out so much.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6X17MLV5A05V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ED55XT6#wasThisHelpful","R6X17MLV5A05V","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three stars only because it works as a CO2 generator (just like anything you can make - easily - for free). However, what I wanted was the ability to hang it from the back of my tank, out of the way, as the product  information claims. I had to return this after three weeks. The hanging adapter is poorly designed and begins to break from the weight of the cylinder. Then, you have to put it on the floor like my old soda bottle standby. There are instructions for making your own DIY CO2 generator all over the internet.Nutrafin provides yeast and baking powder in this kit, although they are labeled as some kind of special-fantastic-mysterious powders. All that you are doing here is putting a little yeast into sugar water. The yeast eats the sugar and the byproducts are CO2 (which you want) and alcohol (dont try drinking it!). Any sugar will work. Start by dissolving 1  cups of sugar into 1  cups of lukewarm tap water and make sure the apparatus are always cleaned first with a hot water rinse (no soaps). Then add about  teaspoon of yeast, which should be activated by stirring it with a fork in about a  cup of lukewarm water until its creamy and has lots of bubbles in it and let it to stand at least 10 minutes before adding it to the sugar water. Although some users recommend adding baking soda (not baking powder), it isnt really necessary to buffer the mixture. The yeast is killed by the alcohol buildup, not acidic water.Speaking to that, the length of time that this will produce CO2 is a function of how long the yeast survives until the alcohol builds up to a certain level and how much yeast is in the mixture. You want to try to find that optimal balance. So, its better to start with the most alcohol resistant yeast you can get, which is wine/champagne yeast. You can buy packets here on Amazon (Premier Cuvee Wine Yeast) for about $8. This will stand up to about 18% alcohol levels, which means it produces longer than a typical bakers yeast that might be as low as 5% alcohol tolerance. Start with  teaspoon of yeast and see how long it lasts for you. Try adjusting the yeast level both up and down until youre happy with the length of time that it lasts and the amount of CO2 it produces (bubbles per minute).Were not done yet. You need to get the CO2 to dissolve into the tank water and not get to the surface where it would evaporate. Included in this kit is a large and ugly bubble ladder (ladders arent very efficient). What I do, which is a much more efficient way to get the most CO2 into your water, is to run the end of the CO2 tube into my canister filters intake pipe. I have a sponge filter attached to it and I insert the tube through the sponge to hold it in place. A power head would also work. The idea is to get the impeller to chop the bubble into minute pieces, making it much easier to dissolve.How do you know if its still making CO2? Buy a bubble counter here on Amazon (Fluval 88g-CO2 Bubble Counter - 3.1 Ounces) for about $3. With that, you count the number of bubbles per minute. Count the bubbles after about 24 hours of setting it up and monitor it every week (or more often) to see when it starts dropping off. Then you know the yeast is almost dead or gone and can decide when to make a new batch. In addition to being a bubble counter, it also acts as a gas separator, helping to prevent anything other than the CO2 from getting into your tank.How do you know if youre getting enough CO2 into the water? Well, if there is a noticeable change in plant growth over about two weeks, you have your answer. However, you can also but a CO2 drop checker (again, on Amazon: ISTA CO2 Indicator Drop Checker) for about $13. This will tell you whether or not CO2 is at a good level or is too high or low.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEONQI1LMF8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00026058Y#wasThisHelpful","R3AEONQI1LMF8D","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, it is 5 stars as a utility cabinet (I'm putting it in my basement). Putting it where it can be seen by your visitors is not a good idea. You will easily see the many holes along the sides where the shelf supports can be placed, the back is cardboard with folds in it and edges do not fit particularly well.

"It is bright and the pinpoint of LED light in the bulb will actually make it difficult to look at, unlike an incandescent bulb having the same light output (lumens), but that is what LED's do. I was trying this in an exterior lamp and that pinpoint of light is very obvious. Use these where you have a shade or other diffuser to try to block that intense pinpoint of light. However, this is not the reason for my low rating (this brightness is the positive aspect of my review).My main complaint is that this is being marketed as ""Daylight"" equivalent. It may be by ONE standard of measurement (color temperature), but there is obviously MUCH more to daylight than that very limited criteria set forth in a color temperature measurement. I suspect that the absence of the full color spectrum of the sun is the reason. Objects under this 5,000K light look nothing like they do under daylight. This light will bathe your object to an appearance of being very washed out and sterile. It fits with what the descriptions were by the men that walked the Moon's surface.Since it seems impossible to get true daylight with either LED's or CFL's, I am going to go back to what I hope will be the equivalent of an incandescent bulb and order LED's having the 2700K ""warm"" look. Hopefully, LED technology can, at least, be the equivalent of that.BTW: although everyone likes the idea of these lasting comparatively longer than any other type of bulb (which is why I'm trying them - cost savings really aren't that great a difference when you factor in the price of these things), the fact is that no one has had them long enough to really know. We are all just hoping that the lab tests saying they last longer translate into actually lasting longer under real-life conditions. Judging by the high number of reported failures by other reviewers, I'm not optimistic.UPDATE: bought the 2700K and they match perfectly to the incandescent light. some observations on various LED outputs:- These bulbs seem to be very sensitive electronic equipment.

"This review is from the perspective of replacing incandescent ceramic (glass) C7's on a Christmas tree.Contrary to what other reviewers have said, these lights are not like the lights when 'we were growing up' other than being the same size and shape.These LED lights are of the lowest quality LED lights you can buy ...and it shows. On a Christmas tree, standard ceramic bulbs glow brightly and this highlights the ornaments and tree branches. These stringer sets glow at about half the brightness of ceramic bulbs so, they are very dim by comparison to the standard ceramic bulbs. With these lights, ornaments are not highlighted and the overall look is that of a very dark tree.Additionally, the bulbs on these stringer sets are 8"" apart vs. the typical 12"" of ceramic bulbs. That makes a big difference on a tree. To cover the same area on the tree as your ceramic set, you need to buy 50% more of the LED sets. Of course, this means that you get 50% more bulbs and now you start crowding out your ornaments. With this many more bulbs, you'd think that the light would be better, but it's not. The bulbs are just too dim, even when the number of bulbs is increased by 50%.From my reading, it seems that the separate ""replacement"" LED bulbs are far superior to the bulbs in these sets. These ""replacement"" bulbs have the standard screw-in small base just like the ceramic C7's and have three emitters per bulb. I assume this means three times the brightness. I haven't tried them yet as they are still very expensive as compared to ceramic bulbs.

"Haven't tried it in snow yet, but expect it to be better than a very similar design that I have right now that is smaller. This is a first impression upon inspection.I avoided Garant's plastic models, as plastic tends to deflect off of packed snow, such as you get when your car packs the snow where the tires run over it. For plastic to work well, the snow must have fallen upon a smooth driveway. Any previous ice or packed snow adhering unevenly below the new-fallen snow will cause a plastic shovel to bounce over or to the side. Metal shovels can scrape up such problems.So, I looked at the steel Garant shovels, but saw some reviewers commenting about how heavy they were. Then I found this aluminum version and, having a similar aluminum shovel before, that held up well, I ordered this. This is well constructed and is still somewhat heavy, but easily workable. I can see that a steel shovel would have had me fighting the shovel itself as well as the snow. This was the right choice.4 Stars because 1) I haven't actually proven that it works yet and 2) a warning to others that they may want to consider buying from a seller other than ""Ron's Home and Hardware."" The shovel arrived wrapped in [what seemed to be] an entire roll of Saran wrap! It took me 15 miuntes to get through it and it doesn't provide protection during shipping. There were many areas where it had been punched right through resulting in scrapes and dings on the shovel. Since the shovel will get that anyway during use, I decided to keep it.UPDATE: First snowfall of 1-2 inches and this shovel performed as expected: lightweight, scraped under the tire-tread-packed snow well, no sticking of snow to the shovel and a good curve to the scoop that makes it easy to get maximum scooping without bending over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ETBI63612WZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DAS1P#wasThisHelpful","R2ETBI63612WZR","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As you know, from season 1, the episodes in this series are really about 20 minutes long, but they repeat so much that they stretch it to 45 minutes to get more commercials in. With those 20 minutes being so good, it was worth the repetition in season 1. However, when you are so distracted by the narration, you start to tune out on the content. That leaves you with about 10 minutes of memorable content and you end up sitting there, at the end of the show, saying ""What was that episode about?""The problem is that this narrator is the thsweetesth guy you can imagine.

"The canopy part of this umbrella seems well made and does the job intended. The tilt (contrary to some other reviewers comments on this style) is good - it allows for significant blocking of low-angle sun. If it were to tilt any more than it does, it might fall over.The reason for three stars, rather than more, is due to the construction of the lower half of the shaft (the section that inserts into a base). A base will have a screw-in retaining system that works by applying pressure onto the shaft section inserted into the base. Unfortunately, the shaft section is - as indicated in the description - aluminum (more like aluminum foil). The retaining screw of a base will crush the shaft of this umbrella without ever applying enough pressure to hold it firmly. Consequently, you can not lift the umbrella up (to move it around) without it pulling out of a base. You will have to grab the base itself to move the unit. This is a very awkward maneuver and puts your back at risk. Further, when the umbrella is angled, a breeze will cause the umbrella to spin out of position, since you cannot tighten the shaft firmly.If the umbrella had a steel lower section, all of these problems would be prevented.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8OGMFKAT9QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074AVHM4#wasThisHelpful","R2V8OGMFKAT9QH","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The songs are excellent, the mastering in this ""Ultimate"" compilation ruins them.This album has the most (worst) dynamic range compression possible. Every soft part of a song is as loud as the loudest part of the song. Not at all the way the songs were originally mastered. You can even hear distortion resulting from this in some songs. Look up ""Loudness Wars"" on Wikipedia. This mastering effort is firing all of the weapons.If you want compilation albums that are not fighting the ""Loudness Wars"", try ""30 Years Of Maximum R&B box set"", ""Meaty Beaty Big & Bouncy"", ""Who's Better Who's Best"", or ""Greatest Hits"" (although it's pushed a little). Don't pick ""Odds & Sods"", it has the same compression problems in the CD remastering.

"That's why I bought it and it completely cleaned the very dirty tires after about 15 passes on the first sheet of these 30-sheet pads. The only drawback is that these are as blue as the picture indicates. Blue is not good in a home. If the manufacturer made a beige offering, i could leave this out on a section of my floor all the time.As anyone with power wheelchairs or, to a lesser extent, manual wheelchairs knows, the tires from these devices makes hard floor surfaces (like linoleum in a kitchen) a mess - even when they are only used indoors. The tires pick up every possible bit of grime and transfer it right to the floor. You need to wash your floors very frequently and then the grime re-develops after about a week. Now, with these, I can keep the pad in a closet, put it down whenever I want (I'll do it daily), and clean the tires in about three minutes to prevent the build-up. This should dramatically extend the time between floor cleanings.They may seem expensive, but you get a total of 120 sheets (they are on thin pads of 30 sheets to a pad). After your first cleaning, one sheet will probably last at least a week before it gets too dirty to re-use. So, this purchase will last you about two years. I looked all over the Internet for a cleaning solution for wheelchair tires but found nothing practical other than either spending hundreds of dollars on special machines or getting down on the floor and clean it yourself with a bucket and brush, but that only lasts a little while before they get dirty again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HXXDMA78Y27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGDY70E#wasThisHelpful","R2HXXDMA78Y27","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Background: I have a little over a third of an acre of clay soil, with grass in it, to mow. I use a self-propelled walk behind mower for the exercise. I have neglected the lawn, other than fertilizing, for over ten years. This clay is fairly compacted.These spikes penetrate, easily, all the way into the soil. That is no issue. However, forget trying to hold these on your feet using the straps that come with it. First, I admit that the manufacturer does not recommend doing this while cutting the grass. They would prefer that you walk around your yard with these on, like a bird (lifitng your feet straight up and down like pistons). The straps might hold in that situation, but how many of us are going to do that?No, we're going to use these while we mow and, if you do that, you are going to walk in a way that moves you forward by lifting your back heel first as you take a step and that makes the straps useless. Here is what I did: buy some industrial strength Velcro on Amazon (make sure it's industrial strength). Put it on a cheap/old pair of shoes (smooth sole surfaces are best) and attach your shoe, that way, to these spikes. I did it and walked around for an hour and these held tight the entire time.The next problem, though, is how to keep your shoe from sliding off your heel. If any readers have an idea, please let me know. While the spike goes into the ground easily. You do have to pull a little to get them up. In a normal walking stride, your heel pulls out of your shoe and the blisters I got, from the back and forth, were not fun. Until i can figure out how to solve this heel issue, i won't use them again. Probably tolerable on a much smaller lawn.Also, this is going to give you a good workout. Plan on double the amount of time to mow your lawn with these on and you will have to walk in a weird way that will exercise muscles you may not be used to using.Be careful with areas of just dirt (no grass), especially if it is damp. The spikes will grab and hold large chunks of the dirt, blocking full penetration. I carried around (in my back pocket) a small three-pronged garden cultivator (you can get them cheap on Amazon) to remove it quickly. I am an OSHA nightmare when doing all of this.BTW: if you're looking at these spikes, you must care about your yard. Don't put any fertilizer on until you know what condition your soil is in. If you don't have the right soil condition, the grass won't absorb much of the fertilizer and may need different nutrients and concentrations than what you just dumped on it. Spend $10 to get your soil analyzed at a reputable university. I use Penn State (Google it). They will tell you what condition your soil is in an give you exact recommendations as to what to do, fertilizer-wise, to get it to the right condition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DSZCPWJK116Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008E06H32#wasThisHelpful","R2DSZCPWJK116Q","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've used this for over three years now. It is highly reliable and allows you to travel anywhere in Verizon's network (which is almost everywhere in the US). It is better to think of this as a cell phone device that has specialized people ready to help you as soon as you push the big button in the center. You talk with them almost instantly. You can test it by pushing that button (they encourage you to do it now and then) and that gives you a feeling of confidence. Their people are incredibly friendly and effective.If you lose your connection, the red light tells you so and you just turn it off and back on, like your cell phone, as long as you're in Verizon's massive US service area. If your home has a weak Verizon signal (like mine does) get a cell extender (Amazon and Verizon have them). They cost about $200 and will give you reception throughout your house (for you cell phones, too).With the locator function, you can authorize anyone you want to be able to go on their website and locate EXACTLY where you are, at any time, either using a map or satellite image. Basic GPS functionality and it works easily.Other reviewers have posted some negative reviews, which I will address:- Ours holds a charge. Never had a problem. Remember; it's like a cell phone you leave on all day. The battery will last as long as your cell phone battery does. They encourage you to charge it by your bed every night, although it can go days on a single charge. It remains functional while it is charging. More than three years now and it still holds the charge.- If you think a $35 one-time fee is too much, you probably don't own a cell phone. I doubt that there are any free services like this. We'll have to wait for Obamacare to give us everything free (I wonder how they are going to pay for that).- I must have forgotten that it's not waterproof. In three years, though, I've never had a problem. I leave it outside the shower. Remember: it's like a cell phone and you can't go swimming with your cell phone, either. However, it would be a good idea for 5Star to provide the option to pay more and buy a waterproof device if you want it. I can see how this could be a significant shortcoming and is the only reason I give it 4 stars. If you need it, and it gets wet, you may end up dead.Security Concern: In order to access your billing information and, therefore, have access to your account, Great Call requires you to verbally establish a pin number with them.

"First: Be careful about people rating the following review as helpful. Micca's US seller is known for seeding reviews to their benefit. As soon as I opened the box, I realized I had a problem. Note the picture of the product. It looks pretty easy to pack and travel. What it doesn't show is the normal - and large - power adapter required to run this!!! The power adapter profile is FOUR times larger than the device itself. It is going to take up quite a bit of space in your bag.As for performance, it has good functionality, but is not a high quality player. You don't get good contrast (no options) and the video crispness is lacking. I compared performance to a real video player: Western Digital's WD TV Live Hub, and there is a noticeable difference in quality.However, for a cheap knock-around [somewhat] portable player, it will do until these smaller, cheaper, devices reach higher quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6D7V3POPPCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NO9RRM#wasThisHelpful","RW6D7V3POPPCD","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Other reviewers are correct: this is relatively quiet and - so far - reliable.I will focus on the maintenance aspect, which is very important. This generator was not designed with maintenance convenience in mind and you will struggle with it. Based upon the poor design for maintenance purposes, I will probably try a Honda if this needs to be replaced.- The front and back covers are difficult to reinstall after removing them and the screws used for installation may be easily lost if you allow the cover to pop off once released. A latching mechanism would have been better. Both covers must be removed for full servicing.- Oil change: get a funnel with a flexible nozzle, the oil has to go in almost horizontally. When draining the oil, a hole is provided in the bottom. Unfortunately, at first, the oil gushes beyond the hole and into the housing.- Spark plug: a standard ratchet set won't be able to get into this tight fit. Yamaha provides a special toll (because the location is so poorly placed) to remove it. It is not a reliable way to ensure correct tightness.- Battery: if you think all of the above is hard, wait until you try to access the battery.All in all, the nightmare of servicing this will cause many users to just ignore it, but it really must be done to ensure proper operation when needed.UPDATE: couldn't take the extremely poor design of the wheels anymore (it's almost impossible to move this thing around).

"It does half of it's job very well. It receives the RF signal from my remote, a Harmony 650 (you have to place the transmitter-battery on the right side of the battery compartment), from anywhere in the house. It just can't reliably re-transmit the IR signal, to the components, from the saucer base. It works sometimes, but is more a random success. You consider yourself lucky if all of the components that you need to run turn on simultaneously. The special RF transmitter-batteries last about a month before they have to be re-charged.The individual emitters (which can be purchased separately) don't transmit through the backside where the adhesive attaches them to your component (unlike the Xantechs). So, you have to find a way to direct the beam, frrm the top surface of the emitter, into the component from a short distance away. How do you do that without hanging them mid-air? It's tough. You have to devise supports in some cases. In other cases, I attached two emitters, back to back, and hung them in front of two components and that increased effectiveness. It will take you quite a long time to find the correct positioning of these and they will be jostled out of place over time, requiring re-positioning work again.I returned the Next Gen RF transmitter and upgraded to the Xantech DL85K. Although it is more expensive, it delivers a solid IR signal to all of my components. It provides a solid burst that never fails to act upon the components of interest. My Harmony 650 now works perfectly - every time. It is so superior to the Next Gen device that you start to forget about unreliable performance and take for granted your remote system because it never fails.Spend the extra money and get the Xantech DL85K system.

"I tried my Harmony 650 remote, by itself, and found it not able to deliver a solid IR signal to all of my components, leaving some on and others off. So, I went looking for IR extenders. After considering reviews, I chose the Next Generation RF transmitter. It worked ok on one or two components and then I bought the 6-emitter pack to reach all of my components. The emitters were finicky and imprecise. So, I went back on the hunt. This time, I was prepared to move up in price to get better quality.Looking at reviews, here, and throughout the Internet, I decided upon the Xantech DL85K. I was not disappointed. It provides a solid burst that never fails to act upon the components of interest. My Harmony 650 now works perfectly - every time.The small receiver attaches anywhere and the IR emitters (that are best placed directly over the IR receivers on your component) attach strongly, unlike the Next Gen emitters, which fall off. The Xantech emitters transmit out of both sides so, when attached over the IR receiver on the component, they transmit out the back. The transmission through the top (front) of the emitter is strong enough that it could also be placed in the vicinity of a component and still work. When a signal is sent by the remote, the Xantech receiver and all of the emitters blink, so you know the signal is being received and generated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LAB23IWY7GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046WZ08U#wasThisHelpful","R13LAB23IWY7GG","A3CWRKJTB2SEQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWRKJTB2SEQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Push your button to perform your -activity-; and you're lucky if all the devices come on. Then you have to work your way through the help feature to get everything functioning the way it should. Use the -All Off- button and good luck getting everything to turn off, which means back to the help process. Might as well just use the three remotes.You can set the remote up either with Logitech's website (which doesn't work with all browser versions - crashes with Firefox - IE may be the only one it works reliably with) or their software. Wouldn't you think they'd have both of the formats the same? Nope, not Logitech. The website is a completely different format from the software. This results in different setup of the remote and I can't figure out which one is better because some of the features are different between the two. Nine months later and Logitech has restructured their web so that setup is difficult to find and they seem to delete users after inactivity for a few months so you will have to go through it all over again. A VERY difficult company to deal with.Logitech does miss some of the functionality of your remotes. One of my devices is the WD TV Live HUB.

It's a bit bigger than I expected, so it's kind of tricky to find an appropriate spot to put it, but it is very pretty (even when unlit).  I found the stand easy to assemble and adequately stable. If you don't like the stand, the lantern can be hung from a hook - I would suggest putting it on a pulley to make it easier to light.  Very happy with my purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAYUHSP3G3ELM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YQ49H2#wasThisHelpful","RAYUHSP3G3ELM","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned several of these types of screen protectors for various devices and I would say that the Skinomi product wins out on one key point - price.  I've used the Zagg protectors, an they're great, but expensive.  When I applied the Skinomi product I screwed it up and had to peel it back to remove cat hair.  I was concerned that because of my mistake I was going to have to contend with a bunch of air bubbles, but 3 days later, the screen is clean and clear. It adds a very slight ""texture,"" but I would say if anything, it improves the touch screen.Make sure you follow the directions if you've never applied these types of protectors before, as they can be frustrating until you get the hang of it.

"This is a nice metal piercing gun for piercing your lobes. It's kind of a two-action gun in that you pull back the mechanism and push a lever down on the side of the gun to activate it.  The trigger squeezes your lobe to make aiming the piercing easier.  I suppose this is good because it helps prevent accidental piercing. I've also found that placing the earring back in the gun doesn't work very well.  I just put the back on once I've put the earring through my lobe.Please toss out the piercing studs that come with this - purchase individually wrapped, sterile studs to do your piercing.  You are tempting infection and irritation if you use the studs that came with this gun.  Trust me. I tried 4 times and had infections every time. Once I switched to sterile studs, I had no problems. Also, make sure you LEAVE THE STUD ALONE for at least a couple of weeks.  Messing with it (yes even turning it, like we were taught) is a bad idea and only invites infection.Pros:Metal is easy to sanitizeTwo-step trigger helps reduce the risk of accidentally piercing your finger (or eye)Easy to useCons:Unsterile studs - toss them and buy individually wrapped sterile piercing studs.I think the studs also contain nickelThe coating on the studs (electroplate?) wore offDid I mention the studs that come with this gun suck?I've had good luck with these:Surgical Steel 4mm Ear piercing Earrings studs 12 pair Mixed Colors White MetalIn summary, this is a great inexpensive way to pierce your EARLOBES. Do not use this type of piercer on cartilage, nose, bellybutton, tongue, sexy bits, nipples, uvula, or younger siblings. Please have those piercings done by a reputable professional","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROBDD8NMNJ155/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGOWU6S#wasThisHelpful","ROBDD8NMNJ155","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was having a plague of frustrating issues with my internet connection through Comcast Xfinity.  I couldn't get through a complete streaming video from Netflix or Amazon without buffering issues, loss of video quality, or just loss of signal.  I continually was dropping the connection and had to fall back to my neighbor's open wifi connection. I was easily unplugging my modem 2-3 times a week to reset the damn thing. I was even having problems maintaining an uninturrupted signal for on - demand video. Yes,  I was a fool and rented the equipment from Comcast.I was hesitant to spring $200 for a new modem, but halleluja, I am so glad I did. My streaming video is crystal clear and has nary a hiccup in sight.  The signal strength is strong and clean. Range seems to be solid - I live on one level and the farthest I get away from the router is 40-50 feet. No problems so far.Setup was a snap. The password for access is located on a sticker on the bottom of the unit.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the access info to change the settings on the router are:ID: adminPassword: motorolaI did have to call Comcast customer service to have them activate the modem, but that took all of 10 minutes.I've got my Roku and Xbox connected to the 5Ghz signal and my phone connected to the 2.4 Ghz signal. (turn on the 5Ghz signal in the modem/router settings)  I did a bit of research and if the interwebz is to be believed, the major difference between the two is signal speed and range. Apparently because 5Ghz has a larger bandwidth, it's supposed to be faster, but doesn't have as much range as 2.4 Ghz.. Conversely, the 2.4 Ghz has a longer range, but isn't as fast as 5 Ghz. As of now,  I haven't noticed a difference.

It's the sheath I take issue with. It's right handed. The knife fits one way (it snaps in securely) and based on where the  belt loop is placed, placing it on your left side positions the blade out and the grip backwards,  which with a knife this sharp, you don't want ANY opportunity to fumble. Yes, you can attach it on your right side and grasp cross-body, but this again seems like an opportunity for bad things to happen.

The last couple of seasons have declined in quality, and the Zombie Episode was a shining example of why it's time to wrap it up. I understand it was presented as somewhat tongue in cheek, but they're still trying to sell the ""science"" when the show has tipped completely into the realm of fiction. They're really stretching the content to try to fit it in the original Mythbusters format, and it's wearing way too thin. There's a LOT of rehash, revisits, and just ridiculous content (zombies).

"I picked up a tip from a DIY website (I can't remember which one ) on how to make an excellent HDTV antenna at home with an aluminum pie pan and 4 feet of coax cable. Initially I thought it had to be BS, but I have replicated it several times and each time it doubles the number of channels I get.  The cool thing is that if it doesn't work for you, you haven't spent 40 bucks on a useless device.Here are the steps:Using tin snips or very heavy duty scissors, cut the bottom out of an aluminum pie pan.Cut another, offset circle out of the center of the pie pan bottom.  You should now have a crescent shaped  piece of metal with two points that don't touch. (I've also had success using the ""lip"" of the pan that I just cut off.  Just make sure you cut a gap in the circle.Cut the connector off of one end of a coax cable about 4 feet in length. strip about 3 inches off the end of the plastic insulator.  There should be a silver woven wiring around the inner sheath.  Unweave this and  twist it together to make a wire.  strip the inner sheath down to the copper wire.  Separate these two ends and attach each to a tip of the ""crescent.""  Make sure the silver and copper wires don't overlap or touch.Connect the other end of the coax to your digital receiver and either nail the pan to a wall, or drape the antenna and coax over the top of a couple of window  shade or drape rods (that's how I have it)Reset your channels by autotuning (check your manual).Be amazed at the increase in signal strength and quality.If you have questions, post them in this review, or web search DIY digital antenna.  It really works!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32Q51NN26DG7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007MXZB2#wasThisHelpful","R32Q51NN26DG7P","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I figured for the price, the Chromecast device was worth a shot.  It is significantly less expensive than any of the other popular streaming units out there (Roku, Apple TV, etc.).  I will say that for the content that it is designed, the picture is great - Netflix, Hulu, Google, Play, Youtube. While it doesn't surprise me, I wish amazon video was supported. For any non-chromecast supported content, the image is great, but I have found that the audio lags. I tried TBS's streaming channel, and it looked great on the cast, but as the content went on, the audio lagged farther and farther behind.Setup is a snap - you plug it in to your HDMI slot on your video device, register your unit and connect it to your wireless network.  Chrome has a plugin that allows you to cast any content from your desktop, laptop, mobile device, etc. It's pretty awesome as it is, but it would be super awesome if they somehow snuck in an OTA digital receiver.  My guess is that they didn't want to mess around with antennae.Pros:Great price pointEasy setupVideo and audio quality is superb for applications that are paired with chromecastCompact and unobtrusiveCons:Needs more content available (probably to be increased in the future)Non-chromecast content quality is sketchy.Overall worth the investment if you have a nice TV or projector and you want to watch your Netflix, Hulu or Google Play  streaming content  on your home theater setup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROOA4RAG0BGA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR0PDNE#wasThisHelpful","ROOA4RAG0BGA8","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Update - 10/21/13*After having played this game for several hours,  I have noticed that the designers have ""borrowed"" a number of ideas from several other games I have enjoyed (Burnout Paradise, The GTA series, (most noticably, gaining experience points for ""super jumps"", near misses, driving in oncoming traffic, etc).I'm still enjoying this game very much.I've never played any of the previous Saints Row titles, so I can't speak to how this game compares, but as a noob to the franchise,  I love the concept.  It's very much a GTA styled game with an ""open world"" map (although, the world is a fraction of the size of the GTA cities).  Based on how the NPC's react to you,  I'd swear it was the same AI engine as the early GTA games.  The thing I love about this game is the ""superpower"" twist.  I love leaping over the buildings, gliding around and racing around the streets.  For some reason, it's just a whole lot of fun. I can see how some reviewers might get a little tired of the repetitous gameplay, but I always seem to come back to it. It's easy enough that it's not frustrating, but challenging enough to keep you interested.  Also, the humor is well done.  I have actually laughed aloud at a couple of the jokes / scenarios / banter, etc. I paid full price for it and don't really regret it, because I was looking for something entertaining.  I don't know that it warrants a full price purchase.  Wait a few weeks and buy it used.  Otherwise, a very entertaining game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0HI6AF4Y151/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRQN2EM#wasThisHelpful","R3P0HI6AF4Y151","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really really really wanted to fall in love with my Fitbit Flex, but it needs more work.  My main problem was that two separate units would not hold a charge.  I tried charging the units for 3 hours (as recommended) and I tried charging the units for a full 36 hours. When my first one wouldn't hold a charge for more than a day,  I figured it was a one-off issue.

"*update 12/26/13I have moved the stix from one case to another and have found that if you do it carefully, it does not leave a residue. I tried the lower cost alternative (neoprene) and found it lacking in the fact that it stretches and gets loose. I have decided it's worth it to pay more for the silicone version and have it keep it's shape.  Also,  I accidentally placed a duplicate order and the company was very good to work with.

"I know there are a zillion reviews on these headphones and people probably won't get to my review, but I love these headphones so much, I had to write a review.  My first ever ""professional"" headphones was a pair of what I believe to be an older version of this model.  I used them for a good 20 years until they finally fell apart. Since then I have tried a variety of cans including Bose, behringer, and JVC.  For the price,  The sound on these 'phones is AWESOME. Big bass sound, but tight and clean.  Nice clear mids, crisp highs.  The cups cover your ears and provide as much sound isolation as you'd want (they're not active noise reducing). You also don't get that weird pressure wave that many active sound isolating headphones have. Here's the pro /con breakdown:PROS:*GREAT sound! I'd put these up against headphones three times this price. Big bass sound, clean and tight, not boomy. Clear mids and crisp clean highs.*pretty darn comfortable (I have a big melon) I've been wearing them for 3 hours straight and have no discomfort, no cauliflower ear, no sweaty ears.*good sound isolation - since they cover your ears, they block out most outside sounds to my satisfaction. you can still hear sounds, but you can't make out details.*Reasonably priced - I paid about $90*comes with a 1/8 plug and 1/4 adaptor for those of you who still have old school a/v equipment that still requires 1/4 jacks (I think that's more for plugging into a console since they ARE designated as ""professional"")*The fold up reasonably compactly, for as big as they are.*comes with a handy drawstring ""pleather"" carrying case.CONS:*Long dangly curly cord (ok, that's not REALLY a con, but I had to come up with something)*Because of their size and propensity to block outside sounds, I wouldn't recommend these for any kind of outdoor use. These are great for home or work where you aren't moving a lot. I do see people out and about with larger headphones on,(say on the bus or subway) but I wouldn't try jogging with these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19YCTUGHUZTS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AJIF4E#wasThisHelpful","R19YCTUGHUZTS3","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been following KT Tunstall since Black Horse and the Cherry Tree made it's debut, and to be honest,  that rhythmic upbeat tempo was what I liked so much about her music for the longest time. I have recently started paying much closer attention to her slower, more introspective songs and have been amazed at what I'm hearing.  IE / CM is an entire album of introspective, mellow tunes. This album is a must listen with headphones because there are a LOT of subtleties that would be easy to miss otherwise. I have been listening to it at work - it's great work music because it is stimulating, but not distracting. The way she layers her vocals (and vocalizations) is fascinating.  This would be a great album to listen to on headphones with the lights turned off and a few candles burning. Yeah,  I know.  That sounds kind of hippy dippy, but this album is mesmerizing.

"I've used this stove camping a couple of times now and I like it's simple design.  It's easy to set up, burns nice and hot, and uses a multitude of fuels.  You can use biomass (sticks, pinecones, bark, dried dung, etc) or you could use a small alcohol stove, or sterno fuel, esbit cubes, etc. I like the idea that it is flexible based on your needs and available fuels. The stove is sturdy when assembled - a pot full of water placed on top is stable as long as the stove is on a level surface. If you use biomass be prepared for a lot of soot on your utensils, and on the stove. The stove is very light weight - useful for everything except the most intense ultralight packing situation.As of this writing, the stove does not come with a case. My suggestion is Custom Leathercraft 1100 Multi-Purpose Clip-on Zippered Poly Bags. You get 3 tough nylon bags in 3 different sizes.  The middle size (blue) is absolutely perfect for the Emberlit Stove. The pouches have a heavy duty zipper and a swivel clip to make attaching to your gear easy.Overall I think this stove is well designed, easy to use and a good price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC7HNC3ZZM9WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADUYW9M#wasThisHelpful","RC7HNC3ZZM9WQ","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*update: 10/15/13*I still love this projector, and I have solved the HDMI audio issue with this little device: J-Tech Digital (Registered US Trademark) Premium Quality HDMI to HDMI + Audio (SPDIF + 3.5mm Stereo) Audio Extractor Converter. It's a teensy bit kludgy, but it works.  You plug your HDMI cable into the unit and run another HDMI cable out to your video source.  There is also a 1/8 inch audio out that you'll need to adapt to whatever your stereo inputs are (I had a 1/8 inch mini plug to rca cable already on hand.) it works well and looks terrible :)I've watched all sorts of videos from DVD to streaming video to gaming to OTA digital programming.  Everything looks great - bright, clear, well saturated (I also typically use the ""eco mode"" which is slightly dimmer and is supposed to make your lamp last longer and/or use less juice. I find it plenty bright for anything I have needed.  The room doesn't need to be particularly dark either.  I've watched videos in full daylight and had no issues. Overall I highly recommend this projector.This my first projector.  I was shopping for HD flatscreens when my GF suggested that we look into projectors instead.  I realized we could save ourselves a good chunk of change and have portability in the mix.  I did quite a bit of research and decided I liked the ""short throw"" concept of not having to place the projector very far from the screen surface. There was only one review, but I've been pretty happy with Sony products in the past, so I decided to take a chance. I'm glad it did. The picture is beautiful, bright and crisp - even in bright light. There are a number of settings to modify the picture based on the content (cinema, game, living, etc).  Setup was a snap once I figured out the ""keystone"" adjustment - When I first turned on the projector, the image was in the shape of a trapezoid.  Going into the menu and adjusting the keystone fixed the problem. By placing the projector about 3 feet from the wall,  I get a nice big 50"" image.  The instructions say that the largest workable image is about 100"".  I found 50-60"" to be plenty big.Inputs:1 HDMI1 S video1 component (rca)Here's where my one complaint comes in.  The built in speaker is decent (surprisingly so), but the unit lacks an audio out.  What this means is that in order to run the audio signal through your stereo system, you need an amp / signal receiver that has an HDMI input and output. OR your video signal source needs an audio out (my HDTV receiver does - so I can watch over the air DTV and run the sound through my stereo).  I run the majority of my video content from my Kindle Fire HD, and because the output on the Kindle is only HDMI, I can't split out the audio and run it through my stereo.This is a relatively minor complaint, but if you're going to build your home theater, you'll need to make sure you have a way to split your audio signal prior to running it through the projector.All in all this is a great home projector at a fantastic price.  Every video source I've run through it is crisp, clear, well saturated, and smooth. Great for movies, gaming, sports, and general watching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F2H63VGKQ0RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00934CQ42#wasThisHelpful","R3F2H63VGKQ0RZ","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*update 09/23/2014*I've had a second Roku 3 now for almost a year and I love it.  It's easy to use, very intuitive, and the content available keeps growing.  I think the first unit that I got (reviewed below) was defective.I was really disappointed with the Roku 3.  I got one to hook up to my new LCD projector to stream Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, etc . . . While watching content from my Amazon Prime account (Mythbusters) It lost the signal 3 times and just plain stopped.  After the 3rd time, I got frustrated and disconnected it and hooked up my Kindle Fire HD to watch the same content. It was at this point that I realized how lousy the picture (and sound) on the Roku is by comparison.  The image from the Kindle is MUCH sharper, better saturated, and looks much more like HD content.  In comparison,  I would say the Roku was like S-video as compared to standard def. The roku also wouldn't recognize my HBO GO account, which my kindle has no problem with.

"*Update 10/7/13*Still in photographic love with the g15.  I've started taking pictures in RAW format and have actually noticed a significant difference between JPEG and RAW.  The colors are better, shadows are more defined, and while I haven't tried this myself, those in the know say RAW format is much easier to edit in post production. Here's the thing - compared to JPEG, RAW format files are H-U-G-E (in some cases, almost EIGHT times as large!) No wonder the RAW images are prettier.  The JPEG files average out at about 3.5 - 4 Megs per photo, while the raw files are upwards of 27 megs . . .! I guess I'd better invest in some extra storage space!I have been a fan of the Powershot G series since the G1.  I have owned the G1, G5, G9, as well as SX200IS and SX40.  I was lured away from the ""traditional"" G series by the prospect of a greater optical zoom (SX200is) and ultimately the ""superzoom"" (SX40). Now I have returned to the G15 and I am overwhelmed with joy.  While the zoom and superzoom cameras take decent shots and have nice close-up capabilities, the overall quality of the photos (color balance, sharpness, depth of field) was lacking.  The superzoom had issues with vignetting and distortion of the image at the outer edges.  One of the things that the early G series (as well as most early model digital cameras) had problems with was low light shots.  The sensors couldn't handle low light situations without graininess.Enter the G15. It is a solidly constructed body, has plenty of functionality for the budding photographer and the serious amateur, takes GREAT low light shots, and just takes beautifully crisp, balanced pictures. I am very pleased with my purchase.Pros:*Much improved low light shooting*TONS of features (facial recognition, self portrait with a wink, ""fisheye,"" posterizing, slo-mo video, HD video, etc, etc, etc, etc!*Dials and buttons are placed within easy reach (new exposure setting dial is very nice)*LCD is big and beautiful (doesn't flip out, but I always figured that was one more thing to break)*AUTO shots are crisp, balanced, deeply colored and gorgeous*Plenty of options to allow you to play with exposure time, aperture, timer, white balance, color swap, monochrome and much much more.*Multiple accessories allow for adapting filters and lenses, external flash, macro ring lights, remotes, slaves, and on and on.Cons:*unless you are interested in delving into tweaking your photos, all of these features might be a bit overwhelming.*body might be a little heavy for some .This is a brilliant camera.

"I love these soaps! My favorite scents are peppermint and eucalyptus.  This stuff can be used in a multitude of ways, depending on how you cut it or what you mix it with.  I recently mixed 1 part glycerine with 1 part doc Bronner's to get a wonderful hand soap and shower ""gel.""  The soap itself is very fluid and I like how the glycerine thickens it up a bit and gives it a silkiness that makes your skin feel wonderful.  The ""ramblings"" on the label are a tad weird, but it's all a part  of the charm.  I'm not kidding when I say this stuff can be used in an endless number of ways: hand soap, dish soap, laundry soap, shower gel, shaving soap, TOOTHPASTE!, all purpose cleaner, wood cleaner, car cleaner, dog cleaner, facial cleanser, toilet cleaner, and on and on and on . . . .Doc Bronner's really is magical stuff.

"After seeing a number of You Tube videos and reading numerous reviews of the Stove Tec stoves, I finally decided to try one out - I'm a sucker for cool tech, especially when it's a simple and elegant design.  I have several ""rocket"" type camping stoves and have experimented with building a basic stove out of bricks.  I'm not sure if I bought the Stove Tec stove with the intent of using it as a barbecue, emergency stove, or just because I was intrigued by the novelty of it.  I think it was the novelty of it.  I cranked up the stove a few days ago and here are my impressions:Pros:Burns efficiently - I boiled a pan of water in about 5 minutes, and cooked up a mess of hot dogs on a circular grill right over the flames.Very little waste - several hours of burning wood in kindling sized chunks resulted in a remarkably small pile of ash (I'd estimate less than a cup)Burns any kind of combustable biomass (Sticks, grass, dung, pinecones, etc) so there's no need to purchase or transport fuel.Cons:This bad boy is HEAVY.  It's steel encapsulated ceramics. . . what do I expect?!  It tips the scales at 28 lbs, which while making it portable, rules it out of any sort of camping other than car camping.  I'd say it's even too heavy to make it worth taking along for tailgating - you could bring a portable gas grill that has a more controllable cook flame and weighs 1/2 to 1/3 as much.You have to keep it from getting wet - the instructions are pretty explicit about this.  I'm not sure if this is to protect the cast iron pot cover, the steel sheathing, or the ceramic insert, but it's mentioned several times.  This means you can't leave it out in the elements, and you'll have to be extra careful when camping or tailgating.The feeding of the fuel needs to be monitored reasonably closely - you can set it up to simmer once you have a good bed of coals, but I found the videos' claim of 30 - 60 minutes of simmer time to be a bit of an exaggeration. Now, I was using mostly pine as my fuel, so maybe using a hardwood would make a significant difference.My conclusion:If you're looking for a great option for an emergency stove,  While I think there are more portable and flexible options (The Kelly Kettle, for instance) I believe the Stove Tec stove would do a fine job providing a decent cooking option.  I also think that if you are living in an ""off the grid"" situation where you have a kitchen set up that doesn't move, the Stove Tec would be ideal. I just think it's too unwieldy to use as a portable stove option in camping, tailgating, picnics, etc.The stove itself is well made and sturdy.  AND it has a 10 year warranty.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R138U7R8C5J5KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084I60J0#wasThisHelpful","R138U7R8C5J5KD","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the flexibility of this back scratcher - it's got a sharp side and a smooth side, a single point and a rounded massage tip. The claws are robust and durable.  My only complaints are that the handle needs to be longer (or a longer handle version need to be offered) and the angle of the scratcher needs to be increased.  I have trouble getting the points to make constant contact with my back.

"I have owned a number of back scratchers both telescoping and fixed.  The problem with the telescoping scratchers is that they inevitably break.  The problem with most fixed length scratchers is that the heads aren't positioned correctly and/or the handles are too short. Enter the Bear Claw.  The handle is nice and long to reach ALL those itchy spots, and the claws are spaced nicely for good coverage.  They're also angled so that the tips make contact and do a great job of giving you a shuddery, goose bumpy back scratch. Some may think the tips are a bit sharp (not me), but it comes with a patch of sandpaper that allows you to dull the claws if you so desire. Wonderful product!

"*update 6/24/13*I have since taken the fan to work with me and it works well on a thinner clamping surface. I like the versatility of putting the fan up off my desk, saving desk space. I retract my statement that the clamp is not useful.I've had a number of desk fans from the Vornado to Holmes and I can honestly say that this fan is a nice little desk fan.  I like the vertical profile because it takes up a lot less space on my desk  On low it provides a nice, quiet, comfortable airflow. On high, the noise level increases quite a bit and the airflow doesn't seem to be that much more.The clip is a great idea, but needs to be re-engineered.  I was going to clip it to the bottom of my window, but the clamp doesn't have enough gripping power to hold the fan in place.  The edge of my desk is too thick for the clamp, so I couldn't try that out either.  Overall,  I believe this fan is worth the money.

"Just got back from a camping trip in which we used the XL flip box as a secondary cooler.  We folded it up, brought it along and put it to use with a 20lb bag of ice which we got near the campground.  It performed better than expected.  In addition to the bag of ice, we were able to fit a 12 pack of cans, a six pack of bottles, and a few additional food items (a pack of sandwich meat, pack of hot dogs, can of soup, ) I was impressed with the capacity  - and the insulating ability.  We had no noticeable melting of the ice until well into the second day - and this is with much opening and closing to retrieve drinks and food. It provided enough insulation that the ice chilled the six pack to ice cold from room temperature in about an hour.  After 3 days, we still have a good 15 or so pounds of ice left. The cooler is about as heavy as a typical throw away styrofoam cooler, but insulates much better and is much MUCH more durable. One slight con is that the cooler allows melt water to leak, which wasn't a huge problem for us since we had it outdoors the whole time.  I guess that prevents a sludgy pool of cold water collecting in the bottom of the cooler. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37YBSW54DXZAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ESE4Y8#wasThisHelpful","R37YBSW54DXZAF","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the reviews for this valve and  am wondering if it's the shower head being used that is causing all the disparity.  I purchased this valve because the showerhead I have has such a high rate of flow that it depletes my water heater in about 20 minutes.  I figured having a variable closure valve would allow each person to customize their shower experience  - from full power short shower to low power long shower.  Based on the reviews, I figured the ""off position"" would actually be ""trickle."" Here's what I found:Wide open seems wide open.  If it reduces flow rate, it's not noticeable to me.Fully closed is full shutoff - no trickle. Beware of scald when you turn the valve back on.Installation is easy - use teflon tape to reduce drips.Overall I'd say this valve does everything you'd expect it to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QX1VOIW27A3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025VWDGQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QX1VOIW27A3W","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**update 04/30/2013**I paired this shower head with a flow control valve (about 8 bucks right here on good ol' Amazon) - this gives me the flexibility to back down the pressure and extend the showering time.  I found with just a slight adjustment,  I could lower the pressure enough that a long shower was possible without a noticeable difference in spray pressure.  An added advantage of a flow control is you can conserve water by shutting the flow off (or at least down to a trickle) while you shampoo / shave / soap up / etc.  Bottom line, if you have a gigantic water heater and don't care about wasting water (shame on you) go crazy! Otherwise,  I would highly recommend a variable flow control in conjunction with this wonderful shower head for invigoratingly relaxing (is that an oxymoron?) shower time.  Happy showering!**update 4/21/13**This showerhead is not, in fact a water-saving device.  I actually drained the water heater last night by taking a 20 minute shower.  I have never drained my water heater before. That said, if you can deal with not saving hot water and can keep your shower to under 15 minutes, this thing is 15 kinds of awesome. We all need at least one guilty pleasure, don't we?How is it that something so inexpensive can be so wonderful? I've tried a lot of different water conserving showerheads and I find myself disbelieving that this device could actually be saving me water.  It sure provides a wonderful high pressure deluge.  I was a little worried that I was going to drain my water heater, but I had plenty of hot water.Installation was a no brainer. I had the best shower in years. Trust me on this one.

"The first time I filled and started my Zippo handwarmer,  I was pretty unimpressed.  The filling process seemed pretty cumbersome, and the warmer didn't get very warm. After doing some research,  I learned a few things.  First of all, it may help you to judge the proper fueling amount, but I HATE the funnel device that came with the warmer.  I fill the chamber directly and had more success (warning - make sure you allow any excess fuel to evaporate before using or you'll have a fire hazard).Here's my advice to get the most out of your warmer:* Give the heater some time to get going before you drop it in the pouch - when the heater is almost too hot to touch, drop it in the bag.* If you want REAL WARMTH, ditch the fleece pouch and put it directly in a pocket.  The pouch extends the burn time, but significantly reduces the heat output.* you can also regulate the heat output by leaving the drawstring open and exposing the catalytic burner to more O2. Conversely, closing the drawstring will reduce the heat.*DO NOT place the metal warmer directly against your bare skin for more than a few seconds as it WILL cause a burn. (this is especially important if your fingers have gone numb from cold)If you don't mind the filling process and keeping fuel around, you'll appreciate the extra warmth for your fingers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4NTJ3QXCZB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ABA08F6#wasThisHelpful","R2T4NTJ3QXCZB8","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My girlfriend introduced me to Paine's incense with their wooden cabin burner and I have been a big fan ever since.  I use the burner very frequently and the wood picks up resins from the incense and the constant heat of the burning cones dried out and cracked the wood.  I needed something more durable, and I found this ceramic cabin.  I was cautious about the pinon incense because I don't like the Paine's version of the pinon incense (I LOVE the cedar). I tried Santa Fe's version of the pinon, and I LOVE it. To me it's reminiscent of beachfires or outdoor campfires.  The cedar incense reminds me more of a fireplace. If you like Santa Fe's incense, I would encourage you to try Paine's cedar cones.The cabin is great - make sure you have the bottom plate set up correctly - those little nubs need to be facing up to allow airflow (just line up the door with the steps and you'll be fine.) Like any kind of wood incense, it takes a bit of time to get this incense burning correctly - hold a lighter to the edge and get it burning, blow on it to establish a ""cherry,"" set it carefully in the slot in the cabin floor (it's very hot), and Bob's your uncle.I would highly recommend this burner and incense for anyone who likes the ambiance of a campfire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ANSSZF3JGWD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NZ0D4K#wasThisHelpful","R1ANSSZF3JGWD7","A1K1MNVOJVP024","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K1MNVOJVP024?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own 5 different models of Dietz tubular lanterns as well as a variety of oil lamps.  Dietz lanterns are an excellent choice for emergency lighting, but there's a lot of misinformation about the correct fuel to use.  These lanterns are designed to use kerosene or kerosene - like fuel.  Both liquid paraffin and citronella are too viscous and will clog the wick, eventually reducing the efficiency of your burn and causing soot buildup on the globe (as well as polluting your breathing air).If you are looking for a very good fuel for these lamps that has low odor, check out ""Guiding Light Oil High Performance Lamp Oil Fuel""If you are interested in more information about different Dietz lantern models, which fuels are appropriate, and information about lanterns in general, check out W.T.

"I give the tracker a 4, rather than a 5 because in spite of the great reviews regarding battery life...that has not been my experience.  The company advertises up to 30 days on a charge.  Not so!  Even if the tracker WOULD continue to function for 30 days, which it never will, you wouldn't have nearly the battery power you'd need to track your pet.  We have 4 trackers on 4 dogs.  If you live in a small house/apt, the battery life MAY last longer.  But we have to charge the trackers every other day!  And always have.  The company explains that while the dog is within a certain distance from the docking station (the device that plugs in, charges the tracker, and is basically the ""brain"" of the thing...) the tracker will go into power saving mode.  If you have a larger house, as with our case, the dogs are more often than not outside the ""home zone"" and the tracker is constantly tracking.  It's because when your pet leaves your house the tracker is tracking or locating, which uses a lot of battery power!  So, this is the key to having marvelous success with these amazing trackers:  keep them fully charged at all times!  The app will signal you when the battery is low, as well as when it's fully charged, but we've lost a dog with 1/2 battery remaining and the tracker went dead rather quickly.  We found the dog, but not with the tracker.All of that being said...I wouldn't want to be without this tracker!  I can track my dog down to a single parking space in a parking lot, if need be.  You can locate the pet and there is an option like a GPS that will take you, via verbal directions, right to you pet!  So, keep them fully charged and they'll work great!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDCQN6CWK26GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077I42S4#wasThisHelpful","RDCQN6CWK26GS","A1NA8VBHIFTDCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NA8VBHIFTDCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most of the others (that I've ever used anyway) have the straight handle and it can be more difficult to get the grip you need to apply enough pressure to push the clog out.

"I never thought I could get so excited about a short little plunger!  But as it turns out, I had an opportunity to put the ""Shorty"" to work just a few days after I received it.  I was having a code inspection completed on an apartment (I'm a landlord) and the inspector advised that the bathroom sink was clogged.  Normally I would have done 1 of 2 things:  either call a plumber, or go out and get some chemical drain unclogger (which I didn't have time for this day).  The inspector said he'd be back to reinspect later that day.  With no time for either a plumber or chemical drain cleaner, I happened to remember by little ""Shorty"" plunger.  I took it to the apartment, put it over the sink drain and pushed down.  Immediately the plunger produced a pretty strong suction over the drain.  When I pulled the plunger back up a bunch of gross looking crap came out and the clog was cleared.  Just like that!I've been a landlord for over 25 years and have always relied on plumbers for things like clogged sinks but now I'm thinking...I'll save myself a lot of money by taking my ""Shorty"" and unclogging the drains myself!  I'm anxiously awaiting a call from the next tenant with a clogged drain!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BDXUFDZLL5GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UJLVGI#wasThisHelpful","R3BDXUFDZLL5GK","A1NA8VBHIFTDCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NA8VBHIFTDCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't purchase my Keurig 2.0 on Amazon.  I received it as a gift.  I thought, however, that I'd take the opportunity to review this product anyway because it wouldn't MATTER where I purchased it....it would be just as much a piece of crap.  I had a Keurig...a nice one, with lots of features that I liked.  For example, I could use any kind of K-cup out there and I found one that I really, really liked.  I can't use that one anymore.  Keurig has made the new 2.0 so that you can't use the little cup that held regular coffee.  And it has to be an ""official"" k-cups because the new 2.0 reads the lettering on the rim of the new ones.  As far as the carafe?  It's a good idea in theory to have a little pot that will brew (supposedly) up to 6 cups of coffee (even more on some of the fancier, more expensive models).  But in reality, you can only get a little over 2 regular sized cups of coffee from the carafe. Any more and it would definitely be too weak.  The 4-cup setting is really pushing it...in my opinion.  And I don't prefer especially strong coffee.  In addition, the K-Carafes are expensive - anywhere from $16-$20 for 8 K-Carafes (which is approximately 18-20 cups of coffee.It's a gimmick...and not even a very good one at that.  Keurig is trying to dominate the K-cup market and whoever buys this machine will be sucked right into it.

"Alex Gracey had been born into privilege and was being groomed to take a lead in the politics of Ireland at a time when Protestants ruled. When he meets Mary Smyth, the daughter of a Catholic activist, however, his perspective changes. Never has he met a woman that captivated him so. He disguises who he is and becomes her protector, as much as he can. He helps her father to plant flax during the potato blight, and gets her brother a job at his familys factory. But, although he remains optimistic, hes well aware that hes playing a dangerous game on many levels, and he may very well be on a collision course.Although I found this book interesting and enjoyed it, it wasn't one that I couldn't put down, and it read more like a secular book than a Christian one. It even had some mild curse words sprinkled throughout the dialogue. Of course the time period has much about religion, because of the hatred and clashes between the Protestants and Catholics. There were very few grammatical errors, although the book is heavy in Irish dialect that occasionally sounds more Scottish. I wondered about the title, because Mr. Gracey was never rescued in the usual sense of the word. I liked the first half much better than the last, because near the end, the troubles mount and there becomes almost too much tension and misery. Still, it was a fascinating read that I would recommend. I do like historical novels, like this one, based on themes and settings not often covered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29REP0TBES1MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VQM2D0#wasThisHelpful","R29REP0TBES1MB","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Luke Davis had come back to Lookout, Texas after being gone for eleven years. Rachel had broken his heart when she married his friend, James. Luke didn't know what had really happened, and Rachel hoped he never found out. Now James is dead, but Rachel's hopes of a second chance at love is dashed when Luke refuses to forgive her. When his pesky cousins decided Luke needs a wife and three mail order brides show up to marry him, things get really complicated and muddled. This is a delightful romantic comedy with each character adding depth to the story. There were almost no mistakes. ""Roil"" being used for ""roll"" was likely a scanning error. The teacher was Mrs. Fairland, and I doubt there would have been a married female teacher in rural Texas in 1886, because only single women could usually teach then, but these items are minor, and the book is enthralling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C7CRZS92JO22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V4AT8A#wasThisHelpful","R1C7CRZS92JO22","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"B.J. Spencer was forced to come back to her hometown because of a will. It was the last thing she wanted to do, after growing up in the orphanage there. Shed also been threatened with harm to her boyfriend right after high school, if she didn't leave. Now shes going to have to face it all again, including Jason.Jason O'Connell has never gotten over Billy Jo, and he was devastated when she left without a word. Hed eventually married, but that had ended badly. Now, with B.J. back, and them forced to live in Rose Mansion for a year, he doesn't know how his heart can survive. But, with all the incidents happening, it may be a miracle if either one of them survives.I liked this story and the characters, but there was a lot about the book I didn't like. The main thing was all the detailed descriptions that went on for pages and pages, and about things I didn't care to know that much about. Two examples are the pages describing Margarets desk in the mansion, and it took 22 pages on my kindle to get through the descriptions from the time B.J. asked for the lockbox at the bank until she actually had it. And, there were many, many more such dry pages. I just wanted to get on with the story.B.J. takes an awfully lot of photos in the afternoon for a professional photographer. The light washes out everything then and makes the pictures look drab. Margarets will said they only had to spend 60% of their days and nights at the mansion, so Jason and B.J. could have conceivably had  had to spend only 20% of the time together, but this was never mentioned. In fact, when Jason started having trouble at his ranch, he regretted he couldn't stay there overnight to help catch the culprits. Jason also found the spent bullet and casing after the police investigated a mysterious shot, but nothing was mentioned about the police missing it.There were also loads of minor mistakes:near for nearly (twice)discussed for disgustedsmooth for smoothlyquick for quickly (twice)wondering for wanderingrungs for steps (on stairs, not a ladder)Randy for Robby part of the timeRandi most of the time but Randy somecomingled wasn't in the kindle dictionaryIf you can get beyond these problems, youll probably enjoy the book.

Her oldest brother is threatening to take the girls away from her and sell them as indentured servants, if she doesn't do what he tells her, and the Friends might let him, since the family is so poor. On top of all that, Amon Cayle, the man she wronged but never stopped loving, is about to come back into life. And, it gets worse.Amon Cayle is still grieving for his wife, who burned to death in a kitchen fire. He almost lost his oldest son, David, also, and even now their relationship is strained. Hes manipulated into hiring Mary to sew his threadbare, growing family some clothes, but can he stand having her around. He loved his wife dearly, but Mary has always resided in a corner of his heart. And why wont she tell him why she left him without a word to marry another?David Cayle will do anything to keep his father and Mary apart. Hes too attracted to Marys daughter, Annie, and, if their parents were to wed, the Friends will consider them as siblings. With his cousin trying to cause trouble and his schoolmaster uncle unreasonable, David sometimes doesnt know which way to turn. But he knows his heart wants to turn toward Mary.There were more grammatical mistakes than I expected. Words were misused, like understood, when understand was needed. Letters were left out of words several times, and some sentences were just poorly written, like I so not understand know why he hates me so. The nominative case pronoun was used at least nine times, when the objective case was needed  ex. between she and Grayson.This was an extremely hard book to read. It was difficult to keep all the characters straight, and the family chart at the beginning did not show well on my kindle. The first half moved by inches and was too drawn out. I liked the main characters, but nothing ever goes right for them, and much of its because of their own poor decisions and reactions and from keeping secrets. The tension was always so high these people I liked lived in misery, and it was frustrating and agonizing. I couldn't read it for too long at a time, because I had to walk away to ease the tension. I kept hoping the ending would make up for the anguish, but it didn't. One situation worked out well, but I wanted more insight to their happiness, which was skimmed over. The other situation is left up in the air for the next novel. I wont be reading it. This one wasn't worth the gut-wrenching. After much deliberation, I ended up rating it 2.5. There were certainly parts about it that I liked, but the parts I didn't outweighed them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKU95RF8G1TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK87I66#wasThisHelpful","REKU95RF8G1TK","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At twenty-nine, Sarah Taylor is tired of waiting for the right man to come into her life. She wants a family, so she decides to adopt a child as a single mother. The only problem is that shes liked Will Kennedy, her lawyer, since elementary school, but he seems to only want to be her friend. When she meets the expecting mother of a possible baby to adopt, her heart goes before her head, despite Wills warnings, and Sarah gets hurt in the process. However, she wouldn't have it any different for the mother and her baby. As Sarah know, the key to a happy life is trusting in God.I really liked this novel, but I couldn't relate to Sarah or Will as much as I usually do in a book I enjoy. I found very few errors. There was a question mark where a period was needed. I dont think dove eggs are larger than chicken eggs. And, I wondered how Sarah and Will saw each other smile, when they were in sterile outfits, including masks, in the hospital. Still, it was a good, sweet read that I didn't regret. I gave it a 4.5, which rounded up to a five.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SGPYWGSEKJ48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O80X7M6#wasThisHelpful","R1SGPYWGSEKJ48","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Carli Williams was taken by surprise when a man comes up to her in the street, tips her back, and passionately kisses her, but she cant forget that kiss. Apparently, neither can he, because he keeps turning up. But Carli has more on her mind with troubles piling up and a dilapidated estate to repair as an inheritance.Ethan Durham had staged a kiss to resemble the famous one from WWII for an art class, but he never dreamed the girl and kiss would linger with him. This may just change everything, especially when he learns someone wants to harm Carli, and he vows to protect her.I wanted to like this novel more, but I just couldn't. It seemed so fragmented and had no flow. I didn't really like either of the main characters. Carli was called spunky, and she would defy Ethan and get into trouble and then fall apart. He was always smirking and being controlling. They just didn't seem to go together. The descriptions of the many rooms on the estate were lengthy, but I couldn't picture what it was talking about. Too much of the story was awkward or just didn't make sense. How could Carli unknowingly resurrect a wall around her heart, when the passage was written from her point of view? How does someone smell amber? Sentences like, The shot had contacted a set of mixing bowls, shattering glass everywhere, could have been better written. Galvons last name was Stanfield most of the time, but occasionally it was Sinclair. Spigot was spelled spicket. And these were only some of the examples. Nothing was strong in the book, not even the ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XK4XW5NFZ5AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0063W0UIG#wasThisHelpful","R1XK4XW5NFZ5AL","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BE MATURE focuses on the Book of James, where he teaches about spiritual maturity, overcoming temptation, controlling the tongue, and praying effectively.

Perhaps if he gets her interested in Andrew Jamison, he will take her away when they marry. However, Frederick doesn't suspect his scheme might just backfire.This had the skeleton of a very good story, but it never really materialized. For one thing, the novella turned into more of a short story, since it was double-spaced, and there wasn't room to develop the plot or the characters.

"A man and his little girl help Sophie Thatcher escape an attacking duck in the park, and she cant get him out of her mind. She cant believe she feels such a strong connection after her fiance just jilted her a few months ago. Thats so unlike her, because shes never been a risk-taker. Why, she doesn't even know the mans name!Bryce Landry is on top of the country music list, but his life is crazy. Thats why hes taken a month off to spend in the quiet town where his grandparents are keeping his daughter for him.

Is there room for a serious relationship, or will the complexity of everything just ruin it? He knows one thing for sure. Hes never connected to anyone the way he has to Sophie.I enjoyed this novel. There were a few minor errors, like an extra, unneeded word inserted, an important word left out, or the wrong word used. Sophie tended to say the right things but feel the opposite, and I felt the ending was a little weak.

Although there is a police mystery to be solved, that plot is not the core of the book, for this is definitely a character-driven novel - my favorite kind.

Never in her wildest imagination did she think she might ever be drawn to Mr. Calahans grandson. But Lane seems much more ready for romance and commitment than Julie. They scare her to death.I loved the characters, and the basic plot was good, but the story drags along much too slowly. At 30%, absolutely nothing but background and mundane, everyday affairs had happened. The book desperately needs condensing and the unneeded parts that dont move the story taken out. Its 562 pages, and thats way too long. I usually read fast, but I thought I would never finish this one. Theres also some other amateurish mistakes  some head hopping, awakened for ""awoke,"" and pored for poured twice. It did pick up some after around the 30% mark, but still parts of it read like real life, and most of thats not particularly interesting if you wrote down what someone did each day. It is Christian and clean, so that was a plus, but it had too many long-winded prayers.

"Emily Dwyer likes the new English teacher, Dan McBride, but he sure does complicate her life, and its already complicated enough. She has two adopted children but was never married. She has just a friend who takes her out, and a custodian, whos not even a friend, but she brings him lunch and they eat in her room every day. If thats not complex enough, something strange is going on at school.Besides being scattered with awkward sentences and a few that are grammatically incorrect, there were too many mundane and extraneous narratives at first, which made parts very boring. There were also way too many characters to keep straight and try to remember. In addition, Emily was a strange, wimpy woman, who took most of what Dan said and did wrong, especially in the beginning. She would get mad at Dan and stand up to him, but she let everyone else run all over her big time. It was unbelievable. If she hadn't been so stupid, the story would have only been about 40 pages long. The bulk of the story was based on silly misunderstandings on Emilys part, which came across as ridiculous, and, part of the plot made no sense. What man would start doing major renovations on a house before he came up with the down payment or signed the contract?  He could lose it all. However, if it had been given more time and rewritten, I think this could have been a good story. Id planned to rate it a 2, but the conclusion was well-done.

This novella is too sweet with no tension or conflict. Nothing disrupts or threatens the romance.

At first Charlotte has misgivings about her future husband, but, as she gets to know him, she begins to understand.Too much of the novella (it turned out to be 149 pages) never moved the story forward.

"When Lorens father had died, she and her mother had become trapped in a bad situation with a father and sons who mistreated them. Only the younger boy, Joey, whod been a baby at first, treated Loren well, especially after her mother died. When the men decided to sell Loren to a brothel, Thad met up with them and bought Loren to save her. He thought she was a dirty child but was surprised to discover she is a pretty young lady, when cleaned up.This book had a few problems. There were run-on sentences, and most of the story was told and recounted. In 1889, Loren would have been called a heroine, not a hero. There were some inconsistencies, like when Loren started a pot of chili before the funeral, but they ended up eating vegetable soup. The novel was also melodramatic with the villains too vile and some scenes too saccharine and cheesy. Then, there were misused words, like alter for altar waist for waste, isles for aisles, and happed for happened. The core of the book, however, had potential, although it could have been a much better book with a little more work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8GPWOFQTIES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X087LYM#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8GPWOFQTIES","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adrianne and Chris made a mistake in college, and when Adrianne realizes shes pregnant she drops out and returns home with only a brief note. She knows Chris plans to go into the mission field, and she loves him too much to try to change that. Chris is devastated and tries to reach her over and over, but she wont answer. He goes to Nicaragua broken-hearted. Eight years later, they meet by accident when Chris is home for his best friends wedding. Only God can orchestrate a new beginning, but, although both are still fighting feelings of guilt, they are still strong believers.I've read several of Janice Thompsons books, but this is the best one yet. The characters are so lovable, and Lorelei, their sever-year old daughter, is delightful. It is filled with deep emotion and draws the reader into the story. Faith is woven into the very core of the novel.

"Reeking The Bailey Flanigan CollectionThis is about the third time Karen Kingsbury has disappointed me in her books. She used to be one of my favorite authors, but not any more. I'm learning to avoid her, and that's my recommendation for this series. Skip it.Leaving - 2Bailey Flanigan is still reeling from Cody declaring his love for her and then leaving without a word. What kind of love is that? She realizes her heart is broken, but she thinks she might need to move on, so she begins to accept Brandon Pauls attention. He wants more than the friendship theyd established when theyd made a movie together. But Bailey prefers Broadway to Hollywood, and shes not sure a long distance relationship will work. When she finally works up the nerve to go tell Cody good-bye, Cheyenne, the fiance of Codys best friend who was killed in Iraq, has just been in a horrific wreck and is battling for her life, and Cody has promised never to leave her.I found this book very frustrating. We see both Baileys and Codys points of views, and both declare the other is the love of their life, yet neither will do anything about it. Instead, they see other people. Cody was particularly infuriating. *Very mild possible spoiler*  -> I can see why he left when he thought Bailey was threatened by being with him, because of his mothers drug dealers threats, but when that threat passes, I didn't understand why he didn't return to Bailey. He says he doesn't feel good enough for her, but he starts seeing Cheyenne, who is just as sweet as Bailey and even more vulnerable because of her finances death. It makes no sense! The book also left everything hanging, leading into the next one. I would have really been upset if I didn't already have the next one, but Im not looking forward to more like this one.Learning - 2This one just continued with the angst. Bailey and Cody both say to themselves that the other is the love of their lives, but they do nothing about it. In fact, the chasm between them is becoming wider and both are becoming more and more interested in someone else. This is way too drawn out and frustrating. I've never read a book series quite like it. Although Karen Kingsbury is a wonderful author, this story is the pits. Perhaps, Im just getting tired of all Kingburys books being about circumstances keeping the main characters apart. In this one, however, its circumstances and the characters themselves. I prefer books where a relationship has time to develop, even though theres problems. Cody and Bailey are never together.Longing - 2This one again continues with the not getting together. In fact, Bailey is now falling for Brandon Paul and Cody has pledged himself to not leave Cheyenne, although he now realizes he loves her more like a close friend or relative. I have never seen the same plot line continue through 3 books like this with few new twists or developments. The events just seems to push Cody and Bailey father apart, but theres few new revelations. It seems Kingsbury comes up with every way possible they can think to keep themselves apart. Meanwhile, I become more and more frustrated. I sure hope I dont go through all this and discover at the end that Ive just wasted my time. As it is, these three books would have been better condensed into one.Loving - 2(May contain some spoilers) I hate it when a romance story sets the reader up for one thing to happen but it never does. I feel cheated and deceived. The first book should have opened with Brandons point of view of wanting to connect with Bailey. Then, I would have been pulling for him and felt good when the story ended. As these are written, Im disappointed, frustrated, and angry. This series is also way too long. It goes on and on and on. Relationships are on again, off again, and who knows whereI didn't even like these characters as well I usually do those in Kingsburys novels. Bailey gives the appearance of being perfect, but she seemed way too self-centered. Everything is all about her, her feelings, and what she wants. Although hes made mistakes in the past, Brandon is so perfect now that hes hard to relate to. Cody is just so mixed up and confused that he doesn't know which way to go. He tells himself one thing but acts completely different. It wasn't until the last part of LONGING that I even began to understand why he acted like he did, and this just added to the frustrations.In addition, all the books are overly sentimental and full of saccharine moments, some of which almost become cheesy. The stories are way too drawn out with unnecessary, repetitive events that did little to move the story forward. I didn't think I was ever going to get to the end, and they became a chore to read. If I didn't know who the author was, I would have never guessed Karen Kingsbury. I feel like I wasted my time here, and it took a lot of time to get through the four, frustrating books. Because of the way the story opened and is set up, I was not satisfied with the ending, although it was a happy one. It didn't make me feel happy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9H6QJUC7PS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKWQ4J8#wasThisHelpful","R2G9H6QJUC7PS5","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Michelle Cottrell faces a clients tragedy in her job as a social worker, shes afraid a similar fate awaits her because of the risks Tyler takes riding bulls in the rodeo. They have a huge argument and break up. After she loses her job, however, she goes back home to Cathedral Hills. Yet, she cant shake the despair, guilt, and feeling that God has abandoned her.Tylers best friend is seriously hurt riding a bull, and, for the first time, he begins to understand Michelles side of their argument. He decides to retire and return home. Its been a year since hes seen Michelle, and he doesn't want to wait any longer. He only hopes shes willing to give him another chance, because hes suddenly realizing how important she is to him.This short novella seemed too fragmented with too many characters and their stories. Michelle and Tylers story is only one of them. This made the book seem sketchy and shallow, when it could have been so much more. Also, some of the main characters were easy to confuse, like Tyler and Trey and Michelle and Missy. Wrong words were used, such as say for saw and their for theyre.  Even with limited space, thoughts and conversations were repeated several times, and there was some head hopping. It contained incorrect grammar, like Her and my grandfather were married. And I dont know where the sentence, Inside Treys car, things were not nearly as peaceful, came from. Are we now in omniscient point of view? I had read Brooke and Peter and enjoyed it.

Shouldn't his personal life and family goals be important too, and shouldn't he be putting God before everything?The novel was worth reading, but it had some minor problems. The story slowed down in places, and the dialogue was sometimes too chatty and meaningless. It was also double-spaced, which made it appeared longer. Bethann was too sensitive and hard on people, especially men, which could make her seem self-centered and uncaring at times. She was also a pretty negative person.

When he goes to investigate, he tries to buy off the other mother, but that turns out to be a huge mistake. Beth is nothing like his deceased wife.

But the more he learns of Beth the more she threatens to crack the hard wall hes built around his heart after his first marriage.Although the plot seemed a bit contrived and far-fetched, it was different than any Id read before, and I liked it. I adored the characters. I didn't like the way Jonathan drew out things toward the end, but this was still a very good book. I wish the conclusion had included more than just public announcements, but it was still an okay ending.

Yet, he finds her more and more intriguing. He likes her carefree abandonment and bright disposition. Will he ever be able to get her to date him?I had a hard time getting into this book. Audrey took some getting used to, and I didn't like her very much at first. The brassy heckling, crass humor, snarky wit, and trying to pretend she could cook when she couldn't wasn't endearing. In addition, the book seemed brief and rather shallow. However, it did have some good themes about not judging and accepting who you are. Audrey did calm down a bit, and I began to like her more.

He vowed he would give his daughter roots and be there for her. The fact that her mother had abandoned Lindsey was bad enough, and it had left Charlie as a teenage single parent, but hed do anything he could for his daughter. However, when Charlie meets Addie, their worlds collide. Will it leave chaos and misery or offer a remote chance for true happiness?I didn't like this novel at the beginning. There were too many inconsistencies, mistakes, characters, and points of view, which didn't make for a smooth or enjoyable read and made the story hard to follow at times. For example, Addie had honey-colored golden hair at first, but then later on, she had dark brown hair. She had warm brown eyes and then bright blue ones. Addie also never spoke using a contraction. Words were mixed up, like not was used for nod, with whoever for with whomever, and class for glass. The princess, who supposedly had perfect speech, said things like, between Jonathan and I. However, the novel became much better in the last half, and I couldn't put it down. I turned into a beautiful love story, full of tension but hope.

Most of these men likely had families and would not want their picture taken with a young, beautiful woman. Yet, despite this, I liked the characters and how the issues were resolved.

"When Cassie Golden is left alone at the Pennsylvania farm during the Civil War, she rents it out and moves to Alexandria, Virginia to become a nurse in a military hospital. She meets Major Michael Bryon, and, despite her reluctance, she falls in love. However, there are parts about Michaels service that he cant share, and she soon finds herself kidnapped and taken to a Confederate prison. Michael finds her, but now she learns hes lied to her and is really a Confederate. Her life becomes filled with threats from the unscrupulous, espionage, and harsh prison life. Still, Michael tries to make sure she has what she needs. As the war drags on, she begins to realize shes been wrong about a lot of things.Two of the worst things with this book were the many technical medical terms used and the occasional too many details that bogged the story down. There were a lot of other questionable things, like the use of a thermometer to take temperatures, which was almost never used during the Civil War. Cassie also went everywhere with Michael without a chaperone, even an all day excursion in the woods and time at his home. Mid-eighteen hundreds society would have never allowed such behavior. Banana cream pie likely originated in the Midwest, but not until several years after the Civil War. There was also some modern slang, like some digs, meaning a nice house. At first, after Cassie intentionally spilled a glass of water in Michaels lap just to show him she could, I didnt like her very much. What an immature, selfish, uncaring thing to do! Also I cant imagine a lawyer would call a witness to the stand without interviewing him first the way Davis did.Despite these problems and inconsistencies, on the whole, this was a well-written book that pulled me in. I dont usually like novels written in first person, but it did work better for this one. I had the surprise at the end figured out before half the book was over, but that didnt detract from the story. In fact, I think it made it better for me.

His first job as a Pinkerton agent is to find Amelia Smith for a man claiming to be her half-brother. After secretly following Amelia around for a few days, he falls in love with her, but she already has a fianc.So begins a very hard-to-believe plot. There was so much wrong with this short novella that I dont know where to start. First of all, many parts just didn't add up. In 1860 Boston, a madam of a brothel would not have been accepted in society. Amelias parents will made little sense, and no reason was given for the odd requirements. Why didn't Ben find Jonathan, the supposed half-brother, after the man rushed ahead to meet Amelia when hed agreed to wait for Ben to go with him? If Jonathan couldn't find Amelia (who wasn't trying to hide) on his own, how did he gather information on her fianc that Alfred was trying to keep hidden? I dont think Amelia would have been drinking whiskey with company in 1860, especially since she was running a finishing school for girls. I was surprised Ben asked her out, when he believed her to be engaged. It would be difficult to skip rocks on the ocean like Ben did. The story was not well-written. It used no contractions, which made it stilted. At least 90% of it was told after events had already happened, and the recounting became boring and tedious. Some of the characters thoughts were repeated over and over again, and all of them seemed very self-centered. The main conflict just disappears with no resolution. Wrong words were used, such as exposure for composure and ground for floor. Modern language was also used, like they were an item, hadn't  seen that coming, and complete turn on. Tuxedos weren't worn until about 1900 either. The book had so many unanswered questions, plot points that didn't make sense, and poor writing that I felt it was a total waste of my time. I really thought that it would have some redeeming parts near the end, but it didn't It did have a happy ending, but even that ended up being told rather than shown and was too saccharine. In addition, the modern cover didn't go with the story. Amelia did not dress like a cowgirl!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTP5T64MI28H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO03ZXO#wasThisHelpful","R1JTP5T64MI28H","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She turns out to be the prettiest, most capable woman hes ever met.There was a few minor discrepancies, but, overall, this was a good, interesting story. It was a bit melodramatic, but I still enjoyed it.

Shell work hard to make up for her one slip.Ian knows Renee will hate what they did when she awakes. He stands watching her sleep, knowing he will never see her that peaceful again.

He can only pray that God will take control, straighten out the mess they've made and ease her anger at her mom and him.This is an exceptional bookwithout a doubt the best one I've read in a long time and maybe even ever. Its so charged with emotion that its almost gut-wrenching at times. However, its also wonderful, strong, deep, and unforgettable. Its message is crucially important and one that needs to be heard, whether people are judging themselves or others. This is the second book I've read by Michelle Lynn Brown, and both have been excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21PXIVWUBM2BP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDD5T76#wasThisHelpful","R21PXIVWUBM2BP","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Melyn Winter had been deeply in love with her husband, but Danny died in a car wreck two years ago, and she blamed God for taking him. Her adult children decide she should get out, and they set her up with a blind date disguised as a business meeting. When Brian Capwell shows up at her door, however, Mel is pleasantly surprised, and the date goes well. However, her old lover from years ago shows up about the same time and she has a quick fling with him.Brian was taken with Melyn the first time he laid eyes on her. However, he has a new-found Christian faith and wants to end his old lifestyle of meaningless affairs. He also wants to be careful with his heart after his cheating ex-wife left and divorced him five years ago. Can he trust Melyn like he wants to?I didn't like the main characters here as much as I usually do. Melyn was too confused and seems only interested in sex through most of the book. Brian falls in love with her at first sight, but it seems to all be based on her looks. I couldn't accept that Brian believed whatever Melyn told him every time he saw her with another man, since he had trust issues. They both seemed to be secretive, hid what they really thought and felt, and had a series of misunderstandings because they didn't communicate. Since the novella was double-spaced, it was really much shorter than what I thought, and it didn't have much development or depth. It could have been much better if it had been expanded some.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5TOPFRMB0SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKHPOL4#wasThisHelpful","R1N5TOPFRMB0SF","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lindsey Solberg had been away for years, first training to be a chef and then establishing herself as a good one. But when her mother dies, she goes home to be there for her sixteen-year-old sister. However, she never expected that Nick Harrison would also be back. He had been the top dog in high school and broke her heart by pretending to like her and then dropping her. Now hes a youth pastor, no less. She cant believe hes changed that much.Nick has changed, and Christ changed him. He regrets the conceited jerk he was in high school, but hes never been able to get Lindsey from his mind. Now he wants to show her how precious she is to him and how much hes a different man. Will she give him a second chance?This was a cute story but it moved too quickly. Lindsey and Nick were passionately kissing over and over again on the first date.

"When the Thoresen family immigrates to Nebraska from Norway, they come with more than most for their new start, but they dont speak English. Even with their supplies, the prairie isn't an easy place to live. The sod has grassroots a foot deep, which makes plowing difficult; all kinds of storms blast the land; drought is always threatening; and locusts can devastate everything. Amid this environment, tragedy is bound to hit.I liked the plot and the characters, especially Jan. However, most of the story was told and not shown, so, instead of becoming involved with what was happening, I stood on the outside observing. With so much head-hopping and rapid changes in point of views, it was almost dizzying, especially in the first half of the book. It was over-packed with too many minute details, like several lists of what they brought and what they bought. At times it wandered all over the place. For example, Soren was talking to a neighbor, it was not following his point of view, there was no one around to hear them, but we see and hear their conversation. In addition, I doubt the ladies would have been canning in the remote Nebraska location in 1866. They also knew a lot about disinfecting and boiling to sterilize. It was first published as LAND OF DUST AND TEARS. This book had a lot of potential, but I didn't find it quite as good as A ROSE BLOOMS TWICE. For one thing, the ending was very weak. It basically just ended without much of a conclusion at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R153O4SP048Z80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982445768#wasThisHelpful","R153O4SP048Z80","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She came home pregnant, and her parents went ballistic. With their help, she managed to finish college, but then she took her daughter and ran, trying to establish a new life for them away from her controlling mother. She goes to tutor a young boy on a farm in Idaho, and she marvels at the family life there. But somehow, trouble still finds her, and she has to learn to fight for whats important to her. The thing is, Dallas Reid, her boss, is becoming one of those important things.This was a lovely story of learning to forgive. There were a few mistakes but nothing major. Points of view were switched without a break or any way of noting it. Wrong words were occasionally used, like along for alone and opening for openly. There were also a few very awkward sentences, but it book was still quite readable. I thought Dallas figured out what was going on a little too quickly and the ending could have been stronger, but I liked the characters and the slow building of relationships. All in all, it was a very enjoyable story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM3T7I39G4N5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C112X10#wasThisHelpful","RM3T7I39G4N5Y","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her parents decide to take away her credit cards and car and make her stand on her own. At twenty, they think its about time she learned some responsibility. When Chloe goes to stay with her brother and sister-in-law, she has no idea how much her life will change, and Stephen Hayes, their pastor and friend, will be a big part of that.I found this to be a well-written book that was hard to put downone of those that will stick with me for a long time. Despite Chloes immaturity and bad decisions at first, shes very likable, and Stephen is wonderful. It was interesting to see how Chloe slowly changes over time. The two things I didn't like about the book was the crass language (not profanity, though) throughout the book. I wished this had changed, too. Also, there were strange question marks in the middle of sentences that broke it in two parts. This had to have been a scanning error, but I cant imagine why they weren't proofed and corrected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6O7CTDU4WZ69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EWLS5R8#wasThisHelpful","R6O7CTDU4WZ69","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Debbie Carmichael wants to take the stress off her father after he had a heart attack, and she works hard to help out in their Laguna Beach soda shop . She also wants to hold a benefit to help pay off the mortgage, and teen star, Bobby Conrad, would be just the person to do that. But when Bobby has scheduling problems and has to cancel, the new guy, Johnny Hartman, agrees to take over. Although Debbie is disappointed at first, she soon realizes shes underestimated Johnny on several levels.Johnny is a pastors son from Kansas who just loves to sing. Hes determined to stay true to his faith, even in Hollywood. Maybe God had brought him here to find Debbie and show some others what they are missing if they dont have faith. He just hopes Debbies focus will move from Bobby Conrad to him.I thought this book had somewhat of a slow start, but when it started rolling, it really took off, and I could hardly put it down. At first there seemed a lot of filler geared toward the reader and not the story. For example, the family laments that gas prices might reach 50 cents a gallon and stamps 5 cents. Yet, this turned out to be one of the sweetest love stories I've read in a long time, and its very well done. I think it would be appropriate for anyone and not just young adults.

"Dorrie Miller likes her job okay, but what she really wants to be is a writer. If she could publish like Mya Elizabeth Linscott, her dream would've come true. Of course, a hunky husband and family would be nice too. But Dorrie has never seemed to be good enough for any of the men shed dated or for her father either.Jermiah Jacobs has just moved into town and joined the writers group there. Hes wowed by their leader, Dorrie Miller, but, after his wife left him, hes vowed never to remarry, although hes a widower now. One broken heart was one too many. Besides, he has secrets he cant divulge. But when they end up driving to a writers conference together, the attraction grows.How to rate this book? The first half had a few parts I really liked, but most of it had scattered scenes and the characters thoughts that were too detailed, often silly, and usually boring. It went on and on with every thought and every movement described. Dorrie over- thinks everything, and its just too long and drawn out. When Dorrie and Jeremiah start to the writers conference it gets a bit more interesting, but the plot breaks down. I couldn't accept the fake wedding scenario, and this was crucial to everything that happens. It just didn't make any sense to me from the very beginning, and the way it played out didn't change that opinion. The last part of the novel did get much better, but I couldn't understand why Dorrie didn't fall in love with Jeremiah right away, since he seemed almost perfect. There were a number of wrong words throughout the book, too. It would have been a stretch for me to rate the first part of the book a 2. I bordered on hating it, and did hate parts. The ending was definitely a 5. After much deliberation, I went with a 3. Although the last part was redeeming, the first part was just too hard to wade through. If it had been edited better, it could have easily been a five. And, with 363 pages, there was plenty of room to cut out some of the cumbersome details.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQX73LSW0CTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMAX8J4#wasThisHelpful","R2NQX73LSW0CTB","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then, she discovers its not Daniel but his prodigal brother, Alex. Her Aunt Honore comes to whisk her off to London, and thus begins a wild adventure.I had read the first in the series, Lady Fiasco, and found it entertaining, but this one was even better. Much of the weaknesses Id found in the first one had been corrected here. The humor was better, Honore wasn'tt quite so outlandish or risqu, and there's even less of the mild curse words--only six in the book. There are no sex scenes in either of them. I found this one very amusing and quite enjoyable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AF458WRBP80Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR3XIDS#wasThisHelpful","R2AF458WRBP80Q","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hes promised himself he will never marry, but hed never planned to meet someone like Hetty. She almost renews his faith in women--almost.I really liked this novel in the beginning. There was some head hopping and wrong words used, and Isaac first had brown eyes and then blue. Hetty's irrational feeling that she didn't deserve anything good went on for too long and seemed too severe for the circumstances. I overlooked it until she ran back to the orphanage to work. From that point on, things became too unbelievable for me. There was no reason for Isaac not to go find her and set her straight, especially after his family situation got better. I couldn't believe that Hetty stayed washing mounds of laundry at the orphanage and being constantly scolded, when shed had some good news and could have left at any time. And, having a party after a devastating fire was ludicrous.

Her parents nasty divorce should have taught her that lesson. Now Sean Taggart, a local fireman, is inching himself into her heart, but someone is trying to tear them apart permanently.I liked the first part of the book. There were too many unnecessary and unimportant details, but I liked Caitlin and Sean. As the story developed, however, parts of it just didn't make sense. The misunderstandings and second-guessing went on for too long. One of the main characters seemed to be two completely different people in the last half, and I didn't like his intense insecurities, which made him so different from the competent person he was to begin with. And I couldn't conceive that Caitlin wouldn't recognize something about a guy shed dated for a good while, even if he was disguised. He didn't disguise his voice. It might have worked for someone she didn't see that often, but not otherwise. However, the last part of the book was hard for me to wade through. The climatic scene was too drawn-out, telling every little move and minute detail. It went on and on, and I thought it would never end. What should have been exciting became very boring. And when the action was over, the story continued with more misunderstandings and misgivings. It would have been a good book, if it had been tightened up. As it was, it seemed to take way too long. At least it was clean, and that was a plus.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDSBQWL7T38HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PULUH2K#wasThisHelpful","RDSBQWL7T38HO","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ROMANS  Julia lives in Pompeii with her family, but her life is about to change in ways shed never imagined. She meets Marcus, a man she could actually be interested in, instead of the disgusting fish merchant, Brutus, who is as evil as he is smelly and dirty. Then, hot ash and rocks start raining from the sky in a terror no one had ever seen before.This could have been an excellent story, but it was too short and skimpy. All the Bible verses were good, but that meant there was even less to Julias story. It was more like a short story. The first chapter gave too much away, and should not have been pulled out of order, with the rest backtracking.CORINTAINS  Julia finds Paula in Corinth after the upheaval in Pompeii, but Tiros parents wont let them married, because they think Paula is just a servant. Drusilla, a harsh, unscrupulous woman, has her sights set on Tiro, much to his dismay, and his mother supports Drusilla. However, Julia is about to reveal a secret her mother has kept about Paula. Will it hurt or help the couple, and how will it all play out?This one had many of the same problems as the first one. Again, it would have been better if the first chapter had not been pulled out of order, because it gave too much of the story away at the very beginning. I liked these characters, but the story was so short, nothing was well-developed. The modern language seemed very out of place, regardless of how the author tried to rationalize it in her notes. One example is dressed to the nines. This one also had several unnecessary commas, it talked about things like the tired wooden wall of the ship, had Paula for Julia once, and used terms like err face and err nose over and over. I finally guessed it meant e-r-r, like a groan.EPHESIANS   Julia is eager to find her sister Lucy, whom she hasn't seen in the two years since Pompeii. When they find her, shes upset that she hasn't heard from Quintus who promised her hed find her when she fled the burning city. Julia and Marcus take her to Ephesus, where Quintus has established his home. But when they get there, Quintus is engaged to Lady Livinia. Yet, he still looks at Lucy the way he always did, with love. Whats going on? Quintus offers no explanation, except hes betrothed.All these stories have minor mistakes, This one had Ephesus for Miletus, Marcus for Quintus, and mixed up phrases, like visitors had frequently gotten got lost. There were some awkward sentences, such as she could think of not one good reason. Engagement rings did not usually have stones in them until after 1476, but all the ones in these stories did. Besides being short and shallow, this book also had a huge gap in the plot. It seemed implausible that Quintus didn't tell Livinia who Lucy was when she showed up and ask permission to tell Lucy the truth. Although this story pulled me in more than the others,the plot ans characters seemed even thinner.Although each story had promise, they needed more, and came up lacking on many levels. Still, they had some merit, so I gave the collection a 3.5, which rounded up to a four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9ZFTVPJGMB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKB4OLA#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9ZFTVPJGMB3","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sky Fischer's friend at work set her up with a pretend boyfriend to make the guy back home jealous and hopefully notice her when she goes there to celebrate the Fourth with her family. Brody Boone seems to know a lot more about her than she does about him. Although their offices are close at the bank, she's rarely been aware of him. As the weekend progresses there's drama with her brothers, and she begins to gradually wonder how much Kevin has changed from the person she knew and fell in love with.

Shes saved herself for marriage, so this hits her hard.There was a lot good about this book, especially the life and faith lessons, but there were some problems, too. Head hopping was a major issue, because it went back and forth between different points of view so often. So much time was skipped in places it left the reader feeling as if they were missing out on too much of the story. For the first 60% of my kindle edition, there was a lot of thinking and second-guessing but little to no conflict.

The reviewer that said it was a nice, clean, romantic story must not have read it. Their sex was described very explicitly. The ending was so predictable and sugary that it left a sickening feeling.

"When her stepmother died in childbirth, Hannah Dandridge's father could no longer stand to stay in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He forces Hannah to end her engagement and move with him to Texas, so she can care for her young brother and infant sister. She soon sees that her father is a harder, more bitter man than he had been, but she loves him and knows he loves her. When he comes up missing, she worries about what she'll do if he doesn't come home. Horace Locklear wants to marry her, but he's much older, and she doesn't care for him. With the war still raging and the Comanche on the warpath, it seems a mixed blessing when William Barnett returns. It had been his ranch before the Confederates confiscated it and awarded it to her father, but he appears to be an honorable man, despite his service in the Union Army. In fact, he proves quite helpful in many ways, but her future seems even more uncertain.I enjoyed this story, although sometimes I questioned its execution. There were lots of  questionable material. For example, the family was eating burritos, but the first documented one came in 1922, and this was 1863. They wouldn't have called God you in their prayers but Thee and Thou. It was stretching things to have Hannah home canning in the Texas frontier in 1863, when the process was just catching on. Why would Hannah have put an Indian in danger to send a letter back to the ranch when she knew Juanita and Berto couldn't read English, and the children didn't read well enough? In the 1800s the Commanche did not dig graves and bury their possessions with the dead. They wrapped the body in a blanket, rode off and deposited it in a cave or crevice if possible, and covered it with stones. Then, all the possessions were burned. People didn't drill wells for water then either. Wells were either dug or driven. Since Hannah had come to dislike Lockhart so much, I couldn't understand why she invited him to go to Dallas with her and the children. There was even an omniscient statement, very unusual for such a well-know authors book. However, I still liked the book and was glad I read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SV08OR0XMBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006G2YPOI#wasThisHelpful","R19SV08OR0XMBG","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jade Millers main goal right now was to be the mother her son needs. After all, shes all he has. She refuses to date because of this, and, after Lukes father ran off, she doesnt need that kind of drama and heartache. When she witnesses a murder, however, shes put into protection until the trial, and Gavin Emerson, her protector, threatens that resolve.Gavin has been the black sheep of the family, and some of his choices have been downright wrong. Hes used women for moments of pleasure and worked for Vegas crime bosses, but hes finally got his life on a better path. Still, he would have said marriage and a wife was the last thing he needed, until he met Jade. Will he be able to keep her and Luke safe, and can she see him as the changed man he is. She certainly makes him want to be an even better one.I liked his plot and story better than the others in the series, but I didnt like the main characters as much. Jade and Gavin are grittier and pushier. Arent I going to get a little more than that? is the only grammatical mistake I saw.

"Miranda Woodruff loves her home construction television show. The bad part was that shed taped the first season right before her planned wedding, so she talked about Robbie as if they were already married, because she knew they would be by the time they aired. But Robbie left her with just a brief note and disappeared. The director and producer insisted she keep up the ruse. When her ratings start to dip, they bring in a guy to play her husband just as shes meeting a man she could really fall for. When he turns out to be a reporter, things really get complicated.I thought the book started off a little shaky with abrupt changes of scenes coming too often. There seemed to be lengthy descriptions of objects but few about the people. And, Cee acted more like a four-year-old than a girl of nine at first. This changed, however, and the novel became riveting. The characters were well-fleshed out, had plenty of strengths and weaknesses, and were very realistic. Matthew was especially well-done. However, the ending was too quick to have such a long huge build-up. Still, the book was plenty strong enough to warrant a five.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZZNO0O7SHR9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIUJYVG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZZNO0O7SHR9U","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rachel Branigans step-cousin raped her 3 years ago, but when she became pregnant, he and his father told the town she was just a loose woman who seduced men.

As Rachel and Reverend Caleb Stone become interested in each other, will the situation change, or will Rachel just impede Calebs ministry? Caleb also has a past that threatens to cause problems.I liked this plot, but the execution was rather simplistic. There was something very juvenile about the two main characters, especially Rachel. There were constant point of view changes without any separation and a few grammatical mistakes, like between she and Caleb.  The cover certainly didnt go with the story, because Rachel had very dark hair. I still liked the book.

She almost bolts when she sees a video of him riding a bull. When she comes to an event where hes almost trampled, hes afraid hes lost her forever.

It felt like half a book, and the ending, if you could call it that, was definitely rushed. You see, the story ended at 47%, and the rest is made up of a few chapters from three other books and ads for other books from Redbud Press. I wouldnt even call 79 pages a good novella - more like a short story. It took me about an hour to read. It felt as if the author, for whatever reason, stopped before she finished.

"Laurette Martels college roommate had talked her into going to Sitka and working for Southeast Alaska Maritime catering to the cruise ships. But then the roommate couldnt go because of family illness, so Laurette ends up going alone. At first her co-worker, Ryan Nichols, seems sullen, but as they get to know each other better, he seems happier. Laurette finds a room with an elderly woman with failing memory, and although she loves her, this adds more stress and worry.Ryan has never met anyone as special as Laurette. It makes him happy to just be around her, but what does he have to offer? He lives in a small trailer and only has a job during the summer months, when the cruise ships are in port. He even lost most of his faith when his mother remarried. Yet, as his feelings for Laurette grow, he begins to understand his mother better.This was a very sweet, uncomplicated story. All conflicts come from the weather or other people, and not from Laurette and Ryan. Laurette is perfect, without a single flaw, and it made her seem unrealistic and flat. I looked on what was happening, as I read the book, but I was never pulled into the story. Therefore, the book was somewhat one dimensional, too. It was clean, sweet, and had a few humorous lines, however. I dont regret reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OGS8P39NMMAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW8AB64#wasThisHelpful","R3OGS8P39NMMAX","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca Butler spent a summer Salzburg, Austria. From the moment she was greeted by Khalil Khoury's melodic tenor, she began falling in love with him. But he is studying to be a Jesuit priest, and his ordination is next year. When he begins to feel the same emotions, he tells himself he can love Rebecca in a platonic way and still become a priest, but the more time he spends with her, the more she consumes his thoughts. It is a magical time for both of them, but it begins a time of inner struggles beyond belief.The butterfly and the snail that the couple discover on the way up a mountain holds a lot of meaning. Rebecca is the butterfly and Khalil is the snail. What does the future hold for two creatures who are so different, yet so very much alike?There were parts of this book I loved, but I didnt love the chapters and chapters that flashbacked to their childhood. These sections were told and not shown, as the character recounted what had happened. It would have been better if these chapters had pulled the reader into the action by transporting them to that time, instead of just telling about it. If it was going to recount the stories, they should have been condensed, so they gave enough to develop the character, but didn't become so boring. Also contractions were often used in an odd way to end a sentence, for example, I love you for who your're instead of you are. This was done with various contractions over and over again. It also ended rather abruptly, although it did have an ending. I just wanted to see more of how it unfolded.That being said, I loved the opening chapter and the chapters involving Rebecca and Khalil. The writing depicts their love, emotions, and struggles beautifully, in a distinctly special way. I could see how Khalil's love for Rebecca brought him closer to God, because reading about it brought me closer to Christ. Those chapters were not just a good read; they were an experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQRUE0BQD99K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z8XCL4W#wasThisHelpful","R2TQRUE0BQD99K","AAIDLB38IY7R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAIDLB38IY7R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When Raelene Strattford's parents are killed by their wagon overturning, she's devastated and angry at God. She is alone now, and although the farm is hers, no one will do business with a woman in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1739. Gustaf Hanssen came to her rescue and is assigned to oversee the farm for her. She appreciates his effort, but she wonders if he's not hoping to gain the farm for himself. However, his hard work and honest spirit shows her differently. As part of her father's will, she must marry by her eighteenth birthday in six months. Gustaf promises to help her find a husband , too.Gustaf is saddened by Raelene's refusal to turn to God, because he knows that's what she needs. As his love for her grows, so does his frustration. She apparently considers him as a country oaf and beneath her. Yet, how can he find her a husband and walk away? Hell just have to rely on God and trust in Him.I liked this story and the characters. There were some glaring historical inaccuracies, however. For example, in 1739, the community would never have allowed Raelene to stay on the farm unchaperoned and for Gustaf and her to be alone so much. She might have embroidered but not quilt squares. Quilts at this time were still whole cloth quilts. And she was canning vegetables over a hundred years too early! In addition, words like scalawag werent used until 1850.This book came close to being a five, but I just didn't feel it quite made it.

"Fantastic tuner.  I bought one of the PolyTunes when they first came out and was blown away by the ease of checking the tuning of all six strings with a single strum, and how easy it was go from there to the identified out-of-tune strings and easily tune them individually.The PolyTune 2 supposedly provides increased accuracy, and also offers a strobe-like function, which allows for even greater tuning precision for users accustomed to that approach.  I tested its accuracy using my Peterson Strobe Tuner - a very accurate tuner - and the found the Polytune 2 to be right on target across the board.  Finally, while the red/green lights of the original Polytune and regular Polytune 2 are plenty bright in their own right, I really like the blue/white combination even better.

"These are the third set of Bluetooth headphones I've owned, and easily the best.  In evaluating Bluetooth headphones I find one has to look at battery life, Bluetooth range, and ease of pairing along with the criteria for traditional wired phones (i.e., sound quality, comfort and fit, construction quality).  So, I'm going to focus a bit on these aspects.My first pair were from Sony - DRBT50's - and were okay.  They're well-built and comfortable, and of the over-the-ear design I prefer for headphones.  They paired easily and the battery life was decent but not great.  They charged via a separate AC adapter, which some people would find more convenient, whereas I prefer phones that charge via a USB cable and computer.  It's easy to find an AC adapter to use with a USB cable, but not so easy to remember to carry around a proprietary charger.  The sound of this set was middling, but they were among the first available, so I found the sound acceptable since there weren't many options without spending a fortune.  Range was only average, they began to cut out about 15 feet from the sound source.My second set were Parrot Ziks.  Frankly, I hated them though they were the darling of the audiophile class when I bought them.  The design is totally quirky IMO.  They're bulky, and they earpieces didn't extend far enough for me to get a comfortable fit.  They don't come with a case, though they certainly should for the price.  Pairing was a nightmare with every device I tried though I eventually got them working with everything (phone, iPad, computer).  Tech support was nonexistent, though it may have improved; I don't know.  One feature I liked was the replaceable battery, permitting one to buy and carry a spare.  Another was the ""tap to control"" feature for volume adjustment. Sound was stellar, but to me that was the only strength to these otherwise overpriced phones.  Range was good, not great; about 20 feet maximum with no obstructions.That brings me to the Bose.  I'd prefer an over-the-ear design, but at least these are very good for an on--the-ear design.  They fit well and are extremely comfortable, they just don't block out as much ambient sound as I wish they did.  I also wish they were noise canceling.  Battery charging is easy using the supplied USB cable (and since I had a ton of similar cables laying around and always keep one in my briefcase to charge other stuff it means I'll never be without a means to charge them).  Battery life is fantastic, I regularly get the claimed 15 hours.  I also like having the controls on the rear of the right earpiece.  They work flawlessly for adjusting volume, skipping songs, etc.  Early wired phones had no way of controlling any of these; while later wired ones do, usually via a cable in-line design, they tend to be iffy in my experience, working with some devices (often only ones from Apple) but not others.  That kept me wedded to my iPod when I'd have preferred to simply use my phone (currently an iPhone 6, but I've had every other generation of the iPhone as well as a Galaxy S4 and Note 2).  These phones finally let me cut the cord to my iPod.  I now exclusively use my iPhone, and can easily adjust volume or skip songs just using the earpiece controls.  Finally, these have excellent range, about 25 feet with no walls, and 15 or so with.Now to the sound.  It's very good, comparable to the Ziks.  If you're a Bose QC user you'll like these.  If you prefer Beats, these will be lighter on the bass than you're used to.  As a final note, you can listen to these via a supplied cable if the battery runs down, but the sound gets comparatively tinny, so it's only useful in a pinch.  If these phones were over-the-ear and had noise canceling they'd be perfect, but even without those features they're still a great pair of Bluetooth phones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNXIF42AXANPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M58CMYC#wasThisHelpful","RNXIF42AXANPM","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's cheaper than the self-adhesive variety, and offers reasonably similar protection but is a bit of a pain to apply.  It's not that hard in the end, but it essentially works like a waterslide decal, so you have to soak it for a few seconds, then apply it, squeegee and wait for it to dry overnight.  I suppose the one advantage for some people is that you have a bit of time to move it around to get it seated properly.

"I really wanted to like this bag, as it's a good-looking bag and at first looks to be of pretty good construction.  It has one fatal flaw, however, and another minor one.  Many of the snaps are of VERY poor quality and simply won't stay fastened.  The problem is with the male ends of these snaps; they're poorly formed as well as flimsy, and the female end simply can't be fastened securely.The minor flaw is that the padded camera section that fits into the interior bottom of the bag is a separate - and loose - compartment that isn't integral to the bag itself and merely rests in the bag, rather than being part of it.  That leaves gaps between the bag and the padded compartment, and while not a deal-breaker it doesn't exactly bespeak quality construction.Too bad, because absent these two defects, I'd have given this five stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9DOY91MZT2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00760EP4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3O9DOY91MZT2D","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm guessing this latest pair is at least my 15th, and what junk they are.  I've only had them a couple of months, and they're already falling apart.  The insoles, which only span the rear half of the shoe, have separated from the rest of the shoe and will no longer stay put.  They've curled up like parchment.  The leather uppers have completely lost their shape.  My son bought a pair at roughly the same time as I bought these, and his have suffered the same fate (he's only 15, and he's never had a pair before, so he's got a pretty bad impression of Topsider's at this point).  While I can't imagine it could be relevant, I'll note my current pair are Sahara (as are my son's), while all my previous Topsider's were Classic Brown.  Unless the quality flaws are peculiar to the Sahara color, all I can say is that Topsider's have really declined in quality.  I'm used to these things lasting for a year or more (i.e., until the soles wear out; the insoles and uppers have never been a problem).","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35FUGLQG4E6LV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EP8LV6#wasThisHelpful","R35FUGLQG4E6LV","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stand is very well-designed and easy to use, and it's very rugged.  Unfortunately, it has - or at least mine has - a major flaw that undermines what otherwise would be an extremely sturdy and stable stand.  The flaw is that the head, which swivels down to fold against the main tube, isn't parallel to the floor when raised: it leans several degrees, thus wanting to tip the stand forward.  Naturally, the problem is exacerbated under a load, i.e., as soon as you mount a bike.I took mine apart to find the cause.  In my case, the head's rear wall thickness either wasn't sufficient to brace the wall against the post early and evenly (there's a gap between the rear wall and the post, so they don't make contact until the head beam leans a few degrees), or the holes on either side of the beam that accommodate the swivel post were drilled a couple of millimeters forward of where they should have been (resulting in the aforementioned gap at the rear).  I had to have a 2mm-thick metal rectangle  (roughly 1.75"" by 1.75 "" welded to the inside rear wall to gain sufficient thickness so that it would make contact against the post early enough to prevent the lean.Were it not for this, I've have given this stand five stars: as it is, I'm tempted to give it only two, but will settle at three (but barely).","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSAMSNGQEOQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FIAUNY#wasThisHelpful","R3BSAMSNGQEOQT","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are amazing.  First, they're bubble free, or at least they become so within a day (as noted in the instructions).  They're easy to apply, because they're a bit stiffer than most screen protectors.  Once applied, there are very few bubbles, and even those disappear within 24 hours (and I mean COMPLETELY disappear).  Once that happens, you can't tell there's a screen protector on the phone.  I've been using them for over a year; I generally replace them about every two or three months, but they could easily serve longer.Oh, and these are indeed crystal clear, as the name implies.  They have only a negligible - indeed, if any - effect on screen brightness or contrast.

"I've owned two of these now, and both have failed in less than a year of use.  I switched to an OWC Elite drive after the second Lacie tanked.  I've only had the OWC two months, but so far so good (though I'd have said the same thing two months into owning the first Lacie).  Compared to the Lacie, the OWC has a substantially smaller footprint, and is MUCH quieter.  This drive is one of the noisiest I've come across.

"Let me start by saying I'm not the audiophile I used to be.  Back in the 70's and 80's I was an audiophile gear junky, always buying the latest and greatest top-end stuff.  These days I'm content to have a ""very good"" system, as opposed to a ""high-end"" system (many of which don't offer any improvement in sound IMO).  I can remember when back in the old days we obsessed over ""total harmonic distortion"" measures the way some people do over CPU gigahertz today.Anyway, I'm a longtime amateur musician (guitar, bass) with a pretty well-equipped home recording studio, so quality sound is important to me: I just don't obsess over audio gear like I once did.I bought these speakers for my office at home, which I work out of about 50% of the time (and spend a lot of time in outside work).  I use them with a Mac Pro that has a topnotch sound card (I do scratch pad recording on the machine using Logic Studio and then move it to my home recording setup, which is also Logic-based, on a different Mac).  I've got an extensive music collection that includes everything from classical to hip-hop and rap (the influence of having two teen-aged sons and a pre-teen who's into the same stuff as his brothers).  Mostly I listen to rock, blues, and country - I'd say they make up 70% of my listening, with classical and jazz comprising most of the rest.I've probably owned a couple of dozen computer speaker systems since I bought my first desktop in the mid 80's, and virtually all have been mediocre at best.  A few later sets from Harmon-Kardon and Altec-Lansing were decent.  This Bose system is very good in my estimation, for what it purports to do: provide high quality sound from a computer.  No, they don't compete with 5.1 home theatre surround system, and one shouldn't expect them to.  But they do provide very good sound in a compact setting.  The stereo separation is decent even though the speakers aren't intended to be spaced very far apart.  The bass is excellent (and adjustable to taste).  The mids and highs are clear and distinct without being shrill, though it would be nice if Bose provide an EQ adjustment for these (and at this price arguably they should).  Acoustic music, like acoustic guitar and piano, sounds sublime through these.  All in all I'm highly satisfied.  After experimenting a bit with these, I'll offer the following suggestions:- Make sure you have the sub centered beneath your computer desk.  Some may try to tuck it to one side or another for space reasons, but it really compromises the stereo field and can make the sound seem really out of balance on some tracks.- Don't point the satellite speakers toward yourself.  I've found that the best stereo field is created by having the speakers facing straight out, and relatively close to the listener.  I tend to sit erect or even lean forward a little when I'm typing: I keep the speakers about a foot to 18"" in front of me and about 30"" -36"" apart.  If I roll my chair away from my desk the stereo field narrows, so you want to position these relative to how you'll be sitting most of the time.  You want to lean more toward having almost to your side than in front of you (figuratively that is).Nice system.  Pricier than most, but better too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4WBC99E9W82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HZBR64#wasThisHelpful","RM4WBC99E9W82","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earphones looked promising, but ultimately proved a disappointment.  First, the bass is weak to nonexistent: the bass on my $29 V-Moda's is far superior (as is the overall sound quality of the V-Moda's), and these don't begin to approach my Bose or Shure phones.Second, the construction quality is very poor.  The volume control didn't work from the start, and the right headphone failed after just two months.The only positive is that - for me, at least - they fit snugly and stay in place.I have to admit to getting a chuckle from the reviewer below who suggested that improper use is the culprit for those of us who can't hear any bass in these phones:1) I've owned over a dozen in-ear sets, and know how to properly insert them.  These simply don't sound very good.2) The reviewer cites the use of these with an iPod or MP3 as an example of failure to use them properly: what does he think Apple makes these to be used with?  Duh....There are far better phones from V-Moda, Etymotic and Shure for roughly the same (or slightly more) money.  The $30 V-Moda's are a real bargain.  They're a tad on the flimsy side, but no worse than these, and are less that half the price.

"As others have said, this album isn't for everyone.  Mainstream Brad Paisley fans are apt to buy it and then wonder, ""what the heck is this about"".  Personally, while I acknowledge Brad as a guitar virtuoso, I'm not a huge fan of him as a ""country artist"".  On the other hand, this album is killer if you're into virtuoso guitar playing and pure musical artistry.  By ""virtuoso guitar playing"", I'm not referring to the physical gymnastics of the average shredder: though Brad can shred with the best of them, as this album shows, this isn't an attempt at showing off his ability to play aimless scales, but rather an eclectic tour de force that showcases a variety of styles.  He's as melodic as anyone else I can think of (I'm a player myself, so I prize players that can play melodically).My favorite songs are ""Departure"", which indeed is a departure from Brad's typical country musings, and ""Cliffs of Rock City"".  ""Departure"" is at once familiar and distant.  It sounds like music you've heard before, but you can't put your finger on exactly where you've heard it.  That's because it's comprised of an amalgam of familiar influences, while not sounding like any ONE of them in particular.  On the other hand, any fan of Eric Johnson will immediately recognize ""Cliffs of Rock City"" as a tribute to THAT master of the fretboard, in much the same way that EJ's ""SRV"" is a highborn tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan without sounding exactly like him.If you're looking for ""Brad Paisley the Country Artist"", this album may not be for you: check out the song samples before you buy.  If you simply appreciate great music, and especially great guitar music, then this album should be in your collection.

"I just bought this monitor for $199 (the price as of 9/7).  It is an unbelievable deal - I'm still pinching myself to make sure I really got this thing for $200.  We are an almost all Mac house - after 20 years of PC's - so we're used to Mac monitors.  My wife and two of my kids have MacBooks and don't use external monitors.  My youngest has a Mac Mini that he runs through a Viewsonic 900X, one of the finest early 19"" monitors made (which cost me $1,100 new, about three years ago).  I personally use a MacBook Pro, along with an older PowerMac w/ an Apple 20"" Cinema Display (a set-up that is now dedicated to my music studio), and a top of the line Mac Pro, with a 23"" Cinema Display.

"I just bought this phone to replace my original Motorola Q, which in turn replaced a Treo 750W.  Let me be begin by saying that I was a longtime Blackberry user until my firm switched to the Windows Mobile platform.  I'm on Verizon now, and no Windows Mobile phone offered by Verizon equals the Blackberry platform in my opinion.  I feel that the Blackberry phones offer superior speed and performance, an interface that's much easier to navigate than Windows Mobile, and VASTLY superior ergonomics, especially the keyboards.I hated the Treo: washed-out display, horrible keyboard, slow and prone to crashing, heavy with a clumsy form factor.I bought the Q to get its better display, thinner form factor, and marginally better keyboard.The Q9 improves on the original Q in only one area - its the same phone internally in all practical respects - and that's the keyboard.  If you are primarily a business user, you'll find the Q9 to be much faster to use and much better for accurate typing - in fact, it rivals the best Blackberries.  The cosmetics are slightly different from the original Q - it resembles the black Q to some extent in that it has some rubberized gripping surfaces.  Other than the minor cosmetic differences and the vastly improved keyboard (and it's music capabilities which are irrelevant to me - I prefer my iPod Nano), it's the same phone.But if you need a good keyboard on a Widows Mobile phone and you're using Verizon, this is the phone for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2346UTZ633QRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VR9JS6#wasThisHelpful","R2346UTZ633QRO","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I started using this in my home office a few years ago to clean surfaces of my various electronics, e.g., computers, printers, phones, etc.A major advantage is the aerosol spray feature, which doesn't result in huge streams of liquid getting where you don't want them.  You can spray a display screen for example, and the stuff doesn't start running down the screen, threatening to get into the innards.  It doesn't leave much in the way of streaks either, unlike many of the most common pump-spray products.In any event, I like it enough that I was willing to order a case over the Internet though Amazon once the local home improvement store stopped selling it.

"These headphones have great promise but are ultimately frustrating.The good:- They sound GREAT!  Balanced response with good but not overpowering bass, clear mids and trebles: very musical sounding.The bad:- Terrible ergonomics, starting with the silicone ear inserts.  The design of these makes them extremely prone to slipping from your ears.  They're just awful.- Again, the silicone ear inserts are a problem: they refuse to stay attached to the buds, slipping off with even the slightest tug.  Expect to lose at least one within just a day or two.- The cord is a constant tangled mess.  Sure, Bose provides a case you can use to wind up the cord and store the set, but it's a pain to use.  I like to be able to gently wind up a set of buds and stuff them in my pocket so they're ready for use at an instant.  Do that with these and you're guaranteed to have a tangled mess, and in in addition expect to find the silicone inserts floating around somewhere in your pocket as you extract the set, that is if you're fortunate enough that they don't fall off and roll/bounce away never to be seen again.I would have rated these a 5 if only the inserts didn't fall off so easily (I can deal with the flimsy, easily tangled cord).  I'm thinking of trying a set of Shures or Etymotics for my next pair.  I want something that sounds as good as these, but with a better ergonomic design.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YA9SZSQ86BB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HWP6SC#wasThisHelpful","R2YA9SZSQ86BB3","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these in a pinch while traveling after I inadvertently left my Bose ear buds behind.The good:- They stay in my ears very snugly (something I can't say about the Bose pair)- The cord, while thin, resists tangling (again, unlike the Bose pair)- The price: they're relatively inexpensiveThe bad:- Biased toward the treble frequencies to the point of having a shrill, ice-pick sound.  At times, this becomes downright uncomfortable- Weak bass, to put it mildly.- Weird design doesn't provide a symmetrical Y-split: the lead to the right ear is considerably longer.  The result is that even a slight tug on the main part of the cord tends to pull the left bud out of your ear.I wouldn't buy these again, even at the low price.  Stock iPod buds from Apple are only a little more and have much better sound.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259EDIG07HO3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JKHXPQ#wasThisHelpful","R259EDIG07HO3A","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are excellent sounding ear buds that far surpass the sound quality of the OEM buds that shipped with my 8gig 2nd generation iPod Nano (and an order of magnitude better than even older stock Ipod earbuds).  They have excellent bass for a pair of earbuds, and they avoid the icepick midrange of the stock Nano buds that can make those buds painful to listen through at times.The caveat is that the fit of these phones depends on whether one of the three supplied pairs of silicone ear molds works for your ears.  By default they're fitted with the ""medium"" molds, which I couldn't get to stay in, though I'm a pretty big guy and have always thought of my ears as being on the large side.  When I switched to the ""small"" molds, the problem was solved (can't imagine who is going to use the medium and large molds).  They quickly orient properly in my ears and stay put snugly, even while I'm exercising.  The snug fit blocks out more extraneous sound than the stock buds.  The stock buds tend to have more of a universal fit, if it can be called that, but that's just because they tend to barely hang on the ledge of your ear.  They are constantly shifting, and the shifting causes dramatic variations of the quality of the sound you hear at any given point.  Not so with these, again, assuming you can get a good fit with one of the molds.  Nice product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OEBIYPBPOMXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KLZ7VG#wasThisHelpful","R3OEBIYPBPOMXY","A1GOKUUDRB63FQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GOKUUDRB63FQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The rear screw holes are not in the correct location for a standard 5.25"" drive; you might need to drill extra holes and may need to add extra length to the metal, depending on your chassis and whether it uses rails (I recommend more than 2 screws since insertion/removal requires a little force).  The metal is thin to begin with, much more flimsy than the Antec EasySATA drive carrier.The metal on the side is attached to rubber bushings which are very flexible; the whole carrier feels very loose in the chassis since the rails are not held in place securely by the rubber bushings.  I glued on some stiff foam rubber to stiffen it up.A 3.5"" drive sticks out 2.25 inches when the drive is seated and the drive can wobble around quite a bit in all directions -- only the SATA connector, weight of the drive, and slight pressure from the door spring holds the drive in place (it could vibrate loose when seeking aggresively).  I added a strip of velcro in the left inside of the tray to reduce sideways vibration (be sure to allow for door movement though).  I would not recommend this holder for any mounting drives on their side due to the huge amount of play in the vertical direction (the door spring does not press very hard on the drive), but I stuck a thick rubber pad to the inside ""top"" of the carrier to reduce play in that direction also.It is difficult to tell when the drive is seated; one must learn the ""feel"" of the SATA connector insertion force (or measure the protrusion length).  The extra padding I added actually makes this part more difficult.The carrier does not provide any grounding to the drive to prevent ESD damage; the only ground is through the SATA connector.  To prevent ESD damage, you should ground yourself by touching your computer's chassis when inserting/removing a drive from this carrier (and of course never touch the drive's circuit board or SATA connector pins to yourself or anything else).Don't mistake the fan-shaped opening on the back for a fan -- it's just a round air vent.  When no drive is installed, unfiltered dust is sucked into your chassis through the 2.5"" hole on the front.The carrier does have both the old 4-pin molex connector and the standard SATA power connector (only one of these should be attached to your power supply).Personally I didn't have much use for the power switch on the front of the carrier and found it just a nuisance to avoid bumping accidentally; OS's generally don't like drives being shut off when running.  I did like the green activity LED, which is something that the Antec carrier didn't have.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DOJ0HQU6MV6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3WNWB2#wasThisHelpful","R2DOJ0HQU6MV6Q","A386LG0LRWKJZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A386LG0LRWKJZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is no fault of Adafruit, but note that the Bosch BMP180 pressure readings are very temperature-sensitive and not quite linear.  A temperature sensor is built-in, but a lot of math is required to convert the uncompensated temperature & pressure measurements into actual air pressure.  BMP180 software is available for Arduino, but I was trying to use it with a CAI WebControl module and it won't be as easy to do temperature compensation with WebControl's PLC programming limitations.

"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comHeidi R. Kling is a new to me author, but after I read this blurb I was so intrigued. Paint My Body Red was unlike anything I have read before, and it was a really good story. Kling captured my attention right away, and I couldn't stop reading as I had to know what was going on. This book deals with a lot of touchy subjects, and yet I thought that Kling handled them masterfully. Before starting this story I would make sure that you take the time to read the blurb as some of the issues dealt with here could be possible triggers for some readers.After a rash of suicides at her school, Paige's mom sends her to live with her sick father fearing that Paige will be the next. Those around her believe that she will be the seventh teenager to throw themselves in front of a train. So when Paige arrives at her father's ranch, she finds out that nothing is as she remembered it. Not only is her father sick, but he is actually dying. The ranch that had been passed down for generations is falling to pieces and is in danger of being sold and the boy she once knew is now a full grown sexy cowboy. Paige finds herself tired of running and is ready to face her secrets. But can she deal with her secrets and move forward, or will they be too much for her no matter where she is?I was really interested in the characters of this story, and I thought that Kling did a great job of showing such depth for each of them. Paige was dealing with a lot, and it was clear that there was so much going on beneath the surface that no one knew about. Between her thoughts and her writing in her journal, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out everything that had happened both in the past and was happening in the present. Then you had Ty, her stepbrother. There was a lot to him as well, and I didn't always understand him or his choices. At times I really liked him and felt for him, and then at other times I was convinced he was a bad guy. He was definitely dealing with his own set of issues though, and I think that had everything to do with his actions. Then you have Jake, the sexy cowboy that Paige had known as a child. I liked him instantly, and I really thought that he was a great guy. There was such a huge gap in time from when Paige had known him before and the present, and I was just as curious as Paige was to find out all that had gone in in the years that she had missed. Jake had his own set of issues he was dealing with, but the more I got to know him the more I loved him.Overall, this was a really interesting book. I know at this point I haven't said much about the actual story and have been pretty vague, that is on purpose though as I really think that this book needs to be read blind. There are so many things that could spoil everything if said that I am just going to say that this book was different and was unlike anything I have read. Not only does it deal with teen suicide but it also deals with so many more issues including illness and loss. I found the characters deep and interesting and their story is one worth reading. I think that a lot of people will really relate to this story and it is definitely one worth taking a chance on. I will definitely be looking for more from Heidi R. Kling in the future after reading Paint My Body Red, and I think that this is one of those books that will stick with me and having me thinking about it for quite awhile.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5FZGE52XH9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PDW76M#wasThisHelpful","R1R5FZGE52XH9J","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comWrapped in Lace is a sweet holiday standalone from Prescott Lane, and I enjoyed it a lot. Every once in awhile I am looking for a feel good type of story that you just can't help but be happy when you finish and this was that story for me. Though it does take place around Christmas and New Year's, it wasn't exactly a holiday story to me. This book really is a contemporary romance that is more about a second chance at love than it was about the holiday. I have to say that while it was nice to get a bit of holiday spirit here, I was so glad that it wasn't overdone and full of gimmicks. A lot of times holiday stories tend to just be cheesy and over the top for me, so it was really refreshing to read one that was done so well!After avoiding his hometown for the last six years, Drew finally agrees to return home for Christmas. Already knowing he will need the escape from his family, Drew sets out to find someone to occupy his time. But when he runs into a wannabe bad girl at a local bar, he never expects for it to be more than a temporary distraction. Drew soon realizes that Piper is so much more than a way to temporarily fill his time, and soon he is wondering how he can make it last.I really liked Piper and Drew. These two were so much fun to read about and I thought that they were great together. Piper was sweet and caring, and I loved that she was supportive of Drew. She was a good girl at heart, but I loved that she was fun and feisty and not afraid to speak her mind. This girl could hold her own, and I loved seeing her put Ellie in her place! Drew was such a great guy, and I felt so badly for how things had gone for him. I really didn't like a lot of his family for how some things had gone in his past and I didn't blame him one bit from staying away for so long. Frankly the way they treated him as though he was the one that needed to make an adjustment made me super angry. But I was so glad that Piper was able to help him move forward with his life, and I thought that she was exactly what he needed. These two had a great connection and a ton of chemistry, and I loved seeing their relationship grow over the course of this book.I will say that there were a few things that were predictable here, and while the story was good it didn't really break any new ground. But it was a very enjoyable read with likable characters and I felt good the entire time I was reading it. Heading into the holiday season, this book was exactly what I needed. It was a feel good story that brought just enough holiday cheer that I am starting to get in the spirit. If you are a fan of holiday romance stories, this is definitely one that you will want to check out. Prescott Lane is a very talented writer, and Wrapped in Lace was a great story. This won't be the last I read from her.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Ardent PRose**","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36M59HFAYKVZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017881ZKK#wasThisHelpful","R36M59HFAYKVZ2","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI Need a Hero is a cute novella length story that is the start of Codi Gary's new Men in Uniform series. This short and sexy read was fun and had some really great moments. It wasn't my favorite read from Gary, but it was still one that I liked quite a bit.After getting into some trouble Sergeant Oliver Martinez is sent to help plan a charity event for the Alpha Dogs Training Program. Just when things appear to be as bad as they can get, Oliver meets the woman that he has to work with, Evelyn Reynolds. Though the attraction between them is instant, Eve is the daughter of General Reynolds, the man that sent Oliver to the program in the first place. Evelyn wants nothing to do with military men, and she definitely doesn't want to get personal with the man helping her plan the event that can help launch her new PR career. But with the chemistry between her and Oliver and them spending more time together, they find it hard to keep things professional and soon are giving into the attraction between them. But is it just a quick fling, or could they have something more?I really liked the heat and chemistry between these two, and I felt like Oliver and Eve's attraction was clear right from the start. They definitely wanted each other, even though they both tried to fight it. The one thing I struggled with though was their connection. As much as I wanted to feel more between these two, everything seemed to happen so fast. I wanted to see more feelings developing between them, and I just had a hard time seeing anything real happening besides their physical attraction to one another. I think a lot of that was because of the length of this story and the fact that there were only so many pages to make that happen. Had they previously known each other I think that I might have felt differently, but since they just met here I just don't think there was enough time to really see a strong relationship form.I did love Beast though, and I thought that he stole the show. It was a lot of fun to read about him and I enjoyed the Alpha Program which I found really interesting. Beast had a lot of personality and I definitely think that he was the high point here. I wish that I had been able to see more happening between Oliver and Eve, because I think that this story had a lot of potential. I am interested to see where this series goes though as I really like Codi Gary's books and I liked the rest of the characters that were introduced here. I will definitely look for more in this series and from Codi Gary in the future. If you are looking for a short and sexy read I would give this one a shot. It was fun and light, and I think as long as you aren't expecting anything really deep or emotional that it is something most readers will enjoy.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250UZP03EIZ0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y88H3ZU#wasThisHelpful","R250UZP03EIZ0B","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI will admit that I am a big fan of Carina Adams and every time I see she has a new book coming out I get really excited! But I have to say that I think Out of the Blue is the one that I had been waiting for the most from her. After reading and loving Forever Red, I couldn't wait to get Mike's story! Though Out of the Blue is technically a standalone, it is really a continuation of Forever Red with more of the focus being on Mike and Molly. I would suggest reading these in order though I guess you wouldn't necessarily have to.When an accident ended Mike's career in the Navy, he came home to a life that had fallen apart. Needing something to do, he jumped at the chance to work security for one of his best friends who was also a famous country singer. As much as he enjoyed being around his best friend Nate though, it was hard to watch his other best friend Lia with Nate as they got back together. Though he had never made a move on Lia, he always thought that they would wind up together. Needing to get away from them, Mike left the tour and headed home. But when Lia shows up months later looking for his help running security for her new client Molly, Mike finds himself unable to say no. Mike and Molly had been friends before, and they picked up like nothing had changed once around one another again. But the more time they spend together, the more things begin to change and soon they are seeing each other in a completely new light.I had really liked both Molly and Mike in Forever Red, so I was excited to get to know each of them better. I felt so bad for Mike with how things went for him and Lia. Though I love Lia and Nate together, I saw the friendship and connection she had with Mike. He is such a good guy, and their friendship and history went back so far. But I really did think that Lia and Nate were meant to be, so it was really good to see Mike moving forward. He was great at what he did, and he genuinely cared about Molly and her safety. It was great to see them grow closer than ever as they spent more time together. Molly was so easy to like, and I thought that she was good for Mike. She was able to help Mike loosen up a bit and start to live his life for himself as well as others. I can't even imagine living life in the spotlight and having to deal with everything that Molly did, and though she did make a few poor choices I completely understood where she was coming from. She wanted to make her own choices and have some fun without the world having an opinion on everything. Where she was good for Mike with helping him be a bit more selfish when he needed it, he was good at grounding her and helping her to let go of all that she had to deal with because of her life as a singer. These two were so great together and I really felt their connection to one another. I also loved the heat and chemistry between them, and I couldn't get enough of them together.I really loved this book and just like with Forever Red, I didn't want it to end! I feel so invested in each of these characters and I just love this series! They are all so fun to read about, and I found my heart melting at how cute Mike and Mols were together. Carina is a great writer, and I was so glad to see how she handled so many issues here in this book. I thought that she did a great job of tackling some issues and giving each the respect that they deserved. There were a lot of things going on here, and I felt like the pacing and flow was perfect. Carina Adams did a great job with this story, and I couldn't put this book down. If you are looking for a book that is funny, sweet and filled with smoking hot chemistry, this is definitely one worth checking out. I have loved everything I have read from Carina Adams and I know that I will be anxiously awaiting whatever she writes next.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Ardent PRose**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJHHQL8BVDOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016U4U0MW#wasThisHelpful","R3CJHHQL8BVDOU","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI have been waiting for what feels like forever to get the sequel to Mad Love by Colet Abedi. So when I heard that we were finally getting Mad Love 2, I could not have been more excited. Mad Love ended with a cliffhanger, and I needed to know what would happen for Clayton and Sophie. Mad Love 2 is the continuation of their story, and it does need to be read in order. So if you haven't already read Mad Love, there will be spoilers below.After her whirlwind romance in the Maldives with Clayton Sinclair, Sophie returns home broken hearted when she sees pictures of him with his ex-girlfriend splashed across the covers of magazines. So when her best friend lands her a job in the south of France, she views it as her chance to start the rest of her life. But upon arrival, Sophie finds out that things were too good to be true and is forced to face Clayton once again. The chemistry between them is as strong as ever, and soon Sophie finds herself unable to fight the feelings between them. But when a family tragedy happens, Clayton shuts her out and Sophie must make the choice between letting go of him once and for all, or fighting for a future together.I really loved Clayton and Sophie in Mad Love. The chemistry and connection between them is undeniable. Things between them happened very quickly, yet it always felt so real. Unfortunately for most of this book though they each drove me nuts. Sophie was a constant blubbering mess, and she came off as very weak here. There were a few times that she seemed to finally gain some strength, but it wasn't enough for me. Clayton was so hot and cold here, and I felt like he never really warmed up fully to Sophie. He did open up more here, but it still wasn't much. Plus to be honest he was way too controlling and acted like a jerk for the majority of this book. I just had trouble really seeing an actual relationship happening rather than just constant circling which would end up in them fighting and pushing each other away. It was mostly Clayton doing it here, but Sophie wasn't the best either. These two were just as hot together as ever, and that was the one place that they never struggled. But when it came to believing that these two had a real and believable relationship that felt steady and stable, I never did believe that here.Overall, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed here. I expected to feel better about Sophie and Clayton, and for the most part I would say that things were even more unstable in this book than they were in the first. I kept waiting for these two to finally come around and it just didn't ever really seem to get there. Though I did like some things about the ending, it still felt unfinished to me. It was definitely more of a happy for now with things still up in the air, than a finished series. I would have liked an epilogue or a few more chapters to really finish things off here. I also had some issues with the book itself when it came to the writing. There were several times that it would basically stop in the middle of something and switch to another time or location with no warning at all. It was disorienting and the transitions were almost non-existent. It really disrupted the flow of the story to have to try and figure out how in one paragraph Sophie and Clayton were together, yet the next Sophie was with someone else completely in another location or time. Those issues along with the characters and lack of development here were what unfortunately sealed the deal here for me. As much as I wanted this book to be as great as the first one and to give Sophie and Clayton the ending they deserved, I just never saw it and was left disappointed and wanting more. This one had so much promise and I really loved the first book, but this wasn't the ending that I had been hoping for or expecting.**ARC Provided by Inkslinger PR**","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UXCUEZIILGXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BL6HSO#wasThisHelpful","R1UXCUEZIILGXZ","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comHard Beat is the newest book in the Driven series from K. Bromberg. This book is a complete standalone though, so if you haven't read the previous ones you don't have to worry about starting here. While this book takes place in the Driven world, this story is about Rylee's brother Tanner who we have only seen a little of previously. I have to say though that I have been waiting for Tanner's story! I couldn't wait to really get to know him, and each book that I read from K. Bromberg just seems to get that much better. It is so hard for me to pick a favorite character of hers, because just when I think that no one can top my favorite she finds a way to prove me wrong! This is one of my absolute favorite group of characters ever though, and I really cannot recommend every book in this series enough!Foreign war correspondent Tanner Thomas is used to living for his work, but after losing his best friend he needs his job more than ever. Convincing his employers that he needs to get back to work, they set him up with a new photographer that tests him right from the start. Though Beaux Croslyn doesn't have a lot of experience, she is determined to do whatever it takes to make it. The attraction between them is instant, but they don't get off to the best start. But Beaux has secrets that she won't talk about and when they start to threaten everything, Tanner is will stop at nothing to find out the truth. But will Tanner's determination put them in even more danger than Beaux's secrets?These two were so hot together, and the heat between them was instant! From their very first interaction the sparks were flying, and I just knew that these this book was going to be one of the steamiest I have read! Tanner was struggling with losing his best friend, and I felt so bad for him. It was easy to see how close they had been and just how much he had cared about her. He was really lost and Beaux helped to give him a way to move forward with his life. These two might have had strong chemistry right from the start, but it took awhile for them to warm up to each other beyond just the attraction they felt. Beaux was feisty and determined, and I will admit that she wasn't my favorite right off. But the more I got to know about her and see, the more I started to like her. K. Bromberg is great at writing strong heroines that have so many sides to them, and Beaux Croslyn was definitely everything that I have come to know and love from her. I like that she could challenge Tanner and give just as good as she got, and I think that she was exactly what Tanner needed.Overall, this was another great book in the Driven world and I just love all these stories so much. K. Bromberg never disappoints, and I love that all the characters and stories are so different from one another. Though the characters are interconnected and you get to see familiar faces as the series continues, you really get so many different types of stories with each of these books. Tanner and Beaux's story was different than any of the rest of the books in the series considering their occupations and the situation they were in, and I loved it just as much as I have all the others. It was great to see Kristy deliver every bit of emotion and steam as she is known for, but to also see that she really can write anything she puts her mind to. Beaux and Tanner's story grabbed my attention right from the start, and I couldn't put it down. If you are a fan of Kristy's, you will love this book! But if you are new to her, this is a great place to start. I highly recommend this series, and I am really looking forward to whatever she writes in the future.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JCCT6DH9V9QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02BRY#wasThisHelpful","R2JCCT6DH9V9QG","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comWow Karina Halle really did it again with The Play! The way this book started off, I just knew that this book was going to be amazing yet at the same time wreck me. I have loved everything I have read by Karina, but I have to say that there is just something about her sexy McGregor guys that gets me each time! The Play features Lachlan McGregor who fans of The Pact and The Offer will recognize as Bram and Linden's cousin and Kayla Moore who is friends with both Stephanie and Nicola and shares a bit of history with Linden. I couldn't put this book down, and I really loved it.Kayla Moore is tired of one-night stands and always feeling like a third wheel with her friends, so she puts herself on a dating and sex strike. But when she meets Lachlan McGregor, she begins to rethink her choices. Talked into writing an article to help out Bram's cause, she interviews Lachlan and things between them become too hard for either of them to fight. Though Lachlan is set to go back to Scotland, they decide to spend the little time he has left in America together. But when Lachlan asks Kayla to go with him when he returns home, Kayla must decide if the risk of something with Lachlan is worth leaving behind her entire life.I really loved Lachlan. I have to say that Karina probably set a record with how quickly she tugged my heartstrings here, and I was instantly invested in Lachlan's story. It absolutely broke my heart what he had been through, and I couldn't have loved him more. Lachlan struggled so much, but he was such a great person. His capacity for love and good was beyond what you could ever imagine for someone who had been through what he had. Kayla was so much more than you first see, and I really liked getting to see who she really was. She was fun and feisty and yet she had a vulnerable side that most never saw. I really thought that these two were perfect for each other, and it really felt like they were two outsiders who had finally found the place that they belonged. They had explosive chemistry and you could see the attraction, but it was their intense connection and bond that made these two so special.Overall, this was a really great story and I loved Lachlan and Kayla. I loved how much Lachlan gave back to the dogs that he rescued, and that he cared so much. It wasn't just a charity to make himself feel better, but was who he was and what he was passionate about. I have always believed in helping strays and animals that need help, so to see that as such a large part of a story was really moving for me. There are so many animals in this world that need help and are unable to ask for it, and I loved that Lachlan did as much as he did. I also really loved that this is something that Karina Halle feels so much about personally that she decided to donate a portion of her sales for The Play to animal charities. Not only is Karina Halle a beautiful writer, but it just shows how big her heart is as well. This book is one of my favorites of Karina's and I know that fans of hers will love this story! If you are new to Karina's books this is a great place to start and I would definitely recommend checking out her other books as well! I cannot wait to see what Karina writes in the future, but whatever it is I know I will be reading it!**Complimentary Copy Provided by Inkslinger PR**","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUI7FA8HN33YK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OQN4AC#wasThisHelpful","RUI7FA8HN33YK","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comThe Weight of Rain is my first book by Mariah Dietz, but it definitely won't be my last. Though I did have a few issues with this book, I found so much to enjoy here as well. I really liked the characters a lot, and I think that a lot of readers will really like them as well.Lauren (also known as Lo) is studying art at a college in Oregon, though she is from Montana. One night she goes out with friends and while drunk hooks up with a stranger she meets. Though she can't forget about him and remembers vague things about him, she can't find him or remember his name. Then months later she takes a job working for Kash as a nanny for his daughter. When she finally meets Kash's brother King, she finds herself face to face with the man she can't forget but couldn't remember. But things don't get off to a great start and though there is a connection between them still, Lo finds herself confused on where they go from there.While I really liked Lo and the person that she was, I did have a few issues with King. For a good portion of this story I didn't like how he was toward Lo at all. He was rude and would push her away, then flirt with her and be friendly. He was a bit all over the place, and he really didn't turn around into well into the story. So while I did like him, he also really confused and frustrated me. Lo was a great person, and I really liked how sweet she was with Mercedes. She got along well with others and wasn't afraid to stand up for herself and her friends. I thought that Lo and King had great chemistry together, and they did have a great connection. I just wish that things hadn't taken so long to turn around here.I also thought that the story itself had a few things that could have been better. There were several times that I felt like the transitions needed work or were basically non-existent. It would just go from one paragraph to the next with no notice that things had moved time or location. Often times a character would seem to come out of nowhere and I was left scrambling to try and figure out what was going on. It was a disorienting and gave the story a disjointed feel. These things could possibly have changed in a final draft as I read an ARC of the story, but I do not know if they were altered any. I will say that I felt like the last third of the book or so that things started to get much better, and I noticed that the flow was a lot better. I wish that the first two thirds had also had been just as good, because I really think that this book could have been great. I will still read more from Mariah Dietz in the future and I think that a lot of readers will definitely enjoy this book. I felt the blurb was a little bit vague and could have given potential readers a bit more as I really didn't have much of an idea of what I was in for before starting. But if this sounds like something you might like, I would absolutely give it a shot.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Between the Sheets Promotions**","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22291X97K8W4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NWMO62#wasThisHelpful","R22291X97K8W4U","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comBreak Me Down is the newest novella in the Loving on the Edge Series from Roni Loren. Though this book takes place between books eight and nine, it can be read as a standalone. Break Me Down is the story of Gibson (Kade's stepbrother) and Samantha (Tessa's best friend). If you are a fan of the series, there are a few other familiar faces that appear here as well and it was really good to see them again as well.Gibson Andrews helped train Samantha Dunbar to be a Domme. Though he had a moment with her where he submitted, he can't afford for others to see him as weak. As much as he wanted to be with Sam and she wanted him, he walked away saying that they weren't right for each other and that he couldn't be what she needed. But when Sam is attacked and heads to her grandma's rundown house in the middle of nowhere, Gibson can't let he go alone. Knowing that Sam needs someone though she will push everyone away, Gibson agrees to spend the week with her in private and be whatever she needs. But can one week together cure the desires that Gibson is scared others will find out about?I liked both Gibson and Sam. I thought that there was a lot of heat and chemistry between them, and it was clear that they cared about each other. I did find it hard to relate to Sam though and I think that is more of a personal thing for me. Though I have no problem with other people's kinks, I just find it hard to relate to female Dommes and male subs. There is just something sexy to me about alpha males that take control and own that side of themselves. The biggest thing that was hard for me here was that I think I might have been able to feel more connected had Gibson owned who he was and his desires. If you are a male sub there is no problem with that, but don't be embarrassed and think that is weak. It is the same thing as a female being a sub, and I have a problem with them thinking that they are weak by submitting. It takes an incredible amount of strength and confidence to give up control and trust to someone else, and I want whoever is submitting to realize the power and beauty of that. I was expecting Gibson to get over that fear and insecurity a bit earlier, and it got to the point that I was tired of waiting. I knew that with this being a novella that it was a short book, so I wanted to see him and Sam on solid ground before the very end. I just felt like the longer it took, the more rushed and abrupt the ending seemed.There were also a few things that made me uncomfortable as far as the scenes went as well. There were a few issues with force and coercion that I just felt didn't sit right with me. Though there wasn't anything major that I could draw fault to, it felt like there were some things that just weren't exactly kosher. There was also something that happened at The Ranch at the end that I wasn't entirely comfortable with either, and I felt like it was a bit unsafe. Precautions are put in place for a reason, and though it was Gibson who made the terms the removal of a safe word is something that just doesn't sit right with me when it comes to BDSM. I don't care that he asked for it or that he trusted Sam fully, I just couldn't get behind that considering the type of play they were entering together. So while I liked Gibson and Sam, this wasn't my favorite of the series. It was hard for me to get into the story and the few things I mentioned just made this one hard to get into for me. I think a lot of this is personal issues though, and no matter what I felt about this particular story there a few things that can't be argued when it comes to Roni's work. Roni Loren is a fantastic writer and her stories are always super hot! If you are a fan of the series, I still recommend this story. If you are new to the series, you definitely should give these books a shot. This series is one of my favorites and I know I will read more from Roni in the future.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G8IDY48HB6CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEOM2C#wasThisHelpful","R1G8IDY48HB6CX","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comThis book left me with a massive book hangover! I have had quite a few books lately that were just okay, but Walk Through Fire woke me up and was fantastic. Kristen Ashley delivered all the feels in her newest installment to the Chaos series, and I couldn't have put this book down if you tried to force me. Millie and Logan's story was heartbreaking but beautiful and I absolutely loved it even when I they upset me. Walk Through Fire is one of those stories that will draw you in instantly and stay with you forever.Millie Cross and Logan Judd fell in love almost instantly and knew that they belonged together. They had their life all planned out and were working on making their dreams come true until Millie broke off the relationship and Logan made the choice to walk away. Now twenty years later, Millie has a chance encounter with Logan and is finally ready to face everything that caused her to lose the only man she has ever loved. At first Logan wants nothing to do with Millie, except to maybe get a little revenge for the hurt she caused him. But when Logan learns the truth behind Millie's decision all those years ago, he must face that all the thought was true was actually something entirely different. Can Logan and Millie have a second chance at love twenty years after they first found each other, or will there have been too much between them to ever get back what they once lost?I really liked Logan and Millie together, and their connection was so rare and special. These two had spent so many years apart, and even when things were rough at the beginning it was clear just how deeply they felt for one another. Logan had tried to get on with his life and was able to find happiness in his daughters, though he never got the dream life he had planned with Millie. He thought that the Millie he knew was a complete lie, and you could see just how much that had torn him up for so long. But when the truth finally came it, it was even more devastating for him to find out just how far she had gone and all that she had given up for him. Millie was strong and such a beautiful person inside and out. Yet she made a choice that she should have talked to Logan about and changed their lives forever. I understand her reasoning behind the choice, but I didn't agree with it at all. Because of it Millie was just going through the motions, and while at first it looked like she had everything it was so obvious that she was actually living such a lonely and empty life. I was so glad that these two finally got to the point where they could talk about things, and I wish that they had been able to do it so much sooner. Time and distance hadn't changed the intense connection and chemistry that they always had, and the love between them had never gone away or dimmed.Overall, this story was so good. I didn't want it to end, and I was so invested in these characters. Their history was so much fun to see, and I loved that their connection was so quick yet was so real and believable. I enjoyed seeing how they met and fell in love, even when it broke my heart to see how things changed and broke them both. This book brought out so many emotions for me, and I definitely shed my fair share of tears. But Kristen Ashley has such a way with words and characters that I think it would be impossible to read any book of hers and not feel it. After I finished this book I just didn't want to move on and was incapable of reading anything immediately after. I was still so attached to Millie and Logan and I wanted to just dive back in and experience it all over again. If you are a fan of the Chaos series or Kristen Ashley this book is an absolute must read. If you are new to Kristen Ashley though, I highly recommend that you start here. Logan and Millie were impossible not to connect with and I think that so many readers will fall in love with them just like I did. I honestly can't wait to read more from Kristen Ashley, and I know that this won't be the only time I read Walk Through Fire.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1BY42Y0V30Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1BY42Y0V30Q","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI have read quite a few of Alyssa Rose Ivy's books at this point, and I have become a fan of hers. So when I saw that she had a new book coming out, I knew I had to read it. Life After Falling is unlike her other books that I have read, and this is a complete standalone. I have to say though that this isn't what I had been expecting, and while I did enjoy it I also had a few issues with this book.Unhappy with her life and herself, Cassidy quits her job and dumps her fiance. She heads home to stay with her parents until she figures out what to do next. When she comes across a cassette tape from her childhood, she believes that it is the way to find happiness once again. But the tape is broken, so she sets out to get it fixed at a used record shop. There she meets Leo, and the two of them hit it off. Cassidy soon finds out that Leo has his own set of issues from his past, and has put up walls against anyone that would possibly get under his skin. But the more time they spend together, the more they start to fall for one another. Soon they are beginning to wonder if they can find a second chance at happiness together.I had a really hard time connecting with Cassidy and Leo. They were both a bit different, and they didn't open up easily. I did think that they fit each other well though, and they were really good together. They had great banter, and I did like that they were able to get along so well as quickly as they did. These two understood one another, and their connection was easy to see. There were friends first, but the chemistry was there from the beginning. They did take awhile to open up to each other, and I wish that they had talked to each other without things just coming out due to circumstances around them. I think it would have meant more and showed a better connection between them had they made the choice to open up rather than things just coming out.Besides finding the characters hard to relate to though, I also just felt like this story was a bit weird. There was so much focus on the cassette for quite a bit of this story, and I just found it all a bit odd. I also felt like there were several things that were brought into this story for extra drama or for no real reason, only to be dropped without mention again. At first Cassidy meets back up with a former classmate Brent, and he quickly disappears. Then her brother is mentioned throughout the story quite a bit and his girlfriend is hated by absolutely everyone, but they were hardly around though they were mentioned a lot. There was one scene where Cassidy finally meets the girlfriend and the brother is horrible as well as his girlfriend, but after the big showdown happens and Leo stands up for Cassidy the whole thing just goes away. They are never mentioned again and nothing was resolved. So while I have really loved stories from Alyssa Rose Ivy in the past, this one just wasn't for me. It did have a cute ending and I was glad to see how things turned out for the characters, I just didn't enjoy it like I have with some of her previous books.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Inkslinger PR**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26HBQ0MRA8ET5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016KSCJPO#wasThisHelpful","R26HBQ0MRA8ET5","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comTouch Me Not is the first book in the Manwhore series by Apryl Baker, and it is also the first book that I have read by her. I went into this book not knowing what to expect, and I am happy to say that I was really glad I took a chance on this one after reading it. This story was different and fresh, and I really liked the characters. I thought that Apryl Baker had a great writing style that drew me in right from the start. I might have been new to Apryl Baker before reading Touch Me Not, but I will absolutely read more from her in the future.Since the accident that killed her twin sister, Lily can't stand to be touched. Even her closest friends and family know that she needs to always keep her distance. She has loved her best friend Adam for years, but he has never seen what they could have together and she knows that with her inability to touch that a relationship between them would be impossible. So when the school manwhore Nikoli takes an interest in her, they agree to a deal where he will help her deal with her touch issues and he will try to seduce her into giving him a night together. The more time they spend together though, the more the lines start to blur and feelings start to develop. So when Adam starts acting jealous and showing signs of interest in Lily, will she give up a chance at something with Nikoli to finally have a shot with Adam? Or will she find herself falling for the school manwhore with the hopes that she will be the one to change him?I really liked Lily and Nikoli. I loved how she made him work for it, and she stood her ground when it came to him. Lily was unlike any other girls he had ever come across, and it was great to see him not know exactly what to do for once. He really put in the effort with her, and it was easy to see that what had started out as him pursuing her as his latest conquest quickly changed into something more. Nikoli was supportive and encouraging with Lily and her phobia, but he was also the one to push her. She needed someone that would take her out of her comfort zone by showing her how to trust and I really enjoyed seeing her open up to Nikoli. These two had a great connection and they had amazing chemistry. The sparks between them were clear from the start, and I was glad that she was able so see beyond his reputation and past. Nikoli never made excuses for the fact that he had slept around quite a bit, but I really liked the fact that he was honest with Lily and he made an effort to change once she came into his life.I also really loved the secondary characters in this story, and I liked seeing how great of friends they were. I am really curious about some of them, and I hope that Apryl Baker will write their stories so that we can get to know them better. I really liked Nikoli's best friend Luther and I am hoping that his book might be next. This book was different than anything I have read recently, and it was nice to see a different story here when so many books in the NA genre tend to be similar. Though the story was predictable at times, it was enjoyable and the characters were unique. I was really invested in them right from the start, and I think that it was very refreshing to not get your average cookie-cutter types here. I would really recommend this book to NA fans, and I am looking forward to more from Apryl Baker and this series as it continues.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Enticing Journey Book Promotions**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UOF9LAFFXPTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ERRJBC#wasThisHelpful","R3UOF9LAFFXPTI","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comDirty Lies is the third book in the Burke Brothers series from Emma Hart. Each book is a standalone story though, so don't worry about jumping in here if you haven't read the previous two. This is Aidan's book, and I have to admit that I have been curious about him for awhile. I will say that this wasn't my favorite of the series. While it did have a lot of enjoyable moments, there were some things that just didn't work for me.Since catching her now ex-boyfriend with someone else, Jessie Law is in no hurry to find someone else. So when she runs into Aidan Burke while he is home from touring with Dirty B, she views it as the perfect chance for a rebound. They agree to one night together with no expectations. But when Aidan then saves Jessie from her ex-boyfriend the following morning, Aidan makes the mistake of saying that he is her new boyfriend. Looking to clean up their act, the band manager asks Aidan to let the public believe that Jessie really is his girlfriend and she reluctantly agrees. The more time that they spend together though, the more the lines between fake and real begin to blur.Part of my problem here was Aidan. While there were times that I really liked him, for the most part he was an absolute jerk. I didn't believe that his feelings were developing for Jessie beyond the fact that he was attracted to her. He would say how sexy she was and there were times that he would appear to be feeling jealous and wanting more, but ultimately it all just seemed to be physical. Jessie was feisty and had a definite attitude here as well. I found it pretty hard to connect with either of them. Jessie had issues with Aidan from when they were young, and i'm not saying that he made it easier here in the present, but she definitely was biased about him and gave him no room to show he was a different person. These two did have a ton of chemistry, but I just wasn't feeling their connection grow like I would have liked.I also really disliked Jessie's sister Saskia. She was supposed to be sixteen, and yet she acted about ten. She was the biggest bratty fan-girl and I hated what a tattle-tale she was! She would try to blackmail Jessie into getting what she wanted, and if Jessie didn't give her everything she wanted she would run and tell her parents. It was so annoying and honestly I was beyond fed up with the crap very early on here. Every time she would show up I would just cringe. I think that this story had a lot of potential for being great. There is nothing hotter than an enemies to lovers story with some good passionate hate sex happening. But unfortunately this one didn't deliver like I had hoped for. I really enjoy Emma Hart's books for the most part, but this one was good when I thought it could have been so much more. Fans of the series will enjoy seeing familiar faces, and I loved seeing Aidan with Mila. Those were some of the highlights of this book, and I loved how great he was with her. I am interested in reading the next book, and I know that I will read more from Emma Hart in the future.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Inkslinger PR**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GMVYU5N0SKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQPE0#wasThisHelpful","R8GMVYU5N0SKK","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comLoving Lucas is the first book in the Lies & Leather series from Violetta Rand. This is my first book by her so I didn't really know what to expect. While there were things that I liked her, there was also a lot that I had issues with. I still have mixed feelings on this one, and i'm just not sure what to think.Stuck in an abusive relationship, Karlie Augustine's spirit as well as her body is broken. When things get bad one night, she finds help in the sexy cop Lucas Lafontaine. With nowhere to go and little to her name, Lucas offers her a place to stay in exchange for her help with the cleaning and cooking. The attraction between them is instant, and living together ignites the spark between them. But with Lucas trying to get custody of his young son and Karlie's ex not backing down, can Lucas and Karlie build anything together?I had moments that I really liked both Lucas and Karlie. Lucas was caring and protective, and super sexy. But there were also times that he came off as a a bit of a chauvinist and I didn't care for that at all. I understood that part of their deal was for Karlie to cook and clean in exchange for a place to live, but I also felt like there were some pretty offensive moments here. I was uncomfortable more than once and unfortunately those moments really detracted from all the good that was here as well. Karlie had moments were she was strong and sassy, and yet she was also vulnerable and beaten down because of what she had been through. But she made some really stupid decisions, and there were times I wanted to shake her. I was looking for more of that fire in her to come out and I didn't always see that.The one thing that I absolutely loved here was the heat and chemistry between these two! They were super steamy and I felt their attraction for each other instantly. I do think that the connection was a bit too instant to be truly believable for as strong as the author tried to make it. I believed they were definitely building something and the chemistry was there from the beginning, but I really thought that things progressed far too quickly for someone that had literally just ended a two year abusive relationship. There were times that Karlie struggled with things and that showed, but it was still rushed to me. Overall, I think that there was definite potential here and there were some great moments that I truly enjoyed. But I also felt like this one didn't completely deliver on what I was expecting and it was unfortunate since I really wanted to love Lucas and Karlie together.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21C0JELFI60YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5576W0#wasThisHelpful","R21C0JELFI60YT","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI'm not too big on anthologies because of the length of the stories. I really wanted to give this one a shot though after reading which authors were a part of this one though. I have to say that these felt even shorter than most stories in anthologies though since there were six here. I really loved the '90s concept though, as I am a huge fan of all things '90s. It was great to see some things here that I hadn't thought about in forever, and I really enjoyed seeing all the different music referenced here. I will admit that I definitely had to listen to some of them as I read these.My Strongest Weakness-Brighton WalshRating: 4 StarsMason is the typical All-American Jock and Tia is his exact opposite, the goth girl. Yet despite their differences, they find themselves drawn together in a way they aren't with anyone else. They live by a set of rules to keep others from finding out what is going on between them, but before long real feelings are starting to develop and Tia wants more. But is Mason willing to risk everything by letting others see how he really feels about her?I really liked this short story from Brighton Walsh. I always enjoy her books, and she proved to me what a talented writer she was here with this one being so quick of a read. I was really surprised with the amount of depth and feeling she was able to show here between Mason and Tia, and I really felt like these two were it for each other. They were really sexy together, and I liked seeing them get to know one another better too. My only complaint here is that even though this was really great for being so short, I would have loved more. This opposites attract story was romantic and emotional, and I enjoyed it a lot.Creep-Lorelie BrownRating: 1 StarRoni and Tom meet when Tom shows up at the shop where Roni works looking for his brother Corey. Roni knows Corey as her drug dealer Skittles, and is reluctant to give information to Tom. She is attracted to Tom though, and gives him some information on where he might run into Corey/Skittles. The attraction between Roni and Tom is instant, and she finds herself drawn to him.This one was flat out confusing, and it didn't really go anywhere or explain anything. It made no sense to me and ended right where the story seemed to start. I have no idea if this story is continued anywhere by Lorelie Brown, or if this is all there is. The whole thing with Roni and Tom didn't work for me, and I didn't feel like they had any connection at all. It was too instant, and honestly just seemed out of nowhere. The situation with Tom and Corey/Skittles was never briefly and partially explained, but it was never resolved. If this one hadn't been so short, I would have ended up not finishing. I also hated how casual the use of drugs was here, and the fact that pretty much everyone seemed to be okay with it. This one was a miss for me.The Belle vs. The BDOC-Amy Jo CousinsRating: 1 StarShelby wants Florence, but Florence is convinced that Shelby is straight. So Shelby sets out to make Florence notice her and finally realize that she is also a lesbian. But what starts out as Shelby putting together a team to beat Florence on trivia night quickly escalates, and soon Shelby and Florence are not only competing at trivia. But can Shelby show Florence that she wants more than to just beat her?This was one that I just couldn't connect with at all. I don't read a lot of F/F stories, but I don't have anything against them. For me though, I wasn't really feeling the connection between Florence and Shelby here. Florence was super judgmental, and flat out awful to Shelby at times. I didn't understand why Shelby would continue to want her after everything. I just didn't really care for the characters or the story here, and this was another case of it being just short enough that I was able to finish.Worthwhile-Audra NorthRating: 4 StarsJust as Jill begins a semester abroad, the boyfriend she traveled there for dumps her. Two weeks into her semester and she is ready to return home, but she stumbles into the arms of sexy Stuart. As Jill and Stuart get to know one another, sparks begin to fly and soon Jill is glad that she decided to stay. But is Jill ready to move on with Stuart, or is she still hung up on her recent ex?I really liked Jill and Stuart. They were great together, and Stuart was such a good guy. This story was short, but really sweet and I enjoyed it a lot. Stuart and Jill's connection was quick, but it felt very real and believable to me. I loved how cute they were together, and this was definitely one of my favorites of the entire anthology. I would have loved for these two to have been given a full story though, as I was really curious to see where things would go from here for them. I also found myself wishing that we had been given Stuart's POV, as I would have loved to have seen what was going on in his head.Smells Like Teen Spirit-Rebecca Grace AllenRating: 4 StarsRory is working a dead end job in the town where she graduated college. One night she meets James, a sexy singer about to graduate from the same college she went to. They instantly hit it off, but Rory is scared to allow herself to feel anything for him after all that she has been through with her parents. She has always felt lonely and abandoned, but James makes her want more. Can Rory and James have something together or will it be over before it ever really begins?I liked James and Rory. These two were super hot together, and the chemistry between them was explosive. I thought that they also had a great connection though, and I enjoyed seeing them get to know one another. Rory loved poetry and James loved music, and they seemed to always be able to relate to one another and discuss their passions. James and Rory's connection felt real to me, but it was a bit rushed. I did feel as though these two were meant for each other though, and I would have liked to have seen a bit more down the road for them after where things left off here.Little Red Thong-Jennifer BlackwoodRating: 4 StarsAs Emily, her brother Drew, her best friend and her brother's best friend Chase set out on a spring break cruise, they each set out to win a game of spring break bingo. There are several things that they must each accomplish in order to win, but with each of them being competitive they will do whatever it takes to win. Chase has always liked Emily, but he knows that he needs to stay away from her as the sister of his best friend. Emily finds herself drawn to Chase though, and is interested to see where things could go between them. But will Chase risk his friendship with Drew in order to see what he could finally have with Emily?I love stories about heroines falling for their brother's best friend, so I couldn't wait to read this one. It was really good, and I liked the characters a lot. I loved that Chase had grown up with Emily and Drew, so they had a lot of history together. That made this super short story about them seem real and believable to me in a way that it might not have been had they just met. Because they already had a connection, it didn't feel rushed. Chase and Emily were cute together and they had a lot of chemistry. My only complaint here is the same as most of the stories in this anthology, in that I wanted more. I would have loved to have seen what happened after the cruise was over and they returned to their lives at home. I didn't doubt that they could handle the distance, yet it would have been nice to see.OverallOverall, this was a good anthology and I really enjoyed four of the six stories here. I wish that those had been longer though, and that was my biggest complaint for them. There were two of the stories here that just didn't do it for me though, and I probably wouldn't have finished those if it wasn't for how short they were. I would still recommend this anthology for the other stories though, and I will definitely be checking out other works by those authors.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Xpresso Book Tours**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AWDL0X40FKPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0157E6688#wasThisHelpful","R3AWDL0X40FKPC","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comHow Forever Feels is book number four in the Friends First series from Laura Drewry. It is a standalone story with each book having interconnected characters. I hadn't read any of the other books in this series before starting, but I am definitely interested to go back and read them after this one. I enjoyed the characters a lot, and I loved the friendship that Maya had with the other girls here. I am looking forward to reading their books and seeing how they all got together with their guys.Maya McKay thought that she had found forever when she got married to Will, until she found him cheating on her. Though losing Will hurt her, it was the fact that she also lost the friendship of Jack Rhodes at the same time since he was like a brother to Will. Maya and Jack always had a connection, but since the divorce two years ago they hadn't spoken. So when Will comes back to town, Maya finds herself hoping to rekindle the friendship they once had. Jack always wanted Maya, but he stepped aside for Will. Now that it has been two years though, he finds his feelings for Maya rushing back and doesn't know how to handle them. Though Maya is no longer married, she is still his best friend's ex-wife. The more time they spend together, the more they both begin to realize that the connection they had is stronger than ever and things between them are far more than friendship. But can they ever be together with all that stands between them?I liked Maya a lot, and I really loved her friendship with the girls. They had each other's backs, and they weren't afraid to be honest with one another. They were all supportive and encouraging, and it was easy to see how far they would go for one another. I really liked how Maya and Jack connected right from the beginning as well. Though two years had gone by, it was as if no time had really passed. Things were easy between them, with their connection natural and real. But the circumstances around them were far from easy, and I really saw how hard it was for them to figure things out. There were times that I absolutely loved Jack. He really was perfect for Maya, and her knew her inside and out. He loved her for who she was and he was a really good guy that had been through a ton. My problem here though was the fact that the author made him come off as extremely weak. I don't think that all heroes need to be alpha males, but Jack was such a doormat here for Will and his family to walk all over. They might have been there for him and taken him in, but he gave up far too much far too easily when it came to them and it got to the point that enough was enough for me.Overall, I really enjoyed parts of this story and the connection between Jack and Maya. They had really great chemistry and a bond that was unlike any they had ever felt with anyone else. But I just couldn't ever really get over how disappointed I was with Jack's character here. Just when I thought things were finally turning around, he did something that really irritated me and it pretty much sealed his fate. He asked for way too much from Maya, and the fact that she gave in so easily was something that also made me lose respect for her as well. If I had been in the same situation, not only would I not have done what he asked of me, but I probably would have never spoken to him for even asking in the first place. It was beyond crazy and just too much considering the entire situation. I think that this one had the potential to be a really great story, and had it not been for Jack's weak nature I think I would have really loved this friends to lovers story. But unfortunately I was unable to really love this one and it ended up just being okay to me when it could have been so much more.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M4RAR2O8AQEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEFGTYY#wasThisHelpful","R3M4RAR2O8AQEE","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI absolutely love the Love in the City series from Steph Nuss! Each book is a great read on it's own, but the entire group of characters here are great and I love seeing them all as the series continues. Each book can be a standalone and are definitely enjoyable, but I would recommend reading them all in order if possible for the full experience. Cherished by You is the fourth book in the series and centers around Tessa and Justin. I have to admit I have been waiting for their story and I really think that theirs might be my favorite so far! There is something special about these two, and I just knew I was going to love their book from seeing them previously.Tessa Wilder has been in love with her friend Justin James since she has known him, but she hasn't been able to tell him how she feels. Each time she tries to subtly flirt with him, he doesn't seem to get it and she fears that if she tells him he will reject her. So she has stayed quiet so as not to ruin their friendship. But when her brother decides he wants to move out on his own, she offers to let him keep the apartment while she looks for something else. Not wanting Tessa to live in a bad area, Justin offers to let Tessa move into his spare room. The more time they spend together, the more they begin to grow closer and soon they are finally exploring the connection between them. But just as they are starting to build a relationship, one unexpected moment threatens everything.I loved Tessa and Justin so much. Tessa was strong and smart, and I loved how she took care of her brother. She did what she had to do for him, and I really admired her. She was a great role model for him, and she was just so easy to like. Justin was a bit different than most heroes you read about, and honestly I loved him for that! He had some quirks, being a bit of an introvert and on the OCD side. But he was also a really great guy, and he and Tessa were perfect for one another. These two just fit together, and I really loved how they brought out different sides of each other. There is nothing sexier than a guy who is a bit nerdy, but is able to dirty talk with the best of them in bed, and Justin was beyond fantastic at it. The chemistry between these two was smoking hot, and I loved that he was such an unexpected surprise for both Tessa and the reader.Overall, this was a great addition to the series and one that I really enjoyed. It is hard to pick a favorite here, but I really think that Cherished by You is it! I couldn't put it down and I loved Tessa and Justin. The only thing that kept this one from being a five star read for me was that I wish that Justin and Tessa had talked about their feelings a bit sooner. If it hadn't been for their friends, i'm not sure they would have ever started to see what they needed to do where the other was concerned. I wanted Tessa to tell Justin she had liked him for so long, and I wanted Justin to just make a move. These two were great though, and I am already looking forward to Paige's story next. I really liked how this one set it up for her, and I can't wait to see what is really going on with her. Steph Nuss is a great writer, and I highly recommend this series.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Southern Belle Promotions**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOM0YPLB2QR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161CEBGY#wasThisHelpful","R1EOM0YPLB2QR6","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comAgainst the Ropes is the second book in the First to Fight series from Jeanette Murray. Though this is about another couple than the first book, the characters are connected and the story seems to continue from the first. I would recommend reading these in order as I was a little confused when starting this one since I hadn't read the first book. There was a lot going on when this one started and there were a lot of characters to try to figure out right away, and it was a bit frustrating to begin with. Because of that this one was hard for me to get into, and I think I would have been much better off having read the first book, Below the Belt.Greg Higgs was a troubled teen that turned to boxing in order to channel his energy in a better way. That along with the Marines helped him to become a better man, and it was a natural fit for him. When he meets the new athlete liaison in charge of the PR for the boxers, he knows that she would fit him perfectly as well. But Reagan Robilard is fresh out of college and trying to figure out her new job, which is becoming more and more difficult as someone is out to get the fighters. With Greg's past coming to light, Reagan is determined to do whatever it takes to look out for him. But can Reagan and Greg figure out what is going on between them, while also dealing with everything surrounding the boxers?I will admit that while I liked these characters okay, I didn't really feel invested in them. They just weren't doing a lot for me, and I didn't feel much of anything at all. I wasn't super interested in them, and I felt like a lot of that was because there was so much more that could have been explored here. The author didn't really seem to delve deep enough for me to care about them, and I think that there was so much more potential when it came to both Greg and Reagan and their back-stories. There was chemistry between them and I really liked seeing them together. I wish there had been more there as well though, as there was much that could have been expanded upon and the sex scenes felt short and almost abbreviated.While this one had potential, it just seemed to fall short and I was wishing for me. Because of of those issues along with the fact that I felt like I had been dropped into the middle of a story here and was a bit confused, this one just wasn't holding my interest. I found myself bored and wanting to skim more than once. There were also a few times while reading that things seemed to sort of happen out of nowhere or that I felt like I had missed something, but then I would go back and see that I hadn't. It was disorienting and I wasn't sure exactly what was going on. Overall, this was one that I think could have been really good, but it just missed the mark. There is also something that affects both Greg and Reagan here that was unresolved, and I am assuming that it will be dealt with in the next installment of the series. Though I am curious to know what happens, I am not sure if I will read the next one after reading this book. If you have read Below the Belt and are a fan of Jeanette Murray's, you will probably enjoy this one. If you are new to the series though, I would recommend starting at the beginning so that you hopefully don't have all the same issues that I had here.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZO5U2T3AX8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI025VQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IZO5U2T3AX8E","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI have been super excited to read Dirty English by Ilsa Madden-Mills since the moment I first heard about it. I absolutely love the cover, and the blurb made this a must read for me. The story itself was really good as well, and I couldn't put it down. I loved Declan and Elizabeth, even if there were a few things here that I had some issues with. I did really like the story though, and I found myself overlooking some of the things that drove me nuts because I just couldn't get enough of these characters together.Elizabeth Bennett lives with a set of rules that she never breaks due to her painful past. She doesn't date and she has no interest in love. She has no problem with one night stands though, assuming that the guy isn't drinking and isn't super good looking or popular. But then she meets the sexy Brit fighter Declan Blay, also known as the best looking guy on campus and exactly what she should stay away from. With Declan being her new neighbor and them having class together, they find themselves getting to know one another and despite everything Elizabeth wants Declan. So when they end up spending one steamy night together, she is ready to end things even though she actually wants more. But Declan knows that the connection between them is so much more, and he is determined to show her that they belong together.I really loved Declan here, even though I did have some problems with him. He was sexy and protective, and I loved how he was always looking out for Elizabeth. He was a great guy with her and was supportive, caring and sweet. There were some times though that he came off as a bit weak though, and for all his support he would also have moments that he seemed to not be understanding at all. It was hard to look past those wishy washy moments, but I did really like him. Elizabeth was smart and sassy and I loved how she was able to be so upfront and open about what she wanted. She was pretty funny, and I loved her rambling whenever Declan was around. But she also had her moments where she was pretty bitchy as well, and I really didn't enjoy that. She had been through a lot and I understood her reluctance to trust because of that. However I didn't feel like that was an excuse for some of her actions here, and Declan wasn't giving her any reason to doubt him. The chemistry between these two was great and you could see just how much these two felt for one another. It was good to see that they were getting to know one another as well though, and I really felt like the connection they were building was very real and believable.I will say that besides the few issues I had with the characters, the other thing that really bothered me was the fact that there were so many outside influences that affected their relationship. There were so many other people that were constantly interfering and that got pretty old here. I thought it was a bit much how many people were in the middle of everything, and I didn't like that they were such a huge part of the story. Declan's crazy ex and the constant parade of women wanting him, plus Elizabeth's friends and ex were just a bit too much when you added that with her family and all her issues. There were a few times in this book that I also felt like things happened or were brought up and then just dropped that I wish had been delved into further. I wanted a bit more and I would have liked to have seen more of the focus here on Declan and Elizabeth rather than what was going on around them. This story to me was somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars, but I really think that without some of the extra drama going on it would have easily been a 5 star for me. One of the highlights here for me was Declan's twin brother Dax. I absolutely loved Dax, and he had such a great personality that I could not get enough of. He brought so much life to this story and he had me laughing throughout the entire book. I would love to get his story as I was able to see so much potential for more beneath the facade he put up. He was super funny and flirty, but you could tell that he was also a really great guy that could be super sweet and caring as well. Overall, I think that this was a good story and it is definitely worth the read. Declan is super sexy and impossible not to fall for, and I think that a lot of readers will love him just as much as I did.**Complimentary Copy Provided by TRSOR Promotions**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M8ZJ6MUC0814/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HBRORW#wasThisHelpful","R1M8ZJ6MUC0814","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI am already a huge fan of KL Grayson's, but after reading A Lover's Lament I am also a huge fan of BT Urruela's. The first time I heard about this book, I knew I had to read it. I was immediately drawn not only to the beautiful cover, but also to the fascinating blurb. This story was so good, and I loved all of it. It was beautiful and emotional, and while filled with hope also had it's heartbreaking moments. This was no easy journey, and I will warn readers that if you are sensitive to war or military content I would advise you to proceed with caution. But I absolutely believe that this book is worth the read, and would highly recommend it.Katie Devora's life changed in an instant with a tragedy she never expected. Now struggling to feel anything, her therapist suggests that she reach out to a soldier through a pen pal program in order to help her begin to heal. So when she found Devin Clay's name on the list of possible pen pals, she was shocked. Katie had loved Devin and planned on spending her life with him, until he left her without a goodbye. Trying to finally find peace and some closure, Katie sends him a letter, never expecting him to actually write back. But what started out as a way to heal quickly turns into a friendship that Katie and Devin both thought was gone forever. But with ten years between them and a ton of pain and grief, can they find their way back to what they once shared?I loved both Katie and Devin. I wanted to be so mad at Devin for what he had done to Katie, and yet I really did understand why he made the choices he did. It doesn't excuse everything, and he definitely could have done things differently. But it was clear that he had enough regret and pain on his own for what he had done. The one thing that was clear is that he never stopped loving Katie, just as she had never stopped loving him. Though they had each moved on with their lives, the connection that they shared was so strong that it had never gone away. Katie and Devin were both so strong in some areas, and yet they each had a vulnerability that the other was able to help. I loved seeing how supportive and loving they each were of each other, even with what had happened. The bond they shared was so real and intense, and their chemistry off the charts. These two were soul mates, and it was clear right from the start that they were made for each other.I will say that there were times that this book was a bit slow, and that is the only reason that this was a four star instead of a five star for me. The descriptions were great, and I really felt as though I was instantly invested and living right through everything with both Katie and Devin. But there were times that I think it went a bit too far, and that unfortunately made me want to start skimming a few times here. I thought that Urruela and Grayson's writing styles meshed extremely well here, and I loved the letters between Katie and Devin. I also really enjoyed the fact that they included a playlist, and I thought that it really added a lot to the story to listen to the music that they had chosen as I read each chapter. This story was beautiful, intense, and deeply emotional. I think that absolutely everyone can find something to relate to here, and I really believe that this is one of those books that will stay with the reader forever. I know that I won't forget Katie and Devin anytime soon, and I already can't wait to go back and read this one again. If you are new to KL Grayson's books, this is a great place to start as this one had everything I have come to know and love from her stories. Her collaborating with BT Urruela here though took this one to a whole other level, and I am honestly excited to see what else he writes in the future. I expected this to be a good book, but he really impressed me with his writing talent and I know that I will be looking forward to his books as well as Grayson's in the future. They make a great team, and here's to hoping that they decide to collaborate again in the future!**Complimentary Copy Provided by Inkslinger PR**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDN77KW0VWJ8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FVO6LS#wasThisHelpful","RDN77KW0VWJ8L","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comAll I Want is the newest installment to the Animal Magnetism series from Jill Shalvis. Though it is book seven in the series, each book is a standalone story containing interconnected characters. Each of these books is so much fun to read, and I always know that I am going to enjoy the story when Jill's name is on the cover. All I Want was no exception, and it was just as adorable as what I have come to know from Jill Shalvis.After the childhood she had, Zoe is happy to be settled in Sunshine Idaho. Being a pilot allows her to work and give flying lessons on the side to help pay the bills. But besides her work and family, Zoe is looking for something else and has been trying to find it with a series of blind dates. So when her brother asks her to allow his best friend to rent a room from her for a few weeks she agrees as long as he agrees to her house rules. But when Zoe meets Parker, things immediately spark between them and Zoe finds him getting under her skin. Zoe finds herself wanting something with Parker and though she knows she should stay away, she can't help but give in to her feelings. With Parker only in town for a few weeks though, will she end up with a broken heart?I liked Zoe and Parker together. They were really cute, and they had great chemistry. These two seemed to just get each other right away and their connection was natural. They were sweet and funny, and I loved how they couldn't help but fall for one another. I will say that I didn't really connect with them that well, but I did enjoy their story. Zoe was hard for me to relate to, and I thought that she had a few issues. Parker was the same though, which is part of what made them work well together. While I did like them, I just thought that each of them made some questionable choices here, and I didn't always like the way they acted.Overall, this was another great addition to the series and I did enjoy it. Fans of Shalvis will enjoy the humor here as well as the sweet and romantic emotional moments that always set her contemporary romance stories apart from others. I did think that this one was a bit predictable and there wasn't really anything new or different. But it was a solid story and I think a lot of readers will really like Zoe and Parker together. If you are a fan of Jill Shalvis you will definitely want to check this one out, and if you are new to her books this is a great place to start. The Animal Magnetism series is one of my favorites, and are well worth the read.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUYRNR51TZUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026L0#wasThisHelpful","R3UUYRNR51TZUL","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comWhat Lola Wants is the first novella in the Leave Your Shoes On series from Calista Fox. It is a standalone story, and features best friends Lola Vonn and Alex Reed. Alex and Lola have always been friends, and have never crossed the line into more. Alex is a bit on the OCD side, and prefers his world to be neat and orderly. Lola is a bit on the wild side, preferring to live life to the fullest and force her nerdy best friend out of his comfort zone when possible. But when she goes to stay with him while waiting for her new apartment to be ready, she quickly realizes that he isn't the same as he once was and she finds that she is attracted to him in a way she hasn't ever been before. Alex has wanted Lola since they were teenagers, but he knew she was out of his league. So when she makes a move and offers to take their friendship to the next level, he easily says yes. But can he convince Lola that he is the man for her beyond just friends with benefits?I really liked these two. They were such opposites, and yet their connection was clear. Friends for years, they already had such a solid bond. I loved seeing Alex and Lola take things beyond just friendship though, and the chemistry between them was so strong! These two were super hot together, and the passion between them was explosive. It was so hard to imagine that nothing had ever happened before because the sparks between them were flying like crazy! Alex and Lola were perfect together, and I really liked how fun and sexy they were.Overall, this was a really enjoyable story. It was on the predictable side, and there really wasn't anything new or super unique here. But there was a really steamy and cute friends to lovers romance that I had a great time reading. What Lola Wants was fast paced and I read it in one sitting because I couldn't get enough of the intensity and passion between Alex and Lola. I am looking forward to reading more from Calista Fox in this series, and I am already excited to see what she has in store for Lola's friend Maxi in the next book.

"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comMs. Manwhore is the short and sexy conclusion to the Manwhore series from Katy Evans. This novella picks up after the first two books in the series and needs to be read in order. Saint and Rachel are finally together and things between them couldn't be better. So when Saint pops the question Rachel immediately says yes. But can one woman be enough for Saint forever? Or will he forever be a manwhore?This novella was really sweet and I have loved Saint and Rachel from the beginning. I enjoyed seeing them begin the next chapter of their life and seeing them as they planned their wedding. These two are absolutely perfect for one another, and that was never more clear than here. They continued to have the explosive chemistry that they have had from the beginning, but they also have a tenderness to them as well. These two were so great together, and the love between them is so special.I will say that this one was a bit choppy feeling to me though, and it didn't have the same feel as the other books in the series. For some reason it just seemed to be disjointed and didn't flow as well as Katy's books usually do. It almost felt like cut scenes from a movie rather than a well flowing story. I did like that we got this ending for them and that we were able to see how far they have come. But I felt like this one could have been pieced together better than it was, and unfortunately I didn't think that it was what I was expecting here. I found myself wishing that this had been more of a story rather than what felt like a few scenes spliced together with glimpses of some of my favorite characters. I love Katy Evans and her books though, and I know I will read more from her in the future.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTUOC5STX54V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X4113H6#wasThisHelpful","R3UTUOC5STX54V","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comBella Andre and Melissa Foster are pretty much the queens of contemporary romance. I absolutely love their solo books, and the Love on Rockwell Island from both of them is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Cape Cod Promises is the second in the series, but it can be read as a standalone with interconnected characters. If you haven't read Cape Cod Kisses yet, I would highly recommend it even though it isn't necessary to understand Cape Cod Promises.Trent Rockwell appears to have everything. He is a successful lawyer and has a large and loving family, but the one thing missing is having a woman he loves to share his life with. After the failure of his marriage to Reese Nicholson, he tried to move on but has never been able to forget her. After moving back to Cape Cod Bay to help run the family's resort, he runs into Reese again after years apart. Though things might have ended between them years before, their feelings for one another never went away. Now after running into one another again, they find themselves unable to deny the connection they still feel to one another. Can they put the past behind them though and give a future together another shot?I really loved these two. It was so clear to me how much these two really cared about one another and the fact that they had never stopped. But I loved seeing them fall for one another all over again. These two had both been through so much apart, and even though they still had a connection it was really about them getting to know one another again. These two both were partially to blame for their marriage falling apart the first time, so it was good to see them communicating better here and doing things differently. Reese and Trent had so much chemistry and you could see that the attraction between them was just as strong as it was when they had first met. But their connection just continued to strengthen here, and I really thought that they were even more perfect for one another after everything that had happened.Overall, this was a great contemporary romance and I am really loving this series. Bella Andre and Melissa Foster are great writers as individuals, but when you put them together it is something really special. I love that their collaborations are so seamless and flow so well. This series is one that I really love, and I think that so many people can relate to the stories and characters here. The one thing that I love the most about these books is that they have everything that I look for in a great romance. They are sweet and sexy, with enough emotion and depth to keep me invested from the first page to the last. I honestly cannot wait to read more from these two and I am looking forward to the next book in this series.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Tasty Book Tours**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BHD8S5QH73LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TD9LTS#wasThisHelpful","R1BHD8S5QH73LJ","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comHold Me Until Morning is the second book in the Grayson Brothers series by Christina Philips. Each book can be read as a standalone story though, so don't worry if you haven't read the first one. This was my first book by Christina Phillips and there was a lot to enjoy here. It was short and sexy, and had its really sweet moments too. I liked this book and Christina Phillips is a really great writer. I would read more from her again after reading this one.When Cooper Grayson's best friend Scott asks him to look after his little sister for a week, he just knows that it is going to be a pain. Paris O'Connell is used to only the fine things in life, after being a famous soap star for the last several years. But when Paris arrives at the remote mountain cabin, he is surprised to find that Paris isn't what he had been expecting at all. Neither of them are like the person they remember growing up around, and the attraction between them is instant. But Cooper finds himself struggling with his feelings since she is Scott's little sister. The more time they spend together though, the closer they become and soon they can't fight what is between them. But when they are forced to face the real world, will they lose everything that they are building?I liked Cooper and Paris. I thought that they had great chemistry, and I loved that they had some history between them. They had grown up around one another, and knew each other before Paris was famous. Paris was far from the typical Hollywood starlet, and I really liked that she had a mind of her own. She had her own wants and wasn't what people thought she was. I did think that she had let her mother push her around for far too long, but I was glad that she was able to think for herself. She had issues from her past that she was able to overcome and I really admired that. Cooper was really great for her as well, and I liked that he was supportive of her. He treated her like she was normal right from the start here, and that was something that not many people did. He was able to see beneath the facade and really cared about her and what she wanted.I will say that I thought that while the first half was great, the second half lost me a bit. I didn't care for her mother and how much she had to do with Paris and her life. I also was really loving the tension and build-up between Cooper and Paris, and it seemed to get a bit lost in the second half as it felt like they just jumped ahead a few steps. Things were suddenly more serious and it didn't feel as natural or smooth as I would have liked. While I liked the chemistry between them, I didn't really feel as invested in their relationship as I would have liked. The first half of the book was really enjoyable, but the second half sort of fizzled out and fell flat. I will still read more from Christina Phillips in the future, this one just had a lot of promise that I felt didn't quite deliver in the end.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NOEYAWBV2ET3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P2ETBU#wasThisHelpful","R3NOEYAWBV2ET3","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comPaper Thin is my first book by Jennifer Snyder. I was really intrigued by the blurb of this one, and I thought that I knew what I was in for. That wasn't the case here at all though, and this wasn't anything like what I had been expecting. Paper Thin was beautifully written, and I think that Jennifer Snyder is definitely talented. That being said though, this story was not for me. I want to warn potential readers here that this is not a traditional HEA or what I would even consider a romance. This story is fiction and deals with some difficult topics and how we handle life's curve balls.Charlotte Montgomery and Fate are not friends. At every turn, Fate seems to mock her. Every time that she thinks things are about to go her way, she quickly finds that she has been fooled once again. So when her sister informs her that she is engaged and asks her to finally return home, Charlotte is reluctant to go. Curious to see who her sister has found, Charlotte heads home and thinks that Fate may have finally given her something. But Charlotte soon figures out that Fate once again has different plans for her.I really felt for Charlotte here. She didn't always make choices that I agreed with, and she did have her moments that frustrated me. But I felt like she was always getting such a raw deal. She wasn't a bad person and yet she seemed to have such terrible karma. At the beginning of this book, I really thought that things were finally turning around for her only for her to be slapped in the face. I hated how things went, and even though the situation was very complicated, I was really hoping that things would finally go her way. This book was really about Charlotte dealing with tragedy and difficult things in life, and I really think that she grew as a person. But that wasn't the story I was expecting here, and unfortunately this entire book was a bit of a downer for me. It was tough to get through parts of this story, and I just didn't want to even finish it at times knowing that it wasn't going to end how I had hoped.Overall, this wasn't a bad book but I think I went into it expecting something completely different and that changed the entire experience for me. I think if I had known this was more of a journey to self discovery and growth/healing that I would have been better off. But I was expecting this to be a romance at the heart of it, and that wasn't the case at all. One thing that is for certain though is that this one was emotional and heartbreaking at times, and I would warn readers to make sure they have tissues on hand before reading this one. Jennifer Snyder is a great writer, and I am sure that I will read more from her in the future. I will prepare myself ahead of time that her stories aren't always traditional HEAs though before starting, and I think that is something that will definitely change my mindset about what I am reading.**Compilmentary Copy Provided by Good Choice Reading**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRWQTEJSVKEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015L98SXU#wasThisHelpful","RPRWQTEJSVKEI","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comDesperate Chances is not my first book from A. Meredith Walters, but it is the first I have read from her Bad Rep Series. Each book is a standalone story about one couple, but they do have interconnected characters. I really liked this book, and after reading I cannot wait to go back and read the previous ones from this series! I loved all these characters, and I am looking forward to seeing how everything started here.Mitch Abrams has been in love with Gracie Cook for years. He always tried to get her to see him as more than a friend, but Gracie did everything she could to keep him at arm's length until one night changed everything. After sleeping together, Gracie and Mitch quickly found out that sex changes everything. While Mitch thought it was the start of his dreams coming true, Gracie let her fears and insecurities scare her into running away destroying the friendship that they had. With no choice left, Mitch moves on and gets a girlfriend that is the opposite of Gracie, while Gracie begins to put her life back together and finally faces the issues that have been plaguing her. But with Mitch's band returning home and them sharing the same group of friends, Gracie and Mitch are once again thrown together and forced to face all that went wrong between them. Can Gracie finally let go and give Mitch a shot, or will things be over once and for all.My heart really went out to both Mitch and Gracie. These two had such a strong connection and they were so great as friends. There was also an attraction there that while Mitch embraced it, Gracie lied to herself about. But I felt so badly for both of them. Mitch had been hurt so many times by Gracie, and yet he also knew that he loved her and wouldn't trade that for anything. No matter how many times he tried and was rejected, he knew deep down that she was it for him. Gracie had a ton of baggage that kept her from really being able to see what it was that she wanted and needed. She had a ton of work to do on herself, and I really felt like she was growing and healing over the entire course of this book. It was terrible that it took so much to wake her up, but it was also really great to see her overcome so much. These two were meant to be together, and I really loved how deep and intense their connection was.Overall, this was an emotional story and I could not put it down. I started with the intention of just reading a few chapters, and the next thing I knew it was a few hours past my bedtime and I had finished the entire thing! This one was angsty and heart-wrenching at times, but it was also filled with love and friendship. I couldn't get enough of Gracie and Mitch, and I just knew that they had to find a way to be together. I loved the rest of the characters here too, and I am looking forward to reading the previous books to get to know the rest of the band and their girls! I would highly recommend this book if you are a fan of friends to lovers stories and if you like sexy rockstars. Mitch and Gracie were steamy and sweet, and I know that I will be reading their story again in the future! A.

"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comUntil Jax is said to be the first book in the Until Him series from Aurora Rose Reynolds. While this one is supposed to be a standalone, I would recommend reading the first book in the Until Her series (Until July) before reading this one. I am not sure exactly what the deal is here since the characters are all interconnected and Until Jax picks up right after the end of Until July. It was a bit confusing since they are technically shown to be from a different series. Until Jax and Until July are both spin-offs of the Until series, and feature the children of those characters. These books can be read without having read the Until series, but I would still recommend reading Until July before starting Until Jax.Ellie Anthony wasn't looking for a relationship, but when she meets Jax Mayson everything changes. Jax knows from the moment that he meets Ellie that he will do whatever it takes to protect her and her daughter Hope. Ellie knows that the feelings she is developing for Jax are happening really fast, and she has more than just herself to think about. However Jax is determined to show her that he loves her and Hope and wants them to be his family forever. But Ellie and Jax both have things from their pasts that they will have to face in order to find a way to be together.I really loved Jax and Ellie here. It was so clear that these two had a connection right away. But I loved that Hope was also such a huge part of that. Jax was sweet and protective, and seeing him with his girls was absolutely adorable. Hope had him wrapped around her finger, and they were so cute together. Ellie was great with him as well, and I really loved their chemistry. Ellie was so strong and the fact that she took care of Hope at such a young age was so admirable. She always put her little girl first, and I loved that they had such a great bond. Seeing that they had a similar relationship to the one that Jax had with his mom, it really made it that much sweeter. Family is what we choose to make it, and it just goes to show that love is what means family, not always blood.The one thing that is common with these books from Aurora Rose Reynolds is the fact that they each center around insta-love, or what she calls the BOOM. Since that is known beforehand, I never let it bother me. But if that is something that drives you crazy, just be aware of that before starting. The connections all feel so real and natural though that I don't even really notice it. The other thing I will say here though is that I would keep in mind the issue about this one being a standalone. You can read this one as a standalone if you are willing to stick with the story, as things are eventually explained. But the beginning is very confusing if you haven't read Until July, and it definitely feels like you are being thrown into the middle of a story already in progress. That is why I really recommend reading that book before this one. I had read Until July before reading Until Jax, and even I had to go back and read the last bit of Until July to refresh myself on the situation as it had been so long and I couldn't remember what had happened. I was confused and felt like I had missed a few chapters of the story here, but once I read the end of Until July it all came back to me. I think that these books are good stories and are definitely worth the read though. I will definitely read more from Aurora Rose Reynolds in the future, and I am really looking forward to getting more of the secondary characters and the stories that were set up here, especially Sage and Kim's.**Complimentary Copy Provided by TRSOR Promotions**","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJMR9GYGJ4C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517382025#wasThisHelpful","R3CJMR9GYGJ4C2","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comBeyond What Is Given is the third standalone story in the Flight & Glory Series from Rebecca Yarros. Though the characters are interconnected, you can read these out of order with no problems though there will be some spoilers from the previous books if you choose to do that. I really love this series, and I couldn't wait to read more from Rebecca Yarros. That being said, this wasn't my favorite of the series.Grayson Masters is focused on graduating flight school and getting the assignment he needs. He doesn't need any distractions, and has kept himself closed off from anyone but his family for a reason. But when Samantha Fitzgerald moves in with him and his roommates, the instant connection between them threatens everything. Sam wasn't looking for anything either, having just left her own horrible situation behind. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the quicker they realize that it is impossible. Soon they are falling for one another, and neither of them knows what to do about it.I really liked Sam and Grayson at the beginning of this book. I loved the chemistry that was so apparent right from the start. They were attracted to one another, and though they got off on the wrong foot I really enjoyed seeing them interact with one another. As they began to feel more for one another I really thought that I was going to love their story. But then all their secrets started getting in the way of things, and unfortunately that was what really started to lose me. I understood some of where Gray was coming from and why he was so stuck on doing things according to the plan. But I also really hated how dead set he was on sticking to those, even knowing everything that he was doing to Sam because of them. He was hurting her by focusing so much on his past and a future that he was basically guilted into keeping, and I really wanted him to fight for Sam. I felt like he didn't really seem to do that until the very end, and it was frustrating. Same with Sam. She was beyond patient and accepting of the situation, but when given the chance for them to take a stand she chose to back off. I wanted her to claim Grayson and face everything together, but she seemed to just give in. It made it hard to really connect with these two, given that they seemed to just give up so easily.The Grace situation got old here for me, and quite frankly I lost a lot of interest because of it. It seemed to take over the story and was more about her than it was about Grayson and Sam. I absolutely hated Parker and Grayson's dad, and I hated the fact that Grayson continued to allow them to have such a strong impact on his life. He might have had words with them at times, but he never really seemed to do much about it, and I hated that he allowed them to get away with so much. While I admired Grayson's loyalty to them and Grace, I wanted to see that same loyalty to Sam. The fact that he knew what they had was everything and more than anything he had felt before yet he still didn't stop all the crap really just made me angry and caused me to lose a lot of respect for Grayson. The pacing here was also very slow and made this book feel far too long. I was getting bored and waiting for something to happen, yet we just kept going around in circles as the situation continued to go unresolved. Though I did like the epilogue and ending of this story, I really felt like there was just too much that had already happened to move past and be fully satisfied with the story. I liked Grayson and Sam together, but I hated the way things went for them and how much it took for Grayson to finally come around. I will read more from Rebecca Yarros in the future as I have really enjoyed the previous books in the series. This one was just frustrating and not what I had been expecting or hoping for.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHLYUBJU95MB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P2ERCG#wasThisHelpful","RTHLYUBJU95MB","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comThe Finn Factor is my first Rachel Bailey book. I really love NA books and the friends to lovers trope though, so after reading the blurb for this one I had to read it. I have to say that while this one had some really enjoyable moments, it was also not what I expected at all. I wouldn't say that the blurb is misleading, yet it definitely didn't really touch on what all was going on here. I thought that this book had a lot going on, and none of that had been mentioned in the blurb.When Scarlett begins to notice that her dry spell is going on much longer than she has ever experienced before, she decides that it all leads back to her kissing abilities. Thinking that she must need some help in that department, she tells her roomie and best friend Finn that she is going to find a guy to help her. Though they have always been platonic, Finn can't stand the idea of her turning to anyone else and offers to give her a few lessons himself. But once they cross that line, their friendship is forever changed and soon they are both beginning to think about each other differently. Not wanting to destroy their friendship, they agree to not kiss each other again. The more they try to stay away though, the more they find themselves wanting it to happen again though. But can they take the risk of possibly having a relationship together when it means that they could also lose everything?I think part of my issue here was that I didn't connect with these characters at all. Finn seemed to be off in his own world and almost completely aloof to everything going on. Except when it came to Scarlett dating anyone else, in which he would constantly sabotage them since he felt that they were never good enough. He wanted Scarlett to be happy, yet he never really gave her that chance. He also was hugely against dating her, yet he would then become very protective and possessive. Scarlett was a bit childish for me at times, then at other times she was made out to be wise and smart and almost motherly. Because of Finn's parents dying when he and his sisters were young, he was forced to step into that role and relied on Scarlett's help a lot of the time. The whole thing didn't really seem to fit though, and just never really rang true for me. It was so weird that he would be okay with both of his sisters just dropping out of school to return home while he was trying to finish his PhD after everything that they had all been through. Him and Scarlett basically went from being friends and roomies to a ready made family and full house, all while trying to figure out their feelings for one another. It just seemed like too much going on, and the focus seemed to be more on them interacting with all the family members rather than themselves.The other big issue I had was that they seemed to get over the whole risking the friendship thing relatively easy, but then suddenly the future was a huge issue for them. It was years away and hadn't ever even been thought of before. Rather than just focusing on becoming a couple and making that transition, things got way complicated super quickly and instead of discussing things rationally they both just seemed to give up. I just didn't really get it, and the whole book and relationship just seemed a bit forced. I also didn't understand the teddy bear thing at all, and didn't really get the significance of why she did that for Finn. I just thought it was weird that Scarlett painted them for him, and weird that he had them all hanging in his room. If I ever entered into some twenty-something guy's room to a ton of pictures of teddy bears, I am pretty sure that I would immediately turn around and run away. I get that he kept them because she made them for him, but the whole thing was just odd to me. There were some really heartwarming moments here, and I do think that these two had a great friendship. But overall I never really saw a romantic relationship develop other than a few steamy kisses that seemed to immediately make them view each other differently. I felt like it was told rather than shown, and I wanted to actually see it. This one wasn't what I was hoping for, and ended up falling flat for me.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Publisher**","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPS9UY4TWM8HZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140NXXAG#wasThisHelpful","RPS9UY4TWM8HZ","A1HAX9F7HY0D5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HAX9F7HY0D5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was really excited about this nursing bra. It is a low price bra and its actually a cute nursing bra. Dont get me wrong, Baby doesnt care what the milk is wrapped up in, but sometimes Mommy likes to feel like more than a milking cow.I love the look of this bra. It has a very Bettie Page look to it. Unfortunately, even in the XL I looked more like Betty Boop! The deep V was very, very deep. I thought maybe I could compensate for bust size by ordering a size up, but I guess I needed a little too much compensation. I dont think this was the fault of the bra  but just be aware when ordering that these are made for those little A/B/C cups.This nursing bra is different from most nursing bras. It does not have clips on the shoulder area that allow the cup to unsnap and fold down for easy access. The idea with these is that the deep V and the spandex material with easily allow you to pull your breast directly out of the cup. This works fine for me. I actually prefer it to the cup hooks, as I tend to pop them unhooked without meaning to.If your utters can still be contained in a C/D cup, this is a cute option.Customer Review of Free Product","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34V9L6R32GL1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ062AK#wasThisHelpful","R34V9L6R32GL1Q","A2RX62V4E2BF5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX62V4E2BF5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are small tasting squares that range from very light milk to fairly dark chocolate. My jar contained 30 of each of the Dark, Bittersweet and Semisweet and 31 Milk. Because I ordered them in November, they arrived safely and in good condition. There are only about 3 months out of the year when I would attempt to have such expensive chocolate shipped to my home.These are definitely better than your standard Hershey bar. (Scharffen Bergen is a subsidiary of The Hershey Company.) Still, I think you can get better for the price.At the current price point (in the $50 range), assuming a generous cost for the glass container, you are paying about 35 cents per square. I think that is probably a pretty generous cost. Dont get me wrong  its good chocolate. The presentation is lovely and the squares are the perfect size for a little snack or to taste with wine or even as a prequel to a meal.As an amusing side note, I had a couple of these on the coffee table. My three year old daughter found and opened one. It happened to be the Dark. It may be the first piece of chocolate that she didnt finish. My husband found the chocolate square on the coffee table.

"Ive recently started cooking more, which for me pretty much means at all. The current trend in cooking details weights for measurements instead of volume. This scale is great. You can easily change measurements from pounds, ounces and grams. The scale automatically tares when you turn it on, so if you have a paper container on it, you dont have to do the math. The scale takes AAA batteries, which is great because you dont have to worry about keeping less standard batteries in stock. This scale is small and doesnt take a large footprint in your kitchen.

"This is a nice basic wine set. The aerator and pump come in a nice presentation box. The foil cutter seems a little out of place and like it was just tossed into the box. I am glad it was tossed into the box. It is a great foil cutter. It is serrated and has good coverage. I like it much better than the current trend of cutters that use just four small points. The vacuum pump preserver is very interesting. I like that it is a manual pump and doesnt need batteries. While the vacuum seal is not likely to be as strong as the larger air-pressure sealers, this one is small and compact and not a burden to your storage space. The spout pour aerator is nice. It makes pouring easy and will quickly aerate your wine. How well these work is really a matter of personal preference. I would suggest trying a small sample of each wine with and without aeration. I often find that aeration takes too much of the edge off.

"So this is an interesting product. It is probably about half the price of a full sized oil diffuser. I have to admit that I find this one kind of strange. It has a tubular filter with a spring on the end. The diffuser comes with a replacement filter, but I wish it came with a replacement spring. So here is a warning  be careful when to take the top off. Day 1, I must have pulled it off a bit crooked because the spring and the filter went flying. The filter didnt go far but the spring went towards a pile of boxes in the corner of my cubicle. Since I doubt the housekeeping service will notice the spring IF they find it, I can pretty much assume that its gone. And for the record, the diffuser does not seem to work without the spring. Also, there is nothing on the instructions, at least in English, as to when you should switch out the filter. Is it for different scents? Should I swap it out and let it dry? Or is the extra for when the original becomes noticeably worn?The diffuser is be attached directly to a USB outlet, which I first though was a little strange but if you have USB outlet switches, you can actually plug it directly to the wall like an air freshener. The extender cable is kind of cool and allows you to put a little more distance between the diffuser and your electronics. Water and electronics dont really mix, so a water product that goes into your USB is a strange idea. While I would not call this spill-proof, it is spill resistant. If it gets knocked over and you right it quickly, you will probably only have a small drop or two of water on your desk.As for how it works, I guess as well as one would expect for the size and the price. I would have thought I would get a stronger scent considering the 3 drops of oil it suggests using for such a small amount of water. I guess all of the scent is trapped in that filter.Even if this one still worked after the spring sprung, I would continue to use my full sized diffuser.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKP2IY46TV9Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CLCBUC#wasThisHelpful","RKP2IY46TV9Y7","A2RX62V4E2BF5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX62V4E2BF5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some definite pros and cons about this case.I love the kickstand feature! It is really nice to be able to prop the phone up, especially when Im using my phone to read a recipe while cooking or if Im letting the kids watch a video. The kickstand, however, seems kind of flimsy and I wont be surprised if it doesnt last the life of the phone. Fortunately, if it does break, it wont have a negative effect on the overall case other than aesthetically.My phone was able to get a full charge from about 20%. Once I ran back down to 20%, I was able to get up to about 50%. So, you should be able to count on a full charge from dead, but not much else. This case is smaller than my previous battery case, so Im willing to deal with less charge.The only real negative about this case is the volume/mute buttons are hard to get to. You actually have to use your fingernail for both. I dont mind so much, but it was a deal breaker for my husband.One BIG improvement from my previous battery case is that this one does not need an extender of any kindAs for the color, it isnt what most people think of when you say blue. It is a very grey/blue.EDIT: After having this case on my phone for less than a week, my phone fell out of my pocket and case came apart. Boom. Slam. Thwack. My screen is cracked and the corner of my phone is so badly damaged that the screen wont even turn on. While I know its not the greatest protection, I expected more than this.

"At just under $12, this is perfect for my daughter. I wanted to get her a locket that she could wear to school to help with her separation anxiety, and this one will do nicely. The picture inside is a little larger than a nickel, and the locket is clear on both sides so you can put two pictures in. It also has a good bit of depth to it, so if you wished you could put a lock of hair or if you wanted to put a picture on only one side, or no picture at all, you could put small beads or whatever you choose for an interesting fashion alternative. The locket closes with a magnet which is pretty neat and makes opening and closing easy, although it also makes it less secure so I wouldnt put anything of real value inside the locket.I dont consider this nice jewelry and this is probably something I wouldnt have worn past my college years but for an inexpensive piece of costume jewelry, this is great and I have to admit that it was much nicer than I thought it would be when I received it.Customer Review of Discounted Product","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9MBIV87WF0UA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014D0JGRU#wasThisHelpful","R9MBIV87WF0UA","A2RX62V4E2BF5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX62V4E2BF5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, do not underestimate how large this thing is. I had ready reviews and people warned of its size, but still I have to admit that I was shocked when I got home and saw the huge box at my doorstep. This has a very large footprint. You are not going to be able to slip in into a nook or cranny and forget about it until you need it. If you do not have a dedicated laundry room or a walk in closet (with an outlet) you should think long and hard about location, location, location before you order this.Second, if you think this is going to eliminate the need to ever iron or dry clean your clothes, you are mistaken. I think this is the idea my husband had when he convinced me to order this. The SWASH does not clean your clothes and while it will improve the look of a wrinkled shirt, it is far from leaving it looking freshly pressed or dry cleaned.From what I have experienced, the SWASH pods are basically perfumed water. The SWASH steams your clothes then dries your clothes. The wrinkles are removed based on how tightly you are able to stretch the shirt in the machine. My husband is a tall guy and wears generally wears XL, depending on the style. If you wear smaller shirts, you may have more luck getting a smoother, pressed look.You dont put dirty clothes in the SWASH. You can put worn clothes in, and it will refresh them the same way your clothes get refreshed by hanging them in the bathroom while you take a hot shower. The SWASH will take a really wrinkled shirt and make it presentable if you are not too picky, and it will take a somewhat wrinkled shirt and make it a little better. I will basically get a shirt about as wrinkle-free as a hand steamer, but with a lot less effort. I found it pretty easy to use. The shirt clips in easily, although I think more clips would have been better. There is also a piece that you stick in the pocket to make sure your pocket is crisp. I wish they would have come up with something similar for the collar.The jury is still out on whether we will be using this machine in three months or in a year. Our biggest problem right now is finding a convenient place for it, because it certainly wont fit in my laundry closet. While I guess it is possible that it will have a long-term place in my house, I somehow doubt it. Either way, I wont be throwing out the ironing board..See the before and after pictures below","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZQ6J34BPRSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SP2K370#wasThisHelpful","R1NZQ6J34BPRSL","A2RX62V4E2BF5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX62V4E2BF5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband and I always kind of laughed about the Luvs commercials, the ones that talk about how Luvs is the number one brand of diapers amongst second time mothers. The running joke is that you dont really care about the second one as much, so you trend towards cheaper diapers. I generally buy Pampers as my first choice, then Huggies if I can find a good deal. The Luvs diapers work and my son seems comfortable enough in them.There are two main reasons for the price difference as far as I can tell. The first is licensing. Pampers have Sesame Street characters and Huggies have Disney characters. Luvs has characters that I dont recognize, so I can only assume they were created by Luvs. This has to be cheaper than paying for Mickey Mouse & Big Bird to grace your diapers. For me, the characters on the diaper make zero difference. My kids do not care and I do not care. Changing a diaper is not made any easier because they like the character on the diaper. Second, the Luvs are definitely thinner than Pampers. This does translate to less absorbency. Ever diaper, no matter how expensive, will at some point have blowouts or leaks. You may get them marginally more with Luvs than with Pampers or Huggies, but depending on your child some might not even notice it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIW3Q1QTE79SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSM7M1E#wasThisHelpful","RIW3Q1QTE79SY","A2RX62V4E2BF5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX62V4E2BF5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a pimply adolescent, I certainly thought at this point in my life, my skin woes would be behind me. While I do not break out the way I did in my teen years, I do have a few problem spots where my skin is far from flawless. Even before I was a mother of two with a full time job, I never was able to keep up with a solid skin care regimen. I pretty much use a moisturizer in the morning, and that is about it. I was excited to try the Proactiv+ moisturizer, hoping that it would help with the problem areas of my complexion. Ive been using it for about 10 days now and Im really on the fence. My skin was not looking so good, but I thought maybe it was a calm before the storm kind of thing, because the celebrities who push this stuff seem so happy with it, and why would Santana lie to me? I struggled through a few days of pretty bad break-outs before I couldnt take it anymore. It was the kind of pimples that HURT, the ones you can feel under the skin wanting to burst out. I used some prescription gel that didnt previously work well for me, and the improvement was almost immediate. After two days, the spots started to dry and the pressure was almost gone.So, while the Proactiv+ itself didnt work, mixed with a previous product that also didnt work, Im getting decent results.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OHSEWXQX6XNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZH05VUM#wasThisHelpful","R1OHSEWXQX6XNL","A2RX62V4E2BF5Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RX62V4E2BF5Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Typos noted.I read up to 66% for the specific purpose of making sure of what I thought in Chapter 3 was right before shooting my mouth off. Well, at 66% read, I know I am right. I do feel bad saying this, because in the over 3 years I have been doing reviews on Amazon, this is my first time to hit this problem.Well over 15 years ago there was either a book or movie with pretty much the same plot. I would lean more to a movie on TV than a book as I was not doing much reading back then. I don't remember if it involved Washington and the papers the Uncle left or not because it was so long ago. For everything else in this story I was able to predict pretty much what would happen. It even had the girl helping Parker because he got shot in the shoulder. In fact, now that I write this it was definitely a movie on TV. I remember seeing the girl tending to his wound.Now, I don't have the movie available to me, especially since I can't remember the name, but it is the same plot, so I can't rate it more than 2 stars.I would recommend it for ages 18 on up though as the plot is a good one.

There are a few sex scenes in the story for those who don't like that. They are not that bad though. I don't remember any cuss words.It is well written, well explained, and grabs you from start to finish. Now I usually let my Kindle read to me as I craft.

Mike also happens to be a popular NFL running back. On T.V. Mike seems charming and good-natured, so Natalie figures getting permission will be a breeze. When she meets him, she is totally not prepared for the arrogant and adamantly opposed man she meets. She is also not prepared for the spine tingling feelings she gets when he just looks at her.

"This book is great. There is one mild almost sex scene but Paula stops it before it starts. I think there are a couple. Spanish cuss words.The story is well written, well explained, and grabs your attention from page one to the finish. There are some twists and turns in the story so that you will not know the murderer until the very end. YEs this is a work of fiction, but I see this story as being written with real life people in mind.Characters:Paula Holliday:I see Paula (our main character) as being a mildly less refined Mrs. Fletcher of ""Murder She Wrote"". I like Paula better though. I see Paula as more real, and of course she is younger so she is easier to relate to.The Sheriff:I see him in the same light as the Sheriff on ""Murder She Wrote"" That Sheriff also seemed to show up when he was needed, like the one in this story.Paula was a media exec who traded her office clothes for garden clogs when she made the move from the big city to the suburbs to start a gardening business. Paula is fairly well versed in gardening and can handle most anything as a result. What she is not prepared for is finding a mummified body as she restores the gardens at Halcyon, a local landmark. Snooping round turns serious when a garden tool impales a body and one of Paula's friends is arrested.As Paula and her friends dig for the truth they find more dirty business the town has kept secret for years.I found this book to be a delightful cozy mystery and recommend it highly for ages 16 and up.Enjoy your read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7X06ZAMQ08Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUCHFFC#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7X06ZAMQ08Z","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is awesome beyond belief! This story is so well written and the defense so entwined that it is going to be hard to review this book without spilling the beans.Anyone who knows anything about race hate by living it, reading about it, doing it, or seeing it done, knows this book to be right on target. In this story a man is accused of setting an explosion in a church that ends up killing the Pastors daughter, a 12 year old girl, and harming the Pastor. He, Brian Stone, is arrested and spends time in jail before his trial.  Judge asks Jasyn Cook, a Black lawyer, to represent Brian. Jasyn is not so keen on doing this and does try to get out of it. The Judge speaks to Jasyn and gets Jasyn to agree. Jasyn, a man or honor, vows to give Brian the best defense possible.Throughout much of this story the Pastor, also a Black man, organizes protest groups to protest Jasyn's defending Brian. Members of this protest group even call Jasyn an Uncle Tom Now I am not even going to spill if Brian is guilty or innocent. What I will pose is The Pastor has placed himself on the same level he believes Brian is.  The Pastor has let forgiveness and compassion go right out the window. I do understand he lost his daughter, but I would expect more from a man of the cloth. I think the way the author has written this Pastor is really good.I think this story is well written, easy to follow and understand, and you will not want to put it down. The characters are well written and you can relate to them easy.I do recommend this book very much. I would recommend it for age 16 on up.

You can relate to them and get to know who they are and where they stand in life.Benjamin Tucker was traumatized by a violent event in his teen years. It took him a long time to get over it, and even now he is drawn to think about it. Ben is a true crime author and amateur detective. Now he is obsessed with solving cases near his home in Holly Springs, North Carolina.  A series of decapitated female victims is found in near by communities and he is helplessly drawn to the investigation.  The hunt for the killer becomes personal and Ben is not sure if he has become the killers idol or his next victim.The secrets that come out while Ben, the police, and the FBI try to solve this case to catch the killer will rock Ben's world for a time.I do recommend this story to ages 18 on up. I say 18 because there are some murders in it that are a bit gruesome. There are also some cuss words that you might not want to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFZA5XAI2QPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IH8H0KA#wasThisHelpful","R1QFZA5XAI2QPE","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never read anything by this author that I can remember, so I have to admit I am surprised at how much I like this book. I don't usually go in for blood and gore, but something told me to take a chance. Not sorry I did either.This book is well written, well explained and easy to understand.The characters are well described and you can relate to them easily. Well, except for the killer.A dead body is pulled from the Chattahoochee River in Atlanta. This would not normally attract much attention except for the fact that it is missing some parts. A deranged killer is collecting specific body parts from the victims and tossing away the rest of the body. This bizarre MO has the Atlanta Homicide Unit referring to the killer as ""The Collector"".Detective Tom ""Brick"" Brikler relentlessly hunts for this killer as the body count rises. This Collector is as clever as he is deranged. He seems to leave no evidence behind.This is a really good book, but because of the content I would only recommend it to 20 on up. . You are going to want enough time to finish this book because once you start it, you will not want to put it down.Enjoy your reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QKRLMX92W5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWMVKVI#wasThisHelpful","R37QKRLMX92W5W","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great mixing of mystery and humor. A wonderful cozy mystery. If you are looking for a refined set of investigators, then this is not the book for you. If you are looking for more human investigators, then this is a great find for you. Lt. Dekker and Sgt. Murdock and a much smarter version of Ralph Cramdon and Ed on the Jackie Gleason show and about 2 steps down from Law and order. They know their stuff, but it is mixed in with the humor of their date life and the food that they eat. I have read at least half of the series and have never been disappointed.The story is well written, flows smoothly and is easy to understand. It is a fast read.The characters are well written and described. Dekker is more serious and smarter than Murdock, but you will love them both equally. Their girlfriends are a bit flakey, but they are a perfect match for them.Their girlfriends get them to attend the local craft fair. After awhile, our two detectives know they would have had to attend anyway because before the weekend is over, a murder has been committed.  The two detectives must look at all the possible suspects to see who had both motive and opportunity to kill this victim.This is a really good story. I do recommend it for ages 14 on up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UQP6PMENLIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPSGXMO#wasThisHelpful","R28UQP6PMENLIE","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is absolutely wonderful. It is a true to life romance that teaches a few things at the same time. It teaches us not to settle for 2nd best. It teaches that while money can be nice, you should never settle for this in a marriage without love.I have a Kindle that talks and I usually let Kindle read me the book while I do crafts. Well, I started doing that up to about 38% and then I just had to read it myself, it was that good.The story is well written, well described and explained. The characters are well written and described. In fact they are so well described that you will find your self wanting to smack 2 people right in the face. Read the book. You will know who those 2 are.At twenty-six Jessica Wilson believes her future is laid out.

She loves him but she doesn't LOVE him if you know what I mean. He has money and will take care of her nicely.Mark, the boy she fell in LOVE with 10 years ago, shows up on her doorstep to fulfill his mother's dying wish.  When he had to leave town with his family, she was devastated. Took her a long time to get over him, or has she. Why did he leave and not write to her? Why did she not try to write to him? Was it pride or insecurity?Read the book for the best story in a good long time.I do recommend this book for age 16 on up. There is one sex scene for those who do not like sex in their stories. It is not disgusting. In fact, it is beautiful..","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0IBZ9Q1V7HI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JH824DM#wasThisHelpful","R2R0IBZ9Q1V7HI","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is fantastic! I am from Salem, Massachusetts and have seen and read by fair share of witch stories, places and books, so at 67 years old, I think I can safely say if you like this subject, you will love this book.It will keep your interest from page one to the end. In fact, when you get to the end you will find yourself saying :""Over already!"". If you like witches and wizards you will love this book. It is a book set in real life with a town witch who protects her town. There are no sex scenes, so those who don't like them will be pleased. There are no cuss words, so those who do not like those will be pleased. This is just really good story. Remember the program called Charmed? Well this book is better.The book is well written, flows smoothly, is well described and easy to understand.  You will find yourself right into the story with the way the author has written it.The characters are also great! They are extremely well described and you will be able to envision them as if you were right there watching.Ebony Bell owns a magical bookstore with the personality of a battering ram. Her best friend is an older detective who drives like a NASCAR driver. There is also a new detective in town.

"This is a work of fiction. While I do think this is a good story, I also think the beginning was a tad too drawn out. If you stick with it though, you will soon get to some exciting adventure and mystery. There are no specific sex scenes in this story. There are some kissing, but not actual sex. I do remember a very small amount of cuss words.The story is well written, flows smoothly, and is well detailed and easy to understand.The characters are unique. The Dallas people are true to that area, and the Caribbean people are true to there.Katie Connell is an attorney whose sloppy drinking habits and rejecting love interest leads to some funny, as well as sad situations. The last straw is a doomed celebrity case in Dallas where Katie is shamed beyond belief. She leaves Texas for the Caribbean to escape humility, a broken heart, and hopes to kick her drinking habit. Sadly, she has traded one set of problems for another when she starts investigate her parents suspicious deaths. She sees an abandoned house in the rain forest and becomes bewitched by a voodoo spirit.I do think you will enjoy this story and I recommend it for ages 18 on up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38LLODL4TFXAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FZPMFO#wasThisHelpful","R38LLODL4TFXAE","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is a bit slow moving in the first chapter, but it does pick up speed after. I just finished it and am ever so glad I stuck with it. Success in both business and romance is sometimes not achieved unless you help it happen. Foster and Becca worked to make it happen. Yes, they did some things that were a bit sneaky at times, but it was for good purposes. They both loved each other.This book is well written, flows smoothly, is well explained and easy to understand. I see this story as two people who are both insecure and need to belong to someone and be loved.  For Rebecca, she has been hurt so bad in the past because her parents and her boyfriend left her. For Foster, he has been controlled so much by his mother and supposed fiancee that nobody cared enough to show him love.They only showed him what must be done to be a member of this rich family. They meet, aided by Rebecca through a devious action. They spend one glorious week together and fall in love. Their relationship has more twists and turns than you could ever imagine. Through it all, they always end up together.This is a book I do recommend highly. Like I said about the beginning of the book, please have a bit of patience and you will not be sorry. Yes this book is a story about the corporate world, but it is a story about true love even more than the corporate world.There are some sex scenes in this story. They are not the blow by blow detailed descriptive sex scenes. I think there may have been one or two cuss words, but I am not sure.While I do recommend this book, I would say the ages would be 18 on up because of the sex scenes.I do think you will enjoy this book..","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SZ35JKGUHVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERKA7PW#wasThisHelpful","R21SZ35JKGUHVV","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has the right mix of everything. It has mystery, romance, family and more.The book is well written, flows smoothly, and it is easy to read. I have to say that yu have to start this book with enough time to finish it. You just will be grabbed from page one to the end and not want to put it down. I was up until 2 a.m. finishing this. I just couldn't stop until I hit the end.The characters are a wonderful mix of many people you would find in real life. The author has a knack of describing them so you understand who they are and where in life they are coming from. . The main character, Toni, is utilized to bring all the characters to light in kindness and compassion.Toni Diamond is the makeup artist to middle America. She has a nose for trouble and a passion for solving mysteries. Toni has had a hard climb up as a single mother, but she has made it to a high position in Lady Bianca Cosmetics. Toni is smart and has a good eye for details and the funny side of life. When a sales rep is murdered at a convention in Dallas, it is Toni who notices things that others, like sexy Detective Luke Marciano, might miss.Only someone who understands how appearances might be deceiving can have an eye into this killer. Toni starts snooping and eventually gets death threats from this killer.The attraction Luke feels for Toni happens almost at the very beginning. He originally thought she was an airhead I think. When he finds out she had a good mind and is actually very wise, his feelings begin to grow.This is a really great first of the series. I do recommend it highly.For those who do not like sex scenes, there are 2. I personally did not find them bad. There was not all the step by step type descriptions that some authors put.

"I did like this book. The book description has it down as ""political intrigue with a splash or romance"". This description may well be accurate, but I would have elaborated it to include something about political intrigue and corruption. The book shows too well how politics works, and how corrupt politics really are. Makes me wonder if there were ever truly honest politicians. Anyway, I digress.This book is well written, it flows smoothly, and you always have an understanding of what is going on. The book shows clearly what the plight f the homeless is all about and how hard it is to end this problem.The characters are awesome. I see each of these characters growing from the start of the book to the end. It is not just a sense either. You can actually see them grow.Jane Patterson inherits a hotel from her uncle. Jane's dreams of operating a 5 star hotel come crashing down when she finds out the hotel is filled with vagrants. She turns to her local politician to get a grant to convert the hotel to a hostel for young tourists. This slick politician has not told her he has plans to ban beggers from the streets and make homelessness illegal. Jane discovers she has a conscience and tries to play the politician at his own game.This story is Jane's journey in trying to do right. It is not always easy to read though. Some of the predicaments Jane gets into are frightening at best. It does make a good read though. Her journey is very thought prevoking. You just may find yourself with a new outlook on the plight of the homeless.This book does have a couple sexual encounters. I word it so because it is not the same thing as in some stories.There are a few cuss words too.I do recommend this book for age 18 on up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBXH2LV8P5ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYOC18S#wasThisHelpful","R1XBXH2LV8P5ZO","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most confusing book I have ever read. I gave up trying at 24% read. The writing style leaves loads to be desired if the author wants us to be able to understand the story. If you have to keep reading and then re-reading to figure out what is going on, then this is not the book for me. If this style of writing is supposed to be the authors version of science fiction, think again.The journalist is a nut job.

This book is like a glorified soap opera and I don't like soap operas either. I will say this though, at least the soaps are less depressing than this book. This book is about people, both rich and poor, who seem to be trying to impose their wills and desires on everyone in bad manners.The book is well written, too drawn out, too well explained, and full of people being nasty to each other.The characters are cruel, depressing, and most re seriously damaged in one manner or another.Sorry, but I can't recommend this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSIP5D1GP4NQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HKN1J3M#wasThisHelpful","RSIP5D1GP4NQS","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you do not like sex in your books, this is not the book for you. There are also some cuss words.I am rapidly getting to the point where I will not buy a series book unless it is a stand alone type of thing. By  this I mean I could read this book and have the story come to an ending to be taken up in another book and brought forth. The ending of this book is a cliff hanger designed especially to get you to buy the next book so you can know what happened. This is all well and good in order to increase the author's earnings, but it is a bit cruel to people who can't afford to keep buying more books like that. Yours is not the only books we read. If all authors were like this we would rapidly go broke. It is for this reason I am giving this book only 3 stars.Anabelle owns a bookstore in the town she has lived in all of her life.

"This is a mixture of suspence, a bit of humor, love, and a psychotic rapist / killer. It is well written, flows smoothly, and you will be glued to the pages until the very end.This is a story about a young woman who has had a tragedy in her life that many women fear ever having. Like the Phoenix Rising, she has survived. It is a story of courage, and ultimately about how the love of her life is there to help her be victorious after a second attack.The characters are exciting, chilling, and some are amusing. Lexi and Noah, our two main characters, make the perfect couple. The ladies of the Senior Center could be anyone's grandmother with a bit of spicey attitude.Lexi Hanson moved across the country to rebuild her life after the attack that almost destroyed her spirits and nearly killed her. She inherited a beach cottage from her grandmother and is now living there. . Her life is now complete.Noah is Rock and Roll's hottest star. After years without a vacation, he finds the solitude he needs at his beach house. Noah is surprised to see his neighbor in his garden crawling around. And so they meet.... Lexi and Noah....But, someone was watching them. Someone who thought Lexi was his, and his alone. Lexi was his. How could she be talking to this guy? He would get her. He would make her pay.When I first saw the ale lead was a Rock star, I thought, ""Oh No! I am not going to like this."" But, I took a chance and started reading. I am not sorry I did. Yes, he is a Rock Star. No, this is not a story about your typical Rock Star. This guy is what every girl dreams of. A good catch and one who will love you forever.For those who don't like sex scenes in their reading, sorry, but there are some. I can only say they are not disgustingly graphic and dirty as some are.

"I finished this book last night. I found this book to be well written, flows smoothly, and leaves you in suspence pretty much for the entire story. This book is mind blowing. I do not have a complete enough grasp on psychic phenomena to say all the facts in this book are true. I will say this though, the manner in which the author writes about the psychic incidents will have you believing them all. That is just how well the book is written.The characters are well written and described. The two main characters are Samantha (Sam) and Brandt. The author has written these, as well as the rest of the characters in such a manner that you feel what they feel, and can understand why they feel that way.Sam Blair is a young psychic who has been through emotional torture because of her gifts. She has been ridiculed, hounded, and even put into a mental institution because of them. For these reasons, she now hides her abilities and lives on the fringes of society. Since she has yet been able to control the times of her visions, she has even tried not to make friends lest they find out. She has recently been given multiple visions of women getting murdered. The murders are so horrifying that she feels she must go to the police and try to help. She hopes they will believe her. Here she meets Detective Brandt Sutherland who only trusts in evidence, but Sam's visions offer him clues that he needs to catch a killer. The more he learns about her visions, the more he sees that they have placed her in risk of harm. While he works o keep her safe, he risks losing his heart.I do recommend this book for age 17 on up.

Tubby is, above all else, charming in his own unique way.The last words that escaped an old friend's lips will not leave Tubby's mind. He also can't get out of the way of a political campaign that is turning rough. Both the Sheriff and Tubby's friend the judge are running for election.  Tubby is obsessed with the thought that a shadowy crime boss is pulling string and costing good people their lives.

"Amazon: Can someone remove the **** from stories? It is getting annoying to have Kindle speak the book because of these.This book is well written, well described, and flows smoothly. It is very easy to understand. The plot is a bit involved, but not so that you can't figure out what is going on. The book has intrigue throughout the entire book. You will just get to thinking you have the book figured out then, wham, it changes.The characters are well written and described. Some of them are rough, but this is in line with the type of story this is. It is about crime.Lishman hooks up with Natasha Rok in a bar and brings her home. Both have done loads of drinking and can't even complete the sex act. Three days later news of Natasha's murder is all over the papers. Lishman is the prime suspect. Only problem is that Lishman can't remember much at all about the night of 'passion'.  He makes a snap decision to run. He turns into a fugitive hiding out on the back streets of London. With the help of Dani, a female photographer friend, he ventures into the world of East End gangs and conspiracy theories to figure out this mystery.This is an interesting read and will keep you glued to the book until the very end. There are one or two crude words in the story.I do recommend this story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9PSIX36SLUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2SK86E#wasThisHelpful","R2F9PSIX36SLUY","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has it all, adventure, magic, humor, a little bit of romance, and more. It is well written, well explained, and once you start it, you will not want to put it down. The story is so well written that you will feel like you are right there when the action is taking place. The characters are fantastic. They are written so well it is like they are right in front of you.Raven is 15 years old and was supposed to snatch a cauldron, but instead, she accidentally blows up the library.Raven's father is a spy for Kingdom Quest. He has been charged with finding. He coerces Raven to help. Raven is disguised and employed at Saint Cloud Library. The library is ruled by a tyrannical director who has closed all book sections.  Her coworkers are wary, unfriendly, and have no concern that the library's magic is taking on the demeanor of a chained monster. There is a cyber security leak and an organization of magic abusers know the cauldron is at the library. Raven must find it first.You have to read the book for the full story.I do recommend this book for age 14 on up. It is a clean story. No cuss words or sex scenes.I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ1WTVKPKMEHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D1D83LG#wasThisHelpful","RQ1WTVKPKMEHD","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story is well written, flows smoothly, and is easy to understand.The problem with this story is that if these 3 women drink this much they should be spending most of their vacation drunk and unable to investigate anything, or in the hospital getting a liver transplant. I mention transplant because the way they drink it is not just on this vacation they are doing it. I know this is supposed to be a work of fiction, but with the pictures at the end of the book I have to wonder how much actual fiction there is in the book.The characters are well written and described. The problem is that the large amount of them are written as stupid beings. The three girls, for example, are taking far too many chances with their lives by trusting way too many people. Let's take the supposed drug lord, sex fiend guy. When he says he will drive them back to their hotel via boat, they go. Huh?? Nobody in their right mind would do that with the fears, no matter how small they are, of this man. So, can I relate to this story, absolutely not.Victoria's dreams died the night she found her husband in the pool of his apartment (they had seperated) with another mistress. Days before her divorce is final, her 3 closest friends whisk her off to Playa del Carmen, Mexico. Vivian meets a sexy Canadian soap star Jon Tourney. They have a hot night on the dance floor than for a walk on the beach. Next morning Jon is found dead on the beach and Vivian is the suspect.So, do I recommend this book? Well, if you want to read a book with characters that have no strength, integrity, or maturity, be my guest. If you want to read a book where the three main female characters are a bit loose, and drink like fishes, then go ahead.  I would only recommend it for ages 18 and up due to some of the items found on Shorty's boat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VRFZPMDNHS74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00876VIUU#wasThisHelpful","R3VRFZPMDNHS74","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay, I gave the 2 star rating because the author tried. He did not succeed. To me, this book was plagiarized It is far too close to Christie's book, and I believe the title was ""And Then There Were None"", but I could be wrong. I read it a good many years ago.My next problem with the book is that it was too drawn out. So much so that it became boring. When you add the closeness to Christie's book, it became even more boring. .I do admit for the last about 25% of the book I was speed reading just to get through to the end and not because I was interested.If it were up to me, I would suggest the author take this book and rework it, keeping only his own ideas in the reworked version. I know I am being snotty here, but this is how I feel.Do I recommend this book? Not really. It is a remake of a classic. I found the classic far more appealing than this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JC2UX6JT5XI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHVWF9O#wasThisHelpful","R2JC2UX6JT5XI2","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"According to the author at the end of the book, this is her first novel. Well, I am here to say that she has done a fantastic job! I loved the story! I love the pace of the story. No we are not all rich like our 2 main characters, but the events are real life. Congratulations Ms. Grace! Well done!Yes, there are a few typos in this story, but I personally feel the story is so good that it is not important. By the way, I started this book about 10:30 last night. I could not put the book down. I was up until 3 a.m. to finish it!This story is well written, well paced, easy to understand and relate to. The characters grow on you right away. You will love them. The character of Faith shows her gaining strength and becoming more assertive. There is a touch of religious value in this book, but not enough to turn off those who don't like to read about religious values. And then we come to Zac. If only each and every one of us ladies could find someone like him. Wow!Faith and Zac grew up together. Faith had a strog and loving family. Zac's family was almost non-existent. . As each went on to different paths in life, they remained strong friends. When ever Faith needed him, Zac was there to support her. Same with Faith. Her support of Zac was invaluable to him.Zac and Faith loved each other deeply, but they could not see it well. Others knew it though. Zac's family has a histroy of cheating men who hurt their wives. Zac was afraid to profess his love for her in fear of hurting her. Faith did not think Zac felt that way about her.Then, one day, Faith's father had a heart attack. When she was there another good friend, Dylan, was holding her in his arms to comfort her. Zac came and saw this and it was like a thunder bolt. He was intensely jealous.Ladies, I stop here. For the best effect you have to read this book yourselves.I strongly recommend this book for all ages. It shows what true love is really like. There are no sex scenes. There are no cuss words. This is just a highly enjoyable and great story that all must read.Again, congratulations to the author on a fantastic first book.

"This is the second book of this author's and he has again not failed me. This story will grab you from page one and keep you on the edge of your seat to the last page. I am looking forward to the next in the Hyder Ali series.The story is very well written. It is easy to follow and flows smoothly. Hint: allow enough time to read it as you will not want to put it down.The characters are well described and and you will like them all.Hyder is an American-Muslim. He is working as a reporter for the Daily Times. His old professor, Eric Freeland, is found hanging inside his home. Freeland's daughter, Jessica, asks for Hyder's help to prove her father was murdered.Detective Tom Nolan is assigned the Freeland case. Tom is an alcoholic and would rather get drunk than work on a case, but, the bills have to be paid so he lets himself be convinced to come out of mourning for his dead wife. .What looks to be an apparent suicide turns into something sinister and dangerous when Hyder, Jessica, and Nolan begin looking for answers.

"I have to admit I read the first 2-3 ages of the lead in and then just skipped to the actual story. We don't need so much description. I would have much rather seen a short character description then so much detail in the beginning. Minus the beginning it is a good story and still worthy of reading.The story is written well, flows smoothly except for to much detail in the beginning. The characters are written well and you can understand them.Chauncy St. Armant is shot to death at a Mardi Gras festival parade. Rookie cop Skip Langdon is there and tries to get through the massive crowd to the body. She had seen the shooter. It was someone dressed in a Dolly Parton outfit.Skip has to interview those who were near Chauncy and untangle a web of clues and secrets to solve the murder. This investigation means danger for Skip and possible doom for the St. Armants.This is an interesting story and, despite the overly long read in, I do reocmmend it for ages 16 on up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R367E5CEMLPUUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007W97WJY#wasThisHelpful","R367E5CEMLPUUR","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another in the list of books by Dr. Gold that I have read and I love it as much as the others.The story will grab you right from the beginning and keep you sitting on the edge of your seat until the very end.If any reader has medical background, you will find this book factual in the medical aspects while also being a good fictional work. I have to say when ever I see that a book is written by Dr. Gold I grab it without even reading the description. I know it will be great.The story is well written, flows smoothly and is easy to follow. The characters are real life and you will relate to them easily.This book takes the reader on a search for the cure for malignant melanoma. This type of cancer is not common, but it does cause deaths almost every hour. The rate of occurence has tripled in the last 20 years. Ever wonder why we see so many ads about sun block. This is one of the reasons.The husband of Dr. Terri Powell died from this skin cancer. She went further in her studies to be able to do research in skin cancer so that she may prevent others from death like her husband.A drug courier is killed in order to get an experimental and promising treatment for malignant melanoma. This theft unleashes a chain of devastating consequences.PAT a company created to find cures for rare diseases has fallen on hard times and was bought out by Kendall Pharmaceuticals. Kendal has very different ethics than PAT.  Here is where the story gets frightening.I recommend this book for age 14 and up. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to see how companies work, and why we should prevent companies from the ability to lobby our Congressmen. The Congressmen get a kickback from the companies and sometimes bad and harmful things can happen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8V6G5XLJAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELWQ4IA#wasThisHelpful","R2I8V6G5XLJAU","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She taught me most of what is in this book, so no, the book did not teach me anything new.

I gave this a 1 star simply because the author wrote it and nothing more. I find it flabbergasting that this work should come out of a female. I downloaded this book knowing the rating was Explicit. For me, there is a  bog difference between explicit and a XXX rating, AKA raunchy. This book is raunchy and I could not ring my self to read it further than about 25%.

"This is the 2nd in this series and I have read both and not been disappointed with either. .The story is well written, easy to follow and flows smoothly.The characters are well explained, and you will find yourself relating to them easily. I like the character of Quincy, our main character, especially.All Quincy wants is to make a success of the flower shop and a wonderful romance with Alex Cooper. The problem is that with Alex's job and Quincy planning weddings and trying to run her business, there are many road blocks. Every time things start to get hot and heavy they are interrupted.Despite the fact that Quincy promised Alex she would stay out of crime solving, when one groom is missing and the other becomes the prime suspect, Quincy has no choice but to try to solve the mystery.  Just when Quincy thinks nothing else could go wrong, a person from Alex's past comes back to haunt them both.Then the ending, oh what an ending! I refuse to spill the beans here folks. It is just too good. I can't wait for book 3 in this series. Ms Adams has yet to disappoint me, so I do look forward to it.I recommend this book to age 16 on up.

"I just finished this book and found it warm, touching, humorous, sad, and loving. This is a clean cut story, so none of you have to fear cuss words, or descriptive love scenes. For Cammy and Race, the author just says they made love.The story is well written, flows smoothly, is easy to follow and understand. This is a story of fate, or another word would be kismet. I can't go further in the kismet thing or I would blow the whole ending for you and it will mess up your enjoyment of reading this story.You are going to love the way Cammy is written. She grows in this story to be a strong woman who becomes well equipped to live life. After you get a bit into the story, you will come to love Race too.When Cammy's husband of 25 years comes to her and says he is in love with another woman, Cammy is devastated.as any of us would be. She spends the requisite time wallowing in self pity and not accepting phone calls or answering her door.  Her husband Race comes to see her to 'talk' to her and get the divorce going. Cammy asks who the woman is. He finally tells her. Cammy finds herself going to face her, like some of us would do. I have to compliment the author here. I know this is a story and I found myself wanting to slap this 'mistress' silly.Cammy's friends decide to take her on a trip to St. Gabriel. She grudgingly agrees. Once there Cammy falls in love with the place.And the story continues if you read the book. Can't say more or it will wreck the story for you.I recommend this book highly for about age 16 on up.

"I usually never have trouble keeping up with who the characters are until this book. By 38% read I was at a loss, so I stopped reading the book. This is a first for me, so not even sure how to write the review.The story was well written, but very hard to follow due to too many people involved. The plot, in and of itself, is a good one. You are involving 3 generations here, and also sisters, cousins and so forth, so in writing you have to be very good in making it easy for your readers to follow. I don't feel you have achieved this at all. If it were up to me, and I do know it is not, I would start with the mother of the autistic woman, the child of the autistic woman, and eliminate the rest of the characters.

"The one thing I do not like is how the story cuts off and we have to get the next book to see what happens. Yes, I do know this is a prequel. Thing is the story is so great that it is very hard to be left off right when the harder part for Allie is coming up.The title, Rumors, is an accurate depiction of what goes on in this book. Teens can sometimes be nasty beings with their talking behind your back. Like all tales, they get distorted beyond belief. Unless dealt with, the rumors can become the truth. Sadly, for Allie, talking about things is no longer possible since Maddie's death. Maddie was Allie's little cousin who died in an accident when she fell into the water. Try as she might, Allie could not quite grasp Maddie's hand and Maddie drowned. Allie made it out by the skin of her teeth. If any of you has ever been the lone survivor of a accident when the survivor was a loved one, you know what Allie went through, Add the fact that Allie is a teen, you can times her problems dealing with this by 3.Her Dad calls her almost at the beginning of summer with an ultimatum. If you want college money, come with me and my new wife and step-son to that same lake where Maddie died. Allie balks, but she feels she has no choice but to go if she wants to go to college.Is her Dad right? Will this help Allie onto the path of healing?

"This is a really good story that requires just a tad of work on it. You left MacKensie in the hospital and we never learn what is wrong with her eye, or even if it can be fixed. Did I miss that part?This story is well written, well explained, flows smoothly, and grabs you from start to finish. The characters are believable almost completely. I say almost because I have to wonder at the percentage of people who would have turned that money in.Vincent Fox, in his 80's, has self-published a book. This book has some of the residents scouring the beaches for Al Capone's treasure. When Fox suddenly goes missing, Sheriff Ray Elkins and Detective Sue Lawrence are hit with a complex web of facts and fictions to get through. Along the way they find new information about a decades old unsolved murder.Get the book and see what happens and if they find the treasure.I recommend this book for 18 on up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F76R8HIHGYNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WA9QAU#wasThisHelpful","R1F76R8HIHGYNZ","A1T41R2H7X3ASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T41R2H7X3ASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do know this is fiction, but I think this work of fiction is messing with the Catholic religion in excess. Let's face it. If purgatory was like this fictional purgatory, nobody from purgatory would ever get to heaven. And I repeat, I do know this is a work of fiction. Thing is the author has taken a Christian fact and played it to be dirty.The book is well written and flows fairly smoothly. The characters, while inappropriate for where they are supposed to be residing, are well written and easy to understand.I would only recommend this book for ages 21 and up.

"Yoga Backpack Mat Bag by Gecko is my FAVORITE yoga bag! Kudos to the design engineering team for the minute detailed thought into constructing this bag to perfection.I'm a minimalist, I prefer to carry only the essentials. A big part of this is is contributed to lugging around extra weight weighing me down not to mention the discomfort. However, this bag is not exclusively for yoga use but for other uses allowing the wearer to carry items with great ease along with comfort.I like the fact this bag provides adjustable straps to securely hold yoga mats of any size and thickness with ease. You can adjust placement, height suiting your frame for ultimate comfort. The pockets accommodate a large variety of sized items. A cover for mat is included which is appreciated especially given the fact the composition of some mats are rather delicate and should not be exposed to natures elements. The padded laptop envelope is another welcomed feature. Water bottle holder has a pull string closure, another feature I appreciate.I loaded this bag with items I would never carry in order to test comfort. Let me say it was more than comfortable. I contributed the high level of comfort due to the engineering and placement of pockets. It seemed as if the weight was evenly distributed for maximum comfort. Even though I am a minimalist I have the option of toting items if need be. This fabulous bag is my yoga go to bag as well as my all around gym bag. No doubt on my next mammoth hike this will be accompanying me with its accommodating and comfort abilities.Workmanship is top notch, stitching, fasteners, zippers all well constructed. A very high end bag providing room and comfort. This will be your favorite carry all with a certitude.

"These ear buds were pretty amazing. Easy to connect, amazing quality sound, makes you practically deaf when they're in your ears, and they fit comfortably... mostly. I couldn't get the left earbud to sit comfortably in my ear all the time, but it was something I could get over.I use these motorcycling and even in my helmet, at 80 mph, I could hear only the music. No wind at all... like I said. They make things very quiet.Unfortunately, I dropped them off my neck without noticing and a car ran over them. Funny thing is, they still worked after, even with the wires exposed on the left earbud and the internals popping out -- atleast, until the plastic failed and then the left stopped working. But the right kept working. AKA they're virtually bulletproof.I did notice a few instances where the sound cut in and out moving throughout urban areas, but nothing crazy.Just make sure to use the connector to tie them together so you don't lose them like I did -- they'll easily slip off your neck without notice.

"A nostalgic coming of age story of recent college graduate Mark Amici.It was great reading a coming of age store of a male, I was hesitant at first thinking it would be an Animal House affair but it was far from it. Sure I was submerged into the depths of the male world, however it wasn't hard to stomach.Mark Amici is an all around great guy - ambitious employee, dutiful son, loyal friend and a great potential romantic partner. He's surprisingly mature and grounded for his age. He's classy, honest and willing to listen to others, he's completely endearing.His persistence in securing employment, and a girlfriend I found relatable and humorous. He has a great attitude and takes his licks and quickly moves on. The book has many tender moments along with humors instances.I was well established in the early nineties, however I did bond with Mark in a few ways. Given his personality of over analyzing and holding on to the past somewhat limited his growth which is the polar opposite of myself. Nonetheless reading of Mark's journey was enjoyable. No doubt this young man has a bright future ahead. As the story progresses Mark and his friends evolve and move on as life, career, choices pave the way for independence, opportunities and establishment.Wasn't thrilled with the heavy hand in sports, however, it's what most men enjoy so I was a sport about it. I also felt it could have been shorter yet it was a satisfactory read.Patz smartly writes of a young adult venturing out into the big bad world as he navigates his way in career, love, life and family.

EVERY story in this collection is amazing with its various substance.Character development, hardcore narratives, revisiting characters from previous stories in the collection, repeating characters, each dealing with violence in their individual circumstances.

Very comfortable, lightweight, perfect for an AC environment without causing you to overheat, handy when the evenings are cool, or wear to look pretty or dress up your ensemble.

I had no issues with dye rubbing off on my clothes. I washed by hand and dye held as well as shape, no shrinkage. I find the sizing running on the small side (I'm an XS and the M was a tad too big demonstrating it runs small), use as consideration when ordering.

My hands are long and slim so I had no issues, a member of my family has ham hock hands so these didn't fit. I'm sure my case is the exception but still consider the sizing issue when ordering.  I'm more than satisfied with these gloves.I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R253KGEJY4NCPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014504QNM#wasThisHelpful","R253KGEJY4NCPL","A93W9EFTHU4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93W9EFTHU4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an outstanding book. A brilliant adjoining of history and mystery with an extremely intriguing main protagonist.No doubt Hart spent painstaking time researching due to the attention paid to the smallest of details. You feel every bit of eighteenth century China lending a tactile feel in atmosphere alone. I enjoyed the mystery but the heavy history element captured my attention an added a dimensional ambiance to my reading adventure. The small remote village feel gives you a true essence to China, culture, traditions, people as opposed to the opulent distraction of a big city life.Li Du is fascinatingly intriguing. We know he is an upper class intellectual in exile but the exact reason in unknown, we are privy to scattered bits of the big why. He takes on the unintentional role of sleuth as he attempts to name the culprit in the murder of a Jesuit. Hart wonderfully describes Jesuit attitudes and those of the local people towards the Jesuits.The mystery kept me guessing until the end, enthralling enough to maintain my interest. Plenty of secondary characters fully developed allowing for constant guessing in naming the actual evildoer.I look forward to more of Li Du as well as much more of this time period and of China. Hart displays strong writing, smart plot matched with an economically cerebral main character Li Du. Outstanding research, cannot emphasize this fact enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGDB70X8KYP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072328#wasThisHelpful","R2TGDB70X8KYP6","A93W9EFTHU4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93W9EFTHU4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best part of this book, the way Stewart provided the backstory of Constance's accidental stumbling into position of deputy sheriff. Constance evolves and ferrets who she is in her self-discovering sojourn as we read of one inspiring woman tapping into her authentic self.Constance, a maverick, fascinating, in short a remarkable woman. A woman refusing to fit into societal expectations, norms. Constance wanted to pursue a career, however, her mother disagreed with her desires, as well as the era proving difficult. Infrequent snippets of her past reveal threads weaving this woman into who she truly is today. The much younger version of Constance is a sharp contrast to the mature woman we are privy to, her attempt in navigating life leading to a few dicey situations on the precipice of ruin, fortunately her family serves by her side.The reader will receive a crash course in the happenings of circa 1914, Stewart creates a vivid setting complete with detailed accouterments. The tension of females is felt as time warrants change as women demand and fight for more than their predecessors. Constance's bravery and courage for nonconformity must have caused her peers to pause, perhaps they lacked the determination Constance possesses, once again she inspired even the ones remaining silence yet wishful.The pace felt sluggish, also a lot of peripheral scenes distracted and dragged in certain portions, really serving no merit translating to padding as opposed to purpose.Stewart provides a smart take on an incredibly new-fashioned woman.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUVAWV5LC7VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPHKR3M#wasThisHelpful","R3NUVAWV5LC7VQ","A93W9EFTHU4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93W9EFTHU4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"pureGLO Konjac Facial Sponge does in fact gently exfoliate your skin no matter the pressure used you won't discover your facial skin cut or skinned. My skin looks polished, feels smoother and dead skin once visible has now been removed, and feels super clean, glows. The size of the sponge is perfect allowing to scrub all the intricate areas large sponges can't reach, perfect to grip on to as well. The fact that it is 100% natural and eco friendly is highly appealing. The sponge comes with two suction hooks as the sponge itself has a 'hanger' attached so air drying is easily accomplished. Wonderful sponge, I hope pureGLO comes out with a Konjac body sponge! Super easy to use just wet sponge until soft and buff away to glowing radiant skin, viola simple.

"Instareads really summarizes the book quite well. I did in fact read 41 and found Instareads provides an excellent summarization of the book without revealing so much you won't consider perusing the book, rather it gives enough to adequately entice the reader with highlights lending a fair and broad perspective. Basically the barebones is in Instareads and the actual book contains the minute details and intricacies for both emphasis and enjoyment. Bottom line Instareads is a wonderful tool in deciding to read the actual book or perhaps pass.

"The Hopsooken Travel Neck Pouch is extremely versatile. Not limited for travel use, I use this for my many athletic pursuits. I'm a motorcyclist so this is a savior for me. There are times I don't want to carry a handbag or wallet due to my activity, however, the Hopsooken allows me to carry my items easily and securely, my hands are free!! The adjustable neck toggle allows the perfect fit, comfortable too. Well made and easily wipes clean. Waterproof and durable which I appreciate, lightweight too. Zipper is easy to work, RFID barrier is a HUGE plus, I like the window ID holder, plenty of pockets to story an array of items even a cell phone. Nice to have all important material in one secure location without needless rummaging, allows for easy and convenient access. Great size not cumbersome at all, although I only carry what I absolutely need, I'm a minimalist, this pouch can hold a lot. I prefer the neck pouch over fanny pack, safer and discreet - easily hidden under garments without being obvious. Highly recommend, especially for hands free freedom while keeping items secure.

The closure is comfortable and secure, easy to remove and to put on. The earrings come with an accompanying velvety jewelry bag/pouch.

"My first diffuser so I have no comparison, however my expectation is fulfilled. I like the sleek contemporary design, great height and width blending into any decor and surface. Diffuser seems study and a good weight, stable. I like the fact I can have 7 changing mood lights or select one vibrant color. I can control dim or bright to my preference. The diffuser is quiet, the only sound heard is when manipulating the function buttons 'mist' and 'light' a beep is heard. Easy to fill reservoir, measuring cup is included for ease. Produces a soft fragrant aroma, delicate but obvious. I have the choice of setting unit on a 3 hour timer or continually run, timer aspect a huge plus for me. Took about 20 minutes for diffuser to kick in at first go, (give or take using cold water) you'll see vapor, further uses within 2 minutes. Lots of flexibility with this unit which I appreciate. My only criticism - the instructions need drastic improvement, you're better to glance at the instructions then play with the unit yourself otherwise your stress level will rise. The instructions are wordy, kinda useless, the unit is easy to operate provided you read between the lines as far as the written instruction goes.

"This kit is fantastic. I'm very picky regarding leave in conditioners, not all are created equal by any means. I will say this leave in conditioner is fabulous. Super concentrated so a little will go a very long way. I have waist length wavy hair and a half palm size worth was the perfect amount. It doesn't leave a greasy residue, and styling isn't impeded in any way. The fragrance is heavenly. No tangles and felt my hair styled better. Silky, smooth, less flyaways, more manageable in general. I applied this to BOTH dry and damp hair, still no unsightly residue or greasy feeling, just silkiness and full of luster, hair felt fuller almost thicker feeling, def more body.The mask deep conditioner is a winner. Use sparingly, super concentrated and the fragrance is delicious. I wrapped my hair for 10-15 minutes using an old cotton t-shirt which is better for hair (less breakage/tangles) and more absorbent, covered with a shower cap, always my preferred method with hair masks. After rinsing, my hair was silky, felt nourished and hydrated, zero tangles easy to style.

Finally we have two beautiful people not suffering from abuse, no whips involved, no dysfuntionality, no disrespect intentionally inflicted towards each other.

Loved the fact Keaton was forced to woo Quinn. The author and reader hook was fabulous along with Quinn's initial resistance. Scott molded a narrative demonstrating loves demands, expectations, trials and tribulations matched with joys. She laid out the vulnerability and risks you must put forth in order to reap amours benefits. An intricate and complex emotional journey of two people navigating love.I had no idea what the ultimate outcome for the couple would be, glad Scott kept me on my toes.

An off putting, snarky attitude a mask of her anguish. Her story is affecting and you are left wondering what in fact will become of Stevie trapped with all her deep seeded issues. The struggles and demons Stevie battles are all too real. As the walls slowly tumble-down we glimpse Stevie's true core discovering her heart isn't black.Haston deserves praise for depicting the clinical environment, challenges of heavy issues, fellow patients along with staff, anyone dealing with in patient treatment will be able to relate and realize portrayed accuracy.There is somewhat of a twist revealing itself as well as a fabulous ending - both complimenting the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DH5JZ75OI70G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OG8JBNO#wasThisHelpful","R1DH5JZ75OI70G","A93W9EFTHU4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93W9EFTHU4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lingerie bags are fantastic. The mesh is small gauge which I prefer over the large mesh gauge bags I previously used, very durable material. The 4 various sizes are perfect (2 L blk & white, 1 M, 1 S), accommodating many items as well as perfect for travel. The black bag included is wonderful for dark colors. Well made, zipper is easy to open/close, stable. Great price for all 4 bags, purchasing individually, IF you can locate the sizes given could be costly. These bags really protect clothing from the harshness washing machines deliver, especially delicate unmentionables.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16MMAQO3OOWWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MYPOHG#wasThisHelpful","R16MMAQO3OOWWQ","A93W9EFTHU4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A93W9EFTHU4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ProsLots of accessories, a few you might never considered purchasing unless included in this bundle. Great samplingGreat for beginners diving into accessory use with GoProFabulous price point, more variety saving tremendous cost if purchased individuallyWonderful storage case, easy to transport, portability easeAn option for those not necessarily known to take care of items, you're not out a lot of money should they be misplacedChest Belt Strap Mount worked wellConsThe items were not labeled, a few obvious, a few you had to hunt around in various reviews figuring out what they wereNot easy to repackage, you end up willy nilly placing items in case. Be nice if each accessory had a designated location, especially if lendingI found the quality under par. You get what you pay for, which isn't a bad thing, just beware when using items you don't destroy your GoPro in the process. Specifically the bike handlebar mount accessory kept detaching under the minimal of vibration, it was completely secured but failed to withstand minimal to extreme vibration.Offering a few options as to what parts could be included would be nice. I know I will never use the Kite accessory, be nice if I could have selected an alternate accessoryMany of the pieces broke, the plastic felt inferior, cheap, not going to last with multiple uses over timeAll in all a great way to get your feet wet, quality meets the price point. Beware of use, gotta watch out for potential mishaps damaging your precious camera. Invest in the high grade accessories or begin here playing and enjoying with options you wouldn't normally consider.

"Pleased with this sewing kit, very impressive. The kit comes with plenty of basic helpful items - scissors, measuring tape, seam ripper, numerous needles, threads galore, even 3 shirt buttons, plus more.

Opens to fold out flat to easily locate required items in a hurry, zips up so spillage won't be an issue.

"I love this brush. I feel as if I have tried every brush in the world and yanked out half my hair in the process, not to mention the financial loss. This brush is strong yet gentle as it glides through your hair, it works the toughest tangles freeing your hair without breakage or ripping your hair out in the process. The teeth don't cut into your scalp. I have waist length wavy medium thick hair. My ends become rather dry if I slack on conditioning so vicious tangles appear, fortunately this brush works and gains the upper hand on tangles/knots period without pain or hair destruction. It literally releases the tangles as opposed to breaking/ripping hair. No doubt this brush would be wonderful for children especially if their tender scalps. Fabulous brush, highly recommend, no more looking at the brush on the verge of tears astonished at the amount of hair loss. Nice design allows easy grip in any size hand.

Overworked, spent, she just wants to unwind from her hectic business travels butcant refuse to help her besties sister with a place to stay before she and her boyfriend leave for vacation. A rather disorganized travel duo, I have a feeling Allison will have her hands full as we were left in suspense. I identified with Allison, been in her shoes on one too many occasions.

I laughed with this story. Cant tell you how many Rachels I know with the dreaded visit to monster-in-law AND the overhearing of Rachel venting on the phone of her feelings regarding hubby and his mom.

Super concentrated, 4 sprays in the toilet bowl appears to be the magic number to eliminate odor. Wonderful product giving results, great price, non harmful to environment.

The sound was clear, no distortion, no muffled sound or the tunnel like sound often heard with poor quality units.

"The current trend for software companies is to provide ""software as a service"" (SaaS) where the user licenses an application for a finite amount of time. There are pros and cons for the user here - since ownership is established via your Microsoft account (yes, you'll need one if you don't already have one), you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you don't pay for it longer than you need it;  you can more easily use it on a variety of devices (mostly Microsoft tablets - check their website for list of compatible iPads and OS version).This pricing model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled out this SaaS plan later year to much anguish). However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run. Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year. So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model. Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over a subscription fee every 12 months. Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.Installation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install. You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for installation and cloud storage features.In use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design. I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations. Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options. Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions. I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).Finally, it's important to note that this is the ""Personal"" edition of Office 365 - ""personal"" as in for a single person.  It includes a license for Office on one PC or Mac plus one tablet.  For the price, you may be better off with the ""Home"" edition, which packages the same product features, but with enough licenses for five total devices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D1BOW6LHN8WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HV9IM58#wasThisHelpful","R1D1BOW6LHN8WS","AHNHLGKIZ2N3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHNHLGKIZ2N3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the biggest surprises since I upgraded to a Kindle Fire HDX is the relative lack of quality cases on the market compared to the original Fire HD models.  I had been using a great case by Marware with my original Kindle Fire - that company is now called MarBlue.  So I was very excited to try this case based on my positive experience with their prior products.  However, the Slim Hybrid Standing Case was a big disappointment, particularly when compared to their offerings for older Kindles.The MarBlue Slim Hybrid only marginally met my requirements for an ideal case:1.  Snug fit with a hardback plastic shell protecting the back of the Kindle - The MarBlue does OK here, although it relies on corner clips to seat your tablet as opposed to a full-edge bracket2.  Padded protection for the Kindle - The Slim Hybrid is so slim, it just feels like you've wrapped a piece of cardboard3.  Swivel from portrait to landscape - The MarBlue only supports easel positioning in a landscape orientation, and even then, the position is held by tiny dots (like plastic stubble) meant to hold the tablet at your preferred angle.4.  Auto-off magnet - The Slim Hybrid does not automatically put your Kindle into sleep mode when you close it.5.  A trustworthy closure to keep the cover from flapping open - I've seen wide fluctuation in others' reviews on the closure, so maybe the build quality is variable here.  Mine is on the ""way too easy to flop open"" end of the spectrum, with only two stiff but stubby tabs on the lid to ensure a reassuring fit.On top of these shortcomings, the Hybrid Blue is also very inexpensive-looking (despite its premium price).  The cover material is very shiny, the stitching looks imprecise, and the interior isn't particularly soft or protective of your screen.  All told, the entire package just looks like nothing special, and while there is scant little on the market for HDX cases - no idea why, a year later - the MarBlue Slim Hybrid is sadly nowhere near the top of that list.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJYVP1LWXF0BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZNOVS#wasThisHelpful","RJYVP1LWXF0BD","AHNHLGKIZ2N3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHNHLGKIZ2N3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Artistic Krystal View Clear Desk Pad definitely lives up to its name.  It's an almost invisible sheet of plastic that allows you to easily see whatever you place underneath it in complete detail.  The desk pad created no distortion at all.

I had planned on using the desk pad on our son's desk, but didn't want to scratch/mar it surface.  I ended up taking it to my desk at work instead, where the desks have tough, synthetic surfaces.  The desk pad hasn't marked it at all, but I still won't risk it at home.  Also, it's not non-slip and it does shift from time to time while writing on it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318VUXSU8YKMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA8OG9G#wasThisHelpful","R318VUXSU8YKMT","AHNHLGKIZ2N3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHNHLGKIZ2N3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This hard pouch is an officially-licensed PS Vita product and works very well, including with the new ""Slim"" or 2000 model.  I'm using it with a Vita Slim which has a silicone skin on it and the case fits like a glove. The case itself is rigid enough to withstand routine transport and usage, but not completely crush-proof.  The interior is padded with soft liner material (including additional padding over the screen). The dual zippers work smoothly.The interior has no additional pockets or slots for memory or game cards, cables, etc.  That might be a consideration for people who are looking to transport their entire Vita setup, particularly if you have one of the original (1000) Vitas for which there are already a number of full-featured cases.

"""Watch Dogs"" arrived on the scene with a lot of hype and expectations, some trepidation (fueled by a lengthy deferrment of its release date), and one glaring question:  what would distinguish this gritty, urban sandbox from any of the others from this past decade?  The purported answer was that the timeliness of the story setting focused on issues of privacy and security in an era of big data and omnipresent surveillance coupled with the hacking capabilities would make the gamefeel fresh and unique.  However, many of the things that should have made it stand out instead are the areas where it stumbles the most, leaving ""Watch Dogs"" as a uneven experience that too often gives a frustrating glimpse into what it could, and should, have been.Gameplay definitely follows a familiar path for anyone who's played any of the Grand Theft Auto series.  However, as I played on, I felt more similarities with the Assassin's Creed games, which makes sense as they're both Ubisoft properties.  For example, the fully-feature map becomes revealed to you bit by by as you climb radio towers to hack into their control boxes - very similar to the climb-a-watchtower-and-dive-off meme in the AC games.  However, that similarity is severely disrupted by the fact that Aiden cannot jump, which feels very odd.  He can vault over objects, but not jump up to climb or parkour off of walls.  Details like this disrupt the exploration that's so central to gameplay - you want to jump frequently and may even hit the button that you think would make you jump, but then you remember that this feature doesn't exist and it brings you out of the experience.And Aiden fares even worse in cars.  Vehicle chases are often difficult to the point of frustrating, both because of the poor physics for handling and also your inability to fire a weapon (at all) while driving.  This latter oddity might be a purposeful feature aimed at forcing you to utilize hacking techniques to disable pursuers, e.g. switching traffic lights to create pileups, raising bridges, etc.  It should be fun, but the timing requirements are so precise that I often found myself running into my own traps and barricades, essentially handing myself over into custody.The story itself is good - a mixture of a personal revenge story and societal commentary.  However, Aiden is tough to root for, both because of his monotone voice acting and his ambiguous morality.  There isn't much obvious consequence to making criminal choices throughout - you may have your notoriety level elevated for a brief time, but then the authorities quickly (sometimes literally mid-chase when right on your tail) lose interest.  So if it's easier for you to evade pursuit by driving through a crowded mall, there's not much incentive to avoid that option.  There are a few wildly unbelieveable plotting moments make you realize that the story is more ""24"" and less Oscar-winning drama.  For example, when Aiden needs to infiltrate a high-security prison to interrogate one of the inmates, he literally just walks in the front door and brandishes a gun in order to get apprehended.  Then they just immediately give him an orange jumpsuit and put him in a cell.  Take that, due process!Graphically, it doesn't jump off the screen and say ""next-gen,"" although in all fairness, I'm yet to see more than one or two games that do so on either the Xbox One or the PS4 as of this date.  Part of this is owed to the game's commitment to a realistic near-future Chicago and its resulting bleak color palette of grey, black, and more grey.  While this does a good job of providing some immersion into the lead character's psyche, it also prevents the game from providing much eye candy (one exception is the ""digital drug"" side missions where you hallucinate wild overlays skinning your surroundings).It's important to note that ""Watch Dogs"" is  very dark and adult in its tone and its content.  Much of the surveillance that you find on others reveals (or maybe even revels in) the rampant depravity and sadness of the masses' lives.  Some of this is pretty graphically-depicted.  Language is in the very hard-R territory and constant - even NPCs you pass on the street and routinely vulgar.  This actually surprised me (and I'm no shrinking violet about language) given that it didn't seem necessary and doesn't add much to the characters themselves.  There is plenty of mayhem, peril and violence throughout.  The game is rated ""M"" for ""Mature"" and definitely justifiably so, but I'd hope that no parent out there gets fooled into picking this up for their kids since it's not GTA V.  I actually found the GTA content less shocking because it seems almost vaudevillian compared to ""Watch Dogs"" undertones of real modern urban life.All this said, ""Watch Dogs"" does a lot right.  Its aiming/shooting mechanics are very good, which makes combat a lot of fun.  The hacking features make the entire city a big puzzle, which is engaging when you have to find the right combination of surveillance methods and other traps to utilize in order to outwit a superior force.  It mixes online multiplayer real-time with the campaign in the form of bounties that other real players attempt to claim on you and other interactions with real players - this definitely ups the excitement due to the unpredictability and the high skill level of most other players.  I also liked the RPG-style progression system which rewards you for completing missions with additional capabilities for purchase.  Once these capabilities start rolling in, the tedium of the initial hours of gameplay starts to get some much-needed relief.So while I generally enjoyed playing ""Watch Dogs"" and found it to be an interesting premise, too often I found myself wishing that it did more of this or less of that, or that some feature or another was more well-designed.  It's long on potential - I hope that Ubisoft works out the shortcomings of this first installment and gets it right for the sequel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N5L0Y6KUBBW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX8VY4S#wasThisHelpful","R2N5L0Y6KUBBW7","AHNHLGKIZ2N3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHNHLGKIZ2N3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited to see the Suddenly Grain line of side dishes appear as a healthier alternative to pasta as an accompaniment.  This Harvest Grains variety mixes rice, quinoa and almonds with dried cranberries and dressing for flavor.  The boil-in bag preparation was simple and resulted in reasonably good texture for the grains - not mushy at all but also not too dry.  The dressing was much sweeter than expected, particularly when combined with the cranberries.  I would have preferred something more savory or crisp to complement the cranberries, but someone else might feel differently.

"The Ravagers is the eighth novel in the 27-book strong Matt Helm espionage series.  It was first published in 1964.  It is probably the best espionage series ever written and decidedly unlike most other spy series.  Theres no secret warehouse filled with scientists inventing ever cleverer gadgets, few fancy sportscars, no orbiting satellites, or secret teams of deadly industrialists with armies of henchmen.  When Hamilton wrote this series, he strived for realism and authenticity.  He got it.The Ravagers is a carefully crafted story about Helm trying to fulfill his duty and ensure that false documents make their way into the enemys hands.  His mission is important and he is told that he is to use any means necessary to carry it out and not to cooperate with other agencies who may not be privy to what his mission is.The book begins with Helm walking into a hotel room and seeing the results of an acid job on the man he has been called in to replace.  The story carefully and cautiously takes Helm step by step on his mission through the high plains and the Canadian woods, playing cat and mouse with other agents and his quarry, with him never letting slip what his real mission is.Some of the wittiest scenes in the book are his verbal parrying with his quarry who is convinced that he must be some government agent and that the escaped convicts he beat the crap out of are other spies sent in to stage a scene with him.What is great about this novel and the series as a whole is Hamiltons close attention to minor details such as how uncomfortable Volkswagens are, how fifteen year-olds in braces and curlers look like aliens, how women should dress (and undress).  The tone of the story is witty, ascerbic, and, although great gun battles and hordes of paratroopers dont spring into action every time he runs into trouble, the story moves along swiftly.This series as a whole and this book in particular make for great reading and, even in this post Cold War world, these old-fashioned, realistic espionage stories are worth reading.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HP5LRCAF5NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781162301#wasThisHelpful","R23HP5LRCAF5NG","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hjortsberg has given us readers a great gift with this book.  It is a nineteen fifties style hardboiled detective novel with elements of mysticism, madness, voodoo, and black magic thrown in.  It is an evenly paced novel that really takes off in the second half.  It sort of combines themes from hardboiled pulp fiction with seventies-era horror movies.  It takes the reader back to post world war two in a land of jazz and women and seedy haunts on Broadway and takes the reader through the funhouse carnival that was Coney Island.  Hired by Louis Cipher (a thinly disguised client), Harry Angel must find a jazz musician that disappeared fifteen years ago when everyone thought he was either dead or ensconced  in a mental hospital upstate.  but to find him, Angel has to wade through all sorts of seedy characters who want nothing to do with him and to fall for a girl who dabbles in white magic.  But, that is nothing compared to the world of horror that he finds once Angel digs deeper.Although this was made into a hit movie starring Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet, the novel itself is well worth reading because it opens up a world of dreams and madness as Angel slowly but surely peels away the layers of mystery surrounding the jazz player's disappearance.If you have read other books by Hjortsberg such as Maana, don't open this with any preconceived expectations.  It is not anything like Hjortsberg's other work.Smoky, jazzy, hip, dark, strange, unearthly, and just plain good reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DRA4KFF6GRUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1453271139#wasThisHelpful","R1DRA4KFF6GRUL","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pigeon Pie is the final chapter in the eleven book Jimmy Flannery saga which combines detective fiction with Chicago favor for favor politics.  One of the great things about this series is the narrator's voice which takes you into a world of old neighborhoods and complicated political relationships.  Over the last few books of the series, Flannery is slowly moved out of his old precinct and his old advisors and the old guard pass on.  This book completes that part of the saga with Flannery making a complete switch from being Warlord of the 27th to a promise of the mayors ward and an alderman's seat.This is probably not the best chapter to begin the series as it is light on mystery and focuses mainly on politics and conniving and influence.  It also refers quite a bit to the previous book in the series, Lion's Share, and it is almost a sequel to that one.It is peopled with street thugs, transgender ex-cops, book banners, sexy political ladies, and more, and, of course, a murder.  It is perhaps all part of the changing world Flannery finds himself in and in which some folks are not quite comfortable with yet.Overall, it is a pretty decent read if you are familiar with the series, but might be lacking in plot for newcomers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GRXJ3GJC7JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892966653#wasThisHelpful","R6GRXJ3GJC7JZ","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Jimmy Flannery series is a more, modern version of a classic detective story.  But, instead of a private eye in a misfitting fedora in an office the size of a coat closet, you have a politician in machine politics Chicago, the land of favor for favor and not rocking the boat.  Flannery is known as a junkyard dog that just won't let go once he sinks his teeth into something and he won't let sleeping dogs lie either.  He got into politics expecting to help out his neighbors and never expecting the cesspool that it is.This mystery series takes the reader into the old ethnic neighborhoods of Chicago and the bars and the back rooms where all the deals are made.But, particularly here, late in the series, the world has changed.  The neighborhoods have changed.  The Graft and the favors are no longer socially acceptable.  And the old elephants are dying out and the young turks are being groomed for political positions.

"You just can't go wrong picking up any Fight Card story.  They are all terrific.  And this one is certainly not an exception to the rule.  Job Girl gives us a couple of twists on the usual fight card story.  For one thing, it's about wrestling, not boxing.  For another, it's about a lady wrestler and narrated from her point of view.  And, thirdly, a lot of the action takes place south of the border among the masked Luchadores.This is the story of Vicky, better known as The Queen of the Jungle, who finds work as a jobber.  In other words, she is paid to take a fall, to be the villain, to lose, to advance someone else's career.  It's a rough life and nets her little respect -and even less money.There are great fight scenes both inside and outside of the ring.

"This is a set of three loosely interconnected stories about three sets of people, each gathering up speed as they circle around a whirlpool of drugs and despair and desperation. The most fully fleshed out of these three groups is Genesis, a drug addicted prostitute who dreamed of someday getting out of Reno and Lupita, a one-armed chick with a blazing gun in each hand who somehow shows up on the spot to rescue Genesis.  Their back stories are intense and are told well.  Together, they follow Dillon's advice in Drugstore Cowboy that the drugs were all there in the pharmacies for the taking and cut a path of blood and gore across the west.  Throw in a little bit of Haitian superstition and you've got two avenging angels out to take whatever they can get and who fall in love with each other on the way.Another pair lives in a seedy Hollywood hotel, Jeffrey goes to AA meetings and his sidekick,  tall thin transsexual Rachel, who turns tricks to keep them full of dope.The final grouping is a French director and his Hollywood connections.  Jacque is a fat soul full of self -importance and who is determined to capture on film the gritty underbelly of Hollywood even if he has to sample every drug available and involve every street kid he can find.Each of these people is on the road to destruction whether rich or poor.  There are no limits, no rules,  and no end to how far their depravity will stretch.It is an absorbing gritty look at this world.  And O'Neill pulls it off well.

"The Case of the Murdered Model (aka Prey for Me) (1954) is the third book in the Mac detective series and, if like me, you cant get enough of the classic fifties pulp detective novels, this is just your ticket.  Mac (no first or last name) is a Chicago private eye, tough, hardboiled, take-no-prisoners, and has a gruff relationship with the head of homicide, one lieutenant Donovan, who often gets Mac out of scrapes, but not till after theyve had their differences.This is one of the best of the series.  It is smoothly plotted and easy to read.  All the action takes place in Chicago unlike some of the other books in the Mac series.  This book has just about everything thrown in that you normally find in one of these fifties private eye novels, from murdered women, blackmail schemes, dirty pictures, preachers, hoods, nightclub owners, mistaken identity, and more.There is plenty of action in this book from fist fights to gunfire and more.  Theres also quite a bit of suspense and a few good surprises thrown in.  Mac has got the hardboiled attitude down pat.  He is as tough and a no-nonsense as any of the old style detectives every were and just as stubborn.Although there are many fifties pulpy private eye novels, this is one of the better series and is entitled to wider acclaim than it has received.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XSDQQUADKZMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012U9FD7S#wasThisHelpful","R1XSDQQUADKZMR","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deweys Mac detective series is one of the best of the pulp-era private eye series, and unfortunately is not as widely known as it should be.  Mac is a tough-nosed ex-cop out of Chicago.  He is no-nonsense and bit sentimental when it comes to people in trouble.  This is the second book in the sixteen-book series that was published between 1947 and 1970, a period of some 23 years when much happened in the world to put it simply.Every Bets A Sure Thing (1953) is a real early book in the series.  It is smoothly written and is a real quick read like all the books in this series.  Here, Mac is assigned a rather unusual tail job where he has to follow a woman with two kids on a cross-country train ride to Los Angeles and is never to let her out of his sight.  A strange but simple task, but he has to do it without being spotted for the private eye that he is.  Hide in plain sight is the name of the game on the moving train and he befriends the womans six-year-old son.  Dewey is such a good writer that even the details of the mundane tasks of tailing someone are worth reading about.Of course, the train ride is quite eventful and, at one point, Mac needs to grow wings to even catch up with the train.  Once in Los Angeles, he continues to get swept up in the case even after his part in it was finished.  Murder, kidnapping, drug dealers, Treasury agents, and battles with hoods and other operatives keep him occupied when Mac isnt living it up at the Ambassador Hotel.All in all, one terrific private eye story, even when the overly complex solution to all the puzzling events comes clear in the end.  Although published over sixty years ago, the tale still feels fresh.  Not clear what the title has to do with any of the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GH0ISIH7KQSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012U9FD6O#wasThisHelpful","R1GH0ISIH7KQSB","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monson is based in Modesto and thus he sets this novella there, nestled near the American Graffiti statue.  He gives us a tale of angst and despair featuring some over-the-top characters, including the drunk gambling loser, his skanky wife on her third marriage (and still choosing loser after loser each of whom she ends up supporting), her boyfriend (the ex-con Aryan gangster who thinks he's a television show tough guy), and of course the wife's eighteen year old son from a former fling who just likes fighting.This story takes these crazy characters and swirls them around in a whirlpool of relentless self destruction when Matt the drunkard gets what little inheritance there is and is determined to gamble until it becomes a good sized nest egg, but he better do it before everyone else gets their hands on it.Matt the drunk is completely out of control but so is everyone else in this story.  There's no normal here and the story gets more and more twisted until it reaches its startling conclusion.The sex and violence is purposefully over the top and all the characters are sort of cariactures, but this is one story you don't want to put down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78HQNGTCV08H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015P098FW#wasThisHelpful","R78HQNGTCV08H","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Manana is an absolutely amazing tour-de-force.  In it, Hjortsberg does such a great job of capturing the early sixties pulp-era feel that you dont realize when you are reading it that it is not a reprint of a paperback original from that era, but a newly published gem.Like many  pulp novels of that era, it begins in classic form with a man feeling the worst hangover imaginable, having no memory of what went on the night before, and nothing but a bloody corpse to give him any hint of what had occurred.Of course, in classic pulp form, the murder weapon is nearby and its his own bloody knife, the knife that everyone would recognize as his.  Everything has been ransacked from this flophouse deep in Mexico, meaning that everything is gone but him and the bloody corpse, even his wife, Linda.But, this is not just your classic man-on-the-run tale that has been done over and over again.  What Hjortsberg has done here is give us an early sixties tale about a young beatnik couple who saved up for awhile and then disappeared for a few years into the cheap paradise that was Mexico, where they could take their VW microbus with all its hidden compartments and go wherever the whim took them, drink whatever they could find, and smoke whatever they could get their hands on.Hjortsberg does an incredible job of capturing the era and the nave innocence of the beatnik/hippie generation on permanent never-ending vacation in tropical Mexico.  Quite a number of pulp novels of that era used Mexico as the backdrop, but few as well as Hjortsberg, who brings all the towns from San Miguel de Allende to Guanajuato to life.Among the beautiful landscapes and endless shots of tequila and endless rolled joints, this is a tale of despair and descent into the depths of hell, a descent that begins with the young couple becoming pals with a quartet of ex-cons who took the room next door.  These are not just beatniks out looking for a good time, but hardened folks who have done time the hard way and this is a brave new world that Tod and Linda have found, not just the promise of the East Village coffeehouses, but a dark and deadly world.Most of the book is Tods desperate search for Linda, not knowing if she left willingly or against her will or where she could be in a country that spans thousands of miles.  On the way, he camps out in his vw van, duels local teens, visits cockfights and bullfights and masked wrestling matches.  And, Tod learns what he is made of and what he is capable of and whether he can hold his own.This is a well-written and absorbing piece of literature that takes the reader on a journey through a country and through a world of moral ambiguity.  After reading this, I am eager to sample what else Hjortsberg has written and that perhaps says it all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXP9JN406OXPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497680735#wasThisHelpful","RXP9JN406OXPO","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prodigal Sons is the story of three brothers who have sort of lost their way in this modern world of ours.Luke literally has bats in his belfry, fell for a girl he met in the institution, and got promoted in his job because everyone above him quit.  Luke is drifting in his mind and haunted by the bats he sees circling above him.Matthew has been having a long love affair with a bottle of alcohol, any bottle, in large quantities.  He has a beautiful wife, a new sparkling decorated house in Santa Clarita, and a job in the industry.  But all the palm trees and endless sunny skies cant make him happy.  Bar after bar he goes to, drowning some kind of emptiness inside him, till he crashes and burns and goes off in a jet-fueled last ride through the apocalypse.Mark, the third brother, seems outwardly the most well-adjusted of the three, but he, too, seems a bit morose, working in his dads grocery, staying with his folks while his house is remodeled, wondering what the hell is wrong with his too crazy brothers.Miner alternates between chapters each featuring a brother until, of course, magically they all meet up.  It is a dark novel filled with alcoholic fantasies and endless empty towns out of Mad Max movies filled with wheel-less trailers and ice cream shops.  Part of it feels like a remake of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  Part of it feels like an endless binge that just goes deeper and deeper.This is absolutely well-written and has a sort of driving rhythm to it that just keeps turning the pages.  It is a dark, foreboding journey and its well worth reading.  But, dont expect it to follow the classic patterns of a standard novel.  It is not like that at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NL6QAHKW28FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QCE4LKI#wasThisHelpful","R3NL6QAHKW28FV","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Campbell's Jimmy Flannery mysteries are altogether unlike anything else in the mystery genre, or at least unlike the classic 1950's private eye working out of a small office waiting for the next voluptuous blonde or redhead to sashay in and spin his head.  Fact is Flannery is not even a private eye.  He's a sewer inspector and ward leader for the 27th ward in old machine run Chicago.  Flannery's got a cat's curiousity and a cat's nine lives as well.  Leroy Brown may have been meaner than a junkyard dog but no one is as relentless as Flannery not even a junkyard dog.  Campbell's brilliance here is turning the whole classic mystery genre on its head and recreating it in the form of a black slapping insider who just can't let go of a bone.This particular edition of the Flannery saga may lack the kind of relentless action you might expect in a mystery novel.  In fact, most of the book is Flannery jawing it up with one connection or another.But what makes it all work and do hard to put down is the narrator's voice which is at one homespun and like that of the cheery guy you just met in the bar.  It does start out with Flannery talking on about his domestic situation but that's really his manner of introducing himself.  The real story is about influence peddling, the world of machine politics slowly coming to an end, the retirement of the old boss of bosses and his successors fighting over the spoils, a body, an illicit affair, and a fight over an old house and the dog that lives there.Just don't go reading this expecting a classic shoot em up mystery with bodies falling everywhere and a half crazed blonde not knowing enough to walk away from the crime scene.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36GF3EEH12CXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0340602899#wasThisHelpful","R36GF3EEH12CXW","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Dewey's Pete Schofield series, he takes a classic detective story and combines with some lighthearted banter between Pete and his red haired fiery wife Jeannie and Dewey makes it work.The Golden Hooligan (1961) is one of the best of the series and opens with Schofield awakening from a drunken stupor as his wife harangues him about spending all evening at the party with a blonde who was practically topless.  The dialogue works well and serves to rope the reader in to a tale that starts in an odd fashion.The story involves dead bullfighters, golden haired blondes in giant hats and almost invisible bikinis, body snatchers, knife wielding tough guys, a poet in a bathtub, beatniks living in shacks, and a don ready to return to California to reclaim his family landholdings.This is a  terrific book that is easy to read and a great introduction to the Schofield series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L9EI6EVPG96M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014E2T93S#wasThisHelpful","R2L9EI6EVPG96M","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emerson's Thomas Black series, published mainly in the late 80's and throughout the 90's, sets a slightly quirky private eye in Seattle and nearby environs.  This is the first book in a series of about a dozen or more books.  It is well-written and engaging.  One of the refreshing things about this book is that Emerson doesn't simply attempt to retell a classic fifties PI story.  It is a more modern take on the theme.Black is an ex police officer with some issues about firing his gun.  A good shooting with bad consequences can do that to you.  He rents his lower basement flat to a young law student, Kathy, who frequently pops in just when it would be uncomfortable for Black.  She is not just a hit dame though.  She is his close confidante and Pancho to his Cisco Kid or June to his Wally.  Sometimes Black bikes to witness interviews.Missing heiresses, angry industrialists, hookers, strippers, psychologists, and aunts with secrets people this book along with people popping up in clown suits.  And, here, Thomas is plagued by dog-murderers, burglars, and a tail he can't shake.There is a sort of quirkiness to some of the characters and you get the feeling reading this that it might develop more of a cult following than a wide readership.  Nevertheless, I certainly enjoyed it enough to look for the rest of this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q65T4ZFN9WQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345414055#wasThisHelpful","R1Q65T4ZFN9WQ6","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chased and the Unchaste is the seventh novel in Deweys Mac series, falling about mid-way through the series.  Published in 1959, this hardboiled detective novel is crisp and clean in its writing style.  This one takes Mac from his mean streets of Chicago to tinseltown, where he works as a bodyguard for the family of a famous producer, his nubile young wife, Carol, who likes to swim au natural, and four-year-old Linda.Much of the first half of the book takes place in the producers home with a revolving cast of estranged ex-wives, boxers, maids, cooks, nannies, executives, and the like making appearances.  Mac tries to narrow down the cast to the few who really could be threatening the family and this part of the story feels a bit domestic and cozy.  But, midway through, the story really opens up and goes straight into the familiar hardboiled territory with bodies turning up, mean cops turning on wiseguy out-of-town visiting private eyes, and the action really explodes.The Mac series is a lot of fun to read and one of the most underrated and least known of the private eye series from the fifties and sixties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FPG363ZJZY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013V27C5E#wasThisHelpful","R1FPG363ZJZY8","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dewey was one of those great private eye writers who wrote lots of books in the fifties and sixties, but simply isn't that well known anymore. He's a pretty good writer and his private eye yarns will stack up well against any of the usual suspects. Mac is a one-man detective agency with one friend on the police force, Donovan, and a host of enemies.Dewey throws a lot of different stuff into this one, including the rich girl with the corpse, the pair of hoods who beat him to a pulp, a pair of jazz musicians, the height of McCarthyism and the sinister attacks on even schoolteachers, the insidious influence of power and money, corruption, police beatings, and flower-wielding five-year-olds. With all these different themes and ideas, the plot gets quite a bit complicated and you could be forgiven if your head spins a bit at times with Mac racing from one disconnected thing to another.Like all the books in the Mac series, it's a good read and moves along swiftly, but it just misses being a great read with too many plot lines going in different directions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8U2O8MBW3DPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GK6FTK#wasThisHelpful","R8U2O8MBW3DPE","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cartel firmly establishes Don Winslow as one of the top modern American crime writers.  This is a broad, sweeping magnum opus of a novel that has historic breadth and scope and chronicles the modern history of Mexico and the Cartel wars that have absolutely decimated that country.  This work, at well over six hundred pages, doesnt feel long.  Rather, it feels overwhelming.  This continues the story about the Drug Lord (Adan Barrera) and the Border Lord (Art Keller) that Winslow began in 2005s Power of the Dog.  Winslow could easily have parceled out the 1200 pages that make up these two novels into half a dozen novels.  There is not one page extra here.  I wouldnt cut anything out of these books.This is the story of Art Keller, who, as a DEA agent in Mexico, saw his partner tortured and brutalized and vowed revenge on the cartels.  It is the story of his counterpart on the chessboard, Adan Barrera, who seems almost invincible, and who, even, in prison, controlled what seemed like half the Mexican government.  It is the story of a chess match played out between these two men, where every move by the DEA and the honest federales only seems to play into Barreras hands.  Knock out the drug cartels in one area and Barrera consolidates his power.  Knock them out elsewhere and local government topples.It is also the story of how an impoverished underclass in Mexico had nowhere to turn when even the highest levels of the government were on the take, when the cartels owned the prison wardens, the army, the local police forces.  It is the story of kids growing up in the slums of Mexican cities and barrios of American border towns who had nothing became narco-terrorists and how the corruption of the local police and federales took over whole swaths of the country and, as one army commander explained, it was not a choice between being on the take or not, it was choice for them as to which side to ally with because they either picked a side or die.Based in part on real historical events, the book tells the story of the clashes between the different cartels, each wanting to control the plazas, or the border accesses to the U.S.A.  It is the story of how the battle between these cartels became more and more violent until the savagery and death that ensued crossed beyond every line of decency.  Wholesale massacres became commonplace.  Torture became a normal way of life.  There were areas like Juarez where any police officer who did not support one cartel or the other was literally torn apart.  Heads were hacked off and whole dance clubs set on fire.  In the Juarez valley, journalists were killed and ordered to report only what the cartels wanted.  Whole villages were wiped out and the entire city devastated as if a full-out war had taken place.Another part of the story is how ultimately ineffective every attempt to contain the violence was.  How could a hunt for the drug lords be carried out when corrupt officials were bagging half a million dollars a month?  And, there was so much money involved that every time someone was taken into prison or killed, someone else took his place, more brutal, more savage, than the previous regimes.  And, the story tells how Washington failed to understand how much of a war this really was and required its agents to fight this war with one hand tied behind their backs.  And, how the drug kingpins used American policy to their advantage to stay in power and to wipe out their competition.This is a story that needed to be told.  It is so close to home, but few in America talk about what has happened just south of our border and how quick and ruthless the descent into savagery became.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPWPGHKNFFM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874996#wasThisHelpful","R1JPWPGHKNFFM0","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much of the to-do in the media talks about Go Tell A Watchman as a sequel to Mockingbird.  However, Although the events in Watchman take place twenty years after Mockingbird, it would be incorrect to think of these as a sequel.  Watchman was actually written first.  It was, apparently, submitted to a publisher who urged Lee to focus on Jean Louise's childhood and her father's famous trial.  Told through the innocent eyes of a child, Mockingbird became an instant classic and a powerful piece of literature for the civil rights era.  The message in Mockingbird was more subtle than in Watchman.  It also captured vividly childhood innocence.  Once Lee published Mockingbird, she never published another novel until in her old age the original Waychman manuscript was found and brought forth.As a standalone novel, Watchman is a slow, ponderous story about a young lady's return to her small Southern hometown after living in New York.  Returning to her home was incredibly disappointing.  Her father who could do no wrong suddenly has feet of clay.  This story is clearly about the civil rights era and it uses the opportunity to hit you over the head with its message.  It's also a young woman's coming of age story ala Judy Blume.As an additional layer of depth overlaying Mockingbird, the book is interesting.  It makes Atticus more complex, more nuanced.  He may have defended Robinson, but he's still a Southerner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JEJ992S3CZV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062409859#wasThisHelpful","R3JEJ992S3CZV4","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Block's Girl With the Deep  us on a very different kind of journey, a journey that has us crawling into the sewer holes that form a psychotic killer's mind.  That's why this isn't the straight-ahead pulp novel we were expecting.Doak might be a retired New York City policeman settling down in a small town to do some fishing, but there's more to him than meets the eye, including a more questionable past than we originally think.  There are things he's gotten away with in his past and, although he may justify his crimes, you gotta wonder how truthful he's being.  Oh, he's a charmer alright and it doesn't take long before women strip off their wedding rings and pretty much everything else for him.  But even adultery isn't quite enough for him.  The sex has to eventually become deviant and violent.  And, half the time you wonder how much of his encounters are real and how much are the fantasies he has concocted.Of course, Doak and Lisa have their meet-cute story about how she was going to hire him as a hitman and how he was going to get her on tape for the sheriff.  But even that gets twisted and Doak being who he is changed the play.  Is she the femme fatale out to finish off her husband or is it really Doak pushing her?This book is a lightning fast read and can be finished in just a few hours.  It's not filled with action in the sense of a guy in the run or shootouts in the street.  It's not a bank robbery story.  It's a lot slower to develop and there's a kind of psychotic madness that Block teases out of this work.  It may be quite titillating with vivid couplings, but there's a lot more beneath the surface.

"Frank Kane published a grand total of 29 Johnny Liddell novels between 1947 and 1967 plus countless short stories some of which were published as early as 1944 .  Bullet Proof is one of the earlier novels in the series, the fourth one.  If you like fifties-style private eye novels, the Liddell stories fit right in the middle of the pack.  They perhaps dont stand out as something unique and different, but they include the standard hardboiled detective working out of a one-man agency with an attractive, built secretary (Pinky), a sometimes friendly police detective, and a confounding series of events.  In this novel as in many of the Liddell novels, he also has a gal pal, Muggsy, a redheaded, leggy cub reporter and, in between drinks and things, they often kick around the mysteries he is dealing with.  It is a fine, enjoyable series.This particular novel starts off with a furious pace of gunfire and action that almost makes you think this is a Spillane novel.  It features a mysteriously disappearing client (but one who actually pays her bills in advance), gangster-movie type rub-out attempts complete with tommy guns and the like, police detectives who find it suspicious that Liddell keeps showing up with corpses and smoking guns.  It is well-paced and a quick reading.  While it may not stand out too much from the mass of fifties-era PI novels, you will never go wrong picking up a Liddell story and certainly will not go wrong with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDDCIEJTI4I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KD5IOK#wasThisHelpful","RRDDCIEJTI4I6","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you haven't read a Jimmy Flannery mystery, you've certainly been missing out.  These are fun, fast reads that are finally available as kindle books.  Campbell sets his stories in the great city of Chicago, steeped in the world of patronage and favor for favor.  Flannery is no detective, but he seems to always be stumbling on corpses and, when he does someone the favor of investigating the situation, more times than not there is some politician whose put out the word to warn him off.Flannery is a sewer inspector and precinct captain and, in the Chicago tradition, he seems to spend more of his time doing favors than anything else.  Some of the best scenes are when Flannery sets out to talk to a political connection and he learns whose leaning on who.Like a lot of the Flannery mysteries, this one has a plot extremely reminiscent of old time paperback mystery novels.  A beautiful model disappears and Flannery starts nosing around and trying to find some answers.  On the way, he trips over a corpse, a retired madam, a lonesome salesman, a photographer and a well-connected politician.  And this model might not be as innocent and pure as Flannery once thought.Campbell does a great job of setting out the narrator's voice and placing this story in the neighborhoods of Chicago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZIBC3W6SRJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015T56Q4E#wasThisHelpful","R37ZIBC3W6SRJX","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absolutely terrific book that should have wide appeal to many mystery readers.  Campbell has taken many classic Hardboiled detective themes and managed to wrap them in an entirely new package and, in doing so, he has created a detective novel entirely unlike anything else out there.  Here he has the dogged investigator working on his own with all of the bureaucrats and the mobsters warning him off.  He has a story about corruption and girls who come to the big city expecting to make a new life only to end up in the morgue because that ended up being the most convenient way to shut them up.  This essence of this tale can be found in dozens of fifties paperbacks.What makes the Jimmy Flannery stories unique are that Flannery is narrated in perfect cadence capturing his Irish Chicagoan persona.  Flannery is a precinct captain in the old patronage system of Chicago where votes were bought by doing favors like greasing the wheels so a fireman who drove his car into the lake after having a few too many thirty days short of earning a full pension at thirty years can rest in peace knowing his widow is taken care of.  Favor for favor, markers being offered, this is Flannery's world, a world starting to change with the old neighborhoods changing.But what happens when a bomb goes off at a clinic and a young girl and an old woman dies in his precinct and everywhere Flannery turns someone is trying to squealch the investigation and Flannery may be like a junkyard dog once he gets his teeth into something, but at a certain point can he fight the entire power structure of Chicago.But it's not just the Davey and Goliath one man against corruption and evil story that makes this book.  It's all the neighborhoods and the bars and the hangouts and all the people in this neighborhoods from all these different backgrounds that Campbell brings to life.Campbell took a large risk having part of the plot revolve around the bombing of an abortion clinic, but he managed to humanize people involved on all sides of the issue.At bottom, this book is simply a top notch mystery and stands with the best of them for its well crafted plot and for a writing style that just pulls you right in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOIRINULCS0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153KUVUK#wasThisHelpful","RCOIRINULCS0Q","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Girl With The Sweet Plump Knees is a terrific old-style paperback private eye novel.  You might think this one was a soft, cozy take at first with all the light banter and hanky panky between Pete Schofield and his sexy redheaded wife Jeannie.  However, there's much more to this novel including a full-on boxing tale, an active riding ranch, a pair of hoods, a blonde babe in a fast car, gambling, strip clubs, and murder.  This is a fast-moving and well-written tale and just an all around top notch read.  Dewey knows how to tell a story and how to tell it well.  Even the lighthearted portions of the story are good.  Recommended read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RIM624RTBGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014E2T9EC#wasThisHelpful","R38RIM624RTBGZ","A2GGSOEKD5VCPK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GGSOEKD5VCPK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Viva Labs The BEST Doctor Recommended DHA Prenatal supplements.This item was given to me for my review.I will not even pretend that I have been taking these supplements long term. This is a new supplement to me, so I can only share what I have observed short term. DHA for adult brains has shown promise in reducing inflammation, as well as impacting the brain's structures and signaling systems. Additionally, DHA has been used to prevent migraines in teens and adults. I am taking DHA for brain health and to prevent migraines. The pills are gels and very easy to take, and I can easily take two tablets at the same time, once a day as directed. I have a hard time swallowing pills, so this was a nice surprise for me. In the short term, I woke up without my usual background headache in the AM for the first time. There is no way to know if this will continue over the coming months, or at what regularity, but it is the first product I have tried that seems to have some research to support it. I am hopeful. So, my initial impression of this supplement is that it shows great promise and is easy to use in my daily life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LYRV3K6C598T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JTF2LO#wasThisHelpful","R1LYRV3K6C598T","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This item was given to me for my review.Dogs like to crunch water bottles. At least, my dogs seem to be really into it. I thought that this toy would be good because it is basically a water bottle and a noise maker like you would find in a doll wrapped in material and with a stuffed head. This Bottle Giggler was grabbed out of my hand by my border collie/heeler, and she really had a good time with it. I could tell that she really loved the crinkling sounds it made as she bit it and tossed it around. However, though the bottle in it was more heavy duty than the water bottles I sometimes buy, after a few chomps, the bottle is flat and does not crinkle anymore. I would buy this item again, if it is not priced too high, but I would understand that it is not a toy that will last a long time at the same level it does when you first purchase it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T60BDSU63RB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWDXO1O#wasThisHelpful","R3T60BDSU63RB1","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was given to me for my review.The Outward Hound Wobblerz Monkey Plush toy is not a really large toy, but is big enough for my 55 lb. bordercollie/healer/whatever mix. Marcy loves thinking toys, and she really gets a kick out of toys with kibble in them. This toy is a roly poly treat dispenser that does not hold a whole lot, but seems to keep Marcy busy for more than the few minutes a lot of toys do. The treats do not come out super easily, so, for a smart dog, this is a good point. I would not give this to a dog that guts stuffed toys, like my other dog, because its life span would be short. My only complaint is that I had a hard time screwing the bottom on and off, and initially removing the plug that allows the kibble to be dispensed. I would have liked it to be bigger, so it can hold more, but Marcy is getting fat, so maybe that is not such a bad thing.

"This book was given to me for my review.SPOILERS.There are not too many books written about the Dark Ages, probably because they were a bit grim at times. War was rampant, and living conditions were not as romanticized as the High Middle Ages came to be. Avelynn, by Marissa Campbell is an interesting historical novel about the Dark Ages,and Campbell does a good job describing the setting, living conditions, government and general customs of the time. Avelynn is a good historical, and even a love story, but it is not a romance. Not unless your idea of romance are a few quickies in the woods. However, if you are wishing to read a good historical with good descriptions and a more true to life love story of the time, this is a good one to read. It is not, however, a PG book. There are some descriptions that definitely fall in to the Mature Audience category. It was, after all, a brutal time. I enjoyed the novel as a whole, though I wish the author could have dumped the ""high spirited heroine equals stupid decisions"" trope, that I am growing so incredibly tired of. The heroine made one mistake after the other, and if the rest of the story had not been so strong, I would have tossed the book. But, the rest of the story is very interesting, and I found I could not put the book down. This is a book for someone who really wants to come away with a feeling for the time, and who does NOT want a cozy romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8KEL1OZLNXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250063930#wasThisHelpful","R3A8KEL1OZLNXN","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel was given me for my review.SPOILERS....Being brave and trying new things that frighten you should not be synonymous with being foolhardy. However, the author of How To Be Brave, by E. Katherine Kottaras, has her heroine, Georgia, doing things that are less brave and more self destructive. Accepting drugs from the one girl in school that you don't really know but is obviously messed up is foolhardy. And, I have a hard time with how Kottaras treats the issue of drugs in the story. The ""people are going to make mistakes"" defense is true, but can, also, be a weak attempt at downplaying the kind of behavior the 12 Steps walk you through. Additionally, when Georgia tells her old world dad that she might do pot and drink alcohol in college, but those are her decisions, and he needs to accept that, I wondered why she would even mention it to him? It seems selfish. You plan on doing it? Okay, your decision, but show a little mercy, and leave him out of the loop. Frankly, it is one, of many, examples where I found Georgia to be self absorbed to the point of unkindness. And, what is that whole thing with the party? If you are THAT messed up, and you made THAT big a mistake, then why are you planning on a potential repeat performance down the road? Hello, a little self realization here! I loved the supporting characters, though. I even found Evelyn to have more depth and to be more of an empathetic character than Georgia often is. I loved the Dad, and I really think Daniel and Liss are interesting characters, too. Georgia is a mixed bag of nuts, but I did care about her story, her art, and her list,  and I enjoyed those moments when she has some emotional clarity, even if she seems to contradict herself at times. The story is interesting, especially the last half, but I was able to put it down and not come back to it for a while. Not my favorite of the many YA books I have read. I definitely do not expect young adults in these stories to not make mistakes. There would be no stories, if that were the case. However, the author seems to send a mixed message of what was learned in this situation. Her father obviously loves his daughter, but unconditional love does not mean unconditional agreement with a child's decisions, and I felt that Kottaras allowed Georgia to lay too much of the blame on her parents, while only accepting some of the blame, with justifications, herself. I get that being a teen is a somewhat self focused time, I totally understand what losing one's mother at that age does to one. I have been through all of it. However, there was a missed chance in allowing Georgia to be more honest with herself. The author came close, but, for me, just not enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3T95UV0PZWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072808#wasThisHelpful","R3E3T95UV0PZWP","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was given to me for my review.I suppose everyone is looking for something different in a bathroom spray. I wanted something that had a nice scent but not of flowers. I mean, I have NEVER smelled a bathroom where flowers and poo make a good combination. Ew. I chose the Juniper scented Poor-Pourri Before You Go Toilet spray because I thought it would be a nice choice, and since it is supposed to be used BEFORE you begin, it needed to be a smell that did not give me a migraine like most bathroom sprays. Well, I could not smell Juniper in the spray. Normally, that would have knocked the spray down several stars, except what I DID smell, a sort of citrus/ginger smell, is so very pleasant and efficient at covering the NOT pleasant bathroom smells, I gave this product four stars. What is more, the scent lingers in the air for a while after use, so you can make your getaway with your dignity intact. I don't suppose it will fool EVERYONE, but it certainly beats the alternative of other sprays I have tried. The bottle is purse size, though I would suggest putting it in a sandwich bag to keep the essential oils from getting on your purse. This is a nice product. I think I would like to try other scents in this brand to see what the differences are. However, I, personally, could not discern a particular juniper scent, though the citrus and ginger may have overpowered it. Very nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRVJMFA6XMTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW6S75K#wasThisHelpful","R2YRVJMFA6XMTB","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel was given to me for my review.The pace is steady, the hero is someone one can admire and empathize with, and the quest is noble. The Letter for the King is a good, old fashioned adventure story, that is long on interest but short on anything that would offend most parents. Written in the 1960s, the storyline of a young man on a quest to bring a secret letter to the King, is old, yet always new. Tiuri, our young hero, is a genuinely good guy. He is everything one should be in a knight, yet he is not a knight. He gave up that chance by doing the right thing, at the right time, for the right reason. A lot of what drives this story are the decisions people make and the consequences those decisions bring. Another theme is that while the goal of the quest is important, so is the journey itself, and Tiuri's journey is as much a pilgrimage, as it is an adventure story. The story is written in a linear fashion, like journey stories of yore. Tiuri, and later his friend Piak, are constantly faced with how to reach their destination alive. Yet, the story, while involving some violence, is not really a violent story. It was nice to be caught up in a plot without grisly detail. The only negative in the story, for me, is that there were a few spots where the author got bogged down in too much detail over things I was not particularly interested in. However, the rest of the story is interesting and fun. I would have read this story to my sons. A perfect night time book for a wide range of ages. The pace is soothing, but it kept my interest through most of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FREJJZQ3XFV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545819784#wasThisHelpful","R2FREJJZQ3XFV9","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was given to me for my review.My family likes rice, and I usually make a slightly sticky medium or long grain rice similar to what we ate in Korea. However, I noticed that several recipes I have in my recipe books suggested using parboiled rice. Zatarin's Extra Long Grain Parboiled Rice is the first time I have used this type of rice, and I understand why the recipe books mentioned it. This rice did not get mushy when I made Arroz con Pollo. The rice held its shape, and it tasted good. I plan on using it for those recipes that are multiple ingredients because it really did work out much better. However, for gumbo and other dishes, I will be using the stickier rice.

"This item was given to me for my review.I am the un-fun house. My kids are grown, and when little ones come over, I have nothing for them to play with. I remember that my brother and I absolutely LOVED blocks growing up, but the set I bought my boys went through two dogs (sometimes literally), magic markers, lost pieces and something sticky. I wanted a nice set to have on hand. Well, I don't think this block set is just for kids. It is really nice with unusual shapes and a instruction book for building. It comes in an open wooden box for storage, and there are a LOT of blocks in the set. The colors are bright and cheerful. This is a more mature block set with smaller pieces, so it is not appropriate for anyone who still puts items in their mouths. It is not appropriate to leave out around your dogs, since some dogs have the common sense of a tic tac (yes, Clover, I mean you.) However, it is a great set for any child....or adult....who likes to build, and who has decent fine motor skills. I found building with the blocks rather soothing....when the cats were otherwise occupied....but I, also, like legoes. All in all, I am very impressed.

"At first when I read this novel, I found myself really frustrated with the main character of Alison. She was such a whiny milquetoast. While the abuse and neglect she suffered was very sad, even I found myself frustrated with her character. When Fred, the butcher, comes into the picture, Neale creates an unlikely, but totally lovable hero. This is when the novel takes an upswing, as the plot begins to take on some depth. I normally love a Cinderella story, but Alison was actually really self pitying in a selfish sort of way. Often, she seemed to have little regard for the feelings of others which would have made for a more empathetic heroine. However, it began to change about halfway through, and then I found the book hard to put down. It was a cute story. Probably more like 3 1/2 stars, but I will round up.

I assume that our tastebuds are just different because I really like the flavor of Healthworks Raw Certified Organic Maca Powder. To me, this product taste like malt balls without being too sweet. I put mine in a barely warm cup of soy chai latte because the temperature is hot. However, I have read different things about whether to heat or not to heat. I am not really sure what the final consensus is on that. For now, I am taking it in warm chai, and this winter I will take it in hot chai. It is really yummy, and works well with these flavors. I barely notice the teaspoon I put into my cup, except for that slight malted flavor I mentioned earlier. I find that it does not give me migraines like coffee does, nor do I feel as jittery. I do, however, feel more alert. I have not taken this product for a long period of time, so I will update if I find long term results vary.

"This item was given to me for my review.I am not familiar with Hemp Protein powder. I have not used the product before. When I saw this stuff, and its rather unappealing color, I was not exactly enthused to try it. However, I looked up Hemp Protein, and I liked what I read. I smelled the stuff, and I liked the smell. It has a grassy, organic smell that reminds me of the fields on our farm (where I know for sure we did not grown hemp!). I tried four tablespoons in a cherry smoothie I made that included frozen cherries, water, and a little unflavored whey protein. That was all. I really liked the flavor, The hemp has a nutty, oat-like taste, but milder. It was not overly chalky, and it did not overpower the cherries. It mixed in pretty well with just a little residual on the bottom of my glass, so that was a pleasant surprise. Often, protein powders do not mix in well, even though I put the liquids at the bottom. This product is a definite win for me. I am using it in other smoothies, and I will attempt raw cookies when I find the time. When that happens, I will post as to their success with this product.

This material is sheer and does breathe, which allows the product to be cooler than some adult diapers that extend the padding to the sides. However, this material is, also, flimsier, and harder to fasten if there is any problems with hand mobility. I have previous experience as a nursing assistant in a care facility, and I think this adult brief works more as a diaper and less as a brief. If one is bed ridden, then it works well, but, because of fastening issues, and fit, it seemed not as practical as other products might be. I did feel it is cooler than other briefs, but this would not be a product I would use if the individual was mobile and able to function on their own to any degree. It is the product I might consider for someone who is unable to function without out toileting help. The sides do refasten, since it is a loop tab similar to velcro, but it is awkward. I suppose advertising Prevails as a brief gives it a bit more dignity, but it just does not function as one. Still, worth a look if the patient is bed bound and over heats easily. Additionally, I dumped over a cup and a half of warm water into the brief and it soaked into the padding quickly and without leaking","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L11NYV9HNNII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NNEPEG#wasThisHelpful","R2L11NYV9HNNII","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was given to me for my review.Well, this is basically an easy to put together box that can be put just about anyplace where there is room. There is no bottom on it, of course, but you use gardening fabric on the bottom to hold the soil in, and to reduce discoloring. I have a discreet area by the garage where I do not care if it gets discolored, but I am using the fabric to help keep soil well contained. I bought this product too late in the year to use, since we are in 100 plus degree weather, and it would probably be kinder to just toss seedlings into the fireplace as try to plant them outside. However, I am preparing the area for spring. My frame will house herbs. It is the perfect depth for the same herbs I planted in pots, so I will double my plants next year. It is made to be easy to assemble, and it does not need special tools or anything extra. Not much more to say about a box, but it is nice to have and suits my purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10J3PBL2EDWL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKPBNGU#wasThisHelpful","R10J3PBL2EDWL5","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was given to me for my review.Jarrow Formulas Mastic Gum Veggie Capsules. Wellll, I am not sure what to say about this product. I cannot honestly say whether or not the product works for tummy upsets because I could not get past burping up the pine resin taste. I am not sure whether anyone else will think this smells and tastes like pine, but when I was growing up in Maine, we used to dare each other to eat pine resin, and there was even a pine resin gum at one time. Mainers tend to be hearty folk, and I think most of us suffered tongue damage from licking frozen swing sets, so our palates were not very sophisticated, but I digress. Mastic Gum reminds me of the taste of pine. Maybe not quite as strong as straight pine resin, since it is in capsule form, but I burped it up like the ghost of bad ideas past for the rest of the day. I tried it more than once because I want to be fair but I could not get past the burping. I don't know if this is a normal problem to have, but it is the one I had. I gave it a star for being easy to take and one for being natural.

"This item was given to me for my review.The Swiffer Wetjet Floor Mop Starter Kit comes with the Swiffer Wetjet floor mop, a few scrub pads and a small bottle of cleaning fluid. It does not come with the four AA batteries that I finally figured out I needed. I am sure it is on the package somewhere, but I did not immediately see it. Actually, I NEVER saw it. (I now understand what my grandfather complained about.) I started off the first time with REALLY dirty floors. I didn't even wet mop them to get rid of any border collie fur dry Swiffering might have missed, and there is ALWAYS border collie fur....Maine coon fur....tabby fur, etc, etc, etc..... What I learned is that the Swiffer will clean, but it is best used after you have cleaned a high traffic area with a regular mop, then the Swiffer can be used to maintain the floor on a regular basis from then on. What I liked about the Swiffer is that it cleans without my needing to bend over to mess with the mop head. I rotate the mop pad when it is really dirty on one side, and toss it when it is thoroughly dirty. It seems to do a decent job of cleaning, but a better job of maintaining a floor rather than trying to play catch-up. I will start using it daily to keep on top of things. I purchased more pads and solution, and that is another reason to use it as maintenance. You need fewer pads if you keep on top of things, and this can add up over time. However, it is easier on the back than my rag mop. I won't be getting rid of that anytime soon, but I will be using both. So, it is a good product, but I still see a need for a regular mop to be on the premises.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17CUD5DCJ4HOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNX7J6K#wasThisHelpful","R17CUD5DCJ4HOA","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The murder plot was interesting, and I was caught up in the politics of the back story. This is a quick read. I wish the book had been longer, but it is still satisfying. I hope the author matures Kate's character a little more. The age difference is less of a problem for me, if she is not behaving like a 6 year old. Great fun.

"This item was given to me for my review.Rubbermaid RM-PL1W Folding 1 Step Plastic step stool is a clever little gadget and easy to use. The stool states that it holds up to 300 lbs. and I am no where near that, but I am not tiny, either. So far it has held me, and my 6'5 husband just fine. The stool really does not slip at all, like the description says, and I have tile floors that are slippery. Additionally, it folds up, easily, and is easy to unfold and set up. I can put it in that space between the fridge and wall that goes unused. While I will use it as a step stool, my main use will be for those things that I used to normally kneel and do, or bend and do. The stool is the PERFECT height for cleaning baseboards, gardening and other down to the ground efforts. I am really pleased about that. It does not have a large platform, but that is actually better for me, since it takes up less space. My kitchen is crazy tiny. It is enough space for my ample derriere to sit on, and that is enough.

"This novel was given to me for my review. Kitchens of the Great Midwest by J. Ryan StradalWere I to have rated Stradal's novel over the first half, I probably would have given it four stars, at least. The characters, Lars, Eva, Fiona, Cynthia, and Jarl are weirdly compelling in their quirkiness. I loved Lars passion for both food and for his daughter, and passion and love, or the lack of both, are two of the themes in the story. This is a foodie book on one level, as the name might imply, but it is, additionally, about the sub-themes we often attribute to food, like nurturing, or abuse, or even apathy. However, about halfway through, it seemed that the book became darker, and there were scenes, like with the deer, that sickened me. There is, also, a lot of foul language, which I find takes away from some of the truly interesting and, at times, witty dialogue. One of my all time pet peeves in writing. Yes, some foul language may set a character or group of characters apart, but this was excessive. Some of the plot elements centering around death, grief, addiction and mental illness were repeated, probably to make a point, but, then again, it became grim. Still, Stradal writes well, as the first half of the book attests. I wondered as the book became more brutal, if the author had a point that I totally missed, or was going for shock value, or if the shock value of some of the scenes overshadowed what was probably a very interesting theme. I don't know. Definitely worth reading if you the negatives do not turn you off. However, though it is often hopeful, and has happy moments, it is often grim. Just so you know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HMKM5BRGMFXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052542914X#wasThisHelpful","R2HMKM5BRGMFXZ","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was given to me for my review.The ADHD Advantage by Dale Archer, MD, proposes to readers that there is a positive way to look at ADHD in young people and adults, one that gets largely overlooked by society's desire to treat ADHD as a disease, rather than a different way of thinking. Dr. Archer, who has ADHD, suggests that the pendulum for treating this learning difference has come to fall somewhere between the emphasis on medication and the non-med fear mongering of past years. Archer makes a strong case for everything that is right with ADHD and how this condition is good for individuals who have it, as well as society, at large. The book is full of examples from the famous to the not yet famous who have this ability, and the personal stories are a strong point of the chapters. After a bit of history is given, Archer explains, in multiple ways, that ADHD is only a deficit ""in certain contexts"" and is a large benefit in others. It is, in his words, a ""superpower"" for a lot of people (Howie Mandel, Terry Bradshaw, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs, etc...), but needs to be understood to be effectively applied. Certain career fields are especially a good fit for ADHD types, like sports, the arts, the military (I attest to that), and entrepreneurship, and certain lifestyles keep non-neuro typical types from being bored, which can be the kiss of death for many. Chapters cover education and learning, jobs, relationships, medications and non-medical interventions. What the book is limited on is more detail for some of the chapters, as it can be considered more of an overview, though a very helpful one. Additionally, the book is strongly skewed toward men and those with ADD with Hyeractivity, than those who tend towards a less physically active, plain distracted form that tends to be predominantly women (well, as of this writing.....definitions keep expanding). I got a lot from the book for my guys, and even for myself, but will look elsewhere for a book predominantly on the ADD without hyperactivity. (Hope I have that straight.....I am not a doctor.) As a positive overview, this is a great place to start. The fact that the author talked about different ways to deal with ADHD without over-medicating or without painting medication as evil, as well as why it is okay to do without medications, is a breath of fresh air to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208U22ZZCF73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633517#wasThisHelpful","R208U22ZZCF73","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It sprays on as a light mist, and it left my hair shiny, with some curl. In general, I liked the spray, but I did notice that it made my hair look oily when I conditioned my hair first. For my fine, but abundant hair, it works better if I simply shampoo first, no conditioner. My hair felt soft and not sticky afterward.

"This book was given to me for my review.John Schlimm tells a sweet, and, thankfully, uplifting story about his friendship with a lovely nun named Sister Augustine. Five Years in Heaven is chronicles the conversations that take place between John and Sister Augustine about life in general, God in particular. It, also, chronicles Schlimm's journey toward understanding himself better and his purpose in the world. The conversations are not necessarily earth shaking, since books on simplicity, New Year's resolutions, forgiveness, God and man have been around for a long time saying much of what Sister Augustine shared, but there is something very sweet and reassuring about how she says it. It is obvious that Sister was a woman who walked the walk, and I loved her pithy comments like, ""A closed mind is like giving the Devil a handful of grenades. Unfortunately, he has a pretty good pitching arm."" Is the story profound? Not really. The topics do bear repeating. In general I really enjoyed the little story of this friendship, and I got teary eyed at the end, but I, also, felt that Schlimm self promoted a bit much, and I would have liked to have heard more about Sister Augustine.

"This memoir was given to me for my review.Let me set the record straight. I really enjoy memoirs of people learning to overcome life's difficulties and gain insight. I chose Pieces of My Mother: A Memoir because it was based on a topic I understand well, a girl learning to live without her mother. The book began on the sad day when Melissa Cistaro's mother got into her car and just drove away, never to permanently, or even frequently, return. Cistaro does a good job of capturing that moment and every miserable vignette she shares afterward. I feel for her because she DOES get how sad and confused and hurt she is as a child trying to understand a broken mother. There were some moments when the author could find common ground with her mother as an introvert in the middle of mommy-burnout, but as a mother who loved enough to stay and hurt, it is obvious that there are some things that neither the author, nor this reader, can totally understand. Cistaro shares how her mother's leaving not only affects her, but, also, her brothers Eden and Jamie. This aspect of the book is well established in flasbacks showing small cruelties, self blame, and the need to cling, as well as references to current alcohol and drug abuses. The flashbacks are well written, but begin to feel like a rehash of the same theme. When she puts in the part about the kittens in the buckets, I had to set the book aside for a while, then skip ahead. I hate the book. I hate the total misery of reading it. I know the book description says it is ""haunting yet uplifting,"" but it was an ""uplifting"" desert for me. How do you rate a book that you wish you did not need to finish? I don't feel like there is much more to say about the author's mother than that she was obviously an addict with emotional problems, and that is sad, but I think her ex-professor had it right when he said she was a bit of a con, as well. Again and again the flashbacks tell the story. She is broken, got it. Cistaro is, also, broken, though by the chapter Clear Lake, she makes the conscious decision to turn her life around. But, that is the end of the book. Hopeful? For her, yes, but I struggle to say I would suggest the memoir to others. If the purpose of the book is to help the reader see her mother's dysfunction and the disastrous consequences, then that was established. But, a whole book of sad scene after sad scene? Perhaps it was cathartibut for the author. I hope so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYAE9OQ5H4XHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492615382#wasThisHelpful","RYAE9OQ5H4XHJ","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel was given to me for my review.Oh, my, a new, first in series that is NOT boring! On a Ring and a Prayer is a first in series book with a brand new heroine, Jessie Stanton. The novel is about a 37 year old newly dumped wife who hires a beach bum detective to find her dead beat husband. The story is sweet and funny with a characters that it is easy to rally around. Danny is not the stereotypical beach bum/detective/love interest (and, yes, there is a stereotype). He has morals and a Christian belief system that is alluded to, but the author does not beat the read over the head about. Jessie is a bit of an ingenue of sorts, but she is not stupid. With the help of her good friend Piper, and new friends Amber, Danny and Riggs, she manages to to make a new life for herself. Though I am not particularly into fashion, I was interested in her new business, and the descriptions of the styles. Danny often comes across as a little too good to be true, until one finds out about his past. The only drawbacks, I felt, were slight. The Grampy flashbacks disrupted the flow of reading and were irritating and largely unnecessary (No offense, Grampy). I would have liked the ending to be more finished, but since the novel covered a lot of territory in setting the series up, I did not feel as dissatisfied, as I might have.  I would, also, in future novels, a final conclusion to the last chapter, and I would like to see more of Danny and a bigger emphasis on Danny's job, with more mystery. Still, as a set-up novel, this is very good, and I look forward to more of this series.

"This novel was given to me for my review.Personally, I love English parlor mysteries where the bodies turn up dead, and I don't have to get into too much detail about how. I love the dialogue, and I love the humor that is often apparent. Beyond Belief does have these elements. There is some genuinely witty dialogue, though it is not evident throughout all of the book. Still, I did like the humor and observations of some of the characters. I appreciated that this book qualifies as a cozy, since there was no real violence, other than bodies inconveniently turning up. You'd probably find more violence in an American commercial. However, Emily Castles, who is supposed to be the main character in the book, is about as faceless and nondescript a heroine as can possibly be not described. I have no idea what this woman looks like nor what sort of personality she has. She is simply a prop, with a notebook....and I cannot even tell you what the notebook looks like. Other characters had more description, but I did feel that the author could have spent more time giving the novel adjectives in almost every area. I believe this is the fourth in the Emily Castles mystery series, but I am not sure. However, the problem does not seem to be that I have read the novel out of order. There is simply a lack of detail, as though the book were hurried, though it could be for other reasons. Throughout the book, Dr. Muriel exclaims about how clever Emily is and how she will solve the murder, but I have no idea WHY she says this, since Emily seems to be just a temporary office worker, running around with a notebook. Even if the mysteries should be read in order, some background information or detail needed to be provided here for the other characters in the story. After a while, I began to think, ""Shut up, Muriel.""  Those times when deductions or conclusions are made, are sometimes senseless, based on information that either does not make sense or was not provided. An example would be Mandy suggesting that Emily was brainwashed. Brainwashed? Really? That is not usually the first conclusion I reach. Even if she meant hypnotizing, it made no sense over the phone, as it were. The fact that Emily entertained the idea made it worse. As for the person and reason for the murders, I was disappointed. There were some genuinely good red herrings, but the final reason was a fizzle for me. And, what was with the drawing room conversations while people were drowning? I watch BBC, and I am pretty sure there should have been a little more reaction, even from the stiff upper lip crowd. That was nonsensical. It might have been a stab at humor, but, though my sense of humor is rather macabre, I did not think this qualified as anything but lacking. So, why three stars, then? Smith has a dab hand for humor and droll observations. I like elements of the novel, and I am willing to admit that I may have missed something by not having read the first three books (though I am not sure that is going to happen now because some problems with the story have nothing to do with that). I don't want to blast a book that made me laugh out loud a few times. However, I would say to someone wanting to buy and read this particular book, that if they have not read any of Smith's other books, they should start at the beginning, and if they HAVE read the other books, this one may not (I don't know) be up to par. Borrow it from the library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QB3JGZPR1N22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477849726#wasThisHelpful","R2QB3JGZPR1N22","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was given to me for my review.Prissy Elrod's memoir, Far Outside the Ordinary: A Memoir, is one of the most thoughtful, funny, sad, and uplifting stories of hope that I have read in a long time. There were times that Prissy/Christy exasperated me, but I could also relate to her. Sometimes, I have read memoirs where the author has been honest, but in doing so, has revealed that they may not be that nice a person in real life. Prissy is nice. She is not Mother Theresa nice, but she is nice in the way real, fallible people are. The cast of characters in her story add an almost surreal touch. It's true. You don't make stuff like this up! I loved Sallie and Du, and even poor Willie. I felt like Elrod was able to capture them with few words, and that is an art. I was often exasperated by their decisions and behavior, but not once did I think that I could not sit down over coffee with them and not be totally touched by their personal stories. Such a well done memoir. I laughed, I cried, I related. Prissy Elrod has a very nice touch with the written word, and I hope she expands her repertoire to fiction writing, perhaps drawing on the colorfulness, the goodness, and the brokenness of the people she knows in real life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REXRXH0QX1XTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=082530783X#wasThisHelpful","REXRXH0QX1XTC","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was given to me for my review.The Oleander Sisters by Elaine Hussey is the story of a close knit, Southern family on the verge of change, but battling past hurts. The basic synopsis has been done, so I would like to look at what worked and what did not work for me.The beginning of the book had a lot of dark foreshadowing, page after page of dark foreshadowing. The gist of this foreshadowing was that something bad was going to happen, only the author said it in several different ways, some more poetic than others, but all leading to a high level of repetition. While I understand that it was Sis' role in the family to be a worrier because she loved and wanted to protect everyone, her character verged on morose to the nth degree. However, perspective came from Sweet Mama and Emily, as well, so we were able to discern that they, too, felt like something bad was going to happen. And so on. It took me several chapters to get into the book, but, once I did, I really liked it. The plot began to build, and, as it did, the suspense, and the characters became more interesting. By the end, I really did feel the tension of the dastardly husband, the storm of the century and the sort-of love story, and I found that the novel went a lot faster. Hussey is not a bad writer. She is actually very good, but the beginning of the book was bogged down in repetition and a heavy handed attempt at building tension and hooking the reader.

"This item was given to me for my review.Alisa Kaplan's story, Still Room for Hope: A Survivor's Story of Hope, is an incredibly inspiring story of survival in the midst of incredible pain and degradation. Others have summarized the book, and I won't attempt to do that. I will address what I liked and found difficult with the story. First, the story is amazing and Alisa is amazing. I honestly do not think I could have come through what she did as well as she did. I am impressed with her, her parents, and those people who had the strength of character to step forward and help her. I am reminded that ordinary heroes still exist and walk this earth. I appreciated the tone of voice in which Kaplan relayed her story. I found it to be neither too emotional nor too stoic. I should think that is a hard balance to maintain. My problem with the book, really, is in her tendency to want to get sidetracked and try to say too much at times when she needed to stick with her original point. The book was generally an easy and captivating read, but for that. I, also, had issue with some of the examples of forgiveness she gave. While I am amazed and humbled by a child who would open their home up to their abusive parent, I hoped that they did not have children. I felt that while the other examples she gave at this point were touching, I wish someone had pointed out that reaching out to your son's killer or your abuser needs to be God initiated, since a person can find themselves in a dangerous or manipulative situation. Sometimes the author was repetitive, and I would liked to have seen a good editor go through the book a bit more thoroughly. So, the story is TOTALLY worth reading. It's tense and touching and an amazing example of the ability of the human spirit, through God's love, to overcome the worst humans have to offer. However, the book is a bit rough in its writing style, and some additional understanding of forgiveness needed to be, in my opinion, explained, since the topic was rightfully brought up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16UFRVC3OG9BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455553832#wasThisHelpful","R16UFRVC3OG9BE","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was given to me for my review.When I began this book, it seemed like it took me forever to just read the first 100 pages, and I thought it would be one of those disaster books that make you want to put match to paper. However, about the time Sister Giorgia entered the picture, I could feel that first flicker of hope. Up to that point, the book was feeling pretty grim, and Charles had not transformed into a character for whom I was feeling much empathy. The dialogue was strained between Charles and his ex-wife, and I sometimes was not sure what the characters alluded to in some of their cultural references. Sometimes, they seemed just as confused. Layer by layer, Charles, Pam, Alison, Cody and Giorgia display their own personal communication patterns, and it become clear that the lack of communication, and the ability to communicate, are shared by each one, though not always recognized. The underlying spiritual element was subtle but a strong ribbon throughout the story, with Sister Giorgia a rarely seen character that steals the scenes she is in, even though I can only make out about five words that she says. The book is tender, sad, happy, discouraging and hopeful. It is at times painful to read, too close to home, and wonderfully inspiring. I rarely give a book five stars, if I have trouble getting interested or understanding bits, but the slow build and my own problems understanding references and meaning fit so well in the overall theme of miscommunication, that I wonder if it was not the author's intent all along. This is a good story, quirky but touching. Very nicely done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JMMW9FRFU9IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547939744#wasThisHelpful","R2JMMW9FRFU9IL","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are new to or familiar with Flylady, or if you are drowning in the mess of your home, Hidden Treasures offers a visual example of what the Flylady routine can look like. Written as a fictional narrative of two women, this novel is not exactly highbrow literature, but, then, that would defeat its purpose and main strength. This is a self help book made more interesting by its format. The story is interesting and suspenseful, and I found that it was hard to just put down. It is a great idea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ORXU8Y49CONK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HE57WZA#wasThisHelpful","R1ORXU8Y49CONK","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was given to me for my review.Jeremiah, Daring to Hope in an Unstable World, by Melissa Spoelstra, was originally meant, I think, to be one of those video studies. However, the workbook can stand alone. I think it would work better in a group setting, but most Bible studies of this nature, do.I have not finished the study because it is meant to go a minimum of 6 weeks, but I have gone through the different days and weeks to see how the workbook is laid out and what the activities are throughout. Overall, from the parts I have thoroughly covered, and the parts I have partially covered, I can discern that this is a typical Protestant study (though not just of interest to Protestants) in a workbook format that is typical to other studies in a similar format. It is thorough, though not as in depth as, say, Beth Moore, who often looks into the meanings of the original Greek or Hebrew words. It is competently written as far as giving basic information, but harder for me to fill out now that I am older, unless I use a separate notebook. I miss having bigger areas to write in and actual lines for long answers. Some of the activities feel like busy work, but I enjoyed a lot of the reading and looking up Bible verses. I sometimes wished she covered more than she did. I actually like what I have covered in it so far, though I would prefer a different format. If I were giving it the exact number of stars it deserves, I would say 3 1/2, but I rounded up, since that is not an option. I think I just need to look for a Bible study with a different format.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R313DXDXWCFTMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426788878#wasThisHelpful","R313DXDXWCFTMS","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was given to me for my review.Apparently there is a learning curve for people like me. I got the Bialetti 06702 8-cup French Press Coffee maker, and it really is the easiest thing to use. However, it took me a bit to get my water hot enough, without bringing it to a boil (note to self: don't worry so much about it, just don't leave the kettle boiling for any length of time), and I had to figure out how much coffee to put into the press to get a good strong cup of coffee. It turns out that I need to put the same amount in as if I were using a drip coffee maker, if I want coffee to my taste. The coffee was very tasty, and I found that it was quite smooth, less bitter. However, I like my coffee VERY hot, and I did not feel that with the process being what it is, this coffee was as hot. I would rate this as a very good travel coffee maker, but I would not use it on a daily basis to replace our espresso machine. It is super easy to use, super easy to clean, and it is light. I like it, but I just want the hotter brew. Oh, one last thing....you do not actually put the carafe in the washing machine as directions imply. You put them in the dishwasher.

"This item was given to me for my review.Love, love, love, love this Curel Ultra Healing Lotion. The lotion seems to be unscented and gentle on the skin. So far, I am not having any problems with itching or rashes. I tend to be sensitive, so this is a plus. The lotion is thick, and it stays on the skin even in areas where everyday wear may cause other lotions to rub off onto clothing or be washed off during washing. Unless I do a good scrub with soap and water, my hands stay soft for hours, even through dishes (I assume because the soapy water is diluted). I am very pleased with this Curel product. I do not use Curel normally, though my pharmacist recommended it, but maybe I will change that. Certainly, I will want to keep using this particular lotion on my legs from now on. My legs are a hot mess and very dry. Another great aspect is that it is non-greasy. I can put the lotion on, and drive without risking life and limb because my hands slip on the steering wheel. This lotion checks all the boxes of what I look for in a body lotion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185D0L6Q8EEOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P9FP10#wasThisHelpful","R185D0L6Q8EEOY","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item was given to me for my review.Rhiannon Thomas writes a fairy tale for cynics.....all of us who cocked an eyebrow and said, ""And THEN what happened?"" after hearing the rather unlikely scenario of a princess awakening to a strange man in her bedroom, and not at least beating him away with her slipper.  A Wicked Thing is a tense ride through the Tale of Sleeping Beauty, except set after the princess is awakened and faces the emotional sucker punch of being orphaned with an arranged....sort of....marriage to a stranger. The question is often asked, ""Is our destiny the story that has been written by fate, the cosmos or others, or is it the story we have yet to write for ourselves?"". The novel is ripe with political intrigues, dastardly villains, interesting possible villains, and magic. I truly enjoyed the novel, but I did feel that the ending was a bit unfinished. I know it must be a part of a series by the way it ends, and I think I very much want to be along for the ride. I just felt that I wanted there to be a next step taken, if not completed. As much as I would like to say more, I cannot without giving away the story. Definitely, a series to keep one's eye on. I will at least read one more, but I hope the author is able to avoid leaving things too open and hanging; some questions do need to be answered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZWU3G4DXSXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062303538#wasThisHelpful","R3FZWU3G4DXSXC","ACUGBCEADYT6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACUGBCEADYT6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The theme of this game is obviously professional wrestling. Even if you don't follow all the ins and outs of this game, you will still have a good time playing it.The game is entirely card driven and comes with 6 wrestler figures and a deck for each one, plus a board. Each wrestler has a unique deck of 30 cards and each card is a wrestling move. The game is played over a number of rounds. You are taking turns trying to win moves against each wrestler in the ring. The game wins when one wrestler is either pinned or doesn't have any cards left to make moves.This would be great for anyone who loves wrestling or has a love of the nostalgia of wrestling past.

"I was excited to get to try out this bathroom spray. I have used other sprays in the past and am always up for a new product.First off, this works. it will not totally mask the 'just used the bathroom' smell. However, it will diminish it considerably.With that said, my favorite thing about this is the packaging. The dark colored bottle and black label make this unassuming and hard to distinguish what it is. The other brand I use is more tongue and cheek with its grandmotherly label and bottle. I like to keep this out where it is easy to retrieve and most importantly, not an afterthought.I wasn't crazy about the fragrance, though. I prefer more woodsy, natural fragrances like sandalwood and juniper. The strawberry is too sweet for this application. In a kitchen or as an average air freshener, this is a pleasant smell. Covering up bathroom stink? Not so much.All in all, I was pleased to receive a bottle in exchange for an honest review and would try the other fragrances in a heartbeat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI53A7T1SIVTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2LHSGA#wasThisHelpful","RI53A7T1SIVTZ","AHRNDSKWH1YBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHRNDSKWH1YBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an 8 year old and a 12 year old. Both were just shy of 9lbs at birth. This didn't do my muscles ""down there"" any favors. So since their births, I have relied on a good washer dryer and regular pads to deal with colds that come with a lot of sneezing and coughing.This time, I was happy to have these on hand to try. After 4 days of constantly changing my pants and underware, I finally broke out the package, read the directions fully and gave it a go. I am very happy to report that aside from a few very full bladder moments, these have worked quite well.After insertion, there was a slight discomfort the first few times I used them. I haven't used a tampon in many years, so I think this was just a normal adjustment. I also felt a little tightness, which I typically also feel during a pap smear. This also lessened with use. Removal can be equated to removing a nearly dry tampon. If that makes you cringe, then I would recommend investing in a water based lubricant to make it easier.I had no side effects, although using tampons was easy for me so I didn't expect to have any problems. I am fine with the #1 size for now, which honestly was larger than a super plus tampon. I would recommend anyone dealing with this issue to give this a try. Just read the directions well and know what this entails.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LETX7VDJ526B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGZSI80#wasThisHelpful","R1LETX7VDJ526B","AHRNDSKWH1YBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHRNDSKWH1YBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using wet wipes for make-up removal. In recent weeks, I have become disenchanted with the pulling on my skin I have to do to get my mascara off. It takes several harsh passes of the wipe to get it all and even then, I notice spots on my pillow when I wake up.I wanted to try this because I am skeptical of oil based makeup removers but I trust Neutrogena products to not steer me wrong. Thankfully, I was right. The oil, easily dispensed onto a cotton puff or round, easily glides across my skin and somehow, removes the mascara I had to work so hard to get off before. After 2 passes and another wipe to clean, my lashes are completely free of makeup. It doesn't leave my skin oily or create any new breakouts. It isn't heavily perfumed and easy to store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D9FB3MIBA8FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2VQZC4#wasThisHelpful","R2D9FB3MIBA8FF","AHRNDSKWH1YBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHRNDSKWH1YBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In addition to being pretty, this vacuum was very easy to assemble, just a couple of screws to attach the handle and attachment holder. It includes any attachment that you might need including: crevice tool, turbo tool, pet hair tool, 3-in-1 pivoting brush and a telescoping wand, plenty of attachments to vacuum stairs and dusting. Changes height automatically for different types of carpet. The removable wand makes easy work of hard to reach places and reaching those areas that are hard to reach. Attachments are easy to switch out and it's easy to switch between carpet/hard floor cleaning. There are controls to turn on the beater brush for carpets and it automatically stops the brush when in the full upright position. There is plenty of cord for going up the stairs or across many bedrooms.The only negative is that it is quite heavier than I thought it would be. The canister is 14 pounds and it becomes a burden to carry around once detached to clean stairs or be more mobile. The vacuum in total weighs about 25 pounds.

"This is a cool idea and sure to make a bag as a gift for any fan of Minecraft. Bonus points to those who are interested in stop motion animation!My 8 yr old son has used the Lego stop motion app and the OgoBild animation set with camera, so he is well versed on what kind of patience is needed to make these short films. We unpacked the box, with the backdrops, individual pieces and stand for the device.We downloaded the app on both a Mini iPad, iPod Touch and an iPhone 6. No problems on any of the 3 devices. Each fit fine in the holder without a bulky case, which we had to remove off the iPad. It was seated perfectly in the notches on the stand. There were shaky moments when my son went to take a picture. He still needs to push the button and this something throws the whole thing out of whack. This was the biggest problem of the whole set. But considering his Lego masterpieces were made not using a stand, it was a great improvement on what we are used to.The set itself is fine. However, considering the price point is $40, I can't rate it higher. There are ""exclusive"" mini figures and more are available for a price at most toy stores and online. The backgrounds are double sided which make 4 different ones. In two separate places on Amazon it says ""6 background options.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJUDC4WX04PI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RZ628O8#wasThisHelpful","R2RJUDC4WX04PI","AHRNDSKWH1YBT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHRNDSKWH1YBT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an 8 year old boy, therefore I have a plethora of Legos in my house. While he used to build and then never touch again, recently he has become more adventurous and wants to build the set then take it apart and see what else he can do.We have the Lego Idea Book and a few other hardback, beautiful Lego books around the house that have been well loved and well used. This new LEGO Awesome Ideas book is full of EVEN MORE fantastic ideas. It is split into five categories: Outer Space, Modern Metropolis, The Wild West, Fantasy Land and The Real World. You can even learn how to build a LEGO world from scratch using the themed worlds section.A great gift for any Lego enthusiast, it is packed with projects, although there is a need to have a well rounded Lego collection in order to make many of the items.

"We have been fans of the OgoBild line of toys for a while now, having several sets that get regular use by my 8 year old. When he started showing interest in stop motion Lego movies, he tried to experiment with various iphone apps. He found them all very frustrating because the phone woul be knocked over or fall while placing the next sequence. We were both thrilled to find this set.The software is easy to install and not hard to use, the camera quality is enough for this set I wouldn't film precious memories on it.) Included are many pieces to build to your heart's desire. The pieces are easy to manipulate although can be hard to connect to one another. We found the more you use them the more they loosen up.After playing around with the Ogo set, I found him moving along to Lego and his sister even took over and did some My Little Pony.

"Eagle Creek Travel Gear Pack-It Starter Set includes a medium Pack-It Folder, a Pack-It Cube and a Pack-It Half Cube.  I travel a lot and often will be going to very different types of places during one trip.  For example, a conference in one place that requires dressy clothes followed by a week spent hiking and having fun.  So, I need to bring different types of clothes and I need to organize my luggage well to reduce space.  I already have two of the packing cubes and they are integral for organizing my luggage when I pack.  I was definitely keen to expand my collection of Pack-It accessories, especially since they are designed to integrate well with my Eagle Creek luggage.The purpose of the Pack-It Folder is to be able to fold button down shirts and pants and then to hold them in place to minimize wrinkles.  You can find videos on YouTube which show how the folding is to be done.  There are also instructions on the plastic sleeve which comes with the folder and which you use to fold the clothes.  I have mixed thoughts on the use of the folder.  While I do like how well the shirts and pants are organized, there do tend to be lines on the clothes where they were folded.  For dress shirts, I like to use the bundle wrapping technique instead because I think it wrinkles the shirts less and use the folder for polo shirts or for packing dress shirts for my return journey.  For the basis of the bundle, I use one of the Pick-It Cubes filled with t-shirts.The Pack-It Cube is great for holding t-shirts, underwear or items that would normally just float around your bag.  I roll up my t-shirts and then fill the bag.  Because the t-shirts are rolled and held in place, they dont wrinkle as much as if they were just rolled up in the bag.  Plus, I know where the shirts are located so that I can find them without digging through my bag.The smaller, Half Cube is useful for organizing smaller clothes or loose items.  I use it for my running gear to keep it separate from my other clothes.I have been travelling a lot of years and I have always sworn by Eagle Creek luggage.  I have used their backpacks during my backpacking days and now use my Tarmac wheeled bags.  I am bringing up their luggage here because with my Eagle Creek Tarmac came instructions for filling the  bag using the Eagle Creek cubes, kits, shoe sac and folder.  The bags and the travel gear are meant to work together to organize your luggage.  You dont need to have an Eagle Creek bag to benefit from the Pack-It Starter Set, but if you do have Eagle Creek luggage, it was designed to be used with the Pack-It system and so they work well together.  You can find more information about the travel system (bag and kits) on the Eagle Creek website.All of the Pack-It accessories are machine washable.  Like most other Eagle Creek products, the starter set includes a lifetime warranty.I highly recommend the Pack-It Starter Set if you are looking for a way to organize your luggage or as a way to reduce the wrinkling of your clothes when you travel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141OO4JQD2R8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9S84AQ#wasThisHelpful","R141OO4JQD2R8C","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At the class, she meets Archie from Scotland and on their first meeting, she flirts and then quickly joins him in bed after class.  One gets the impression that this could not be the first time she has done this.The story basically follows Annas life and thoughts, but her day to day actions are interspersed with paragraphs about conversations that occurred between Anna and her therapist and conversations or memories between Anna and her lover.  These interruptions of memories from her life are how the character development occurs through the story and they allow the reader to learn who Anna is and what drives her to the bed of another.I found the first half of the book to be tedious to read.  I could not relate to Anna or how she led her life.  The storyline felt as boring as Annas life at times.  It was difficult to relate to Anna who seems to given into every whim, who doesnt take her own life or family seriously and who just drifts through it all without fear of consequences. But it is thanks to the ongoing passages about her life that I did begin to at least understand her better.  The second half of the book therefore was more interesting to read and the last 50 pages or so were difficult to stop reading.Hausfrau is a challenging book to read as it is a perspective into the mind of an outsider who is full of despair in her own home.  Her husband inadvertently pushes her on her destructive course through his own actions and disregard for her.  And Anna keeps on the course even though she knows she should not.  The author allows Anna to blame much of her problems on the Swiss coldness and rejection of outsiders.  This theme is visited time and time again.  But, it is Anna herself who is to blame for the choices she makes with the opportunities she is given.  Can she keep it all together and hidden?  Will she be punished for her lies and adultery?I didnt really enjoy this story about depression, but the ending has kept me thinking about it after finishing it, so there is that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2AEE1E1AO8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997530#wasThisHelpful","RD2AEE1E1AO8A","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved playing operation as a child and so I was excited to share this SpongeBob edition with my nephews and nieces.  The game board is basically the same as the classic game, but features SpongeBob on the game board and the items you need to try to remove are related to the show.  You need to retrieve shells, crabby patties, etc from the holes in the board.The pieces are made of plastic and are a bit slippery to grab.  But the openings are generous for older kids who had little trouble with most of the pieces.  The wire connecting the tweezers is stiff and we found often got in the way while trying to remove pieces on the left side of the board where the wire is attached.Overall, good fun, but only for a short time.  Once removing the pieces was mastered the game didnt make it off the shelf for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ87R4J07SJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NO86SC4#wasThisHelpful","RZ87R4J07SJ3","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Olivia works for an investment firm in New York.  One day one of the traders in the firm comes into the office, yelling at her and goes as far as to pound on her hand, breaking two bones.  Olivia is then fired and her reputation is ruined because the traders puts out the word that she is trouble.  Olivia's life in investments is over.  Fortunately, she knows some tough guys.  Very tough guys including her uncle who has served time.  Her uncle hangs out at a place run by Beck who was wrongfully accused and sent to prison for a few years where he met the others.  Once out, Beck started helping other men who were coming out of prison to get back on their feet.  And now Beck and the others want to help Olivia.  What they dont expect is what sort of web they untangle when they do.Among Thieves is fast paced and suspenseful.  It is also violent and the author explains the damage that blows cause during fights.  The book starts with a brawl, setting the pace of the book, but also revealing a lot about Beck.Beck is the leader of the band.  He is indestructible and the man with the plan.  He is able to see several steps ahead and plan for it.  Beck reminds me a lot of Lee Child's character, Jack Reacher.  If you replace Reacher's past in the Army and his knowledge of how it works with Beck's past in prison, you have similar types of  backgrounds with the exception that Beck doesnt roam and his loyalty to family and friends are what keep him in one place.The writing is very good.  Despite the constant action in the book, the character development happens slowly as information is teased out of the characters through dialogue or thoughts.  The slow buildup is essential to the plot since it adds to the suspense.I really enjoyed Among Thieves and I look forward to future books by John Clarkson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VB8TENVQ82D2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047242#wasThisHelpful","R1VB8TENVQ82D2","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Calvin Klein ETERNITY for Men AQUA has a light, crisp scent.  It is described as opening with a hints of cold cucumbers, citruses, lotus and green leaves.  I do notice the cucumbers and citric which gives the fragrance part of its crispness.  There is also a bit of warmth with floral elements.I can see this as being a nice spring and summer fragrance, but not something that I would reach for in the winter.  I found that the scent fades away in a few hours.Overall, if you want to try an aqua, I recommend this.  If you are unsure if an aqua is for you, most larger department stores carry the product so that you can sample it first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37AKPLL95O06O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JVRIM0#wasThisHelpful","R37AKPLL95O06O","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TP-Link Archer D2 AC750 is a combined modem and router that offers multiple wireless protocols over 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz as well as one USB port (2.0), and Four 10/100/1000M RJ45 ports for connectivity.  The specifications for this router are good for the price, but TP-Link also makes other modem routers with higher specifications and more features.The range of the wireless signal depends on the spectrum you are using (2.4GHz or 5Ghz with 2.4 GHz offering better range, but potentially more interference from other devices).  I am using the 2.4 GHz spectrum in my two story, timber frame house and the signal coverage is good to strong throughout the house.Note that the modem is an ADSL modem and it will not work with VDSL.  If you are unsure which type of modem you need, check with your provider.To set up the modem, I connected it to my computer via the included CAT5e, Ethernet cable.  I used followed the Quick Installation Guide (you can find the guide and the manual on the TP-Link website).  Setup was actually very easy if you want just the basic settings.  I had the router up and running in no time.  In addition to giving your wirless networks names and security, be sure to change the administrative login name and password to prevent others from accessing the settings and taking control of your network.Future modifications to the router settings can be done by again connecting the router to a laptop or Using the Tether App, you can manage the router from mobile devices instead of needing to connect to it with a computer.  There is a QR code in the Quick Installation Guide which takes you to the App Store or Google Play to download the app.The AC750 offers a lot of advanced settings for those who want more out of their router beyond the basic settings.  The user manual is 120 pages long, but gives only basic information.  The manual does highlight what can be done, but you may need to search the internet to figure out what all of the advanced settings mean if you dont know already.  However, some of these settings were a lot more difficult than the quick setup.  For example, I tried to put the device into the Wireless Router Mode to use it just as a router and found the setup to be not at all straightforward.If you visit the TP-Link website, you will also find instructions for setting up a media server, storage sharing, a print server and a FTP server.Overall, a good combined modem and router capable of providing wireless coverage for your home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1024TENV0NC6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGMDGG0#wasThisHelpful","R1024TENV0NC6P","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the heady days of the '89 Democracy Movement in China, Li Huasheng, commonly known as Peanut found a way to express his anger at the government at the way his father, an intellectual was tortured during the Cultural Revolution, many years before.  He begins to give information to British Intelligence from his collection of like minded friends who are working on projects for the military.  But, the Democracy Movement came to an abrupt end and Peanut disappeared into prison.  Twenty years after that, the anger still burns in Peanut as he escapes and again contacts his network to try once again to sting the establishment that hurt his father.  But, China has changed dramatically during Peanut's twenty year absence.  He becomes a rogue operator in a world he doesnt understand.  So too has British Intelligence where serving ones country is changing into serving ones company first.  Peanut makes contact again and this time offers a prize that the British cant help but respond to.  And so begins a web of intrigue which drags the characters into it and threatens to destroy them all.Night Heron is fast paced and an enjoyable read.  The author doesnt spend a lot of time describing the locations which the characters are constantly moving through, but when he does the description of the locations in China and the conversations feel real, most likely due to the author's own experience in China.  The Chinese government is very definitely shown as Big Brother.  The constant motion in the book overrides the chance for character development.  We know the main character's past and their current relationships, but we know little about what they are thinking beyond how it impacts their behavior.I enjoyed this dark tale of espionage and if the author writes a sequel, I would definitely be keen to read it.  Just dont expect a lot of depth in the characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NCLPE45THC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316399833#wasThisHelpful","R9NCLPE45THC5","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Avery Index Maker Double-Column Clear Label Dividers (13150) add class to binders that are in use professionally or just look nice for binders at home.  If I am using a binder to organize documents for a project, I really appreciate the nice, printed tabs instead of hand written tabs that tend to smudge.  This particular set is good if you want to have a lot of tabs in your binder.  Avery also has smaller and less expensive sets if you want to have fewer tabs.There are minimal instructions with the labels.  For some reason, typing in the number on the Avery website didnt take me directly to Design & Print Online, but a Google search on the product number did.  From there, I could choose the text for the labels and add graphics (either my own or a stock graphic).  The design you create can be saved which is a time saver for situations where you want to use identical designs for different binders.  Printing involves the creation of  PDF through the website which you then print onto the labels.  The process could be better documented, but it is not difficult once you play around with the different options to see what can be done.  There is even live chat available 7 days a week if you run into trouble.Overall, I am pleased with the results and how the printed labels make the binder look tidy and professional.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F54RM1GFL6NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O48A1SK#wasThisHelpful","R3F54RM1GFL6NR","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is 1978 and Slaney has just escaped from prison after serving four years of a sentence for drug running.  Slaney and his friend from childhood, Hearn had this great plan to bring marijuana up from Columbia on a yacht.  It didnt end well for Slaney which is why Caught opens with Slaney is on the run.  While everything in Slaney's life is telling him not to, Slaney has a plan to get back into the drug smuggling business.  He just needs to get clear across Canada, get down to Columbia to pick up the drugs and to get them back.  What could go wrong?The writing is good and the development of Slaney's character is excellent.  As the reader, I really wanted him to succeed despite it all.  There is a constant give and take in the dialogues between characters which keeps the book moving right along.  However, the author does use a writing style which I found a bit disorientating at first which is to omit quotes when the characters are speaking to each other.  When you pick up reading again after you put the book down, you have to figure out what is being said and what is just an action or a thought.  This takes very little time to do, but I found I had to get used to it.I found the book to be a page turner and I was through it in no time.Overall, a good read.  This is my first book by Lisa Moore and I am now keen to read more of her works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22EMWWBVABB1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802122124#wasThisHelpful","R22EMWWBVABB1X","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow.  Stephenson is a master of creating world and storylines that are massive in scale.It is this year and a mysterious agent causes the moon to fracture into seven pieces.  This event is met by gawking from earth but not more concern other than beyond what could have caused this.  But, then the fragments collide, splitting the fragments into more pieces and the scientific community makes a horrible realization that the world as we know it will end.  The exponentially growing population of fragments will eventually fall from orbit, smashing the earth and increasing the temperature of the air to the point that nothing will survive.A plan is set to launch as many space capsules as possible to create a swarm of survivors that will continue the human population beyond the end of days in the hopes that thousands of years in the future, the Earth can be repopulated.  The plan is well thought out at first and then becomes more of a DIY effort as thousands volunteer to help to build the rockets to hurl those chosen by national lotteries into space at a frantic pace.  Finally a swam of space capsules hosting thousands of people is created in space to survive as the earth burns, but the survivors are faced with what to do next and how to survive in a very hostile environment where even a tiny pebble flying through space can kill without warning.It is a story of innovation, sacrifice and tenacity.  It is for the most part an optimistic story of how the human race would react to ensure its future when facing the end of the world. But the survivors bring with them the frailties that have plagued civilization including greed for power and life.  In that sense, it is not a pretty picture of the future, but probably a realistic one.The book is very thick and it does take time to get going but that is because the groundwork must first be laid for the story.  For example, the title of the book didnt click into place until I was halfway through the book.  From that perspective Seveneves is very similar to Anthem or Reamde.  However, the book is very readable and I did have a difficult time putting it down most of the time.In Seveneves, the author gives the reader a lot of detail to paint the world in which the storyline takes place which is typical of a Stephenson book.  The detail can go on for pages and so the author will often then include action or intrigue scenes so that the pace of the book does not get bogged down.Overall, I really enjoyed Seveneves.  I certainly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKMK45FXWQTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062190377#wasThisHelpful","R1NKMK45FXWQTK","ACHTDPEQYSEQL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACHTDPEQYSEQL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This battery case fits snugly on my Galaxy S6. In fact, it was a challenge to get the case to come apart so I could put my phone in it. Directions would have been nice!Beyond that, I have charged it several times with my phone in the case and with just the case. Personally, I don't notice the problems that I have read in the some of the other reviews but I will update if that becomes an issue in the near future.For now, I like the case. It charges my phone (and I can charge both at the same time) and it protects my phone. I have a new phone and have been trying different cases for days.I like the way this one fits my hand. It feels solid and is easy to grip. It hasn't gotten hot while charging or being charged. It seems to be a nice battery case that provides protection and the backup power needed to keep me going all day.I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for testing and giving my honest opinion of this product.

"This phone case for the Galaxy 6S is a really nice case. I have the white and it is a ""winter"" white which is nice as it is a soft color and it doesn't stand out when carried.I like that this case is snug. REALLY snug. It is not meant for the phone to be taken in and out of on a daily basis. It also has a wrist strap that can be removed.The cover includes three slots for credit or business cards and an area to slip your cash or key. It is closed with a magnetic strap. The magnet keeps the case closed (unless I put too much stuff in the storage compartments - it does have it's limits) and is nice to be able to carry it instead of my larger tote when running errands.If you are looking for a solid protective case for your phone that also serves as a small wallet, I would recommend this one.

"Almost every adult has memories of dragging the blankets off of the bed and lining up the kitchen chairs to drape the blankets across.  Along with the space under the kitchen table this area was instantly transformed into a special tent area to play in. It became the most magical place to play under at least until it was either bedtime and the blankets were needed or dinnertime and the chairs were needed. But there was just something special about playing in that area that even as adults we can look back on and smile.Creative play is so important for kids today with so much pressure to be plugged into all of the media devices and video games.  Parents have to work really hard to create playtimes that will both entertain and allow kids to become creative.  Sitting in front of some electronic device may be popular but really does little to develop creativity.Kids love to play pretend. Boys and girls love to dress up and imagine that they are knights in shining armor ready to slay a dragon or a beautiful princess all dressed up wearing a crown. It is so much fun watching childrens imaginations blossom when they are given the opportunity to enjoy creative play.The Click n Play Company encourages childhood creativity and has designed great play tents that today can be placed almost anywhere in your home and even make a great play area outside.  The Click n Play tent can be easily set up and can then be quickly taken down if the space is needed. Your little knight or princess will soon be slaying dragons when the knight castle tent is set up.  The tent actually looks like a small castle with perforated windows on each side and a door that will drop down making it become the perfect quiet area. The tent dimensions are 40 x 40 x 51 inches and only it weighs a light 2 lbs. It can easily be placed back into the carrying bag when playtime is over, a great storage factor. The 100% polyester fabric is durable and lightweight allowing the tent to remain cooler and is easily wiped off if caught in the rain outside.This fun item would make a great holiday gift but would also make a great addition to any childs bedroom for their very own quiet corner.I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for testing and giving my honest opinion of this product.

"This is a multi purpose stroller organizer. It will fit almost any stroller, jogger or handle bars. We have been enjoying this organizer for several weeks and have had it attached to several different things. It's awesome!It has deep storage compartments that keep everything you need handy and organized. I really like that the cup/bottle holder compartments are insulated. Our crew loves their juice and with this organizer I can slip either ice cubes in their sippy cups or place a small freezer pack to keep beverages and snacks cool for hours.I like the size of this bag. It is shorter in length than some and it just seems to be able to be attached to more things. The straps are easy to adjust. Oh, and the breakaway bag is great for either your personal items or just a diaper and a little pack of wipes. Perfect for when you don't want to carry the entire bag inside when you are eating or making a quick pit stop. I slip my ID and cash, along with my keys in the bag and then I do not have to carry my purse around on quick errands.I tend to overpack when leaving the house, so this bag has been great to help me trim back on what is packed. If you find you need more than a change of clothes and a few diapers, you might want to consider setting up a back up bag for your vehicle.

"Keeping the area around the cat littler box just got a whole lot easier! This mat is larger than any other mat we have owned. This allows space for your cat to step out of the litter box and take a couple of steps to remove any litter that came on their paws.The mat is tacky to touch. This helps to keep the mat in place and to pull off litter from the paws instead of it being tossed everywhere around the litter box. Not only does the area around the litter box stay cleaner, being able to pick up the mat and toss or return the litter can almost be done with one hand.Clean up is easy. Shaking the mat is all that it usually takes, but the mat can be washed when needed.If you have a messy cat litter area, take a look at this mat. Problem solved!I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for testing and giving my honest opinion of this product.

"Supporting your team colors has never been easier than with one of these sport ropes necklaces.I appreciate that they are handmade and have a breakaway clasp since my grandson wears it all the time. The breakaway clasp is a nice safety feature and will release if the necklace is pulled or caught on something instead of becoming a choking hazard.Necklaces are available in a wide variety of colors and lengths so you should be able to find the color combination for your team.I was not aware that these were so popular until opening the package with my grandson. As soon as he saw it, he called dibs, which is not like him. He put it on and I don't think I have seen him without since.Whether supporting your favorite team or being the cool thing to wear, this sport rope necklace is both lightweight and well made.

"If you travel to conferences or meetings like I do, then your phone and tablet always needs to be charged. I work on mine constantly, and it doesnt take long for the battery to wear down! But its not always convenient to sit near a wall plug or charge it in the car, so Ive started carrying the EMIE Memo *Just Shake it!* Pop Art Power Bank.The first thing I love about this portable power bank is the cover! I love the funky colors and design; its not just a boring solid color like so many other chargers are. Plus, if Im in a hurry and need to check to see how much power it has available, I give it a gentle shake and the LED light shows in either red, blue or green depending on how much charge is left on it.It also charges my devices pretty quickly too, with a 2.1A output rate. Thats as fast as some of my quick power chargers at home! And the power bank takes about 3-4 hours to completely charge up, so I can toss it on at home before I leave for my meetings and have it ready to keep me going for the rest of the day.No buttons to hit or remember to turn it off. The LED indicator light shuts off after about 10 seconds and the battery will stop after being idle for about 60 seconds.All in all, this is a handy and sometimes vital piece of technology to keep on hand.I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for testing and giving my honest opinion of this product.

"I have to admit I wondered about this at first when it arrived. However, I can now say that it works great!It was simple to pair with my phone. It makes taking selfies or group photos so much more fun and I don't have to carry around a stick.This weekend we put this remote control through the paces. We had a large gathering for a birthday and I set my camera up on top of a shelf and was able to take photos throughout the party without having to walk around with my phone. (remember to take the sleep mode off before setting this up).I would think this would be nice for photographers that use a tripod but want to interact with their subjects.

"Love my new mittens/gloves. My daughter knitted a pair for me last year but they did not have the thinsulate in them. My hands froze!These arrived just in time for the first cold snap of the year and I have hardly taken them off since they arrived. I like the way they fit. Not too snug yet snug enough to prevent air from getting in around the edges.The reinforced palm is great for when you are driving. It really helps with gripping the steering wheel. I imagine they will be the same for holding on to our ski poles this season.The light color goes with just about anything. They are fashionable and warm. The finger sleeves come to just past my middle knuckles.The only issue I have is you have to have the mitten part off in order to use your phone or other devices.

"I admit, I was a non believer before hooking up and actually using this hose. I doubted it could possibly expand from the little hose in the box to the  claimed length when in use.And I was wrong!This hose has a rubberized material that stretches when under pressure and retracts when the pressure is removed. The first time we hooked it up it stretched a good amount but not as far as I was looking for it to go. It did however, gain the needed length on the second use and has been working fine for about a month.It draws back up to almost the original size pretty quickly. We have it on the  porch out of the worst of the weather conditions. The directions do suggest storing inside during bad weather months. Since it is small when not in use, storing it in a bag or in the garage would be wise if you live in areas that have months of below freezing temps.I do like the multi settings on the sprayer and the hanging rack. Both make using the hose easy.Promotional or discounted product provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XX3YW67L8I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CUEZ6K#wasThisHelpful","R37XX3YW67L8I5","A3K7YJBGSYHGC2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K7YJBGSYHGC2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on one experience, this Bartelli can opener is brilliant.  I tried it on a 3-ounce cat food can (only 2-5/8"" diameter) made of unusually thick metal that is stubborn to open despite the tab.  The opener went around but nothing seemed to be happening and it did not stop by itself, so I gave it another go-around and pressed the button again to stop it.  When I dubiously lifted it up, the lid had been amazingly transformed.  It could now be reused, fitting neatly inside the original diameter of the can, and not a rough edge to be found on any surface!  A pet could eat straight from a Bartelli-cut can without being injured. It outclasses all other can openers I've ever used, and I hope it's as durable as it is elegant.  By the way, the packaging was very easy to open (no clamshell battle) and the batteries were super easy to load into the top (no tiny screws to mess with).  This tool seems to reflect the famous Italian talent for engineering design, but the country of origin is not stated on the machine, the box, or the paperwork, nor do they have a website.

"I like the style of this water pitcher and it reminds me to keep hydrated, but I wonder if the filters make it worth $64. I purchased it due to the focus on ""alkaline"", after reading the hype on how healthy alkaline water is.  Then I bought a pH test kit, and lo and behold, the alkaline level of Tucson tap water is exactly the same as this filtered water. I have no way of checking the quality of the filtering, but the alkaline part was my main concern, so I doubt I'd have purchased it if I'd  done more research first.  At least the pitcher helps me keep track of how much water I'm drinking, as it holds eleven cups of water, but the cover on the spout keeps coming loose.  Researching after the fact, I would not purchase bottled water either, but will probably go back to tap water when the filters are used up.

"The video demonstrating this doorbell decided my choice, and it turned out to be accurate.  The audio quality of the tunes is amazingly rich, especially coming from such a tiny source.  The non-traditional tunes are delightful, and there is more than enough variety.  The transmitter is touch-sensitive and more stylish than the typical mechanical button.  It took me a few tries to get the two units communicating, but the directions are simple and correct.  I love the styling and the performance, and the unit is well worth the price.  The only thing the Advantek DT41 could use is a weatherproof housing for the transmitter, but that would increase the cost.  However, since my transmitter has to be outside under an overhang, I made my own housing.  METHOD A:  (1)  Using the insert with a hole in the middle that comes with the doorbell, I bent the cardboard to fit around the transmitter.  (2) Lining up the bell symbol with the hole, I cushioned it with the molded white foam.  (3)  I put the transmitter wrapped in foam and cardboard into another small box and cut a hole where the bell symbol was located.  (4)  Covered the whole thing in Contact paper, threaded a  long twist tie through it, and secured it to my gate.  METHOD B:  Come to find out, the transmitter is so sensitive that it works even through a layer of clear stiff plastic, so you can weatherproof it simply with a clear plastic box.  Live and learn.  It is a fun change from my old doorbell which only played one tune.  I hope the Advantek DT41 will prove as reliable as it is elegant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHW0MGXGJZNTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5VR1DG#wasThisHelpful","RHW0MGXGJZNTN","A55S98JEGRUUX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55S98JEGRUUX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautifully designed machine, take it from a senior lady. I'd been looking for a trimmer that was cordless, lithium battery, no string, easy to handle, and affordable.  The MLG is the only one I could find after scouring the internet several times, but it exactly fits the bill.  It is light, maneuverable, easy to assemble (all the assembly is done except for adjusting the length, adding the handle and the guard).  I trimmed  the tops off the expired wild flowers in my whole yard (40 x 40 ft), and the battery still hasn't run out.  The safety instructions and provisions are excellent as well.  I thought I wouldn't need the wheel, but on second thoughts it comes in very handy when you want to set the trimmer down without damaging the blades.

"This solar pump is a little champion and works just as strongly as the more expensive ones that look the same.  The solar panels are interchangeable with similar models, but not with the kind that come with the fountains, which have the male/female connection reversed.  I have four of these pumps as I'm somewhat obsessed with fountains, and the oldest combo has lasted about four years with no problems.  The solar panels are very sensitive (unlike the kind that come in a frame), but they have no means of attachment so you have to improvise.

"This fountain is well made with a lovely glaze, but the problem is the solar panel and pump.  At first I thought there was a cover on the solar panel blocking some of the light (not just the protective film), but after prying off the top frame I discovered there was no additional protection!  So all I proved was that I had to glue the frame back together, and either the panel or the pump is defective, or both.  Rather than return the fountain, I spent another $15 for a different pump that works perfectly.  Hard water problems:  (1)  If you have hard water, keep putting vinegar or other water softener in it, because if you let the calcium build up you will never get it off.  (2)  Another trick is to coat the outside top surfaces of the fountain with oil periodically to prevent the deposits from forming in the first place.  (3) If the calcium deposits are too far gone, you can simply spray paint the entire fountain, calcium and all.

"This fountain starts at five stars, but if you have hard water it should be replaced about every three years.  I purchased this model from a different company in June 2010 and it worked very nicely until 2015.  Now the rubber plug in the top jug is beginning to deteriorate, so water splashes outside the bowl.  The calcium buildup from the hard water has become impossible to remove, so it looks ugly.  If you add a calcium remover to the water, animals might get poisoned, so I'll put it in the garden where a slight leak won't matter.  I'm replacing it with Amazon's low-profile, blue ceramic Koi fountain, as I've found this type of thickly glazed finish is easier to maintain.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5QBPVRYC7RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BJ29GY#wasThisHelpful","RE5QBPVRYC7RJ","A55S98JEGRUUX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55S98JEGRUUX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I plan to keep them in my car for the rare occasions I've had to walk through unexpected puddles away from home, like last week when I soaked my good shoes.

"UPDATE:  I ordered and reviewed the wrong L'Oreal Mousse!  The ""Sublime"" is not at all like the ""Absolue"" that I reviewed.  I didn't know they had two mousses.  When I got around to using the Sublime, I discovered it is NOTreusable; it's just the regular made into a foam for one-time use.  Also, the #70 color in the Sublime is much darker and is brown, not dark blond.  No wonder it was much cheaper.This is for the Absolue REUSABLE mousse:  Wow!  I have short grey hair, and from one can of mousse I got two complete colorings, with plenty of foam left for a third treatment.  I started in September, and the second coloring was just as strong in November.  There was still plenty of foam for a third treatment in December, but I was mistaken in thinking it was still just as strong, because it was not.

"Like other reviewers, I've tried many ""affordable"" creams to deal with dry, thin, elderly skin.  CeraVe beats them all.  It absorbs quickly and then seems to stay in the skin, keeping away the dry spots for a long time, while the other creams had to be applied again soon.  Right before CeraVe, I bought one that was full of herbs and organic stuff and was supposedly hypoallergenic, but when I put in on my face after a shower it gave me a rash.

"The Medium-size length is just right for my 5ft. 2in. height, bust 36, weight 125 lb.  (A similar dress in another brand was two inches too long and I had to return it as the fabric would be hard to shorten.) The polyester jersey  feels silky and luxurious to wear.  The weave is dense enough that you can't see through it in normal room lighting, but if the sun or a strong light is aimed directly at the skirt, you can see outlines.  I love the color variations, and since they are so affordable I ordered three more while they last.  I plan to wear these maxidresses in winter (Arizona) with a sweater on top or turtleneck under, to cover imperfect legs as an alternative to long pants.  The standard shipping for these dresses was very fast, four weekdays.  UPDATE #1:  I'm taking off one star because the elastic around the waist is not very strong under normal usage.  Fortunately Dritz and others sell black elastic thread, and it doesn't seem hard to make repairs, just a bit of a bother.  UPDATE #2.  Oops!  More stars off.  The elastic shirring is definitely a problem.  Trying to replace the elastic thread is no fun at all, especially since the original was put in with chain stitch, so if it breaks the whole length can go.  I gave up and removed two broken rows on one dress, and I can see ending up with no shirring at all.  This won't be the end of the dress, but it is a disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRVI1MLGGOO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJL7X9A#wasThisHelpful","R1RRVI1MLGGOO3","A55S98JEGRUUX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55S98JEGRUUX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When we find ourselves out of sorts, it's time to sort it out.I feel extra appreciation for authors who use words well, who seem to weigh them and taste them and then arrange them with care. Sarah Bessey is one of those authors. Whatever aspect of life she's talking about, she reveals its hidden glory, she shows us where God has touched it.The first chapters hooked me right in, because she dives into the metaphor of ""sorting things out."" We feel compelled to sort material possessions when a major change happens. We sort when somebody dies. We sort when we have to move. We sort when we want to pass along one of our treasures to somebody else.Sarah feels that it is much the same with faith. Sometimes a piece of our faith seems to die, and we're left sifting through the memories. Sometimes we have to move on, and we feel suddenly rootless. And all the time, we want to pass on the good of our faith, but the graces may be buried in the negatives.This book was born from Sarah's sorting, and as she ""unpacks the boxes,"" you may see things that you recognize right there in her hands. As is must be with any storyteller, she speaks from her heart but the words echo in yours.Sarah tells us that she has always felt an ease in her communion with the Spirit. It didn't keep her from struggles, or fears, or terrible loss. But through it all, she has been known, and she knows it. This comes out in her writing. The Jesus that she is madly in love with is a living Jesus, a God-Incarnate whom she meets in the Gospel accounts and on the street and around her kitchen table.He's the One Eugene Peterson described, who could ""say the big nouns: joy, glory, peace; and live the best verbs: love, forgive, save.""And because of him, Sarah will not walk away from the people that he calls his body. She will not forget that he called us into a kingdom: a way of being fully human; of spending our moments well; of being present with people the in presence of Christ; a way of working towards what is good, especially when it's hard.If you read Out Of Sorts, you will come away with something valuable. I came away with an expanded vision of what Sarah calls ""Eternal Living."" When a Christian says ""eternal life,"" the world hears ""that disembodied forever existence that you think you're getting- if you're not on God's sin list.""That cannot be what Jesus was referring to when he said that we had his life in us.When Sarah hears those words, she hears something more like ""Eternal Living""- doing life as if God was right there in it, as if it were all caught up in Christ- finding its grounding and glory in him.Treat yourself to this book. It's positive without being fake. It's serious without being despairing. It's full of truth without arrogance. It sounds kinda like a conversation between her, and you, and Jesus.I thank Howard Books for providing me with this review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSJGAU50Z830/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717583#wasThisHelpful","RRSJGAU50Z830","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The publisher's blurb refers to this devotional book as ""unique and life affirming,"" and in this case the marketing team is exactly right. Sid and Rosie, an older couple participating in the daily adventures of life, will both enchant and encourage you as you encounter them in these little parables.Having read some of Penelope's other novels, I knew that she is capable of exploring wide, high, deep truths through simple ""fictional characters."" I hate to call them fiction, though, because she renders them so realistically. They're fully human, clumsy and flawed, and they want to live well, so they try hard to find the rhythm of kindness and joy.Sid is a Quaker, having come to this path later in life. For him, the idea that Jesus is the Way is of primary importance. No amount of religion can make a Way- and a Way is what we need to walk in. Sid is slow to speak, and sensitive, and provides a sounding board for Rosie.Rosie is a self-professed spiritual ragamuffin, having worked her way through many faiths and their teachings as an adult before she met Sid. She is curious, passionate, and ever open to new ways of thinking. Together, they're an encyclopedia of quotes and insights from God-chasers and Life-lovers the world over.And we readers get to snoop into their days, eavesdropping on their stimulating conversations and witnessing the satisfaction they find in being together on this good earth. From Rosie making bread to Sid quoting poetry, to interpersonal misunderstandings and the required forgiving, their shared moments are ordinary. Yet they've determined to look up the sunbeams to the Sun, and to recognize the glory that grows in the ground and falls from the sky and lights up each other's faces.They'd be good friends to have, Sid and Rosie, friends who don't pretend to have God in a box, who aren't stuffed with sureness about God's will, but who do believe that God has given a Way, and they put their small feet on it and walk.If you're looking for a little wisdom, and a few smiles, and some new thoughts to chew on, then try this as a devotional. I don't see how you'd regret it.I thank Penelope Wilcock and Monarch Publishing for gifting me this book in exchange for a review.Penelope says:""My aim in writing is to make goodness attractive. I love simple human kindness and gentleness, and I am moved by human vulnerability. I am fascinated by the power that is within our grasp to lift one another up, to heal and strengthen and encourage each other - our power to bless.In the novels I write, I think of the reader sitting down to enjoy a book, the door of their imagination open wide to allow the story in to influence and shape their spirit. I accept the responsibility that confers as a great privilege, and it is my intention that when you put down any book of mine at the end of reading it, you will feel hopeful, peaceful and comforted, more ready to look on your fellow human beings with compassion and see their point of view.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14PW3QT5DRXK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857216023#wasThisHelpful","R14PW3QT5DRXK5","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""It's Not What You Think"" is a perfect title for a book like this. The ""it"" Jefferson speaks of is the Gospel, and a lot of people think they know what it is. And they think it hasn't got much to do with their strongest fears, deepest desires, and greatest hopes.The Gospel has been to reduced to a transaction between you and a guy named Jesus. Thanks (somehow) to his sacrificial death on a cross, you get into heaven when you die. (Try not to sin too much along the way.) But what if there's way more to the whole thing than a ticket to posthumous paradise?What if the Gospel and its God-touching-man narrative actually had to do with reality?What if the Gospel met our need, not for more religion, but for renewal? And what if it conferred a responsibility to us, a ""burden of care"" that we share with God Himself?If you're ready to think about the whole Christianity thing in a different, life-affirming way, then let Jefferson be your guide. Of course, he'd probably rather be considered a fellow traveler rather than a guide, a traveler whose insights provoke new thoughts and fresh conversations.For me, these were two of the foundational concepts-""The Kingdom's Not Where You Think."" We aren't peddling pie-in-the-sky, enticing you to restrain yourself down here so you get a better reward up there. We're offering new eyes to see the work of God today, where you never recognized it before.""People Are Not Who You Think."" What if those new eyes suddenly showed you a glory in the people all around you, a weight and worth that re-invents them for you even if they never change.If you let this book do its job, your may begin seeing the sacred (the meeting place of God and man) each day.I thank Thomas Nelson for giving me this review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W5YLIYWYNSGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400205417#wasThisHelpful","R1W5YLIYWYNSGB","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book several moons ago now, and I hesitated to review it because I had loved it so much that I didn't think I could do it justice. In the inhospitable landscape of dating advice, we all might need Kate's words to reassure us.I needed her straight-talk, and her sense of humor, and her strong grip on both spirituality *and* reality. Particularly, I needed her bravery when she said that while singleness is certainly no curse, it's also hard. It's probably harder for a mature adult single person, rather than for a young adult, but still- you feel an absence. We belong to a species that was designed to be paired, and we feel separated when we're not. I look at couples, and families, and I want that belonging. I want to be a link in the chain of generations. Acknowledging this deeper hunger means being vulnerable, and that takes guts. Kate has them.And it takes another dose of guts to say ""I'm going to own this longing, and not attempt to satisfy it with substitutes, and I'm going to live well in this tension and find goodness in this life of mine, whatever my relationship status."" Kate has a suitcase of that kind of guts.Without platitudes, or sentimentality, or self-pity, or browbeating, Kate leads us to think about purpose and satisfaction and opportunity and gratitude and grace, all without sounding like a zillion other ""Christian Dating Books.""Really, this is much more a book about being a healthy, whole human being. But there's plenty of talk about Love and Relationships too- you won't feel cheated if you're one of those singles who compulsively reads relationship books. :-)Because this is a book about living life well, Kate invites us into her personal journey of growing closer to the heart of God. And, like the best of storytellers, her questions and reflections lead you to your own.I thank Harvest House Publishers for my review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAIR7PWOH7KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736962263#wasThisHelpful","R3BAIR7PWOH7KV","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no delicate way to say this, so I'll be frank: The Gospel is such incredible good news that sometimes it doesn't seem to have anything to do with daily life.After all, isn't the Gospel our Big, Important Spiritual Truth, and everything else is just hit or miss attempts?What could our days (full of washing dishes and stopping at traffic lights and reading to children and trying to plan family reunions and working overtime) possibly have to do with God-in-Flesh and a Cross-carried-for-us?J. D. Greear agrees that there's a lot of Ordinary Life to live, but he thinks that every moment of our living is grounded in the Gospel that we've been given. Preaching the Gospel to ourselves throughout our days, he says, will reorient our minds, strengthen our hearts, nourish our spirits, and guide our hands.It is this being ""rooted and established"" in God's love that we experience in the Gospel that teaches us what we need to know to live well. The chapter titles may clue you in: ""The Gospel as Gift-Righteousness,"" ""Changed by Sight,"" ""Urgent Mission,"" ""Expect Great Things,"" ""But if Not..."" and ""Extravagant Generosity,"" just to name a few.The Gospel is the only thing that can convince you of God's love, and it is the only thing that can grow the love of God in you.It will show you God as the source of all the goodness, and teach you obedience to his good ways.It will convince you of God's steady care and tenderness, and adversity will not destroy your hope.And once you have received God's Gospel, and you know his kindness and his mercy, then you'll be able to give others what God-in-Christ has given you.I thank B&H publishing for giving me this review copy.

"When you look around the natural world, you see that there is a rhythm to the way it moves. There is intense and purposeful activity: the verdant growth of spring, the chorusing of mating frogs, a wild snowstorm or powerful thunderstorm, deer running in a field.And then there are also periods of seeming inactivity: geese flocked together on a pond before they migrate, bears hibernating underground, the empty trees when all the leaves fall down, a dry creek in a drought.If you don't have the right eyes for looking, these moments will appear as wasted time instead of the holy pause that they are. You'll see unchanging dark instead of dawn on the horizon. You'll see unmelting snow instead of hearing stirring sap.The natural world doesn't know to complain when the pace slows down, but I do. When things seem to stall, I get nervous. Waiting seems too much like doing nothing. After all, I shouldn't ""wait"" for a job/friend/community to come to me, I should go look for a it. Right? Perhaps right. But even when I'm doing my part, there will still be times of stillness, when all my efforts echo in the air. There will be times when the pieces don't fit, and my frustrated striving won't change that.""Waiting on God"" by Wayne Stiles is a book for those times. It's a book to remind you that maybe you don't have to choke on that horrible word ""wait."" You're not being asked to doing nothing. You're not being told that this time means nothing. You aren't being sold a pie-in-the-sky destination. This waiting period, it's more of a bearing period. Bear this time, this tension, this want-unfulfilled and fear-unresolved. Bear it, and while you carry it inside you God is making space in you. And God wastes nothing.

Indeed, she has some words for those who use Christianity as an invitation to unreality: ""We've lost the plot if we use religion as the place where we escape from difficult realities instead of the place where those difficult realities are given meaning.""In this book, she stretches her eyes wide (to her own discomfort) and looks hard at everything around her. She recounts some of the ways her life has collided with other lives, in births and deaths and sin and forgiveness.It's ugly reading at times, because that's how it is when you're capable of hurting people and being hurt.It's beautiful writing sometimes, because she finds Gospel-beauty alive and growing in this world.We often talk, in Evangelical circles, about helping our children to ""find a faith that will survive"" in this wicked, pernicious, tempting world. (Insert ironic eye roll.) After reading this book, I wonder if maybe it's more that we need to learn to survive our faith. After all, our faith is hung upon a Man who went down to the lowest and the darkest and the most ragged places, and so following him means we have to go there too.I'll close this book recommendation with one of my favorite quotes. Half-way through the book, Nadia ends a chapter by saying ""... the holy things we need for healing and sustenance are almost always the same as the ordinary things right in front of us.""I thank Convergent Books for giving me a review copy.

"""The Surprising Imagination of C. S. Lewis"" is a delightful and provocative read. As the authors acknowledge, imagination has been reduced to a very narrow definition, usually applied to creative children. In this book, they explore the works of C. S. Lewis to show us more of what human imagination is.As we read, we see that imagination....Re-enchants the familiar.Show us bursts of glory in the ""ordinary"" world.Sends us on the genuine quest for truth.Teaches us justice, as we recognize a thing's value and give it due esteem.Takes us beneath the obvious surface of an issue, to the heart of the matter.Lets us see the world rightly, aligning the self with reality.Of course, human use their imagination wrongly too. We can dream ourselves into delusion, and justify evil things. We can inflate things above their proper importance, and neglect what really matters. We can hide our flaws from our own eyes.I have a hard time categorizing this book. It's not academic. It's not straight-up theology. It's not a systematic study of C. S. Lewis' writing. It's a carefully written examination, with the keen eye of a meditation, that sometimes turns into a celebration, all about the imagination.I'm glad I read it. I've got a fellow C. S. fan in the house to share it with, too.I thank Handlebar Publicity for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EBNEZBQ38VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426795106#wasThisHelpful","R24EBNEZBQ38VX","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to read this book because it was a sister-story. When you have a sister and you're growing up together, sometimes you feel like the two of you are really one person. You know your sister. You can read her face and her tone of voice, and you know when she needs you. You know when she's being her authentic self and when she's faking it. At the same time, you are two separate individuals, and so you can hide from each other. You can deceive each other. You can hurt alone.""Never Said"" captures all of these sister dynamics. Shifting back and forth between Annie's rush of thoughts and Sarah's more careful narration, ""Never Said"" is a fast-moving read. Sixteen year-old Sarah is all twisted up inside, struggling with anxiety and an unfinished relationship while worried sick over her twin sister Annie. Annie was the beauty pageant winner, the outgoing show-stopper, the life of the party, the confident and commanding presence. Now, Sarah doesn't know what think. Annie has deliberately and methodically undone every aspect of her former self.This is a book about shame and renewal and identity and friendship and acceptance and family and cruelty and ignorance. It's how we hide and how we heal.I thank Blink YA Publishers for providing me with a review copy in exchange for my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSURNQJ42J7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310746612#wasThisHelpful","R1LSURNQJ42J7W","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Hardest Thing to Do"" is book four in a most wonderful series. I marvel at the way Penelope has imagined the whole world of St. Alcuin's Abbey, peopling it with fine, deeply human characters and plotting it with startling surprises and satisfying resolutions, and then giving us that world through her novels.If a monastic community in the 1300s sounds too far removed from your daily life to be remotely relatable, then think again. The men of St. Alcuin's are each distinct unto themselves (and they become more themselves as you meet them in each episode) but they are Everyman too. The essential struggles of being human- choosing and renouncing, becoming and accepting, receiving and losing, growing and remembering- are their struggles, and yours and mine too.The other thing I really enjoy about this series is their integrity, by which I mean that they have no pretense. They're not a story varnished with ""Christianity"" so that they can stay within the bounds of ""Christian Fiction."" Instead, they're the stories of men who've sworn to lay down their very lives for a Risen Christ. The brothers' preferences and attitudes, their time and energy, their animosity and comradeship, their doubts and prayers and work and calling- it finds its grounding in the Gospel.Because of this, and thanks to the sensitive heart of the author, the character's conversations and meditations (and most of their meditation is really wrestling with God!) show us what they're learning about life and the One who gives it. There's a lot for a thoughtful reader to think about, and it all belongs to the characters of the story. It's not an awkward sermonette from an author, who interrupts the story to deliver a Christian PSA.Because of this, if a non-religious friend thought the books sounded interesting, I'd loan them in a heartbeat.If I've piqued your curiosity at all, do yourself the favor and get this series onto your shelf","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3171MKVFLA5DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782641483#wasThisHelpful","R3171MKVFLA5DF","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Just Show Up"" is both a practical guidebook and a personal revelation, co-written by two friends, Jill and Kara. At the time of the writing, Kara was fighting cancer, and Jill was part of her supportive (and beloved) community. Shortly before publication, Kara passed away, and Jill completed this book while loving on Kara's family and friends as they all grieved this loss.If you've read Kara's first book ""The Hardest Peace,"" then you'll have already absorbed pieces of her story. That book was also written during her fight with cancer, and out of her pain and sickness she gifted readers with words of life, a glimpse into her family and their Big Love. She captured, in a few short chapters, why it is so good and so hard to be human.If you haven't read ""Hardest Peace,"" then perhaps you grabbed this book because of the subtitle: the dance of walking through suffering together. Perhaps you're trying to navigate the rough waters of a terrible diagnosis in your family, and you need somebody who understands how you feel as you take care of somebody else.Jill and Kara are good guides to turn to. The first portion of this book is intensely practical. They begin by explaining that when it comes to blessing somebody in a hard situation, Just Show Up is the most important principle. If you don't take the risk of going to them, nothing beautiful can happen between you.They next suggest ways to show up and meet specific needs according to your abilities, at the right time and with no expectations.Then they address the need for the ""helper"" to have their own support system, and the need to be honest about how bad you'll feel even as a supposedly ""unaffected"" helper. You'll probably feel guilty thinking like this, but the thoughts will come: ""This is so hard for me! They're the one who's suffering, and I feel so bad! Who do I turn to?"" Jill and Kara make it clear: when you have somebody you're giving comfort to, and you need somebody to dump on.Together, Jill and Kara go to their vulnerable places in this book. Once they move past the more advice-based parts, they return to Kara's story, as seen by Jill and other friends who walked beside her. At the end, you know this truth unshakably: The God who is God-with-us made us to be with each other, and if you choose to be with someone in the hard, then you may never know how very much your choice means, because it does.I thank David C Cook for providing me with a review copy in exchange for my thoughts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JV3ANOJERG9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434709531#wasThisHelpful","R2JV3ANOJERG9M","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alright, so I broke down and read a full-length Mary Connealy novel.And it was really funny.""Fire and Ice"" is almost pure comedy, with a note of complex family relationship and some troubles that need to be overcome by hope.The early interactions between Gage and Bailey had me snorting with laughter. First they do this whole ""You're stealing my land/No you're stealing MY land"" routine- complete with gunfire and dynamite- and then they settle into a truce. They'll work together on this one certain problem, but they won't promise be happy about it.From there, we see them getting rather attached to each other. They're stubborn mules, both of 'em. They deserve each other. And they're gonna need each other, because ranch life isn't simple. There's danger and deception and hysterical in-laws. And of course, there's cows in need of fresh grazing and mares having a hard time foaling.Read this book if you want a Wild West comedy, the sort that would make a great film.Thank you Bethany House Publishers for providing me with a copy in exchange for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DXWWYI8EDKWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012H0ZTJW#wasThisHelpful","R3DXWWYI8EDKWS","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pastor Alcorn isn't content just to tell us to be happy. He insists on searching Scripture and showing us the Gospel-centered reasons for a happy life.And if you trust him for a few hundred pages, he'll convince you that there's a lot of happiness to be found, first in God Himself, then in the gifts He gives us, and in our response to God and His world.I really enjoyed reading this book. (Frankly, if a book called ""Happiness"" wasn't a pleasure to read, wouldn't that be a major problem right there?) Randy clearly studied his subject, because this book was peppered with quotes from philosophers and scientists and preachers and artists and songwriters, all of them engaging with ""happiness.""I agree with him that for Christians, happiness has become one of those unspiritual concepts. We don't want to seem like we're obsessed with personal satisfaction or self-gratification, so we shun happiness in favor of a joyful holiness. And joyful holiness is wonderful, but Randy argues that we've devalued the concept of simple, easily recognized human happiness to our own detriment.For Randy, happiness (along with joy and gratitude and contentedness and peace, etc. etc.) rounds out the wholesome life.In this book, Randy devotes many pages to studying the most precise meanings of various words in Scripture. There's a reason for this. Often our translation of a word can give it a whole new meaning, sometimes subtle, sometimes glaring. There are a lot of really strong happy words in Scripture, and maybe you've never realized that before. If it's become easy to skim over phrases like ""blessed,"" and ""rejoicing,"" then spend some time with these sections, being startled by the bold, brave, bright happiness that God is fond of evoking.All in all, this is a really comprehensive look at happiness: how we can have more of it now, why we can be assured of it for all eternity, and why we should celebrate the fact that we want happiness to begin with.Also, as you're sitting there holding a thick book with ""Happiness"" emblazoned on the cover, you may have somebody come up and ask you what you're reading. Won't it knock their socks off when you tell them?  Now that's a way to start a Christ-conversation, with happiness.I thank Tyndale Publishers for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N037SM67T0DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414389345#wasThisHelpful","R3N037SM67T0DW","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last Chance Hero is a fine finale for this series. It starts with a plot worthy of a Hallmark movie. She's a young doctor trying to set up a practice in a small town; he's a former NFL player come home to coach his high school team. They meet, and they seem really good together, but she hates football, and it's the center of his life.Now, that sounds pretty cute. But don't be fooled: just like the previous three ""At Home in Last Chance"" books, the story gains depth as it progresses.Andy isn't just a fun-loving football-obsessed guy, and Jess isn't just the new-blood fighting the established order. They've both got choices to make as they confront the past and look forward to the future, and they have to decide how they'll contribute to their community, both individually and together.Final assessment? If you've begun this series, then you've gotta take one final trip to New Mexico by reading Last Chance Hero. Andy and Jess have a good story on their own, and it's enhanced by the cameos of Ray and Lanie, Sarah and Steven, Chris and Kaityn and Grandma Elizabeth.

"""Gather Around the Amish Table"" would be a fabulous gift for anybody who is fascinated by the simple life of the Amish.This is a softcover cookbook, filled with full-color photography and engaging personal stories, and every page highlights the good food that can be found in Amish kitchens.When you work hard and tend the land well, your reward is the bounty of the seasons. Judging from these recipes, Amish cooks know how to use that bounty, making their meals both nourishing and enjoyable.There are recipes for any day of the year and almost any skill level, because the contributors ranged from young Amish girls to their kitchen-wise grandmothers.As with any cookbook, you'll likely never make some of these dishes (you'd have to butcher your own hog to get the ingredients!) but if you're a fan of the Amish life, then you'll find the more obscure recipes interesting all the same.And there is plenty for the average cook to work with, such as cauliflower bacon salad, ""Party Potatoes,"" ""Broccoli Bonanza,"" ""Best-Ever Meatloaf,"" ""Lisa's Lasagna,"" and various delectable brownies and cookies and pies and granola bars and puddings.  There are muffins and breads for breakfast, one-dish dinners, lots of noodle recipes, and many desserts.So next time you need a present for your favorite Amish-wanna-be, consider this cookbook.I thank Litfuse Publicity for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0J3QO9U0W36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0836199103#wasThisHelpful","RN0J3QO9U0W36","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Atheist Who Didn't Exist,"" by Andy Bannister. Bannister is the Canadian Director for RZIM, which is Ravi Zacharias International Ministries. A book by one of Ravi's associates is a book for me.I've often heard my father-in-law refer to God as the ""Man Upstairs."" I've also done it myself. Its can be an affectionate colloquialism for God, or, as Andy Bannister points out, it can be linguistic laziness and theological ineptitude. Banner points out that according to 2,000 years of thoughtful Christian tradition, built upon several more thousand years of Hebrew scholarship, God is no ""man upstairs."" He is instead the ground of all being, the One who creates and sustains all things, the reason than anything exists. To argue about God is, perhaps, to tacitly admit that He exists, and that He demands your attention.RZIM is a ministry with a focus on apologetics- the rational, logical, personally relevant defense of the faith. Ravi teaches that behind every question stands a questioner, to be treated with respect and never dismissed or ridiculed with insult.Today, we have a movement (New Atheism?) with a few leaders suggesting that skepticism is the ideal way of life. Atheism is well-dressed these days, polished and educated and urbane. We need coherent thinkers and civil voices to present the alternative- the message of Christ. RZIM has provided quite a few such people.As you try to wrap your head around the arguments presented in this book, keep a few facts of Christian history in mind. The Gospels, especially when investigated, stand up as eyewitness accounts. Eleven of the twelve apostles were sentenced to death for their faith, and not one sold themselves out to save their own flesh.I recommend this book with the disclaimer that I like what RZIM is all about, and that includes Mr. Bannister's work.

"As I read ""Encountering Truth,"" I kept trying to decide how to describe Pope Francis' words. The closest I can come is to say that his homilies read like a conversation with a very devout neighbor, somebody who talks about God and life with both feet planted firmly on the ground.He makes his theology immediate- the Gospel demands action. The Christ was flesh and blood, and so is his Church. Doctrine and practice move through life hand in hand. Truth is more than pretty ideas, and grace is not a hollow word.Pope Francis is preaching a faith in which the presence of God is expected in the everyday. Prayer, confession, justice, tribulation, renewal, moralism, courage, wisdom, peace... he addresses all of these aspects of life, and  grounds them in his understanding of being human in this world.Here are some of his thoughts.""Hope changes our attitude; we are ourselves, but we are not ourselves; we are ourselves, seeking the other side, anchored in the other side.""""The power of man is prayer, and the prayer of a humble man is God's weakness. The Lord is weak only in this: he is weak in the face of the prayers of his people.""""There (in the hands of God) we are safe. It is the greatest safety, because it is the safety of our Father who loves us.""My best endorsement would be to say that when the cares of life narrow our eyes and reduce our view of God, this book will help wake us up again, and open our eyes to see him more clearly.And that Pope Francis isn't telling us anything ""new and exciting."" He's not marketing something he's manufactured to get our attention. He's re-presenting the timeless message of God's invitation and God's redemption and God's victory, and in every age, that story compels us and converts us and changes our direction.I thank Image publishers for providing me with a review copy in exchange for my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QCVUDCV38OF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101903015#wasThisHelpful","R1QCVUDCV38OF9","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kristen Strong had me when she admitted that change she didn't orchestrate was about as welcome as chewing off her own right arm.Um, absolutely.Is there a secret handshake for this club of change-averse people? Maybe I should come up with one. Heck, I even view the change of seasons with suspicion, until the new charms of nature woo me into Spring, or Summer, or Fall.And who hasn't experienced change, with a capital C?Somebody you care about goes away and your heart walks on out of your body and goes with them.Something you depend on- steady employment or educational opportunities- shifts under your feet and you're left trying to decide on our next move.Life's fragility becomes intensely personal... there's an illness or a death, and you just want ""the way things used to be,"" to be the way they are again.Change doesn't look the same for any two people, but we likely feel the same when we meet it. Kristen compares change to her 6' 5"" cousin. Despite the fact that he was a gentle giant, people stepped aside to clear his path. Change is that big guy... we want to hunker down in a corner and hope he doesn't see us. We're concerned just looking at him.Today was one of those days. Recently, someone I love has been trying to make an important move in their life. Everything seemed to come together, and then it derailed again, with more stress added to the mix. I'm hurting just watching them.Kristen's book challenged me to believe: there is a God-for-me story, and a God-for-my-friend story. And that change that I want to fight off and run from and dig out from underneath as fast as I can? Well, that change is ON our way, not IN our way.So, how does the Gospel illuminate change, transition, and the unknown?  How do we keep moving when the wanted-change doesn't happen, and the change-we-didn't-choose is breathing in our ears?Kristen turns our faces towards the God who never runs short of grace or glory.She writes, ""He loves me through all ancient and future time, so whatever circumstances are a part of my story are a part of his everlasting love for me too.... When I sit in times of change, I remember I also sit in his everlasting love.""Somehow, Kristen managed to spread the truth of Scripture onto my heart with each page she penned. She's asking me to take a risk, to believe God in the changes. Yes, I desire the changes I think would be good for me. Yes, I dread the changes that cause me trouble and worry.I know there's the kind of change where wonderful things come into your life, and there's the kind of change that is synonymous with loss. Yet I have the same God at all times, the God who came for me and made me whole, and he has restoration in mind and not ruin.""Girl Meets Change"" is TNT inside the cute cover.

"This book is a great way to start the holiness conversation, because it's centered around a couple of questions: what is holiness, and why does it matter?Ideally, we recognize that holiness is about waaaay more than following the modern Evangelical modes of approved behavior, but sometimes we forget, and we make holiness about us.Think about the way we categorize things-Gambling in Vegas? Unholy use of money.Donation to Billy Graham? Holy, of course.Various peculiar body piercings? Unholy!True Love Waits ring? Very holy.Why do we come to these conclusions? Are conservative choices automatically more holy than progressive ones?Does holiness accumulate like dust does, guaranteeing that older traditions have more of it?How do we steer toward holiness, if we don't know where it stems from?Tyler Braun's book points us to this truth: holiness is the nature and ways of God himself. He is Holy, and he showed us his holiness on earth in his Son. So, if we're talking about personal holiness for you and I, then we're talking about drawing close to Christ.When we say that a person has the quality of holiness, we're (hopefully) speaking about the way they seem to reflect the heart of God.We're speaking about the way that grace upholds that person, and the way that they work that grace out in fidelity and self-giving.What does this ""holiness-is-given-from-God-as-he-brings-you-near-to-him"" approach mean for us, practically?It means that when we make choices, we're saying as much about God as we are about ourselves.That's how holiness comes into every arena. There's always something to say about God.So after walking us through chapters titled Innocence, Shame, and Love, Tyler takes us to the out-working of holiness, in Community and Artistry, and Mission.This book's only 176 pages, but it's got big concepts to think about. And it's worth reading more than once.I thank Moody Press Newsroom for providing me with a copy in exchange for my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PNWMFTF3QY16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080240507X#wasThisHelpful","R3PNWMFTF3QY16","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps you've heart of Ann Voskamp's ""One Thousand Gifts."" Her book challenged us all to find the ordinary glory, and to name each glimpse of it that we see in our days.When I read Eileen Spinelli's ""Thankful,"" I thought to myself that it was ""One Thousand Gifts"" for children. Both Ann's and Eileen's books have the same heart-beat, and both women have a way with words.Sure, this is a book of simple, rhyming sentences. But listen to some of them...""The artist is thankful for color and light.The clown for her costume, silly and bright.The doctor is thankful when patients get well.The traveler, for a cozy hotel.""Don't the rhymes just dance right off of your tongue? And Eileen comes up with some unexpected gifts- everything from comfortable shoes for a waitress to a mayor who's thankful for every vote.And the illustrations! This is Archie Preston's first published book, and it's fabulous. There's a wry, comic note to many of them that both little people and big people will appreciate. His work reminds me of Arthur Howard's illustrations in the well-known ""Mr. Putter and Tabby"" series.So, again, ""Thankful"" is a treat. It reminds us that practicing gratitude is ultimately celebration, celebration of God's good care and recognition of all the gifts we have.

Some of these points really got my attention.First, we'd need to begin recognizing God's glory and good opportunities in our own zip code. Ministry and mission happen right here, Alan argues. God is at work and you can join in, on a dirt road or in a city block.Second, we'd need to understand this place we're trying to serve and flourish in. As Stephen King said, ""A place is yours when you know where all the roads go.""  So, go explore. What's the culture? What's the lingo? How do the people here roll? Where do you fit in seamlessly and where do you struggle to find a toehold? What do you enjoy about this patch of the map, and what drives you crazy?Third, watch your mindset. As you explore, be a pilgrim, Alan suggests, not a tourist. To simplify the definitions, a pilgrim moves with an eye for Christ's presence in all places, and accepts the hard things as well as the lovely ones as part of the journey. A tourist might eagerly find all the best spots in town, but by nature they can't stay long or get deeply involved.Fourth, you need to neighbor. No, you didn't choose them. No, you don't live anything like they do. No, you don't know them yet.But if you're going to stay and stay well, you're gonna have to meet the neighbors.""You know your neighbors are beginning to trust you when they begin to inconvenience you.""This is a statement that is so true, yet I'd never thought of it this way before.If somebody is a stranger to me, do I call them to ask for help during the dinner hour?No. I don't.But if I ever did, if I took that risk, they might become a friend.And actually, I've seen this happen.Maybe you have too.Maybe you've been really blessed by the people around you, and maybe you've blessed them back.If so, you know what Alan is talking about. If it's never happened yet, keep the faith. It can happen.""Staying is the New Going"" would be a really great book to read along with Hugh Halter's ""Flesh."" Both of them revolve around the same thing- Jesus does his awesome work through common men in common places.(And perhaps you'll find that no place and no person is common, if you borrow God's eyes to look with.)I thank Tyndale and NavPress for my review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IDRAY69P4AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631464795#wasThisHelpful","R14IDRAY69P4AX","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I had the privilege of helping a new Christian begin to seek the Scriptures, I might be inclined to give them this book.""God Speaks"" is a high altitude survey of the Bible- why it's reliable, why it's valuable, the claims it makes for humanity, and the character of the God who gave it- and occasionally it touches down on particular points, such as what Jesus taught, and how to interpret a passage in context and informed by church wisdom through the ages.If you're new to your Bible, this book could help orient you as you start out, and whet your appetite for further reading.As a basic introduction, it has plenty of helpful resources. There's a timeline of events, spanning from the call of Abraham to the writings of Augustine, a giving you a glance at those who lived the Hebrew history and those who articulated the new-born faith.And here's a chapter about biblical archeology- the study of textual data and material evidence. He includes brief descriptions of discoveries, and explains where those artifacts fit into the scope of history recorded in the Testaments.If the reader were ready for more after finishing ""God Speaks,"" then I'd begin adding in other books.I think I'd give them Norman Giesler's ""How we Got our Bible"" if they wanted to know about the inspiration of the text and collection of the manuscripts and recognition of the canon.I'd hand out J. Warner Wallace's ""Cold Case Christianity"" if they wanted to think specifically about the New Testament, and what (if any) evidence suggests its authenticity.I'd hand out a small library of Ravi Zacharias if they wanted to explore the questions of the human heart *and* look at the Man who claims to be the Bread of Life and Living Water. ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Why Jesus?"" and ""Can Man Live without God?"" would be good ones to begin with.I'd probably slide Randy Alcorn's challenging-yet-ultimately-comforting ""If God is Good..."" into the pile if they wanted to read more about suffering and evil in a God-made world.So yes, ""God Speaks"" could be an ideal jumping-off point for all sorts of Christian studies.I would also like to explore more of Dr. Craig Evans books myself. ""God Speaks"" is the first one of his that I've read. I'll be keeping an eye out for ""Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels"" and ""Jesus and His World"" and ""From Jesus to the Church: The First Generation.""I thank Worthy Publishing for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH7ZXDZO1ELJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617954810#wasThisHelpful","RH7ZXDZO1ELJ5","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is this possible? An argument-free relationship?I've personally thought that it could happen, and in this book Fawn Weaver explains why she thinks so to.First, a definition is necessary. Argument-free does not mean disagreement-free. It does not mean a relationship without differences of opinion, conflicts of interest, and personal preferences that tend to clash. (You'd have to marry a programmed robot to achieve this! And Fawn has no interest is being a robot, or wedding one.) It means you handle your disagreements without argument.That blows your mind, don't it? So simple.(Let's define argument as an exchange of words, designed to cut somebody up and run them down, said in anger, ostensibly revolving around an issue that needs dealing with. From what I know, these exchanges aren't problem-solving study sessions. Nope, they're torture to live with and usually get swept under the rug until they happen again over some other issue.)She has a 230 page book, formed around a 28 day challenge, that all boils down to the most basic of concepts.First, unless it's a full-on emergency, choose a sensible time to discuss a problem. Why court a fight by bringing up inflammatory things when everyone's out of patience and suffering from low blood sugar?And if there is a real problem, find a way to solve it together. Resolve to speak to that end- uncovering a solution.If there's no resolution on the horizon, then find a way to bear the trouble together.(Wait- what if you're the only one who sees the problem? Yep. That's always a challenge. Persistent, honest communication about why you're so troubled may bring the other person to a place of concern over the issue as well.)Focus on your original emotion- what lies deeper than the anger? Anger is easy, because it comes with a surge of power and justification, and the force of it can beat somebody into responding. Vulnerability is not easy. When you want to argue, and choose to find your original emotion instead, you're choosing to open a hurting heart up and explain yourself. That takes courage, but it can foster trust.One idea that I really liked was found in the ""Get a clue, get a cue"" section. The clue comes from deciding to evaluate yourself before you diagnose your partner. ""There's tension here- am I contributing to it, even if I'm in the right?"" That's strong medicine to take, whether you're married or not!The cue section is more fun. Fawn says that many couples she's interviewed have developed cues over the years- when they recognize their spouse becoming nervous or upset, they signal to them subtly. It's a secret code that says ""I can tell there's something wrong- let me help. Let's talk this out.""Personally, I've done this with my siblings over the years. I imagine it would be useful in a marriage.Remember- if this relationship is a marriage, then you've got a lifetime to work this stuff out. A bad moment is a moment, and it can get better. Ultimately, the relationship is what matters. How can you best keep that going strong amid stupidity and struggle?Presume innocence when you go into a disagreement. They may not have intended to misunderstand you/neglect you/set you off. If you're assuming the best in them, you'll be less likely to attack and more likely to seek understanding.Cultivate gratitude. You chose this person. Why? It's possible those wonderful qualities are still there, and it's your vision that's changed. Can you recover the ability to see them through the eyes of love? Not delusion- just a gracious acceptance that finds the best amid the flaws.I came away from this book with a renewed desire to replace arguing, unproductive unkindness, and manipulative shunning with discussion, grace, and honest explanations of why I feel the way I do. Will it always ""work""- always elicit the perfect response? Hell no. Will trying it grow me as a person? Probably yes.And if Fawn wants to reignite a generation's hope for good marriages, then this book will further that goal. Who would want to lock themselves into a decades-long argument? Nobody. But if we can rescue marriage from the gladiator pit, and replace fights with partnership through life's problems, maybe marriage can earn high esteem again.I thank Thomas Nelson for providing me with a review copy through BookLook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O960A7S2J7O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400205069#wasThisHelpful","R1O960A7S2J7O1","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes, I don't feel up to the challenges of life.My strength seems insufficient, my efforts inefficient, and my level of hope is deficient.In short, I feel desperate. I think that I ""need"" things that I don't have.As Eric Johnson says, ""It is tough to experience the vastness of the Kingdom when we are desperate. When we act desperate for the things we already have access to, we are choosing to live in a state of unbelief.""Eric Johnson has one core message in this book, and the title makes it rather clear: Christ in you.The hope of glory, yes, and the source of whatever we need to live well today. Our job is to realize that our desperation can be hunger- hunger for the nourishment found in Christ. ""Hunger is based on an awareness of abundance,"" says Eric. And Christ is our abundance.That's the point of this book. And Eric makes it well, telling stories and exploring Scripture. Yes, he is a Charismatic. He wants to keep his eyes peeled for all the works of God that are actively happening in the world. He believes that there is no end to the fullness of God, and he believes that God delights in caring for us, and providing for us, out of that fullness.This is a short and valuable read.

"Hugh Halter's ""Flesh"" was one of my favorite reads in 2014. The heart of that book was the age-old question ""How do we live like Jesus?""Hugh gave us not only a challenge, but a reassurance too. He made the argument that our humanity doesn't stand in the way of our holiness. Instead, holiness grows out of our full humanity, when we learn to be human like Jesus. Hugh called this phenomena ""whimsical holiness.""When I saw ""Brimstone"" in the catalog, I knew I wanted a copy. And now it's here, and it was worth the wait. While enlarging the portrait of whimsical holiness, this book tackles some serious questions.What is judgement?Does Jesus judge?Am I equipped to judge?This is not a unique observation, but ""Christianity"" and ""judgement"" have become linked in a lot of people's minds. And they're not thinking about the Day of Judgement, either, when God shall destroy all evil and Christ shall reign over a Kingdom made whole. Nope, they're thinking about the critical, unkind, unbending, arrogant, strident, self-righteous judgements made by professing Christians.Now, we Christians mostly don't mean to wreak havoc.We hope to save our culture by protesting the ""moral slide.""We hope to make converts by critiquing lifestyles- warning people away from the edge, as it were.And that all works well in theory.If we're preaching to a choir of folks just like us, we can rail against other people's choices all day long, and finish up with a round of ""Worthy is the Lamb.""This just doesn't work so good when we're dealing with our family, neighbors, and co-workers. Somehow, we repel them when we start railing. Especially when our depiction of ""biblical convictions"" suspiciously meshes with our personal preferences, and we denounce all that we disagree with.So, we need a new way to be. We need the art and the act of holy nonjudgement. And that's what Hugh talks about.Now- don't jump down the author's throat. He's already got enough people doing that. He's not a Universalist. He does believe in sin. He does have convictions. Feeling better?He just thinks that we need to get back to the Gospel, take our sainthood to the streets, and discuss real issues without being a judgmental jerk.And this book is your conversation-starter, your jumper-cables to the brain, your spoonful of truth, your whack upside the head...Try it. It'll give you a lot to wrestle with, and it will give you a new idea to rest in: We don't have to fight everything wrong all the time.(Sex trafficking? Fight it. Tattoos? Let it be. The health of your own marriage? Fight for it. Speculating about the divorce down the street? Let it be.)Sometimes, we can just make friends and take care of people, working out whimsical holiness, shaking up people's preconceived notions of how Christians are.I thank David C Cook for giving me a copy in exchange for my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTKGK2RDOK3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434706532#wasThisHelpful","R3UTKGK2RDOK3W","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"History we need to know, told in an utterly riveting way.That's how I'd describe ""Legend.""If you read James Bradley's ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Flyboys"" for World War II, then you should read ""Legend"" for the Vietnam War... and Karl Marlantes novel ""Matterhorn"" also.This book focuses on Special Forces staff sergeant Roy Benavidez, who willingly placed himself in grave danger on behalf of his fellow soldiers, and who saved multiple lives while sustaining terrible injuries. Ultimately, he was recognized with the Congressional Medal of Honor.Eric Blehm mined never-before-released documents and made use of extensive personal testimonies to create as full a picture as possible of the May 2, 1968 Special Forces mission and all what led up to it. As an author, he puts the facts together coherently, but he also tells compelling personal stories.We get to read excerpts of letters and transcripts of audio tapes sent home by these these soldiers to their families. We see their character, their fortitude, their fidelity. We see young men (ordinary young men- who never expected to be called heroes) who knew what it was like to stare death in the face daily, to eat and drink war, and who did what was necessary to protect their brothers in arms. They made the hard choices. They spent themselves in the name of serving their country. We see ""greater love has no man than this- to lay down his life for his friends"" in all its original rawness.I'd put this book on a required-reading for high school students.Now I'm off to wrap and mail my copy down to a college age cousin who's minoring in Military History.I thank Crown Publishers for providing me with a review copy through Blogging for Books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REON5HILUTT0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139512#wasThisHelpful","REON5HILUTT0R","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as we all think we'd prefer answers, sometimes what we really need is a question.A question can cut us right in half, pare us down to our deepest secrets, reveal the truth we already knew.Jesus asked a lot of question.""Who you you think I am?""""Has no one condemned you?""""Why have you forsaken me?""""What are you seeking?""Just a few words apiece, these questions continue to echo through our universe. Yes, they meant something the moment they were uttered, and they still mean something today. In this book, Israel Wayne looks at 20 questions from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. From these questions, Israel draws lessons about the lordship of Christ, the forgiveness of sin, the hope of the resurrection, and the sovereignty of God.The questions that Jesus asked can move you from just ""knowing another thing"" about some facet of Christianity to realizing what it means for you. (And I think He knew that when He asked them.)Each chapter is short and to the point, making this ideal for a Bible study (one chapter per question) or as a faith-enriching read.I'll be shelving Israel Wayne's ""Questions Jesus Asks: Where Divinity meets Humanity"" near another similar book, ""Dare to Answer: Eight Questions to Awaken your Faith"" by John Busacker.I thank the author and Cross Focused Reviews for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3729A2OWD59QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892217340#wasThisHelpful","R3729A2OWD59QY","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Everybody's been there,Everybody's been stared down by the enemyFallen for the fearAnd done some disappearing...Honestly, I wanna see you be brave.Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you liveMaybe one of these days you can let the light inShow me how big your brave is.""~Lyrics from the song ""Brave"" by Sara Bareilles.That song has a way of getting caught inside my head whenever I hear it. Who doesn't need somebody encouraging them to be brave?Nicole Unice has written this book to point us towards the best kind of bravery: Jesus-Courage, she calls it. See, apparently there was a word for it in the Greek New Testament, ""tharseo,"" and it means to have  courage or cheer in your heart, or strengthen or comfort your heart with courage. And apparently, that's the word that Jesus used rather often: ""Take heart, for I have overcome the world.... for your faith has made you well... do not be afraid, it is I.""Nicole suggests that this Jesus-courage can saturate our souls to the point that we are brave enough to face life with His courage even in our fear.In each chapter, Nicole adds another aspect of life that we can be Brave Enough for.Brave Enough to get in the race, to say to Jesus ""Teach me who you are, and show me how to carry on and find the goodness you've given me.""Brave Enough to love grace- because despite the pretty name it has, grace is frightening. It's everything for the child of God, but trusting grace is like falling into an invisible safety net. Sure, you tell me it's there, but I won't know until I fall down and find it there.Brave Enough to explore your territory- to find your gifts (whether they appear to be big or small) and dare to accept them. She has a wonderful image for a woman who's found her gifts: She's a prism, and now the light can stream through her and make a rainbow. That picture will stick with me. What makes you feel like you're casting a rainbow?Brave Enough to know your own limits, and to leave space in your days for your soul to breathe.Brave Enough to fight *for* what matters, especially in relationships. We can learn how to move away from the win/lose and guilt/innocence narratives, because those only lead to an attack/shame posture. We can learn to face conflict with an eye for reconciliation and renewed hope.After all, as Nicole points out, what does it mean to take up your cross each day, unless it means we must operate out of our daily brave?I thank Tyndale House for providing me with a review copy in exchange for my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AICX551DXZGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496401360#wasThisHelpful","R2AICX551DXZGV","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Together with You"" is a strong story that hits all the right notes of hope and reality.The hope comes when the characters realize that they can build a very good life, even when their reality will include hard choices and perpetual struggles.Carly Jo comes from a tight-knit Kentucky community, and her beloved father is the town's preacher-man. From him, she learned the truths of her faith, and he modeled care and kindness and fidelity. It's no wonder that she would end up working with children.It is a wonder that all the steps and stops of her life would take her so far from her roots. We meet her in California, living in a doctors home, as a nanny/caregiver for his motherless daughter.This story may remind you of ""The Sound of Music"" in all the right ways.There's a serious man, a decent man, who's lost touch with his children's hearts.There's a handful of kids who need both guidance *and* some good times with their dad.And there's a gentle woman, strong enough in the strength that comes from God to give her all in the name of healing a family.This is a romance, most definitely, but the author remembers a critical point- that there are many kinds of love in the world- and she weaves them all into her story.  There are moments of innocent humor, and moments of familial goodness, and moments of tenderness between two people who are better together than apart.I'll be on the lookout for another book by Victoria Bylin.

"I had heard so much about Mark Batterson's books, but I'd never gotten around to reading one of them. I decided to change that when ""A Trip Around the Sun"" came up for review from Baker books.In this book, Mark introduces us to his dear friend and mentor, Richard Foth. Together, these men lay out their visions for what abundant, adventurous life looks like. Both men find God to be the source of all goodness, so worship of Him and service for Him provides their daily purpose, and inspires their work.In a series of short dual-perspective chapters, Mark and Dick engage with various personal-growth themes. You can tell from the way their thoughts complement each other that they have a bond of deep respect and affection. This comes through in their writing, and each thought they present comes with stories from their own lives.The last sentence of each chapter gives you a peek into the heart of their message.""Don't Accumulate Possessions, Accumulate Experiences.""""Goals are Dreams with Deadlines.""""Catch People Doing Things Right.""""Happiness is a by-product of Holiness.""""Never Lose a Holy Curiosity.""""The Greatest Freedom is Having Nothing to Prove.""""The Closest Thing to Christ-Likeness is Child-Likeness.""And finally, ""It's Never Too Late to Be Who You Might Have Been.""Clearly, this is a book by men who believe that God isn't going to run short of glory or mercy, and that we all can live with grace and enthusiasm.If that sounds good to you, or if you feel like you're stuck in a rut, grab a copy of ""A Trip Around the Sun.""Meanwhile, I'll be on the lookout for other Batterson books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OY9GWI0KH5KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801016835#wasThisHelpful","R3OY9GWI0KH5KQ","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm grateful to have a sunny piece of land to plant a garden in, and I'm delighted by the arrival of ready crops: multiple kinds of summer squash, crisp cucumbers, heavy tomatoes, home-grown potatoes, red radishes, tiny eggplants, beets and their greens, basil in pots, cabbages and Brussels sprouts, bush and pole beans, even a pepper or two. And if these cultivated plants aren't enough, we can forage the wild for blueberries and blackberries in their season.Indeed, Summer is a time of abundance, with almost infinite sweet and savory possibilities.So that's why I was so happy to get a copy of ""The Broad Fork."" Hugh Acheson is a two-time James Beard Award winning chef, who has a serious love for fresh produce, and his new book releases right in the middle of garden season? Count me in.""The Broad Fork"" provides ideas for every one of the vegetables and fruits I mentioned, as well as almost three dozen more varieties of produce- from tatsoi to garlic to asparagus to morels to melons to corn.The best part of this book for me was Hugh's evident delight in his topic. (The guy has a radish tattooed on his arm to remind him of the first thing he ever grew, his introduction to the farm/food/table cycle.)He has a profound respect and admiration for the men and women who till the earth and bring us its bounty. That's why his cookbook includes profiles of his favorite local farms, and encouragement for you and I to find out what's growing in our own area. ""Making friends with farmers"" would have been an apt subtitle for this volume, and I mean that in the very best of ways.I'm blessed with a garden, but if you don't have that then Hugh points to the opportunities found at farmer's markets and CSAs.Now, about the recipes themselves.On rare occasions I'll follow a recipe exactly, but I typically use cookbooks for inspiration. I get the basic idea, and then I take off in my own direction.(Yeah... I know what you're thinking. Sometimes my results *are* admittedly interesting.)  I've been marking all the recipes I plan to follow. One of them is ""duxelle,"" a mushroom paste that sounds like a delicious complement for roast. Another is corn spoonbread... sounds great. Another is roasted beet soup with hard-boiled eggs. Then there's fried okra with remoulade. Or creamy cauliflower gratin. Or eggplant with tahini and yogurt.Doesn't this all sound so good?Now, some of the ingredients I have never seen before. (This is a restaurant chef's book, after all!) I don't have fresh thyme, sherry vinegar, pancetta, or speck- just found out that the latter is an Italian ham. BUT- I do think that these recipes can be a fabulous jumping-off point for the home cook. I hate to use the dreaded word ""substitution,"" but I'm sure there's a way to make this work. I will use cream cheese in place of fromage blanc on my radish cucumber sandwich, and I think it will be fine. :-DIn short, I was sitting here reading this cookbook, and another family member came along and grabbed it, looked at the pictures, and began making requests.

"""Dare to Answer"" by John Busaker is one of those books that immediately sets you off in the wrong direction.You read something it in and you think ""This would be great for so-and-so, she really needs this.""The author describes two doors. Behind the first one are fifteen things that are not pretty, and we can easily fool ourselves into thinking ""Nope, that's not me."" Door number two hides nine aspects, all God-inspired, which we could all enjoy more of with some time and care.This could be considered a self-help book. It's easy going and at the end of each question/chapter there are a couple of Scriptures to examine and a couple personal challenges to address.It is designed to deepen your faith, with the author realizing that this takes time and patience.

"Eamon Goodman is the traitor's heir, who fears that his own blood will betray his faltering faith.He is the King's Hand, who bears two conflicting titles and is claimed by opposite loyalties.Now, in the third and final volume of Anna Thayer's Knight of Eldaran Trilogy, the stakes are higher than they've ever been before.How can a man whose spirit was captured by the clear light from the Star of Brenuin serve under the draining red fire of the Throned? How can he be the oppressors Right Hand? For that is what Eamon is- Right Hand over the River Realm.And the Realm writhes and frets, every corner full of destruction and suspicion. Eamon's beloved city is held in the poisoned grip of the Master, and the scent of war is born on every breath of wind. The feared invasion of the Serpent and his forces terrifies the weakened citizens, yet for Eamon, that day will be the coming of his King. ""Hold fast,"" he whispers courage to his own heart- but the lies still torment him, flooding his mind, and the Master feeds him tastes of power.Can a broken blade be made true?I don't dare try to thoroughly explain what makes this set of books so fine. All a review can do is hint at the goodness of them.If you're considering diving into Eamon's series, expect to find words well used, drawing images that linger in your mind's eye.Expect to follow the action with rapid page turning, *and* spend time quietly absorbing the kindness and majesty and honor and truth that you'll find.I thank Lion Hudson for gifting me with copies of all three books as they were published, in exchange for honest opinions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K1X48ZBTDJVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178264105X#wasThisHelpful","R1K1X48ZBTDJVR","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mosaic: disparate, broken pieces, some of them literal trash, selected by an artist and then brought together into a new whole that is so right and true that you almost forget the material's past existence- but not quite.When you look at a mosaic, you're aware that the current beauty was formed out of sheer brokenness. The past is renewed and reformed in the present, and we recognize the art of that.The idea of a mosaic as a metaphor for our spiritual transformation is not a new one, but it is incarnated in a fresh and satisfying way in Betsy St. Amant's latest novel.At first I thought, ""Well, this is like a decent Hallmark movie. Guy and girl have A History Together, and both of them are All Grown Up Now and Trying to Move On, but they end up in the Same Small Town and all the old patterns are still in place. Sparks Fly, Etc. That's nice. This will be an entertaining little read.""And then by the end I was saying ""Whoa. That went deeper than I'd thought it would.""If you want a love story, you'll find one here.

"""Summer's List"" is a warm-hearted story filled with characters who are just-this-side-of-fanciful yet real enough that you'll root for them.After caring for her parents during a long post-accident recovery, and then losing them to their injuries, Summer Snow formed a very tight bond with her Granny. She learned every lesson of life from Granny, finding love in Granny's arms and hope in Granny's faith, and she formed her early adulthood around Granny and the bookshop they ran together.And now, she's about to lose Granny too. Heart failure is slowly sapping her strength, but Summer's grandmother knows that she can't leave this earth without giving Summer one final gift. The ""gift"" is an odd one- it's a list of things that Summer has to do, most of them whimsical and beautiful.The clincher is, Granny wants Summer to complete this list in the company of a childhood best friend, Martin.Contacting and reuniting with Martin is step one on Summer's list, and their old camaraderie may just the healing balm Summer needs in this painful hour. If only Martin didn't have so many troubles in his own family!As Summer executes her Granny's wishes, engaging in the activities Granny chose, something becomes increasingly clear. This wasn't about the list. It was about a new mindset, a new way of looking at the world. The list was only the beginning.Maybe the true adventure is found right in our daily lives, when we open ourselves up to love, when we keep an eye out for wonderful possibilities, when we listen to someone else's story. That, for me, was the heart of ""Summer's List.""

"When I began ""The Mapmaker's Children,"" I was only passingly familiar with the man named John Brown.In case you don't remember him either, he was the radical abolitionist and insurrectionist who was executed in 1859 for seizing a government building in the Harper's Ferry raid. With deep, Scripture-centered convictions about the evil of slavery, Mr. Brown determined to lead a rebellion and set the slaves free. The tragedy is the blood he shed in the process. I'm sure volumes have been written about the man and his mind and motivations, because his acts are considered one of the catalysts that began the War Between the States.""The Mapmaker's Children"" is not a John Brown biography. It's not a historical biography of anybody, as the author tells us in her endnotes. It is the story of two women, one from today and one from a hundred and fifty years ago. The lady from the past, though, is based on John Brown's daughter- Sarah.By the end of this book, I was both intrigued and troubled by John Brown's role in history, and I cared about the fate of his family as the author imagined it.Sarah is fiercely loyal to her father, even when she wishes that he'd trust her with his plans. The fight for abolition is men's work, yet Sarah has a skill that her father needs. She is a deft and talented artist, with a memory for natural scenes and a hand that captures their likeness keenly. Sarah has what is needed to be a mapmaker for the Underground Railroad.This is her story- of her grief over her father, her choices of how to live and who to love, and her heart full of devotion in a torn world. And it may become your new favorite historical novel.Of course, there is the modern storyline too. That story, and its links to Sarah's, comes together with similar power. Eden and Jack Anderson have spent years trying to ""start a family."" That innocent little phrase masks the regret, frustration, and fear that came along with infertility. And Eden feels so alone.Over the course of Eden's chapters, we watch her slowly come back to life again in all the best ways. We feel little stabs of her pain, and we taste the small pleasures that sneak into her dark days. The supporting characters are gems, too, with their own struggles and moments of growth.""The Mapmaker's Children"" is a great example of a dual-perspective novel. It marries the modern and historical voices, and keeps both individual stories moving along while engaging the reader.I thank Crown Publishing through Blogging for Books for my review copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV7JFQHL4WGJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348908#wasThisHelpful","RV7JFQHL4WGJ5","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I'm reading and reviewing (and enjoying) this book as one of The Next Generation.(No, not the Star Trek fandom, the young Christians growing up today.)And I have to say, I love the ideas behind this book and I want to be a part of putting these concepts into practice.The longing for somebody to listen to us without getting upset or thinking they need to be our savior, to share their life lessons without being heavy handed or negative and to give the precious gift of their time and affection- I think those are universal desires.Some say it's mentoring, some say it's making disciples, some just call it friendship, whatever word you use it all comes down to intentional investment in another's life. I can do that, you can do that, and somebody can do that for us.Frankly, if an older woman came alongside me and began listening to me and talking with me following the approach outlined in this book, I'd probably soak it right up. Pamela encourages women to gain one main quality- that of being a safe haven.If you expect to speak frankly about ""vocation"" and ""sexuality"" and other charged topics, then you'd better be an open-hearted listener. We'd better know that our secrets are safe and our struggles aren't turn-offs. You'd better be able to bear with issues that may have no resolution, and to encourage our frail little dreams.There is a place- a big place- for guidance and even correction.It just has to be planted in the good soil of Trust, Comfort, Understanding, and Compassion.""A Friend in Me"" makes this abundantly clear. And it also makes clear the wonderful weight of a well-spoken word. Kind words, inspiring words, dream-giving words, they can feed a heart and change a whole life.So let's all be a safe haven for somebody. Let's all speak worthy words. Let's be friends.Thank you David C Cook publishers through Litfuse Publicity for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNMITSNCOZIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434708640#wasThisHelpful","RXNMITSNCOZIN","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, we've been loving the Christiansen family for the last two years now.We've followed their adventures, gotten misty over their heartaches, and delighted in their personal renewals.Darek, Eden, Grace, and Casper have revealed their secrets through the pages.But little Amelia, the baby of the family- she's stayed a mystery.Oh sure, we saw her in the background- camera around her neck, lending a hand at the family's resort, and encouraging everyone else to  expect wonderful things.Now, this is Amelia's turn to tell her story.She's not sure whether it was a reach for independence or a desire to make her own mark in the world, but she went further away from home than any of her siblings. She went all the way to Prague. And then she came back.What happened in the middle is unknown to most of her clan. She only shared bits and pieces. They know that her heart got broken- some guy named Roark. And they know that Roark came to Deep Haven, showed up at their door just as bold as you please.And Amelia's brothers send him home- all the way back across The Pond. Good riddance, it's over.Well, what if Roark and Amelia weren't as over as it seemed? What if he came back again- risking the wrath of the Christiansen men to win the lady's hand? As you can imagine with a set-up like that, there'd plenty of drama in Deep Haven. (There'd also be plenty of small town charm, as Roark tried to enter Amelia's world.)The sub-plot is a continuation of Max and Grace's story, and I found it to be a worthy follow-up to their own ""When I Fall in Love."" If you've been wondering when/where/and how those two tie the knot, expect to laugh at the answer. And if you've been wondering how Max and Grace can make a life of love together while expecting a painful future, you'll be touched by their decisions.I'm glad to have ""The Wonder of You"" on my shelf. I'll be returning to it as a comfort read when I need a pick-me-up some day.It's hard to believe that out time in Deep Haven with a Christiansen tour guide is almost over. Owen's story is the last one left to tell, and I'm eager to hear it.

"The villagers have begun calling her Widow Kearney.Not that she hears it often to her face- Carlyn has avoided the village for many moons. She's been busy eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, watching the road for her Ambrose's return. Carlyn is one of many wives left behind when the Civil War called away her husband, but his status as 'missing' places her in limbo. She can't carry on her life, and she can't fully grieve his death.When the ax finally falls and Carlyn loses their little house, she beseeches Heaven for an answer, and she seems to hear it in the ringing of the Shaker's bell. This celibate community offers her refuge in exchange for two things: put your hands to work and turn your heart to God. Carlyn has practiced both of those disciples all of her life. Becoming Sister Carlyn- just until Ambrose comes home- seems to be her answer.Ann Gabhart's books have always been literary comfort food for me. They're quietly nourishing, and leave a sweet ""taste"" in your mind when you finish. This is no exception.The spiritual heart of the story was, for me, a question of the answers God provides. Asking for them, and then opening up to them. Few ""answers"" are obvious, like a bolt of lightning writing words across the sky would be. Maybe they're more like a rain storm, pouring all around you- both calling you out to drink in the freshness and sending you to shelter.And the romance- well, as Ann admits in the dedication, a Shaker and a Sheriff is a new combination for her. And it's a very good one. Mitchell Brodie is first intrigued by Carlyn, then comes to care for her. But how does a man reach out to an only-perhaps-widow who's chosen a life in a religious community?I'm guessing that Carlyn's dog Asher was one of Ann's favorite characters to write. He is indeed a special creature- but you'll have to read the story if you want to know how.I'm going to have to read the rest of Ann's Harmony Hill series now. She did a great job spinning an engaging yarn, weaving in a thread of Shaker history, and dying her characters vivid colors.I thank Revell for providing me with a review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPSNABKRBTL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800723414#wasThisHelpful","R3PPSNABKRBTL5","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the last two years, I've come to this conclusion: If Plough Publishing House is going to publish a book, I want to read it.I was delighted when I received my copy of ""Everyone Belongs to God,"" with an invitation to share my honest opinion.So, here it is: This book is common sense wisdom, from a father to his son-in-law, and each page is richly infused with the steady love of God.There's a more modern book by Leonard Sweet, called ""Nudge- Awakening People to the God Who's Already There."" Mr. Sweet wanted to remind everyone that it's not our job to 'bring people to God,' because every one of us already lives and moves and has our being in the presence of God, under his hand and receiving his touch. Mr. Sweet suggested the best evangelism is the kind that wakes us up to the good news that God has provided, the truth that surrounds you even in your unbelief. His book was viewed as a revolutionary new concept breaking into Evangelical evangelism.Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt's book proves that these idea have been around for quite a while.Mr. Blumhardt wrote his words over one hundred years ago, in personal letters to his son-in-law, a missionary to China.Mr. Blumhardt challenges his son to live among the common people as neighbors and friends, to gain their trust by being a decent human being.He challenges him to keep an eye out for everything true and good and beautiful in the culture around him, and to accept it and build upon it as a foundation for displaying Christ's ultimate glory.He encourages him to trust God's heart for these people, even if no standard conversions are forthcoming.He begs him to work for the Kingdom, pushing towards justice and peace and grace, even if the ""gains"" seem small to a human eye.In other words, this man gave suggestions that apply in every time and every place. He asked his son-in-law to cling tightly to the Gospel of reconciliation and redemption, and to hold ""Christian"" forms and traditions loosely.I can see where, in my small New England town in the internet-age, there's a lot for me to learn from this little book. If I'm serious about wrapping my life in the glorious Gospel, and trying to give people what God in Christ has given me, then I'd better return to this volume a few times in the coming years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHOM3EG56CRH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874866464#wasThisHelpful","RHOM3EG56CRH9","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book for anybody who is trying to find some goodness in the world, or who is striving to ""be good.""It's for the fearful, the shamed, the despairing, the disturbed, the outcast, the worried, the dry and thirsty souls who really need grace.First, I've gotta say- Christine Hoover writes like a Puritan. I mean this is the best of ways. She delivers truth with words fitly spoken- dispensing rich theology in memorable phrases. She exalts the Glory of Christ and remains honest about the human condition, showing us God's tenderness.I'm guessing that Christine is a fan of Charles Spurgeon.Just sayin'.I'm afraid of oversimplifying a satisfyingly thorough book, but I feel like the heart of her message is this- Everything comes down to God's initiation, and we move in response to Him. Grace and Gratitude/ Gift and Reception/ Invitation and Welcome.Grace surrounds us, and permeates us. It reconciles us to God and restores us to Him in open relationship. Our reactions become colored by grace, and grace gives us the strength to reach out to the world.Here's a few thoughts from Christine-""We cannot contain love, and we cannot reach its end, but we can respond to the Love-Giver.""""Worship develops into a craving for God. He is our safe place, the one whose wings we hide beneath. He is our companion, our security, our assurance. He is the truest peace we'll ever find. As we receive his care and loving provision for our soul's needs, we crave to be with him, and we treasure the Word where he beckons us to meet with him. Our desire is for him, and we devour Scripture looking for the ways he moves and speaks and loves.""""The Gospel- Christ- is synonymous with grace. When we talk about our dwelling place, our home, we're talking about grace. We entered by the grace of Christ, we remain because of the grace of Christ, and our future salvation and hope are because of the grace of Christ.""Grace cleanses us, gives us hope, teaches us how to love, provides our security, and focuses our eyes on Jesus. As we lean into grace, and rest on it, we begin to know the heart of God and become more like Christ.I thank Baker Publishing for providing me with a review copy of ""From Good to Grace.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHG04F2FENXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801016673#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHG04F2FENXJ","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""This is my body, broken for you. Take and eat.""When Jesus spoke those words, and handed out that bread, he gave us true nourishment that we can't explain.Now, in ""Our One Great Act of Fidelity,"" Fr. Ronald Rolheiser meditates on that Body and what it means to break it, share it, and receive it.Despite the differences between the Catholic and Protestant forms of communion, Fr. Rolheiser's writing could probably touch anybody's heart. {Not being a member of a church, I've never even received communion. Still, I loved this book.}He has a way of getting down to the heart of the matter, bringing his years of theological study and his personal spirituality together, and showing us how the things of God flourish in the world that He made.When I read Rolheiser, I think ""He understands.""Well, just listen to him. Here's a sampling of quotes.The Eucharist... ""is that place in our world where God takes on concrete flesh. The incarnation is still going on. The Word is still becoming flesh and living among us.""""Our Eucharists, like our homes and places of work, bring us together even as we are still filled with distrust, jealousy, paranoia, and misunderstandings. We stand around the Eucharistic table with the same wounds we bring to our other tables.""""The Eucharist tries, first of all, to change us so that we become what we receive, one body, one community, one heart, and one spirit. And that is no easy thing to achieve.""""The Eucharistic person is ... the child of the kingdom, the grace-merry person who, while sharing fully in the tears of this world, is ultimately distinguished by his or her laughter.""In this slim volume, no page is wasted. There are compelling ideas everywhere. He ponders the Eucharist as a vigil of waiting, a sacrifice, an invitation to mature discipleship, reconciliation, the touch of God upon our very skin, and a window to the priestly prayer of Christ.My favorite section was ""A Spirituality of the Eucharist,"" where he discusses Life as Gift, and our lives as receptive Gratitude.I thank Image Books for providing me with a review copy. In a scant number of pages, Fr. Rolheiser provides days worth of reflection.

"Cynthia Ruchti writes so that we can see what's she's talking about. When you read her sentences, your imagination fills with the sounds and colors and sensations that she's describing.{This descriptiveness comes in handy when she's talking about food- I could just about taste the root vegetable soup and the crustless quiche served at the Wild Iris Inn!}Cynthia is also skilled at rendering emotions. I could feel the combination of serenity and good chaos at the Wild Iris; I could see the dilapidated cottage and its latent possibility, and I could sense the hollow in Emmalyn's chest when she thought of her husband behind bars.Emmalyn is a bit of a reserved character at first. She has her secrets and she certainly doesn't intend to share them with strangers. A little distance is her protective measure. After all, when we meet her she is unmoored from all seeming securities, and she's about to ride a ferry across Lake Superior into a strange future.This story takes place in two separate-yet-linked spheres: Madeline Island, where Emmalyn is starting over, and a state prison, where her husband is incarcerated. This makes for a very compelling read. In fact, I can't think of another book that has featured a character dealing with a loved one behind bars. The circumstances allow some penetrating questions to be asked- can people change? Can we move beyond a your fault/my fault mindset into an era of restoration? Can the relationship be repaired? Does hope live here- even here?The title of this book, and the heart of the story, derive from a verse in Job, in which Job is promised that someday he will remember his troubles ""as waters gone by.""

"Earlier this Spring I had the chance to read ""No More Perfect Kids"" by Dr. Kathy Koch. I now think that book belongs on every parent's shelf, and I'm inclined to think that ""Never Say No"" should be next to it.This is an awesome book that's full of ideas that could change our relationships with everybody, not just our children. But if you have children, so yourself a favor and try this book. It does not set itself up to be an owner's manual, an instruction book, or a recipe. After all, we are dealing with human beings- not rifles, engines, or collie dogs.As the authors explain, if you want behavior modification, there are numerous ways to achieve that. Who hasn't seen shame, fear, and anger used to manipulate somebody? It ""works""- on the surface. People adjust their words and actions to appease and calm the situation. Yet deep down, that unhealthy trio destroys.So what do we really want when dealing with people in general and when raising children in specific? We want relationship, I'd say.We want communication and understanding.That's what this book is about. It's about walking without our kids through each area of life. Together, we can share the ""safe chaos"" of community, we can explore God's work and His ways, we go with courage into the big world, we can let Christ shape our character, and we can train our appetites to crave the good, the better, and the best.Working from the infant years through childhood and up to the late teens and twenties, Mark and Jan share what they tried to do with their kids, and we find inspiration for ourselves. There are so many things to consider as you read this book, little things that you can integrate into your days. They discuss all the usual stuff- praise, boundaries, discipline, confidence, responsibility, goals, dreams- but they set each topic in the context of relationship, and that's what makes this book valuable.I thank Litfuse and David C Cook publishing for my review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9YBZQF7G20Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781411734#wasThisHelpful","R2P9YBZQF7G20Q","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Long Fall... the third book in the Hawk and Dove series.This story opens with Brother Tom, musing on the loveliness of a late summer eve. Tom is now thirty-three years old, and well settled in his life at St. Alcuin's. He is Father Peregrine's personal attendant, and as such his responsibilities range from shaving his superior to lecturing him in common sense. Tom has bonded with his Abbot, more than if they were blood relations. Father knows when Tom is troubled, and always invites him to ""Tell me about it."" Tom knows when Father is pushing himself beyond reason, and he gently-but-firmly takes him to task. It's a relationship of respect and common humanity.Could anything break their understanding?Could a change in circumstances destroy their mutual trust?Can a soul make itself understood when a body is weakened and afflicted?Can love reach beyond speechlessness and provide a healing embrace in pain?These and other essential questions are asked in this tender tale. I can see the author's background in hospice care coming through in this episode. She shows us Brother Tom coping with the physical suffering of his dear friend, and learning how to walk that friend toward death, while coping with his own varied emotions and reactions.Some scenes are so beautiful, and so true, and so good, as we see grace amid hard realities. Her portrayal of Brother John and Brother Michael, the monastery's infirmarians, is a tribute to all those who work in the healing arts. The indignity of illness and the depersonalization of becoming only a ""patient""- John and Michael resist those attitudes. They strive to tend the sick with the care of Christ, treating each old, sick man with the same honor as when they were sound and healthy.Read these books, and let the characters take up residence in your heart.

"On and off through the years, I've seen people recommend Penelope Wilcock's ""The Hawk and the Dove"" series. I had it in the back of my mind to try them, and never got around to it. Now, thanks to Lion Hudson Publishing, I've been able to encounter these stories in fresh reprint editions.At first, the books sound rather obscure. Vignettes from a 14th century Benedictine monastery? Wasn't that the Dark Ages? Were people back then even human? Didn't monks live such tiny lives? What could they have to say to me?It turns out, these winsome stories have a great deal to teach me, and perhaps you too.In Abbot Peregrine's own pain, the wounds of Christ have become very precious to him. These wounds of God- received because of love- are at the core of Peregrine's theology. They comfort him in his afflictions, and they teach him mercy when he interacts with the world.Again, as you read this book, you'll see Peregrine being refined like gold in the fire. This conforming to the image of Christ happens slowly, surely, and with many stumbles on the way. Reading about Peregrine, I felt a little whisper in my heart: ""God doesn't abandon the work that he's begun.""Along with Peregrine, we also see Brothers Francis and Tom and Theodore and Cormac, and we get to peek into their maturing lives.You may think a monastery would be a narrow, joyless, dull place- but there's a great deal of life being lived within the gates of St. Alcuin's!When Father Peregrine is invited to a theological debate, will justice or mercy win?Does Brother Francis have any substance underneath his easy laugh and ready smile, or is he merely shallow and unmoved by things of importance?What was that incident regarding Brother Tom and a certain girl?And what happens when a piece of sensual, spiritual poetry is discovered on the grounds?You'll find out the answers to these questions and more, in this second delightful volume of the Hawk and Dove series.You'll be glad to know there's five more books waiting for you!

"On and off through the years, I've seen people recommend Penelope Wilcock's ""The Hawk and the Dove"" series. I had it in the back of my mind to try them someday. Now, thanks to Lion Hudson Publishing, I've been able to encounter these stories in fresh reprint editions.At first, the books sound rather obscure. Vignettes from a 14th century Benedictine monastery? Wasn't that the Dark Ages? Were people back then even human? Didn't monks live such tiny lives? What could they have to say to me?Oh, there's so many reasons to read these books.Read them for the fine writing that turns these little tales into magic doors that transport you to another world.Read them for their deceptive simplicity, because while they're stories of particular people and place- the brothers of St. Alcuin's- they're somehow about you and I too.Read them for the way they'll absorb you utterly, and the way you'll crave the next chapter, and the way they'll feed your heart.Read them for Brothers Tom and Cormac and Francis and Theodore. Enjoy the delightful camaraderie of young men all trying to understand their vocations and conform their lives to the pattern of simple service. There are antics and escapades and growth in goodness aplenty among these novices!Read them for Brothers Andrew and Matthew and Edward, older men who took their vows long ago and still find themselves learning God's ways.Read them for Father Peregrine, the abbot who leads them all, with justice and distance at first, and eventually with a true shepherd's merciful hand.These men may belong to the 1300s, but the human heart still breaks and mends in the same old ways.Father Peregrine feels real enough to step off the pages. His ""strength"" and his ""weakness"" are both laid bare for us- humility and pride, gentleness and severity, prayer and tears- and we see him become the Wounded Healer, a man who can bless others because he owns his brokenness and offers it falteringly to God. He's not a stained-glass saint, lovely as those are. He's a laughing, working, struggling man who ""does Christianity"" in a beautiful way.And I'd be remiss not to mention Melissa and her family as well.In the first two books of this series, each monastery story is grounded in a scene between fifteen year old Melissa and her mother. Melissa's wise mother understands the best way to guide and guard her daughter's growing spirit is to give her stories, and these accounts of Father Peregrine are their distant family history. We see Melissa and Mary and Beth and Cecily and Therese- the five daughters- going about their days, with Melissa eager for the next story that Mother will tell. You may find yourself craving a cup of tea as you read.I hope somehow I've conveyed a bit of the winsome, heart-easing, encouraging nature of this book.

"I read a book called Bloody Point a while ago. It was a mystery, revolving around two FBI Agents, Jake Tucker and Cass McKenna. They had been good friends and partners until Mike McKenna, Cassie's husband and an agent himself, had died. Cass resigned from work, retreated into grief, and found a slender ray of hope in restoring a neglected sailboat. Jake wasn't content to leave her like that, and he began investigating Mike's death again... finding surprising evidence and making dangerous connections.The story balanced action with emotion, and I wasn't the only reader asking for a sequel!Now, ten years after the first book, Linda J. White has satisfied out demands. Jake and Cass return!""Lady Justice can be battered too...""If you loved Bloody Point, then you'll come into Battered Justice with questions.Did Cass finish restoring the Alberg 30?Did she go back to work?How is she doing now that Mike's last case is solved?Will Jake repair his relationship with his estranged wife?If not, is there something more than partnership between him and Cass?Oh, dear reader, rest assured... all these questions and more will be answered.If you didn't read Bloody Point, that's Ok too, because this is a whole new story.Where to begin? There are some suspense novels I've read that were just that- suspense novels.What I mean is the characters seemed to have been invented to carry the plot. I may remember the blown-up building and the body count, but I never connected to the humanity of the characters. In a Linda White book, it's been the other way around. For me it feels like her characters are the most important, and bad things happen to them and mysteries find them and they deal with life and its challenges.Now, don't let ""character driven"" fool you into thinking there's no plot. There sho'nuff is.And it's a plot that takes you through grimy back alleys and tragic crime scenes and powerful politicians' offices and into the midnight noise and glare of a casinos. You'll follow suspicious cars and make friends with a kids from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" and you'll trust your life to fellow agents and you'll enter the courtroom to face Guilt and Innocence head on.Not only is this an engaging mystery, it's also a bit of a tribute to the agents and officers that make up our law enforcement. The work of these men and women is fascinating to read about, and Linda also shows their personal lives ""behind the badge,"" making for a well-rounded portrait.One last bit of advice for the reading world.When you ask an author for a sequel, and they say yes, be prepared.Be prepared for them to crush your favorite characters. Expect the author to test them, and place them in the fire, and to not let them out until they're transformed. Halfway through the book you'll be saying ""No, stop! They can't handle this! I can't handle this! Author, it's all too much!""And in the end, you'll love those literary people more than ever, because you've journeyed beside them through conflict and brokenness. It won't all be easy reading, but it's worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVUU47T40S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1NNAMS#wasThisHelpful","RRVUU47T40S0","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Perhaps being disillusioned is a good thing if it leaves you facing the Truth.""That was my thought after finishing Searching for Sunday.Rachel Held Evans knew who she was. She was a pastor's daughter, ensconced in a tight-knit Evangelical community. Her family was a link in a chain of giving and receiving, of visiting the sick and sending casseroles to new mothers. All of her childhood memories were bracketed by those familiar people and that particular expression of Christianity. And it was, in some ways, a very good thing.But in other ways, that same sense of unity would leave a growing Rachel wondering where she fit. She makes an excellent point partway through the book: In Evangelical circles, we call ourselves ""a community of believers."" Because we're afraid of faith becoming mere rote routine and ritual, we emphasize the personal beliefs. And we often ask our people to believe far more than just the Nicene Creed. We mine the Scriptures for dozens of other principles and doctrines, and we package it together as a whole.So when Rachel could no longer swallow the whole Evangelical serving, when she could no longer sign off on the doctrinal statement, she felt that she'd lost her place in her childhood church.She unfolds her stories a sensitive touch, holding on to the things that blessed and nourished her even as she describes her strong disagreements with the American Evangelical culture.When did she begun to trust her place in the Body again? When she found a place at the table of communion, a place on the path of pilgrimage, a place in the row of footwashers, a place where the healing oil flows. When she couldn't bear the weight of belief any more, it was tangible, tactile sacraments that re-introduced her to Christ and His people.I requested this book because I had heard that it was arranged around the sacraments, and that idea piqued my curiosity.Rachel chose seven sacraments: Baptism, Confession, Holy Orders, Communion, Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick, and Marriage.She writes several chapters about each one, telling us what they have come to mean to her and drawing in dozens of thoughts from saints both ancient and modern. She manages to meditate on the essence of each one, revealing them to be so compelling and beautiful that it seems to me like the sacraments must preserve the church, instead of the other way 'round.And she does a wonderful job showing how the sacraments apply to all of us. (Typically, marriage would seem to have no bearing on the single, and holy orders would be reserved for the ordained.) Rachel expands on those ideas, exploring marriage as the mystery of our union with Jesus and holy orders as the calling of every man and woman to recognize and live their sacred calling.Buried about three quarters of the way through the book is one of my new favorite quotes: ""Scripture doesn't speak of people who found God. Scripture speaks of people who walked with God.""  Excellent point. I never like the whole ""I found God,"" thing. It doesn't make theological or logical sense. But walking with God? Oh yes. That points to ongoing relationship, and that's what this book is about.I thank Traci at Traces of Faith dot com and Thomas Nelson for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWPVECO2V7MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718022122#wasThisHelpful","RBWPVECO2V7MG","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every Stephanie Landsem book I've read has gone straight to my heart. Sometimes it was a character refreshing my heart, sometimes it was a scene putting hairline cracks in it, but the story was always a treasure.First came The Well, then The Thief, and now The Tomb.The best part of the Living Water series is the way it's crafted. While the spirit of each installment is the stories of Scripture, Stephanie develops plots and subplots that twine and weave and layer together. She puts story-flesh on Biblical people, and invents other men and women who could have jumped from the pages of the New Testament. When you immerse yourself in these novels, you encounter a piece of the Gospel, you meet the Good News.In this case, you find the Good News through Martha's story.Martha, Mary, and Lazarus are the grown children of a devout widower, who observes the rules of his religion as carefully as possible.Martha runs her father's house like a matron twice her age, attending to the duties of hearth and family. She watches Mary with a bittersweet affection- the younger sister is burdened by nothing. Mary laughs and loves like a child, and people either appreciate her kind heart or resent her freedom.He may indulge Mary, but their father is proud of Martha's gravity and piety. He defines her as a girl who always uses her head instead of following her heart. Even that praise becomes a chafing yoke for Martha: her father loves her stability, but he overlooks her dreams.The Tomb is the story of the one time Martha follows her heart, and what happens after.Oh, this story!Scripture hints that this trio of siblings were deeply beloved, one to another, and they invited Jesus into the home made by their love. Those themes come out strongly in this tale. Because they were human, their relationships also had conflict- we see that frustration in the classic Mary/Martha scene.The sisterhood between the girls- it's tenderly described and rings true to life. My sister is my best friend, and we know when we're seeing each other's ""real self."" The brotherliness of Lazarus is also precious- he wants to make things well for both of his sisters.When Lazarus rises in this tale, the author takes pains to give him ""hope and a future."" Scripture lets us wonder about the specifics of what happens after, and Stephanie gives him something beautiful.Without giving away any secrets, I also love what she does with another main character. The man who lived among the graveyards, tormented, who scraped himself with the broken rocks? And he meets Jesus, and Jesus restores him? I love that story. And Stephanie re-imagines it here.I wish the Living Water series could go on and on. That's how good it is.I'm grateful I have had the chance to read and review The Well in 2013, The Thief in 2014, and now The Tomb in 2015.Thank you Stephanie and Howard Books for my review copies over the past seasons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H6XA7FO9DZS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451689128#wasThisHelpful","R2H6XA7FO9DZS0","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Relationship. What does the word make you think of? For me, I'd say there's a hundred things that come to mind. In a relationship we're chosen, seen, and heard. We have security, acceptance and loyalty. We experience generosity, hospitality, and welcome. We find honesty, vulnerability, and kindness.We get to give and receive all of these things, and that's what makes relationship so wonderful and life-giving.{Of course, we also get to give and receive pettiness, slights, offense, bitterness, criticism, anger, tension, and a host of negative drains that us dry. The human condition guarantees broken relationships.}We dream about the wonderful experiences, and yet we know the hard ones all too well. So who hasn't read a few books on the subject, hoping to get some wisdom and insight to make the whole thing smoother?Likely that's why you picked this book up, because you want to learn more about relationship grace.Prepare to be surprised and refreshed!*Everyday Grace* by Jessica Thompson is a great read, because it isn't a book focused on what we should do.Relationships are already based too much on performance- the last thing we need is a ""Try harder!""This book doesn't say try harder- it says ""Look, meditate, and rest. Christ has done everything.""This is one of those books that saturates your soul with the goodness of the Gospel. It awes you, because it magnifies the Lord- turning on the zoom lens, as it were, and showing you Christ's beauty up close. It floods your mind with the knowledge that because He's so good, we're so very safe. Because He is perfect Love, we're securely loved. Because He laid Himself bare on the cross for us, we know we're perfectly understood. Because He is our High Priest, He is interceding for our every sorrow and every happiness. Looking at the evidence of His care that this book presents, we see that there's nothing but hope.We see the way Christ relates to us, and then we look at how these truths resonate in our human/human interactions. Christ is our Friend, our Older Brother, our Savior.And oh, this book will spur you to praise Him!Thank you Bethany House for my review copy, provided in exchange for an honest opinion.

"{Thank you to Kirk Farrell for the review.}In the 60's, 70's, 80's, I was much more of a professional sports aficionado than I am now. It was Bill Russell's Celtics, followed by Bird, Parish and Michale. The Pittsburg Steelers and now to a lesser extent the New England Patriots.I knew of Jack Kemp, a quarterback, politician, and head of government housing and urban development. The author of Facing the Blitz, Jeff Kemp? Nope, never heard of him.This book has enough about sports and Jeff's own professional career to tickle the interests of died in the wool zealots or casual observers like me.However his message, his book, has more to do with Christian faith than it does with sports.  His breakdown on pages 95, 96, and 97 are worth the price and time it would take to read the book.Jeff Kemp breaks it down to two mindsets: What can I get? vs What can I give? Will I be a consumer in life, or an investor?Me, I've been both. Shamefully often a consumer, occasionally an investor.Go and get this book. It's a touchdown.

"The packing box was weighty when the UPS man handed it to me. I saw the HarperCollins label, and my eyes grew wide. Could this be it, the book I had been waiting a month for? I quickly cut the tape and pulled the flaps open. There, among the crunched paper, was Shauna Niequist's ""Savor.""In the words of my Dad, ""That book's got one heck of a cover."" Indeed. This devotional is linen bound, and the page edges are dyed indigo.This looks like the kind of book that would make a superb birthday present- the recipient would be oohing and aahing as soon as they saw it.And the subtitle? ""Living abundantly where you are, as you are."" That conjures up images of freedom, acceptance, grace, and peace.OK. So we've established that this book looks and feels beautiful, but I don't use my books as decorations.What's inside the cover? That's what I wanna know.I was new to Shauna Niequist, so I did a wee bit of Googling. She's written three other books: Bittersweet, Cold Tangerines, and Bread and Wine.A Starred Publishers Weekly review used the adjectives ""humorous,"" ""contemplative,"" ""brave,"" ""poetic,"" and ""profound.""And now I can see why.You see, Savor is 365 devotions, with a portion of them coming from her earlier works. This was perfect for me, because now I know that I want the full-length editions of her books on my shelf. Similarly, a long-time Shauna fan may want to add Savor to the collection because the devotional format presents the familiar material differently.And what is the material? A whole bunch of lovely meditations on what it means to be human. As I read, I found myself thinking about so many things, asking myself little questions, and wanting to grab my favorite people and ask them questions too.""What takes your breath away? What makes your heart beat faster? What private anniversaries do you grieve on dates you'll never forget? What memories do you cherish? Whose arms do want around you? What wrenches you to the core? Whose smile helps you face the world? And.... what tastes so good to you that you close your eyes to eat it?""Shauna strikes an excellent note in her writing. It's urgent- live now, open your eyes, be present, stir the soup, kiss that beloved one- and it's reflective too. It's personal- after all, her inspiration is her life!- but by paying attention to her particulars, she somehow reaches the rest of us.I was lamenting to my mother as I read that this will probably be sold as a ""Woman's Book."" It turns out Shauna already addresses this. I found an interview where she said she doesn't write for women, she writes for people. Like Timothy Willard's beautiful devotional was not only for men, Shauna's is not only for women. If you're a man and I catch you reading this, I'll smile, because you'll be absorbing good thoughts from your sister Shauna.Let me close with a few quotes from the lady herself.""I want to make God glad that He gave life to someone who loves the gift.""""Sacred and surprising things happen when we gather around a table and share food made with love and by our own hands.""""In many cases, change is not a function of life's cruelty but instead a function of God's graciousness.""""This is it, in the best possible way. Normal, daily life ticking by on our streets and sidewalks, in our houses and apartments, in our beds and at our dinner tables, in our dreams and prayers and fights and secrets. This pedestrian life is the most precious thing any of us will experience.""Thank you Shauna and Book Look Bloggers for providing me with a review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z5ZY5K9IE38N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310344972#wasThisHelpful","R1Z5ZY5K9IE38N","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Love is silent. Hate is loud. I don't want our love for law enforcement to be silent any longer. That is why I wrote this book.""~ Karen SolomonPerhaps now more than ever, we need a book like this. ""Hearts Beneath the Badge"" is exactly what it sounds like- an attempt to introduce readers to some of the human beings who wear those distinctive uniforms.Those badges mark cops in the eyes of the world. For some of us, when we see a uniform we know help is nearby if we need it. We see cops as the protectors and servants in our community.There are other people see cops in a much less positive light, and that same badge marks officers to receive unkind treatment or outright hatred.Either way, it's easy to loose sight of their individual humanity, and just see them as cops, for good or for ill.Yet as long as we have this simplistic view, our law enforcement officers will never be respected, honored, or properly supported.There really are hearts beneath the badges, and there's a life story of family, friends, and goals behind each LEO.Some of their stories would be too painful to tell, but others certainly need to be told.Karen Solomon has brought a valuable collection of stories together in this book.She interviewed both male and female officers, some of them young and just starting out {Ray and Damien} and others retired and looking back on a full career {Walt and his wife Jan.}Some of them worked in cities, where gunshots and blood trails were common events, and some in quieter areas where barking dogs received a full investigative response. {That reminds me of my town... two weeks ago a local officer was dispatched for loose pigs in the road. And he went with such a good attitude!}Some went into police work because of a mentor's example, others because it made sense after time in the military.Some of them chose to relate a lighthearted account, others described a tragic moment that they can still see in Technicolor.The common denominator between every LEO she profiled was their desire to help people and their attempts to live a life of integrity and courage.There will be times when you're reading when you set the book down for a moment and regroup.Some of these stories will hit you hard as a reader, and I tried to imagine living through them as a direct participant.You'll hear several messages ringing through this book, good ones to consider as we relate to our police.People do not become cops to harass citizens, or to be called heroes. They don't want to be put on a pedestal, but they don't want to be judged and convicted by public opinion either.They do hard work because somebody has to: there's precious few pleasant calls coming in to 911. They appreciate community involvement, and many cops try hard to reach out to their neighborhoods. They don't want to distrust everybody, but they do have to be cautious. There may be no such thing as a routine call- things can turn bad very quickly, or on the rare occasion, it can end very good.In a lot of places, departments operate on shoestring budgets and officers respond knowing that there may be no backup, and minimal equipment is provided. Shifts can be long and lonely, and the hours and stress all take a toll. And for most officers, the people they go home to experience the effects right along with them. That's right... an entire family is involved in law enforcement along with their officer.Karen skillfully illustrates the role of family in a LEOs life, by including the testimonies of wives and girlfriends, and highlighting the experiences of children who grow up proud of their police officer parent.Obviously, people who already appreciate LEOs will be drawn to this book, and they'll find it a rewarding read. However, as Karen Solomon points out, this is a book for the unconvinced or the hostile, too. If you think cops are out there to make your day difficult, or that police departments are a drain on the taxpayers, perhaps this book would challenge those preconceived notions.As Karen says about one man, but paraphrasing for every officer, ""Their job does not define them. They define their job.""God bless our law enforcement and all the people who love them and support them, and may this book help us civilians reach a better understanding of them and their work.I thank Karen Solomon for providing me with a copy of Hearts Beneath the Badge, in exchange for my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLCXTPS52186/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986322105#wasThisHelpful","R1YLCXTPS52186","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Sparrow in Terezin, sequel to The Butterfly and the Violin, the second Hidden Masterpeice Novel.Despite dehumanizing treatment, victims of the Holocaust left behind works of art, some of it created within the death camps. Kristy Cambron is writing a series of books about these ""Hidden Masterpieces,"" imagining a story for each artist.The way Kristy brings her characters together is something to behold. Just like in life, all the steps and stops add up, and leave you facing your enemy, facing your friend, facing yourself. And when various characters meet, they must decide whether to help or harm, give or ignore, recognize fellow humanity or close their eyes.Along with the compelling history lesson we receive as we follow Kaja's exodus from Prague, we get a modern day story too.If you read book one, you remember Will and Sera. They solved the mystery of a haunting painting in the first book, and when you begin this book you'll find yourself attending their wedding.Of course, Sera and Will don't immediately experience wedded bliss. There's another mystery for them to solve, one that requires delving into history's secrets for answers and wisdom.These two books belong together, read in order, because they forma panoramic view of several stories.

"Karen Kingsbury's second novel in the Angels Walking series shares the same awesome premise as the first- sometimes angels come to earth in human form.In this case, the angels are trying to preserve two lives. The first is Marcus Dillinger, a pro baseball player with a passion for helping inner city kids. The second is Mary Catherine, a woman who inspires passion and joy in everyone she meets.It's Mary Catherine's heart- the spiritual one- that grabs Marcus' attention. She's so gracious and generous, she's the kind of woman he wouldn't deserve.And it's Mary Catherine's heart- the physical one- that keeps her from allowing love a foot in the door.Her heart is diseased, and she knows that she may not see thirty years of age. Because she understands her condition, she lives by a chosen motto: It's not how many days you live, it's how much life you have in your days.Enter their common mission field: a group of youth, who will be sent to prison if this intervention program fails. And while Marcus and MC pledge to do their best, there are also two angels watching over them.First, I've gotta say that letting one angel come as a policeman is the neatest thing. Especially because Karen Kingsbury's family experienced a moment of prayer with a policeman during a family crisis, and later on nobody could identify him. Was he, perhaps, an angel walking?Second, Marcus and MC are such likable characters. How can you not cheer for them?{And if you read the first book, you'll be meeting up again with your old friends Sami and Tyler.}This book is deeply inspirational, because it showcases the power of prayer and reality of miracles.I love a story of healing. God absolutely can and does do miracles.However, I would not want to read a series where every patient was healed, every relationship restored, every home rebuilt- because that's not the world we have today.Sometimes, I need to read a story where the healing doesn't come, and the author somehow shows me that the Love doesn't waver and the Glory doesn't depart.I'm glad that Karen balances these realities- Yes, God moves in our world, yes, things that happen hurt us badly. His presence and our pain are not exclusive of each other.So you'll see moments of miracle in this story, though the prison system and the hospital hallways still exist, and characters will learn to live with strength in a broken world.There's a fine old song by the country group Alabama, called Angels Among Us.I'm going to close by sharing the lyrics.""I believe there are angels among us/Sent down to us from Somewhere up above/They come to you and me in our darkest hours/To show us how to give, to teach us how to live, to guide us with the light of love/They wear so many faces, show up in the strangest places/Grace us with their mercy in our time of need/Oh, I believe there are angels among us.""Indeed.Thank you Howard Books for my review copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29H8E4G3M9NDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451687508#wasThisHelpful","R29H8E4G3M9NDV","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book begins with a strong hook, expounding on the opening chapter of Daniel.Imagine this young Hebrew, a worshipper of the Almighty God and a citizen of a oppressed nation. His intelligence and sensitivity mark him for his captors. They want to submerge him in their culture and seduce him with their philosophies. They're going to train him in all their arts and sciences and install him in the Babylonian court.Right there you can feel Daniel's tension and hear the questions in his soul. ""How will God preserve, redeem, and deliver His captive people? How will I serve Him and how can I trust Him when he allowed me to be torn away from my family and home?"" It's black and white text on a page for us today, but for Daniel it was sweat and blood and sleeplessness.Often, our time/space distance from Biblical events obscures both the relevance of the message and the humanity of the narrator. Oxford Professor John Lennox sets out to show us the book of Daniel in a new light, by revealing the significance of one life dedicated to God. By mining the book of Daniel for all the wisdom it contains, we can learn a great deal about how to live ""against the flow"" in our day.How did Daniel hold fast to the faith of his fathers when he was totally surrounded by a pagan people?How did he speak so courageously, and so winsomely, to guards and governors? He presented the truth unflinchingly, yet with utterly respect, and powerful men were moved to consider his minority position.How did his personal fidelity fuel his counter-culture stance?  We can see that he was a man of prayer, and he sought to close the gaps between his convictions and his integrity. Paraphrasing Rudyard Kipling, Daniel walked with crowds and kept his virtue, he talked with kings and didn't lose the common touch.This man epitomized being ""in the world and not of it.""We have no reason to believe that he was an unpleasant, bigoted person who condemned and shunned left and right. Instead, we see a steady witness, whose hard-words-softly-spoken were valued by the establishment of his day. We see a man who knew the score about the world he lived in, and who made his decisions with the character of God as his reality.Indeed, there is much to learn from Daniel. And this book is a great start.... it's 400 plus pages of fascinating history that spans multiple empires and conquests and kingdoms, as well as commentary on how we can live today. Human dignity, the meaning of history, how to live as God's ambassadors, the nature of the kingdom of heaven, the reality of revelation, the power of predictive prophecy, the invasion of the supernatural into the natural, the synergy between mind and brain... all these concepts receive treatment in this book.And the ultimate purpose of Daniel's Scriptures and Professor Lennox's scholarship is to point us to a living God, one who is intensely personal as He meets with his people, and who gives the centuries their meaning.I'll close with a quote from the book of Daniel, CEB translation. This is God addressing Daniel: ""Do not be afraid, man greatly beloved; all will be well with you. Be strong, be strong.""Thank you to Monarch Publishing and Litfuse Publicity Group for providing me a review copy.

"Jill Savage and Kathy Koch have a theory- every parent has two sets of kids.The first set is the ones you always dreamed about, the Perfect Kids.The second set are the Imperfect Kids, the ones you sometimes don't even recognize as your own.You envisioned a reader, you got a fashion designer. You hoped for an aspiring doctor, he wants to me a mechanic.You want to pass on your love of people, she's an introvert. You adore music, the stuff screaming from his iPod is a din.""These are mine?"" Yes, they're wonderful, but they're nothing like you dreamed of!So what is a parent to do, when dreams and reality are sometimes far apart?How do you surrender those dreams and embrace the real live children you've been given?Thankfully, Jill and Kathy understand all about this. And they've written this little book, packing all 270 pages full of practical wisdom, to help you engage with and love your Imperfect Kids.This book is framed around seven questions, questions rarely voiced but ever-present in the human heart.Each chapter looks at why children feel this way, and then talks about parental responses that will help the child as they grow.These basic questions keep reoccurring through life, and you may find that you're still asking them today- openly or unconsciously.One: Do You Like Me? ""Of course, I love you!"" No. Do you LIKE me? As one girl observed to Dr. Kathy, love was almost a guarantee. They're her parents, after all. But she didn't feel liked. And liking is a combination of being wanted, seen, heard, and received with compassion.Two: Am I Important to You? We spend a lot of time asking this question one way or another, in each relationship we're part of. You know you're important when someone cares about what you're Doing, Thinking, and Feeling.Three: Is It Ok I'm Unique?  What makes us unique will often drive us crazy until somebody helps us find a hidden strength in the middle of it.When Dr. Kathy was young, she didn't want to be tall. It took creative parents providing good opportunities to help her appreciate her height.This chapter reminded me- You have to dig beneath the surface of an annoying complaint to see if there's a genuine concern that the person is afraid to share.Four: Who Am I? {Could have been subtitled ""The Scariest Question in the Universe."" How the heck do we begin to answer this one?}Perhaps we've made the question too large and intimidating. Jill and Kathy show that we can help kids by providing positive identity statements often.""You are God's, and you are Loved"" is a great start. ""You are a loyal friend and a clever problem solver"" is a great addition. Whatever you come up with, it all boils down to ""You are a unique and unrepeatable miracle!""Five: Am I a Failure? This question is most terrible when you're afraid to ask it, when it just rolls around inside your head. Everybody needs a safe listener, who can hold a heavy question like that. We can build up the truth that nobody is a failure by learning how to process mistakes in a healthy way.The purple marker stain is a good place to begin- focus on solving the problem, and if it's unsolvable, give grace to yourself and the kid.This chapter also addresses the Big Stuff- the mistakes no parent wants to see their child make. The ones that change their life. Even then, Jill and Kathy insist, God is present in it all.Six: What is my Purpose? Again, let's start small and local. You can help your child experience purpose by giving them chances to make a difference. It sounds too simple, but in my experience it works. Whatever chance you have to help somebody or serve somebody, let the kids help meet those needs.Seven: Will You Help Me Change? If what we see in the kids around us are areas requiring growth and maturity, then we'd better be prepared to help them achieve it. Helping somebody else change presumes that we ourselves are committed to healthy choices, vulnerability, and honesty. As always, coat the process liberally with grace. Neither adults nor children find change easy- children's struggles just happen to be more evident.Jill and Kathy may have written an indispensable book, here. It could certainly set you on track to ""Loving Your Kids For Who They Are.""I thank MP Newsroom for my review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OMHZ9Z7B5FLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802411525#wasThisHelpful","R3OMHZ9Z7B5FLI","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""No man has ever spoken words like this man. His words feed life; they behold hope; they gush truth."" ~Thus speaks the Samaritan Woman whom tradition names Photine.Sometimes when I read the Gospel narratives, they seem distant and strange. It's hard to still my soul and hear His words in all their power.The woman at the well, the woman with the issue of blood, the woman caught in adultery, and Mary of Bethany- they heard Him.They sought Him, they were found by Him, and on the day they met Jesus, their world changed.Mary DeMuth and Frank Viola have given each woman- known by a few brief and timeless lines in Scripture- a fuller story.One that gives them back their humanity, providing them with hopes and fears and a past and a future.Otherwise, they're just black and white text to us.The goal of this book is to help you ""see"" these women as they meet Him, and then to encounter Him for yourself.And along the way, they crafted a keeper of a Bible study- the kind that compels good reading.The way Mary uses words is beautiful... listen to the thoughts of one woman set free by God.""I ran to the outskirts of Nain under a full moon and twirled under it's shadow a free woman, so blessedly alive it nearly scared me to death.""Don't you love that visual?Don't you want to meet the joyous, good, gentle, mighty God who provokes such life in His people?Jesus is the one who ""tells us our stories straight, and with that, changes the endings forever.""Thanks to Him, we can live ""stolen lives, given to us by the Author of life.""I have been blessed by Baker Publishing with a review copy in exchange for an honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13U18M6649833/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801016851#wasThisHelpful","R13U18M6649833","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skin in the Game: A personal investment- holding nothing back- laying yourself on the line.If I asked you to think of this phrase in connection with the Gospel, you may see Jesus in your mind's eye. Obviously, he put His skin in the game. In the immortal words ""Being in very nature God, He humbled himself...."" and He bared His Divinity in flesh, offering Himself to and for the world.Yes, Jesus has skin in the game. But Rick Lawrence says it doesn't stop there. Jesus is the reason we get to ""play the game"" at all, but we have to offer our skin, too. The life of faith, Rick insists, is a life of risk.Calculation, analysis, and circumspection all have their place... but they aren't ends unto themselves. There comes a time to step out and try.Rick walks us through seven Gospel encounters between Christ and a man or woman, and shows that each time Jesus pushed them to put their skin in the game.The woman at the well had to face her shame.The man at the pool in Bethesda had to own his deepest desires.Peter had to confront his fear and move in illogical, water-walking trust.Mary and Martha had to bear a waiting period, with their beloved brother cold in the grave.Every story, when you look at it closely, involved a risk.  On one side of their decision hung the weight of past- my brother died, my body is diseased, I've never stood on a wave before, I've ben rejected so many times there's nothing left of me- and on the other side was the promise of Christ's words.They chose right.Rick Lawrence makes me want to choose right too, to trust the One who understands me fully and who leads me risk-by-risk.And every time we offer our skin in the game of life, we find ourselves in Him- awake and alive and reflecting Him a wee bit more.I thank Kregel Publishers for providing me with a review copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GH7X7KXUOH8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T80LVYM#wasThisHelpful","R3GH7X7KXUOH8O","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many families I know have several favorite Christmas stories, and the routine of reading them every year adds delight to the season.Nobody I asked, however, could have named a single Easter story except for the Gospel narratives.This volume will happily change that.Plough Publishing has carried on in the tradition of their previous work ""Home for Christmas.""They've mined great literature from through the ages and across the globe, searching for stories that shout and whisper ""He is Risen!""The stories range widely in style and genre.Some are what we call ""Biblical Fiction,"" where humans use that holy imagination to give us a scene from the Gospel's themselves.One of the most unique examples of this is ""Stories from the Cotton Patch Gospel.""Clarence Jordan brings the Gospel into Georgia. He envisions how the Passion may have taken place in the Deep South, with followers Rock, Jack and the Magdala girl and Jesus bringing the ""God Movement.""He shows us the betrayal, the agony in the garden, and the Sunday Rising in a new way.{I'll be keeping an eye out for Mr. Jordan's entire book.}St. Veronica's Kerchief is more traditional, but every bit as compelling.I can't say anything about it without spoiling the pleasure of your own reading, but it gives a story to the Sixth Station of the Cross.And then there's Elizabeth Goudge's ""John."" I hope to re-read this one every year.In just a few pages, she manages to give life and breath and soul to John, Peter, and Mary Magdalene, following them to the Tomb.Some are historical fiction, such as Tolstoy's tale of two old villagers who set out for Jerusalem.On the way they find God through an unexpected detour, and they learn the true meaning of pilgrimage.Claire Huchet Bishop provides another historical, about a gang of children living in Nazi occupied Paris.The way these children provide an Easter gift for a sick friend makes a wonderful story.And Alan Paton, author of ""Cry, The Beloved Country"" takes us to South Africa in the pain and turmoil of Apartheid.His story, quiet and humble, shows us clearly why Jesus washed his disciples feet and said ""Now do the same.""Other's are far more mythic, and all of them contain glimpses of Him and His Resurrection power.He's in the King who ""calls out with a lion's voice"" and takes the lash upon his own back.He is the Ragman in my second favorite story, who goes calling through the city, exchanging bandages for health and tear-stained handkerchiefs for gladness.He's seen ""through a glass darkly"" in the fable of Danko, who tore out his burning heart to light the way through danger.And the best part is, the selections transcend all denominational categories.Turn your eyes and tune your ears to the everlasting mercy, and prepare to hear these tales echoing in your heart for a while to come.""For though every man's life must come to its end, God's spirit can never be quenched... thus Jesus wanders on, over steppes and through forests, into hearts and homes. He looks into the eyes of beggars; he blesses children. No spies can prevent him, no magistrates can arrest him, no prison can hold him fast. He can cross every frontier, and walk among us, too. Pray that he may, for we have long had need of him.""~ Karl Josef Friedrich, ""The Case of Rachoff.""

"Our world is many things.It's big, beautiful, wild, wonderful, delightful, dizzying, sad, and scary.And in this world, when it gets overwhelming, we have two common responses.The first says ""I'll handle this by being excellent, competent, and fully capable. I will manage the world through my efforts and performance.""Obviously, the first example screams ""perfectionism!""That's become a bit of a buzzword lately, applied rightfully and wrongfully to a lot of people.I've never been that Type A over achiever. I'm not driven or ambitious.In fact, I'm quite slow to move on anything. I tend to watch other people live and cheer quietly from the sidelines.I let opportunities come to me, and sometimes I let them pass right by.So it would seem that I am not a perfectionist, and I resigned myself to reading a book that didn't apply to me.But then Holley listed a second example of how people cope with the world.This belief says ""I'll stand very still, and if I don't chase after anything or rock the boat, then I'll avoid any potential damage or danger. I may not make any friends, but I won't accidentally hurt anybody either. I may not step out of my comfort zone, but I won't inconvenience anyone either. I may not share my life too personally with anyone, but I won't upset them either.""That's me. And then Holley explained that this is perfection-based too.You're afraid to try because you're afraid to fail.The glorious thing is, Holley has a third option to tell us about.Instead of trying too hard or running and hiding, we can live freely and fully.Now that's quite a promise to make, isn't it?But Holley has a sure thing backing up her promise- Jesus set us free, took away our sin, took on our humanity, and can dissolve our fears with His kindness.So this book tells us where we are- we're held close by the Shepherd, seen through his eyes of love.We're not good enough, but He is all goodness, and so we don't need to be.And this book asks you to find out who you are- how did God make you? What do you have to give?How do you work and learn and give and receive love?Because Holley is convinced that God calls us all to walk in His way, and that there's a unique way for each of us to do so.One of the best chapters, I thought, was the one about the will of God. If the will of God is that we be conformed to the Image of His Son, then that's a lifelong process.And we don't need to see everything up ahead, and all our efforts don't have to pan out, and we can even mess things up along the way. What matters, she insists, is that we start moving and trying and doing- He'll guide us through it all.There's a compelling chapter about trading Guilt for Grace, with diagrams that accurately represent the two cycles- Grace begets obedience and intimacy, Guilt spawns shame and isolation.Holley describes how she returns to these truths throughout her day, centering her heart with gratitude and trust.Obviously, when we begin to accept grace for ourselves, it will change our relationships with others.All of the the steps we take toward freedom and fullness will help us as we live with our people.There is a cycle to break, the cycle of Criticism and Condemnation.The good news is that we can replace those imposters with Encouragement and Correction.One word, act, and prayer at a time, we can build life-affirming connections with friends and family.Ultimately, it all comes down to this...""We can carry less when we become convinced that we're cared for more than we can even imagine."" ~Holley Gerth.And I love that.  So if you worry yourself sick about your performance, and you crave freedom and fullness, then ""You're Loved No Matter What"" will speak to you.

"The Unveiled Wife is a story of a young couple who seemed to have almost everything going for them.They met in a home-style youth group, the love of God bloomed in both of their hearts, and they went overseas in ministry as newlyweds.Yet on the inside, when they went home at night, their marriage was miserable.There were times of happiness, sure, and delight that they were married. They saw God work around them and through them, they were committed to Him.... but still they were in trouble, and they knew it.When you reach the point where you can't go on like this anymore, what do you do?As Jennifer says, everyone enters marriage with some baggage- unmet expectations, imperfections, and insecurities.Some of these will be more pronounced than others depending on your past, your personality, and the lessons you've already learned.This book was a rather freeing read, because it says this- God's children still make messes.They still hurt each other, they still lose hope.And through all of this, God remains. Draws near, in fact.Transforms the hearts involved.This book speaks to a profound truth- you grow into grace and truth over time. And it's worth the effort and the struggle.Even without being the target audience, I came away with this: No relationship- even dealing with manipulation or unkindness and distrust- is too far gone if you have two partners fully intent on restoration.Chapter 29 ""Dealing with Heart Issues"" should be made into a booklet and added to every marriage-prep course.On second thought, let's just include this whole book as pre-wedding reading.It will provide vocabulary for expressing specific concerns that otherwise might never be addressed.It will require you to make space for the hard questions and the potential disappointments.And it will give encouragement as you try to meld your life with another person's.I thank Tyndale Momentum for my review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QYXNABNC5B0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414398042#wasThisHelpful","R3QYXNABNC5B0U","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If You Find This Letter is a memoir by ""a girl who's just trying to find her way.""That's how Hannah describes herself. And this is excellent reading. Captivating. Unpretentious. Quietly wise.Hannah Brencher is a noticer, the kind of person who allows things matter to her, to change her, even if it hurts.As writers and lovers must, she seems to drink in people and places and pieces of life.(In a world as beautiful and terrible as ours, this noticing is a dangerous way to live. It gives you everything, yes, and it demands everything in response.)This book is a praise hymn to growing up and stretching out our wings and to coming home and treasuring our people.It's about making space in our hearts and saying goodbye and holding what we love gently and bravely.It's about the endurance of stories and the power of kind and honest words coming together in the gift of letters.If you've ever had the privilege of writing and getting letters, then you'll find this book to be a nourishing feast.You'll recognize the magic of letters winging their way across the miles and into mailboxes up and down country roads and city streets.You'll already know the weight of care and intention that a letter bears.You'll remember the particular delight of knowing that the writer's hand was all over that paper, and that this specific beloved always curves their e's that certain way and that one use circles instead of dots in their exclamation points.You'll say, with Emily Dickinson- ""A letter is a joy of earth.""If you've never been able to savor letters written and received, then this book will make a convert out of you.And you'll want to go visit MoreLoveLetters dot com, so that you can be a part of this whole thing.Ultimately, it's a book about love.""No matter how much I pretend the world might be about something else- something bigger and brighter and shinier and more perfect that that- I think love still wins the race to steal our hearts."" ~ Hannah BrencherAnd as C. S. Lewis says: To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken...""Thank you to Howard Books for my review copy.

"The first thing you read when you open this book is a quote from G. K Chesterton:""Paradox simply means a certain defiant joy which belongs to belief.""I like that- a defiant joy.And paradox {or tension, both concepts work} permeates everything.The world is exceedingly unstable, yet we declare that God is eternally trustworthy.Human beings are fatally fragile, yet we dare to suggest that we're also immortal souls.Everything is running down and burning out, but we hope for renewal.Paradox, all of it. Multiple truths, at loggerheads with each other, all describing nuances of reality.Ken Wytsma says that the life of faith in Christ is the Grand Paradox, and this book is a guide for us as we enter that life.He gets off to a strong start in chapter one, ""Jericho.""In a few pages, he takes us through the heavily fortified city, and shows us the walls crashing down. From where we are, the story is awesome. God brought down stonework with the blast of trumpets.Yet really, do you think this made any sense to the Israelites? Do you think they understood what God was doing, why He was demanding such a ridiculous thing from them? What terrible military strategy- ""Don't invade, march around the outside making music.""Yet what God teaches us through this experience is that the battle is His.Pastor Wytsma makes this point over and over: He leads, we follow.Sometimes in this book Ken stresses part one of the equation- God leads. Trust. Rest. Fear not.Sometimes he stresses part two- we follow. Live your faith. Obey. Act.And there's so much material for reflection here as he works on those themes.When Ken talked about resignation, and how that isn't really wholesome submission to God, I saw myself.I'm so tempted to be that prisoner in chains he describes, following the jailer because he has no other choice. Ouch!That part made me want to find a way of being disappointed and yet not falling into resignation.Looking at modern trends, he talks about the way we process information and share ideas today.We have plenty of conclusions on every possible issue, and yet those conclusions often lack nuanced understanding.His case for withdrawing from the information stream, reflecting deeply, slowing our conversations, and owning our convictions- it's a powerful one.His ""Love is Never Wrong"" chapter stole the show for me, for one reason. He says ""... we can do this. Faith isn't beyond us.""And on days when the world is wild and I'm failing my ideals left and right, and I can't keep up with all I need to learn- I need to know that It Can Be Simple. In this chapter, he says that we can stop worrying about never doing the very bad wrong things, and start pursuing the always available right thing- Love.He also takes on the question of ""What is happiness?"" and he addresses spiritual fatigue- burnt out on religion?The last paragraph of the book was a delightful surprise, too. Again, he's quoting, but I won't tell you who.And when you read the book, don't skip to the end. Let me just say that I thought those were perfect words to close with.Thank you Booklook and Ken Wytsma for my review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JGC1MPQSGC9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0849964679#wasThisHelpful","R1JGC1MPQSGC9J","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is this book? Is it a Bible study? Is it a self-help?I'd say that it is a Scripture-intensive look at women's wounds, and also at the ever-faithful One who heals them.They divide this book by the kind of hurts, such as Grief, Barrenness, Bitterness, Burdens, Abuse, and Desolation.And they tell the story of each woman who experienced those pains, such as Hagar, Ruth, Hannah, Jochebed, Abigail, and even Ichabod's Mother.(Excellent chapter on that little-known woman.)Tina and Dena go deep into the Biblical narratives, mining them for wisdom and grace to give to their Sisters in Christ.These ladies clearly know their stuff. They speak of God using fresh, full color images.His Word is alive for them- it nourishes them and transforms them.And their passion comes through clearly, as they point us to sustenance in a hungry world.This book has an excellent, balanced approach.The Biblical accounts are presented, as well as contemporary testimonies of God working through the same emotions and struggles.The individual stories are permeated with His Story, the Hand of the Father guiding and guarding His daughters.Hurtful experiences are never belitted, wounds are never dismissed, readers are never told to ""suck it up.""At the same time, wounds are never allowed to define our worth, our identity, or our future.Instead, hope is extended, Christ's presence is promised, and God's goodness is proclaimed.This is a supportive, gentle, God-grounded book. It's honest about our fears and incredibly bold in claiming Christ as the resolution to all of them.Very much worth a read, even if you aren't dealing with a specific trauma.Thank you to Tina Samples and Dena Dyer, Kregel Publications, and Bookfun.org for my review copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SV25A3KQ44NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825442141#wasThisHelpful","R3SV25A3KQ44NC","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A powerful, practical little volume!I requested Jesus Outside the Lines because of the subtitle.Who isn't tired of taking sides?I can turn on the radio these days and my head starts spinning.So many issues, so many debates, so many hot topics....How do we pick our battles?And is that even an analogy we should use?Are these confrontations to win or opportunities to engage?This book claims to point to a way forward.Does it deliver?Yes. For me it did.Scott Sauls has arranged this book around ten contemporary areas of division, in our politics, piety, fiscal policy, and posture towards others.Red State or Blue State?For the Unborn or for the Poor?Personal Faith or Institutional Church?Money Guilt or Money Greed?Affirmation or Critique?Accountability or Compassion?Hypocrite or Work in Progress?Sexual Freedom or Chastity?Hope Or Realism?Self Esteem or God-Esteem?These chapters are not in-depth sermons about each issue that tell you what to say and think/Instead, this book calls us back to foundational Gospel truths, allowing us to think about what that means for these issues.Sometimes I wish he'd had more room to explore the nuances of things, most particularly in the chapter on organized church.As always, we have to define the church first, as a family, not a building or program.And once we've said that, then people will ask why the family has to gather weekly on Sunday, in a stuffy/drafty/formal/unaesthetic building.""If you're hooking up with fellow Christians, challenging, counseling, and communing with each other, isn't that church?""We all want a solid, committed, stable Christian experience, in church or out... and then we're right back where we started, re-inventing the wheel.....Even in places where you do disagree with him- on something big or small- I think you'll find him sincere and gentle.If he speaks and lives the way he writes (and people are saying that he does) then he's enfleshing his convictions with compassion, and always attempting to behold the Image Bearer in the middle of the issue.His chapter on sexual purity strikes some critically important notes.As long as fulfillment, intimacy, and satisfying relationships are linked so tightly to sex, then we can't realistically ask anyone to be chaste or celibate.So should we fling away chastity? Heavens no. Instead, he asks to provide companionship, human touch, and emotional support for each other in ""friendships as deep and lasting as marriage and as meaningful as sex.""Wouldn't that help everyone out- no matter why you're single or for how long?Each chapter had a few gems that I heavily underlined.In the chapter on Christianity and politics he says  ""Public faith enriches the world not by grasping for earthly power, but through self-donation.""Later, in Affirmation or Critique? he says ""If people are going to get upset with us, let's at least make sure they are the same type of people who got upset with Jesus. The lepers and the crooks and the drunks and the gluttons and the sexually promiscuous people and the sinners and the nonchurchgoers, to be clear, did not get upset with Jesus....These people were drawn to him.""Jesus Outside the Lines is worth a read, sooner rather than later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDID55YAJFMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496400933#wasThisHelpful","RFDID55YAJFMT","AE2852M5ZI67L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE2852M5ZI67L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am in the market for 3 boosters - one for my husband's car, two for my van, for two soon-to-be 6-year-old girls.  I have only ever used the Graco turbo booster for my oldest child, and wanted something that went taller, something with more protection to the sides, hopefully something that latched and something that was comfy for the child.  I would love for it to come in pink, purple, and red - and I thought this seat was just about perfect.Taking this seat strictly for what it is - it is quite comfortable for the child. The covers are spectacular - deep, vibrant colors  and smooth, sturdy materials that won't get pilly or fuzzy over time.  The side/back support is high enough that as you raise the headrest and the child grows, the child is still nicely enveloped at the back and sides, which I like both for comfort and because the seat doesn't develop quite such an odd ""E.T."" appearance as some as you raise the headrest.  It certainly goes nice and tall - however, when I test it with my tall but thin ten year old, while the height is good (with room to spare), he is squished in the shoulders, which makes me wonder how useful the height will be over the long haul.  I suspect you won't be able to use the seat anywhere near the full limits of its height.  I like that it is symmetrical with two open cupholders which means that if you plan to use this seat outboard in the 3rd row of a minivan you won't be faced with a seat where one one of the storage options can't be used (which would happen with cubbies that slide in and out - ie the Affix).  The cupholders have rubbery inserts that can be pulled out for easy cleaning.  It fits both my very petite almost-6-year-old and her much sturdier twin very well.What I don't like about this seat is how it plays with the car.  It is VERY wide.  If you are putting this in a captain's chair in a minivan, it's not a big deal, but if you are putting it in a position where you would like to be able to have 3 across, it's going to be tough.  I want to put 2 boosters in the 3rd row of my Odyssey - which may well be the narrowest 3rd row of all the minivans - and there is just no way for another person to sit between two of these.  It is seriously monstrous.  And while I would like a booster to have some sort of side to side support/protection, I'm not personally convinced that the extra cushion on the outside adds significantly in terms of safety.  The width of this seat can lead to buckling difficulty in some seating situations - true to an extent of all boosters but I think this one may be slightly worse than the Graco.  Finally there is the latch strap - it does not tighten.  It is only meant to keep the seat secured in case you are in an accident and no one is using the seat.  I understand this from a safety standpoint; however, another benefit to latching boosters is they stay in place as kids climb in and they don't migrate over on top of buckles.  Latchable boosters do have some ease of use functions that are missing in this seat since the latch strap does not adjust.  Furthermore, there is nothing grippy under this seat so if you have leather seats, you might find this seat slides around a lot (our prius does not, our van does).  One more minor quibble - the armrests feel very cheap.  They are not blow-molded and solid but rather an open shell, with the opening to the outside.  It's a small point but I was surprised at how cheap they felt.  If the cover is not lined up exactly right over the arm rest, it feels like the whole thing is twisted and deformed.  (I actually thought our purple one was defective but it wasn't)I think my biggest complaint is that this seat does not become backless.  I knew this when I ordered it - but I assumed it wouldn't matter, since it goes so tall.  However, due to the how narrow the inside dimensions are, for a bigger kid, I really think you are going to hit a point where the child no longer fits comfortably but still needs a booster.  And it is a pity that this seat does not convert because it is such a nice, deep seat, it would be a fabulous backless booster for an older child.  I know backless boosters are fairly inexpensive, but it would be nice if this one converted, as *many* (most?) other high back boosters do.  The design of this allows it to come apart but it is not tested and approved in backless mode - I knew this before I bought it but wonder if that close-up shot of the hinge in the listing may lead people to assume the two come apart for backless use.  The narrowness of the shoulder region plus the lack of option to convert to backless means I don't think this seat really has the longevity it appears to have on paper.I really want to like this seat, but I just can't love it.  My girls, for whatever reason, have both determined that our old Turbo booster is more comfortable than the Recaro (I don't know why, the cover is ugly so I know that didn't sway them, and they never agree on anything) We've decided instead on the Turbo with safety surround which, while it doesn't come in the colors I like, fits my girls wonderfully, has side protection without being monstrous, and becomes backless. I may need to re-evaluate down the line, but for now, for us, it's seems a better choice.  If Diono's new booster was available now, I think we'd be going with that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L384O5FBUSM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6URAP8#wasThisHelpful","R3L384O5FBUSM0","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know if this product it simply amazing, if I am the luckiest mom on earth, or if lice just aren't as big a deal as I always thought they were, but if we ever have the little critters again, this is the first product I am turning to.  One of my kids came home from school with intense itching and lots of red speckles on the back of her scalp.  I've never had to deal with lice and I didn't know that that was a tell-tale sign of lice (the school nurse had looked her over and sent her back to class -  she wasn't sent home from school, just coming home normally).  I washed her with dandruff shampoo that night but when it was still itching the next morning I looked and saw two bugs.  Went out and bought this as it had worked for two friends whose kids had lice last summer.Naturally, it was my daughter with the thickest, almost waist length hair who got the lice.  I poured the entire bottle on her head.  Put a cap over it and let her watch TV for a while (longer than the 10 minutes it suggests, I wanted to be sure) and then I started combing.Make sure to have your child sit on towels when you comb out - this stuff will drip and run like crazy once you start combing.  It is a messy process.  I saw bunches of lice come out with the combing and they were all thoroughly dead.  (We put one under a magnifying glass to check it out...  kids thought it was neat)  I combed and combed and combed until I wasn't seeing any more bugs.  Washed her in the shower and immediately she had no more itching.  Took her back to school the next day - she passed the nurses nit check but I did find a very, very few nits after that (I think - I can't be sure but whatever they were I slid them out with my fingernails)I've been checking her and my other 3 kids ever since and we've had no more issues.  And my kids are very close, always wrestling and hugging, so I was surprised no one else got it.I did not go crazy with house cleaning - washed her bedding, carseat cover, and favorite stuffed animal, and vacuumed the couch and carpet in the room we spend most of our time.  Everything I have read says you do not need to go overboard with the cleaning and it makes sense.  Lice won't live long once they fall off, and it's not likely they will fall off on their own anyway.  The nits are also not likely to come unglued and if they do, they won't hatch without the warmth of a nice little head anyway.  It's possible that we just caught it very early so no heroic measures were needed but all in all, this was no where near the catastrophe I always expected lice would be.I really like that this product is safe to use.  It is basically a super concentrated conditioning gel that smothers the lice, rather than being a chemical that they can build up a tolerance to.  No worries about poisoning your child in the process.  And my friends who have dealt with lice before me swear this worked better than the chemicals - I skipped the chemicals altogether based on their experiences.I did purchase the terminator nit free comb and some of the fairy tales products thinking I would need those as well - the nit ungluing mousse and the ""lice repel"" detangling spray.  I was actually kind of looking forward to seeing how the nit comb would work but I haven't had to use it or the foam.  I have been using the repel spray - it can't hurt, and it smells great and works well as a detangler, which my kids need anyway.  (One of my friends says the green comb that comes with the LiceMD works better than the terminator comb anyway - but again, I wouldn't know - didn't get to use it!)From my experience - the LiceMD is safe, not too expensive, and amazingly effective.  If you find yourself with a lousy kid, don't panic and give this a try.  Hope you are as lucky as we were.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBCL926DN4F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010Y5EV0#wasThisHelpful","R1NBCL926DN4F9","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love magnatiles but I am not a fan of this set.  You are essentially paying a premium for a few special pieces and a bunch more of what you already have.  The quality of the product is the same as the regular magnatiles, there are no problems there - it's just that the ratio of special to regular pieces is so far off, you'd be better off spending your money to get more regular pieces.  Magnatiles really needs to put of a set of just special pieces - maybe 4 cars and some other oddball pieces, which is what the knock off companies are doing.

"The containers themselves are wonderful.  Snap together, easy to stack for storage, easy to clean, and fairly leak proof.  (If you put water in and squeeze you will get dribbles, so I wouldn't pack anything straight up liquidy in here like soup - but anything a little wet, like a salad with a dressing, should be good)  Lids are easy for kids to open but not so easy they pop off on their own.The colors in the kid's set are wonderful but you pay a premium for them.  In addition, it's all or nothing if you want to use the ice pack, since it is one piece and sized to hold all the containers at once.  We ended up purchasing the ""entree kit"" and prefer it to this.  By going the way of the entree kit, you will get more containers and two smaller ice packs.  Not as much ice overall but I'd rather have more containers and less ice.  The colors aren't as pretty, but you get a lot more versatility.

"The angle adjuster absolutely does what it is supposed to do - allows you to rearface your radian without the driver or passenger having to eat their knees.  But for the price you pay for the radian and with this design flaw clearly being known to the manufacturer, it's ridiculous that this is their solution to the problem.  Not only is it absurd that you have to add anything to get the most out this carseat, but the material used is reported in many reviews to compress over time so that you end up having to replace this.  It's basically 4 or 5 thin layers of pool-noodle type foam glued together - pretty dense but not indestructable.Basically this feels like a temporary solution.  The seat needs to be redesigned so that no add-ons are needed or else the additional piece needs to be made more durable and should be included in your purchase.  I can't think of any other seat that requires you to purchase an additional item to get the most out of the seat.  While it is true you can use the seat without the AA, it is simply not practical for most vehicles, and with one of these seat's merits being extended rearfacing, it is ridiculous that achieving that goal is going to require the purchase of an extra piece of foam.It's really hard to rate this item.  It's like YES it works, however...  Basically, it does what it is supposed to do, and it's not like there is a safe alternative, but it's crazy that you even need to buy it.  At least it isn't *terribly* expensive?  However, it does seem to run out of stock periodically so if you see yours starting to flatten, you might want to buy a new one as soon as you can, to have on hand - otherwise you may find yourself paddle-less up a certain undesirable creek.  ;-)  I'd have given it 4 stars if it weren't for complaints of it breaking down over time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342PKQEUMXVXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006I1QTYQ#wasThisHelpful","R342PKQEUMXVXR","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This definitely does the trick - it does what it is supposed to.  It came in the mail and my 2yo actually put it in the Potette and peed in it on his own with the cardboard still on it.  I bought the potette needing something super compact to take biking with the family and this insert is a little bulkier than I would like but it is squishy and it definitely works well.  If you really need super compact it is not as good as just carrying a few of the bags but it will sort of smash out of the way if you toss things on top of it.  Prior to this we had a the five dollar potty from ikea as our travel potty and this is much better but not quite as squishy as I hoped for.  Def. buy it from amazon because at least right now the blue is so cheap you'd be a fool not to add it on to the potette if you are buying it.  ;-)  It basically works awesome as a car potty but might be too bulky if you are thinking it will fit in your diaper bag.editing this to say - it does fit in my diaper bag.  Kind of bulky but it works, especially potty training is going so well I don't need to carry much in the way of diapers/supplies.

"Long time Britax girl here, branching out.  We have a couple of classic marathons which are expiring soon.  They're fabulous seats aside from the 35 pound rearfacing weight limit.  My son is a lightweight so odds are that limit is high enough for us but the style has been discontinued making it a moot point.  The current line-up of Britax seats are mediocre as best when it comes to extended rearfacing so I've decided to try some other brands - this and the Diono Radian RXT.My initial impression with this seat - which made me rule it out initially - is that the harness pads are, as many have mentioned, AWFUL.  Happily, Chicco listened to customer complaints and the pads are now easily removable and OPTIONAL. This prompted me to give this seat another chance.  We're using the pads for now but will probably remove them in time.The seat is wonderfully, wonderfully padded.  I wish I could fit my butt in here and experience the full effect but alas.  Not gonna happen.  I use it primarily for a 2 1/2yo but I also have 2 5yo girls who are my car seat guinea pigs and they assure me it is comfy.  Shoulder room is adequate for an older child - one of my daughters looks squished in the classic marathon, even though she fits by height and weight still.  My impression of this seat is that the harness does go a smidge higher than the classic marathon or the radian so this seat should keep most kids harness until they are ready for boosters.The headrest on this seat is solid and easily adjusted up or down, which in turn adjusts the harness.  This makes for super quick adjusting if you need to use the seat for more than one kid.  You can use the headrest fully extended, if rearfacing, which is not true of some other seats - peg perego and the current Britax seats for example.  I'd expect most kids to be able to rearface in this seat at least until 4.I have no problem tightening the harness aside from having to adjust those pads to do it.  Some reviews complain the adjuster is hard to use but I have no problems there, installed or not.  (Almost rf carseats will have the adjuster strap pushed into the seat of the car - you will have to figure the best angle to pull to work around this.)Installing this seat, rf or ff, could not be easier.  You attach both LATCH connectors, pull side one...  and then the magic, pull side two - and it tightens it rock solid, effortlessly.  You do need to be sure to let all the slack out of side two if moving to another vehicle.  This seat did not install well in the spot I most wanted it - rf in the 8th seat of a 2012 Odyssey - but that is a weird seat so it's not unexpected.  Rock solid install in the captains chairs or in the back of my husband's 2006 Prius.Very compact rearfacing install, given how generous the height and weight limits are.  9 recline options should enough no one is going to need a pool noodle or the like to install.Leg room in this seat is generous.  My 2 1/2yo can sit with his legs fully extended, easily.Seat is HEAVY - not a con imo, just a fact.Two quibbles with this seat - 1 the cup holder is very small.  It will fit something about the size of a bottle of bottled water.  Not much bigger.  Not a huge deal as there are things which will fit.  At least it has one - the classic Marathon does not. And it secures super solidly, which the radian cupholder does not.  2. -  it is a very deep seat.  This means it can be hard for older toddlers, who like to be independant, to climb and out on their own.  That is one place the radian shines, super easy in and out.  The deep walls make you feel your child is super safe and protected, even in an outboard position, but they might really start to bother older rearfacers.All in all, a wonderful seat.  Since it comes with a nice infant insert, it is one you can start using very early and, with the harness going as high as it does, it is a seat you will get a lot of use out of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QPP51ECNZSQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJP114M#wasThisHelpful","R2QPP51ECNZSQK","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This replaced a Haan si-35 slim and light steam mop.  Basically it is the same thing only with a head that swivels in more directions.  The 35 died after 2 years.  I would have liked to have gotten more use out of it.This heats up faster than my 35 and seems to get a little hotter.  Floors dry a little faster.  Cord seems a little longer and is softer, more pliable.  Also a 2 prong whereas the old was a 3 prong.  This is good for me since I have an old house where many outlets are 2 prong, but might not bode well for what is inside the beast - who knows.  The swivel head lets me get into places I couldn't with the 35.Very happy with it so far but I am going to come back in time and upgrade or downgrade based on longevity.  I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't have reservations based on my old one.  I bought this at Costco so I know we can take it back if there is a problem.Before Haan we had a Shark which left my floors streaky, never could figure out why.update - I got 5 months out of this, which is even worse than the last one.

"I got this a couple years ago and was non-plussed at how way off the mileage tracker was.  I would walk a known 5 mile loop and it would tell me I had done maybe 4.25.  I tried and tried re-measuring and re-entering my stride but it never seemed to be on top of things as far as distance.  Stuck it in a drawer and gave up.Then my husband got a fitbit for some contest he did at work and when he stopped using it, I took it up.  I wasn't any more impressed with the miles tracked but it seemed dead on for the steps so what I did was went and walked that 5 mile loop and figured how many steps it takes me to walk a mile which ends up being about 2,300 (I have short legs, I guess 2000 is the average).  I think this is a much better means of tracking distance than relying on the pedometer for telling you how far you went.  I became more interested in setting a step goal vs. a miles goal.The fitbit is super accurate in terms of counting steps.  However for some reason my 2 year old is obsessed with it and if he realizes I am wearing it he will stop at nothing to get it off of me.  Nothing!  He will pop it out of the case and run off with it and currently I have no flipping clue where it is.  Somewhere in my house.So I dusted out my old Omron which needed a new battery by now.  It's a lot simpler to set up than the fitbit (which has no buttons so you need a computer to sync it up and get the time right)  The omron has buttons, you can just set it to whatever, wherever you are.  All I set is the clock since I have given up on it giving me an accurate distance.I don't feel like it counts steps quite as accurately.  I think it's CLOSE but not perfect.  If I ever find my fitbit I will compare the two.  For some reason my kid leaves the Omron alone but even if he were to make off with it, it is bigger and harder to lose.It's a good price, it's easy to figure out, and it's reasonably accurate in terms of steps.  And hard to misplace.

"My oldest child is 9 1/2 and when he was of the age to get this, a friend had 2 and I loved them. They used to be called Kinderzeats and were touted as ""the chair after the high chair."" I think the chair itself is essentially the same but back then there was a wooden bar across the belly area and a single strap between the legs and that was how this worked for younger babies. I don't think it had a 5 pt harness at the time. This could explain some confusion with some of the older reviews or reviews by people who have had this chair for years and years. It has changed somewhat.I was super practical and penny pinching with my first and as much as I wanted this chair, we didn't NEED it, so I just could not justify spending the money. Back then it was two hundred bucks. I considered other brands but they were still pricey and I know wouldn't resell well which is something I always consider with baby gear.  I've always thought Ikea would come up with something affordable but they never have. We got by with the Fisher Price booster when he was small (*highly* recommend) and as soon as he was able, he climbed up in a normal chair. He knelt but he got by. It worked well enough.Then I had twins and there was no way I was buying TWO of these puppies. Yikes.I kept an eye out for used ones but they were few and far between.Now I am on kid 4, the final kid, the kid who is getting the things the others didn't just because this is my last spin on this merry-go-round. I was out buying a shower gift for a friend and saw two of these on clearance. Still pretty pricey for what it is, but a serious discount from what they sell for now (I swear Stokke stuff has inflated worse than anything else since my oldest was a kid.) So I snagged one for myself. And the next day I went back and snagged the other for my friend.I know, it's just a chair. But it is so awesome for a little kid (my little dude is a recent 2 and small for his age) to be able to climb up easily and sit comfortably at a normal height at the table. The independence for this age group is priceless. He can climb up and sit comfortably to eat or to color with his sisters. No kneeling or fidgeting or squirming. And it is HIS chair which means he ONLY sits there - he is very territorial over it - which helps me a lot with containing the mess. I have tried in the past to assign the messiest eaters to a certain spot, I have tried decorating a chair with ribbons LOOK IT'S YOUR SPECIAL CHAIR, I have tried having an easy to clean kiddie table - it just never works. They always end up back at the big table, moving from chair to chair, spreading the sticky and the crumbs as they go. But he will ONLY sit in this chair and I keep it in one spot which means the worst of the mess stays in one spot instead of migrating to cover the whole dining room if I go longer than 11 minutes without cleaning.  It's very smooth and easy to wipe clean.Now, as great as this chair is for toddlers and preschoolers, it is mind-numbingly expensive for what it is. There just isn't much to it. Some wood. Some bars. Awesome design. But not enough to justify the cost especially when you factor in how much the add-ons cost. They have been making it for decades so it's not like they need start-up funds at this point.If you want to use this as a high chair for an infant, you are going to have to shell out at least sixty bucks more for the infant part. And that is JUST the seat part, not the tray. The seat part is well made and durable but it's PLASTIC. It's not made of diamond-encrusted unicorn horn. (Seriously, someone from Stokke correct me if I am wrong here. Were any unicorns harmed in the making of the insert?) For twenty-five bucks you can get a fisher price booster WITH a tray which will serve you just as well if not better. Yes you will have to use one of your existing dining chairs but if you need another chair for a guest buy a folding chair for twenty bucks and you're still way ahead.  (I should mention though that that plastic part is at least made in the USA which is great - but still.  Plastic!)The 5 point harness on this is over the top as far as safety. If you don't start to use the chair until the child can get in independently there just isn't much point to it. I removed it entirely because high chair harnesses get gross quickly.  It's not easy to remove, you need tools and you need to take the chair apart slightly - an improvement would be a no-tool removal for easy washing, if you decide to use it.  Everyone is going to have their own opinion on this one.If the infant add-ons came with this, I'd *possibly* give it a 5. But the price is utterly insane for what you actually get. It is an awesome chair for a toddler or above but there is just no way to sugarcoat it into being a cost effective choice for infant though adult. If you can find a deal, or if this is your first kid and you will get years and years of use from it, snag it. You will LOVE it, for a toddler or preschooler. But for an infant, odds are, you can do more for less, in the baby stage.I will say, at the other end of the spectrum, an adult could sit in this chair. Many of the ""grow with me chairs"" (such as the OXO), while they are more inclusive of baby items for the price, they still LOOK like high chairs once they are in big-kid mode. I could sit in this chair and maintain my self-respect. Which means we might just hold on to it, long term, until we have grandkids, and actually have it in regular use, vs. being stashed away in the interim. But still. Wickedly expensive for the add-ons. And that keeps me from saying 5 stars.  But for what we paid and for how well it works for us, we love it.One more thing, I have read some complaints of the painted ones chipping - so if you have the choice, you might want to go with a stained one rather than a painted, colored one - or at least be aware that could happen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDK25R4YO71V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001D1505A#wasThisHelpful","RRDK25R4YO71V","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't have any pets but went with this pet formulation because I needed to get vomit out of my car and the non-pet version didn't specify vomit on the label at the time of purchase.  I suspect the oxygen part of the spray is what does the job so the non-pet version should work just as well but I wasn't taking any chances.This saved me from having to have my car detailed after a disgusting vomiting episode which still stunk after trying numerous other methods.  I went over everything twice with this, soft and hard surfaces, popped molding off, really soaked the carpet, and shoved wadded up cloth diapers under the carpet so air could get under and it could dry.

"These containers are sturdy, attractive, and simple to operate.  The lid forms a good seal to keep the contents fresh and can be completely taken apart for a good cleaning.  We ordered one of the 4 quart size to hold flour and it exactly holds one bag of flour.  Not perfect since I don't want to have to wait until it is completely empty to add a new bag, as I wanted canisters on my counter so I could get bags out of my pantry.  This is pretty ideal for the new shrunken 4 pound bags of sugar, though.  I'm glad we only ordered one so we could try it out - I wanted 3 canisters and planned to order all the same for flour, flour, and sugar, but I think a 4 quart and two 5.5 quart ones will work better for us.

"My kids had the Princess, Cars, and Angry Birds throws you can get from Costco.  Those are super thick and warm.  One of my girls really wanted a Perry blanket though so I claimed her Cars one for my bed and got her this. It's not quite as thick as the other throws, it is a shorter nap (pile?), but it is still moderately warm.  Good size to cover a twin bed.

"I knew this had no top sheet when I bought it - but it was on clearance at the big red store, crazy cheap.  ;-)  Otherwise I would not have bought it.  It is super soft and lovely to rub.  Feels to be nice quality.  The pillowcase alone was worth what I paid for it - so comfy.  My Perry-obsessed daughter is in love.  But what are you supposed to do for a top sheet??  I also picked up a princess set - one of my girls already has princess sheets so we just use the top sheet from that and it works.  I guess they figure a true fan will already have regular Phineas and Ferb sheets?  Or maybe they are just cashing in on the Agent P love and figure people are dumb enough to buy sheet sets with no top sheets.  If you've got regular Phineas and Ferb sheets, just blend them with this.  I don't know if we will get P&F sheets or just find a solid colored top sheet to go with these.  Very mystifying. Hard to rate since it's great quality but no top sheet!  A friend actually said these would be great for her because they don't use top sheets, just blankets, but we are top sheet users, so I guess this is something that varies widely.  I am not sure how this material would work as a top sheet but they show a top sheet on the package so - where do you get one?I'll confess they were so cheap I bought a set for myself, just for the pillowcase.  I'm also a bit obsessed with the semi-aquatic egg-laying mammal of action.

"I got this for my son's first Christmas, which was a mistake.  He was too young but the older kids loved it.  One of the older kids loved it too much and discovered that the mallet, which has very square corners, could be used to make delightful dents in drywall.  And then in the process of the wreckertons playing with it, one of the wooden ramps inside came out (we could have glued it back in promptly and it would have been fine, but then it disappeared, as toys do) and the yellow ball went AWOL.  So now we are missing a ball and a ramp.  I put the toy away for a while, got it out again a few months ago - baby was 20 or 21 months old.It's a GREAT toy.  I'd say ideal for 18m and up.  It takes just enough resistance to pound the balls through the holes that it is the right balance between challenging and rewarding.  It makes a nice clackity sound as the ball rolls through - even minus a ramp.  Simple means of teaching colors and numbers 1-4 to a very young child.  Just plain fun for a little one.My daughter seems to have outgrown her hunger for destroying drywall so that's good.  We haven't lost any more ramps so just that one must have been loose - it's totally and easily fixable if you have this issue, you just need to do it before you lose it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULGPYO7AXS5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VO3GME#wasThisHelpful","R3ULGPYO7AXS5P","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this for my youngest for Christmas.  He was twenty months.  I think it might have been more amusing for maybe a one-year-old (closer to twelve months).  I don't know if I got a dud or not but there is little resistance to the pegs - they just slide right down, and the opposite peg pops up.  My older kids always seem to go for the baby toys along with the baby and no one seemed to find this very interesting.They all liked the M&D pounding ball tower way, way more.If you want a peg pounding bench, look for one of the ones that actually has some resistance.

"I got this to replace a 7 cup cuisinart which worked fine but was very basic and kind of small.  I don't know if all food processors are like this but the Cuisinart has a hole where the blade goes through which seriously limits how much liquid you can actually put in the container.  If I wanted to make smoothies for my 4 kids, in theory, the food processor would be much faster and more efficient than my 40 year old blender, but it simply couldn't handle that much liquid - even though the capacity was 7 cups, more than ~3 cups of liquid would spill out.The most amazing thing about this processor is the ginourmous container which will actually hold 12 cups of liquid.  Smoothies for a crowd are no problem with this.  The design is completely different than the Cuisinart, there is no gaping hole!  The part where you mount the blade it sort of a rotating thing within the container, vs. poking something down through a hole.So far I/we have sliced celery, jullienned carrots, shredded carrots (fine, for muffins), made a loaf of bread, made pizza dough, sliced cabbage for coleslaw, made ""yonanas"" (frozen bananas pureed into ""ice cream""), and made cranberry orange relish.For the pizza I used 5 1/2 cups of flour and I suspect this is about the limits of what this will handle - but that made 4 medium (thin) pizzas so that's plenty.  I have never made dough before in a food processor so I can't say how it compares to others.  It worked fine for me, though!For chopping (as for the cranberry relish), it did a good job of chopping into tiny uniform bits vs. pulverizing the heck out of everything and liquifying or pureeing it (as my old one did).With the bananas, this processor did a ridiculously good job - my old one seemed to whir them around and around and around for so long that by the time it came together, it was thawing, so I had to shred them first, then switch to the chopping blade, to get it to work.  This made a ton of yonanas very well and very quickly using just the chopping blade.My husband has made a cream cheese glaze for a cake using the small container and there was some slop over such that the large container needed washed, which seems to be a common problem with nesting processor bowls.  Not a huge issue but be aware of it.  If you plan to use both bowls, use the outer bowl first since it might get dirty.I am completely blown away by the design and quality of this item.  The food chute is HUGE and has a smaller insert for small/skinny items.  The mini insert doubles as a measuring device.  I haven't used it as such yet but it is seriously like they sat down and thought, ""How many features can we possibly squash into this thing?""  Compared to the larger Cuisinarts, the safety mechanism (such that the large pusher is in place so there is no risk of shoving your hand in the processor) is MUCH smoother and easier to work.  The most amazing thing about this unit, though, is the storage case that it comes with for ALL the blades.  It is HUGE.  You won't believe how huge it is.  I keep looking at it and thinking it is too good to be true, that in this day and age of shrinkage and declining quality, it's like some crazy throw back to the past when appliances were made with quality and you didn't get nickle and dimed for everything.  This processor comes with EVERYTHING you will ever need.  It is truly amazing.I did a camel camel camel search when I bought this and snagged it at the lowest price all year in early december.  You can set a watch to be alerted if the price drops.  For what I paid, considering it is huge and useful and comes with everything, I think it was a bargain.  Even at a higher price - look at what all it comes with, and focus on the features and not just the cost.I have not yet called for the upgraded slicer attachment and lid.  I have only sliced carrots so far and have not had a problem.  I do find the fine side is not as SUPER fine as I would like - it was acceptable for muffins, but if you wanted super duper fine parmesan, you might find it a little thicker than you like - but I think that is my only quibble with this machine.  Truly, truly amazing otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16N2PPALJSDVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005I6ZKCE#wasThisHelpful","R16N2PPALJSDVA","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will echo what everyone else is saying, yes, yes, 100 times yes - this game is a crappy copy of a beloved childhood favorite.  I actually bought mine a few years ago so the board is red but it is the same horrible design - with the additional insult that the box reads ""same great playing game!  easy storage box.""It is NOT the same great playing game and there is nothing easy whatsoever about removing the hippos, extending the necks, puzzling them in place, and getting the thin flimsy lid shut compared to putting a ONE PIECE board back in a simple, sturdy box.  I guess they realized how false this claim and removed it - which means they know how lousy the game is yet they continue to produce it.Seriously how much more money could it cost to make this the old way?  People would gladly pay a few dollars more for a game their kids get use out of.  This game works just well enough that every buyer is hopeful it will work out for their kids, but Hasbro should really be ashamed of this toy.

"One of my daughters is prone to developing a dreadlock on the back of her head that would put Bob Marley to shame.  We have had some luck with dimethicone sprays - they will kind  work for the day they are used and then you are back to rasta-style the next morning.  I have tried jojoba oil which which people rave about but it just didn't seem to soak in to my daughter's super fine hair or really seem to do much for the knots.  I wanted to give one of the argan oils a try but they are usually quite pricey and I really didn't want to drop twenty bucks on a hair product that wouldn't work.  When I saw this and how cheap it was (as of this writing it should be cheaper to just pick up locally, under five bucks - but prices on Amazon can change) - I figured eh, we'll give it a try.To use this I combed her hair (dry) and drizzled a bit of the oil on a fine tooth comb and combed it through, focusing on the bad section to start and then using the same comb to go over the rest of her hair, which just lightly applied whatever was left on the comb.  It did look oily initially but it soaked in over the next half-hour or so leaving her with shiny, slippery, untangled hair.I know that hair is dead and as such you can't really ""repair"" it but I think this stuff actually soaks in well enough and stays there well enough that it is the next best thing.  We actually see a day to day reduction in tangles with this product, vs. same-day only results.Very pleased with this product, both the results and the price.  I find it interesting that another reviewer has always been happy with Garnier and is now losing faith in the company - I have actually never liked Garnier products, this is the first one I have been pleased with.  I don't know if this means they have changed and are better suited for different hair types or what (I always found their products to leave my thin hair even more flat) but I am definitely a fan of this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR6UH6UBW4J5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DF6XB4#wasThisHelpful","RR6UH6UBW4J5N","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crazy story.  I had a Sienna minivan.  ""Not Me"" or ""I don't know""  (it's not clear) went out one day and put a big handle-bar height scratch alongside the car.  I had the crazy idea to go out and buff it out with toothpaste.  It works on watch crystals, why not cars?  It was super scrubby arm & hammer baking soda toothpaste.  I used small, circular movements with my finger and then cleaned it off with a baby wipe. It kinda-sorta worked.  It worked to where if the scratch was wet, you could't see it - but as it dried it came back, although not as pronounced as before.OK so we traded the van in for an Odyssey in the exact same color - not because of the scratch but because of a leak no one could figure out.  And what do I do?  I back into my garbage can and end up with a scratch JUST like the old car almost as if the old car is haunting me.Since it was a brand new car and I felt like a total dummy, I figured I should try something better than toothpaste.  This took the edge off...  but I can't say it worked much, if any, better than toothpaste.  I would try toothpaste first.  It's cheaper and you can brush your teeth with the stuff that's left over.  I would not suggest brushing your teeth with this stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TG3BN5P9YVOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002UNON8#wasThisHelpful","R3TG3BN5P9YVOQ","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had been borrowing a friend's older Yakima trunk mounted rack.  It was supposed to hold 3 bikes but we could only ever get 2 on it, with difficulty.  We were in the market for a hitch mount rack and I had thought we'd go with a Yakima double Down Ace 5 - Yakima's arms are not as far apart as they used to be - but it's still not easy to get a variety of sizes on due to the fat stability portion of the cradles.  I gave the Allen a whirl because over a 2 day period I ended up in traffic beside 5 people with Allen racks - I thought it must be some sort of sign.The arms on this bike rack are pretty far apart - maybe 15 inches? - but the cradles are very small.  Your bike will not be as cushily cradled as with a more expensive rack - however, you will be able to get a wide variety of bikes on the rack.  The small cradles make for slender arms you can stick through different portions of the smallest bikes - allows you to think outside the box somewhat.  Saved us the cost of buying adapter bars.  Hope I am explaining that OK!We have this on the back of a 2012 Odyssey.  I had concerns about the innermost bike hitting the hatch since the hatch kind of bows out, but it seems to be just fine.  I don't know if it matters but we have the factory hitch which definitely affects how high the rack sits and might also affect how far it sticks out the back?  We have loaded a 15"" men's hybrid, a 17"" mens ""fitness,""  a 24"" kids mountain bike, and a trail a bike.  So glad we can get the trail a bike on!  and a 5th bike will absolutely fit on the last spot with this set-up, although for the time being we don't have one.  Two little kids ride in the trailer and that goes in my trunk.Some do not care for the straps on this rack - they are nylon straps and you need to thread and unthread them each time.  While it is more fiddly than pulling those rubber holey kind other brands use, I actually prefer it.  It's a smoother motion with a much bigger range of adjustment.  On some bikes it was downright painful to get those rubber straps pulled just right.  So it may take a little longer but it is easier on the fingers and gives better results IMO.  And there are no worries about straps popping open while driving.  (I had this happen with the yakima...  there is nothing like pulling over because the bike is leaning a little funny and realizing the straps have come completely off!!!)Only one grumble with this rack - it has an odd sized hole for the hitch pin so if you want to use a locking hitch pin you have to buy the Allen one which is expensive and has very unconvincing reviews.  I have a feeling the Allen rack is not going to be in as great danger of being stolen as the bigger brands; if it is a concern you can use a cable lock through that loop at the base and your hitch bar or bumper.  I think a key lock might be more convenient than using tools though to get the rack on and off the car.  Allen says the two-sized hole thing is crucial to the no-wobble design.  This being the only hitch mount rack I have driven with I can't say how the wobble or lack of compares.Will update if quality turns out to be poor but after 4 trips out now we're really, really happy.  Seems to be very sturdy and simple and sometimes simple is good.  Huge outdoor mega store just had a big sale so for a nice price we could have gone fancier but we chose not to.  Unless you've got very delicate frames (mega expensive bikes) and need extra cushioning - no need to pay more for a 5 bike rack.  I think that for most families this will prove a better choice than a fancier rack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XFEKF7B9QS2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OD3ERS#wasThisHelpful","R1XFEKF7B9QS2K","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I borrowed this from a friend because our car situation was in flux - looking to get a new car with a hitch.  We had a Toyota Sienna, '08, LE model.  The rack fit well enough - not great - but it was NOT easy to get kids or small frame adult bikes on.  I have a 15"" hybrid men's bike, my son has a 24"" (wheel) kid's mountain bike.  I couldn't hang either in the normal fashion, I had to do the goofy crazy cockeyed method and ended up with a LOT of sway.  My son's bike actually popped out of the straps on one trip - I don't know HOW I managed to not lose it entirely.  I was always looking out the back window making sure we had the bikes and his suddenly looked WAY more lean-y than usual - pulled over - straps were off.I never felt like this fit my car great, I felt like every trip was a gamble.  I'd find myself trying to make slight adjustments and the whole thing would then drop to one side or the other so the bikes had to come off and rack had to be repositioned.My husband's bike (17"" frame) was the only one of our bikes that fit on here normally.  I think the arms are just so far apart it only fits bigger, and men's, bikes, unless you have the adapter, but that wouldn't help in terms of size.I found the straps hard to pull and you couldn't always get EXACTLY the right tightness.  I know many bike racks use this type of hole-y rubber strap set up - we're looking for one that doesn't.  It's going to depend on YOUR bike, of course - I think my son's bike is thicker and it had a setting that worked but for mine I just ended up with sore fingers and a fit I wasn't crazy about.Maybe we were doing something colassally wrong but I just hated this rack.  I was nervous every time I drove with it.  And I don't know how on earth you fit 3 bikes in here - we could only ever get 2 on.If you have 2 of the right bike and need a trunk mount rack - MAYBE this will work.  But we're moving on to a hitch mounted rack and hoping for smoother sailing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWQHH5SYXUEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042EQUP4#wasThisHelpful","R1IWQHH5SYXUEJ","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought one of the first Silk Epils years and years ago (circa 1995) and it seemed like over time the metal tweezers stopped gripping.  That style had been discontinued so I replaced it with a Soft Perfection (20 tweezers) only to then learn of the X'elle which had 40.  So I bought an X'elle - aqua blue sparkly body.  The head, without the attachments, looked kind of naked and unfinished compared to the Soft Perfection and the tweezers were half plastic, half metal vs. metal on metal like the Soft Perfection - but it worked well.  I had some doubts of it holding up but it has held up fine over the last 4 years or so.  I am in need of a new replacement head - I think they ALL lose tweeze ability over time - and decided just to buy a whole new unit since they are making a new style now so the old is cheap.I may end up trying the new style down the road just because I like gadgets...  but since I tend to be crotchety and stuck in my ways I for now am going to say I prefer the old.  ;-)  As far as I can tell they use the same head so tweezing ability should be the same.  The new one just pivots which seems to me like it would offer less control?  I love the colorful, sparkly look of the old - the new looks boring.I keep wanting to try an Emjoi but I can't help but think that second spinning backward head, if it does anything, is going to break hair rather than help...Anyway.  Let's talk epilating.  Chances are if you are considering epilating, you are doing it because shaving doesn't cut it for you.  I am a hairy woman.  I blame PCOS + my mother's Italian genes.  Genetics has been cruel in that my brother and father have less leg hair than I do - on what planet is that fair???  So assuming you are coming at this from a similar place, you may never look like the woman on the box.  Your legs may also never feel as smooth with epilating as after shaving - but they will LOOK acceptable for much longer.  I can epilate and then go camping for a few days with friends and look OK - just don't touch me -vs shaving and I will look like a neanderthal in 8 hours.My experience is this works great on coarse hair, fairly well on medium hair, not so great on fine hair.  It will grab hair that is pretty short - way shorter than waxing - but the thicker the hair the less prone to breakage.So this works well on my lower legs (coarse).  Fairly well on the fronts of my thighs (medium) and bikini region (coarse).  Also well on my face (a few coarse chinny chins).  There are parts of my inner legs kinds of above and below the knee where the hair is fine, doesn't work so well on this.  Luckily my arm hair is light and fine, if a tad long - I would never dream of using this on my arms.  And I do not do the backs of my thighs because the hair grows in nine million different directions and you really need to go the right direction to epilate.  I am simply not limber enough to be able to get close enough to figure out what I am doing back there.On coarse hair- this works well.  I have never seen 4 weeks of smoothness - I tend to do it every few days in the summer.  But it is still more effective than shaving. AmLactin lotion can help a lot with an ingrowns that result - or for an acute horrible patch of them, tend-skin or the home made alternative.  I think weather or not you get them is partly a personal variation and it's annoying if you do.  A good Veet now and then (which I do to take care of the backs of my thighs) also tend to free the ingrowns.  For a manual exfoliation I have found that better than any scrub or loofah etc IN the shower is AFTER a nice long shower, dry your legs very aggressively with a nice un-fabric-softened towel - you will see the skin roll off even if you just used scrubby gloves or whatever.  Then use lotion.Forget about the acessories - the massage thing gets in the way, the cooling glove is not needed (but is good for kid's boo boos)  Bare bones, unit and spinny head, yank those hairs.Is this device perfect?  No - but it fails because body hair is a tough enemy to beat.  It won't get ALL the hair and it can hurt until you get used to it.  But it does a great job on coarse hair and it has a real place in the hairy woman's arsenal.  I can't imagine much better short of laser becoming truly affordable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35FC6UJF5P0SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QI271W#wasThisHelpful","R35FC6UJF5P0SV","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend recommended these, and her eye doctor recommended them.  Previously I used a Visine allergy eye drop which worked for a little bit but didn't last for long.  Most allergy eye drops have a redness reducer which can supposedly over time case rebound issues with over or repeated use, much like a sinus spray - alaway does not have a redness reducer, just an antihistimine.  But zap the irritation and you zap the redness in the process.These work so well and so fast and feel so amazing, it is almost worth having itchy eyes for just to feel it.  :-)  Relief tends to last until it is sane and logical to use the drops a second time.  This has been a doozy of a summer for allergies so I am glad to have these.  Only reason for one star off is the price is high.  Shop around - I found them cheaper than anywhere else in a two pack at our local Kmart but ""cheaper"" is still pricey for how tiny the bottle is.  So now I have a few bottles stashed in various places so I can always get my fix, er, relief.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPRPY9OYKGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014DSOM8#wasThisHelpful","R2XPRPY9OYKGE","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am constantly looking for kids games that the smallest members of the family can play that don't make the adults wish they were somewhere else, such as having a root canal in the 19th century.  I happen to really enjoy this game.My husband hates it, though, so your mileage may vary.We recently played with my mother in law, 2 4yo girls, an 8yo boy, and myself.  My mother in law has an older version of this so the picture was different but the premise the same.  There is a board with a lot of pictures and a bunch of cards each with one picture.  Players take turns drawing cards and then every other player takes a turn asking a question to try to guess which picture the main player picked.  You need to keep track of what was asked and it can get confusing, the longer you go on - but in a test your memory sort of way, not in a ""this game is annoying"" kind of way.My 8yo is getting to the literal/smart aleck phase so playing with him can be frustrating - my MILs version had a ladder for example and when asked if the item was striped my son said ""Yes, in the middle"" - despite it being just a yellow ladder - leading us all to guess things like the flag, the beach chair, the umbrella to no avail.  Once he revealed that it was the ladder (no one guessed it) no amount of discussion could convince my son that a ladder is not actually striped - so with some kids you may run into the issue of clues that don't really point to the answer.  My younger girls did much better in this respect.I can't remember how the board was at my MILs - if it was one piece or not.  Ours is two pieces which puzzle together which is a weird design IMO but they are sturdy enough pieces and you don't do much with the board so holding up over time isn't an issue.I really enjoy this game, although as I said my husband hates it - so it may or may not work for you.  My girls absolutely love it, and I think it's fun seeing them try to work out the answers.  A great way to teach reasoning and paying attention to clues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QMBEBY347TNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SDB4#wasThisHelpful","R2QMBEBY347TNC","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this bike during a sale at a well-known outdoor/clothing store with a legume in the name, making the price more reasonable and most importantly assuring easy local returns if needed.  Once it arrived I was intimidated by the ""must be assembled by a professional"" wording on the box along with a list of the tools required, which included a bike stand and chain tool among other things.  Our branch of said store no longer sells bikes so I was a little worried about the assembly.  My husband has been on a waking up early kick and got up yesterday and had it assembled and ready to go before I woke up.  He says it took nothing special and was pretty easy.I was not sure if we should order the original version of this bike or the slightly smaller version - I ended up going with the original.  We have 4yo twins - one is at the big end of normal, but not so big that you would look at her and say ""Oh my god that is a big 4yo!"" or mistake her for 5 - the other is at the small end.  Not pygmy small but could easily pass for 3.  The bigger one JUST fit on this bike at the smallest setting.  I could see her butt slipping a little from side to side as I rode behind her as even at the smallest setting it was just a hair too big  - but it worked.  We can not put the smaller girl on this yet. We tried but she can't pedal and doesn't feel secure.  I'm kind of on the fence about taking off a star for the size.  On the one hand, a 4yo DOES fit and you want your money's worth from a product, so it makes sense that a 4yo would ride it on the smallest setting.  On the other hand - if you have a SMALL 4yo, you might want to go with the compact version of this.  Luckily (in this case) our smaller girl is lazy and content to ride in the trailer, so we didn't have any squabbles over who got to ride and her not being big enough anyway.  I really think if you try to push it and put a too-small kid on this bike, you're going to be lugging an unhappy kid around and that's no fun for anyone.The child does not really have to pedal the bike, but for the most part, my daughter was pedaling.  My husband felt like turning the pedals took a good bit of effort - other reviews comment that they feel stiff - but my daughter did just fine.  She was perfectly content and happy to ride along on this for 12 miles - my older son who was pedaling on his own was the only reason we had to end our trip when we did.  My husband points out that the stiff pedals mean the kid is getting something of a workout despite not really doing much, which is good.The bike attached and pulled just fine on my husband's bike (Trek 7.1, 17"" frame) but I have not tried it on my own bike yet.  I have a rack for a baby seat on my bike and you can't use the two together.  I will update when I get around to trying it.No complaints so far.  Easy assembly, pulls great, kid likes it A LOT.  Just be aware that while it says ages 4-6, imo, it's aimed at a bigger 4yo and you will get many years of it, size wise, which is good, because while family biking seems like a great idea and good exercise and all, the longer you can pull the kid, the longer your trips can be.  :-)I just wish that the tandem version was not so stupidly expensive.  Down the road we may want trail-a-bike seating for 2 kids and it is cheaper to buy two singles than the tandem!eta after many awesome family trips out this fall, we still love the bike.  If you think my review is not helpful I'd prefer you leave a comment rather than an unhelpful vote.  I feel like a lot of unhelpful votes came in at once for positive reviews here.  My chief complaint remains this won't work for a small 4yo - but my big 4yo loved it.  So much that when a pink one came up on sale I grabbed one for the small one for next year.  And then when I found a killer price on a Burley Piccolo I snagged it as well - so I will have more comparisons soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IO5KMTDX3O4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027SLUG6#wasThisHelpful","R1IO5KMTDX3O4A","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the older version of this seat and was looking to get the newer version because it is rated to hold 8 pounds more of kid.  One of my girls is right at the 40 pound mark.  I had no trouble mounting the old style (Baby Seat I) on my bike and theoretically, if you have the seat stay mounts, this should be just as easy.  But my bike doesn't have them!  So I am stuck with the old version.  The seat itself as far as I can see is pretty similar and we're perfectly happy with it from that end. Even with my 40 pounder, my bike handles just fine and my daughter says she's comfortable. If you don't have the mounts, try to find an earlier version.Once the rack is mounted, both versions are similar easy to put on and get off the bike.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQA72C2YH14K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028018OW#wasThisHelpful","R1PQA72C2YH14K","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to replace the horrible choking hazard foam belly bar of my B-Ready.  It will work on both the 2011 and earlier and the 2012 - but on the 2012 ideally you will put it in the 1-click-back position - otherwise it is too far forward IMO.It is a tad higher than I would like BUT my baby can't bite chunks out of it, so that scores points in my book.I wish Britax made a tray or non-edible belly bar - that would be INCLUDED with the B-ready - since they do not, this is the next best thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R330NOPSWJXVNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IYDJNY#wasThisHelpful","R330NOPSWJXVNK","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the old, and now I have the new, and here is how they differ.- The new model has a seat with a 4th, totally upright position as well as an easier to open buckle.  On the old you had to really press in and tug just so to get the buckle open, on the new the sides just fall out.  Personally I found that on the old, my bigger kids did not need that more upright position.  My baby kept pulling up on the belly bar and biting chunks of foam off of it, which made me think he wanted to be more upright, but the new 4th position actually seems almost TOO upright to him - he tries to slide out!  He's 15 months, so not super young.  I actually got out the level and checked and while the back is now totally upright, the seat part actually seems to slope forward a bit.  I expect we may never use the new 4th position.  Hard or easy buckle has pros and cons both ways so is the new seat really better?  It depends.  I do prefer the easier buckle, but some prefer the harder kind.  What they should really do is give you two and make them removable, vs. sewn in, so you can pick what works for your family - whether you have an escape artist kid or if you tend to find yourself with only one free hand.- The weight limit on the seat is now 55 pounds and I think it was 50 pounds before.  There is now an extra strap under the seat cover which I suppose adds more support.  However - realistically - this is a SMALL (seat-wise) stroller.  I would expect most people are done with it by 3, 3 1/2.  At 4, my girls are squished and while we can use this for them, I would not use it all the time.  I don't see putting either a 50 pound or a 55 pound child in either version.  (The actually fit better in the 2nd seat, which I think is a tad wider, but has a lower weight limit!)- It has a deeper basket - but the difference is marginal.  It is POSSIBLY inch deeper and doesn't matter all for practical purposes.  If you take the baskets off (you can unzip at the front, unsnap at the back) and put them on top of each other, they seem pretty much the same.  The frames of the strollers are the same so it's not a difference in how it hangs.  If you try to switch the baskets, though, you will get maybe a quarter inch of zipper that doesn't line up at the front.  The difference is VERY minimal.- The suspension is somewhat better.  It's a little easier to make the shocks give - but you have to MAKE them give, still, vs. really feeling them give over bumps.  This is still not a hard-core off-roading stroller.  I do most of my walking in nice weather in a cemetery which has a mix of smooth pavement in good repair, smooth pavement in bad repair, oil & chip type pavement (tiny rocks but all glued together) in good repair, oil & chip in bad repair, and gravel/dirt.  Old or new, I will not take this stroller on to the gravel/dirt parts - I will only use my Bob back there.  The old did decently on all the other stuff.  The new does  a bit better - but I largely credit the wheels.  Maybe 10% new suspension, 90% new wheels.- The wheels are rubbery, forever air, vs. dense foam over plastic as before.  They provide a smoother ride.  It's not a Bob, but it is an improvement!  They are also quieter - there have been many reports of the old starting to squeak over time, and mine had in fact started making noise after just a few months.  The new one is QUIET.  So far.- The amount of accessories has been cut back.  It comes with the cup holder, but no longer includes the rain cover  or color-coordinated storage organizer pouch.  Admittedly, the pouch organizer thingie was only marginally useful and kind of strange, but it was something, and it matched.  For the price this ought to come with SOME sort of parent console!  (I use a Jolly Jumper one and it works perfectly - and is cheap - I know Britax sells one now but it is considerably more moola)One thing they did not improve which I wish they had was the belly bar.  As I mentioned it is covered in foam.  Exposed foam.  I have seen it referred to as a ""choking hazard belly bar"" - and I have to agree it very well could be.  I have pulled sizable chunks of foam out of my baby's mouth.  The bar needs to come with a color-coordinated cover OR be made of hard plastic.  I have ordered the UppaBaby tray to do away with the bar.  I have been using it without the bar but my little dude likes to have something to grab.It retains all of what I love about the old - flipable seat, baby is comfortable, push is AWESOME, decent sun shade, folds easily, open between back wheels so no kicking while you walk.  It's a wonderful stroller.  But if you are trying to decide between the old and new, or wondering if you should sell and upgrade - I think the wheels are the #1 improvement.  I really thought it was going to be the seat, but I am on the fence about the seat.  It may be possible to snag a killer deal on an old one, and replace the wheels.  Or replace the wheels on the one you have.  Either way get the UppaBaby tray as the belly bar is the one thing IMO that really needs to go.If they included a parent organizer and fixed the belly bar - I'd give this a 5.  Maybe in the next version?If you are wondering - the new will take the old 2nd seat and the old will take the new.  All that has changed on the 2nd seat is the buckle, and the color choices.Also - Britax has said you can put the new top seat on the old frame but mine didn't seem to go together well, I couldn't figure out why.  It looked like it should but it just wouldn't click for me.  Also you can swap the skins of the seats, old skin on new frame, and vice versa, although Britax only seems to sell complete seats, not just frames or skins.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19MI3HGW38GS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CTPWYQ#wasThisHelpful","R19MI3HGW38GS3","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a baby who has a right to be in a stroller as well as 4yo twins, one of whom is much lazier than the other.  :-D  I don't use this as an all-the-time double but it is useful for a day out so the whiny one can hitch a ride.  As luck would have it, the whiny one is smallish.  Shorter end of average in height, hovering around 33-34 pounds - so almost maxing out the seat.She can hop in and out on her own and I am happy to report that even if she decides to sit in the basket of the stroller, it holds her.  :-/For the heck of it, I put the bigger twin in - she is 40ish pounds, so above the weight - and it held up and pushed great still.  I wouldn't go over all the time but I suspect there is some wiggle room built into the weight limit so if you have a slightly bigger child, it should still be OK for occasional use.  Don't hold me to that in court or anything, though.  Luckily the bigger twin is more energetic and will normally go for miles under her own steam.  She is well within the weight limits to stick her in the top seat, and I can wear the baby then, if needed.  (Ironically, though, there seems to be more butt room in the 2nd, lower weight limit seat!)I don't use this with the sun shade as I am using it with taller kids for occasional use.Technically you can put a baby in the 2nd seat but, while I haven't tried, I am 99% sure my little dude would freak out if I put him down there.  So as a regular double I expect this would work best with an older child in the bottom - old enough to find the novelty interesting - and an infant up top.  (And while the top does not go flat, IMO it goes back enough that an infant will be just fine in it.  Maybe a little body support.  No need to buy the basinette.  My kids all hated being flat as newborns.)The only difference between the old and new models of 2nd seat is the buckle.  It is easier to open on the new one.  The old seat will work on the new frame and vice-versa.  Personally I find the buckle is not needed for putting an older child down there - they aren't going to fall out.  For a smaller child, the old style buckle is even more difficult to do down low BUT it's probably what you want to have if you are putting a child down there who you need to stay buckled.  So it's a toss-up, which is better.Folding with the 2nd seat attached is only slightly bulkier than without, although as I said, I don't use the sun shade.  I find it easier to remove the seat as to fiddle and fight with the extra heft of the seat + stroller, which is how I prefer to fold it.  However if I wanted it to, the whole shebang will fit, 2nd seat attached, laying on its side, behind the 3rd row of my van (Sienna)This adds a nice dose of versatility to an awesome stroller.  As a twin mom, I would hesitate to suggest it as a dedicated twin double - my experience with doubles is my girls fought in tandem set-ups.  This is MUCH easier to steer than a traditional tandem, but I feel like the inequality of seating plus the logistics of putting a baby in the 2nd seat (mine just wouldn't go for it) make this a less than ideal dedicated double.  I much prefer side-by-sides, for twins and/or primary double use.  But that's just me.  What works for you is going to depend on spacing as well as temperment of your kids.  I think this is great, though, for older + younger or sometimes use.  Strictly based on how it works, it steers great and is easy to push, even with 2 4yo girls in it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RZHCTA6KWYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OBYTOU#wasThisHelpful","R25RZHCTA6KWYA","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm so glad to see they are making this toy again.  I was trying to snag a used one for a while but the only one I found locally was missing one of the purple steps, and I couldn't get a replacement because they weren't making it for a while.My girls (4yo) love to play with this in the child care at the mall, but it was rationalized as a birthday gift for my newly 1yo.  At 14 months he is small and just barely starting to toddle but he is very happy on this.  We put him on and push him down the hill and he laughs.The girls have a blast on it, too.  They're pretty average in size for 4yos and fit but are about the upper end of useful size if that makes sense.  My 8yo can even ride but he looks ridiculous and does not have as much fun as he would if he fit.  (Not sure I want to spring for the giant outdoor one!)I'd say this is BEST for ages 1-4.  Get it young to get the most use out of it.Assembly is super duper easy - no tools, just snap together.  Everything comes ready to go, you don't even need to put stickers on.Dis-assembly is also easy, if you don't want to have it out all the time.The actual toy takes up ten feet and 2-3 inches past that but you will also want a good 5 feet of room to keep going - make sure you have the room if you plan to use this indoors.

"There's no polite way to put this.  This is the sort of thing you buy for a child if you have no experience with how kids really are (first time parent) or if it has been so long since you had little kids that you have forgotten (grandparent).I know.  It's cute.  And it's so much fun to imagine kids HELPING in the garden.Here is what kids really do in the garden.  They pick plants you don't want picked.  They over water things.  They dig where they're not supposed to, and they move dirt to where it doesn't belong.We got two of these as gifts for my girls and they are super cute but they are plastic, kind of junky and clunky, and let's just face it - kids young enough for this to be suitable are NOT going to garden - truly - and kids old enough to garden deserve better tools.Even just for plain old fun digging in the dirt - kids deserve better tools.

"I've had a corded Toro trimmer for the last 6 years or so.  Initially it had one of those bump and grind line feeding thingies which drove me stark raving mad so I replaced it with this grass gator thingamajig which took pre-cut lengths of thicker, green-twizzler looking line.  It worked great.  I bought a huge spool of the line and cut it myself and have not had to buy line again in all those years.Now...  this could partly be because I hate trimming so much that I don't do it as often as I should.  I tend to do it when things really look bad, or when company is coming.  While the trimmer itself works great, lugging all that cord around, switching outlets, having it come unplugged randomly, having to wind it all back up again in the end...  drives me crazy.I keep thinking about a gas powered trimmer - but the maintenance scares me.  Reviews of the cordless electrics have tended to be hit or miss.  But we have had a 36v B&D cordless lawnmower for a few years now and I am very happy with it so since this new version of the 36v cordless trimmer came out I thought I would give it a go.I just used it for the first time and am very happy.  It doesn't feel like it has quite the oomph of my Toro, due to the single thin line vs. the dual twizzler line, I think - but it whacked through everything I needed it to.  Things were pretty bad this first time out as I've been neglecting to trim for weeks - have mowed the grass 4 times or so this season but not trimmed at all.  So I am going to have to wait for stuff to kind of dry up and blow away to see what I missed and give it another go.  I tried to keep it no more than 3 or 4 power while using it, though.  You can adjust a dial from 1 to 6, the higher it is the more power you give it - which means you drain the battery faster.  According to my husband using it on the max setting a lot will shorten the overall battery life - so while I try it out and make sure I like it I want to be sure it does the trick without having to kick it to max power.  I had it on 2 or 3 for a good portion of the time and was able to get through everything I needed without cranking it to 6 - though I did have to spend a little time on the thicker stuff.It has a safety trigger which is a good thing - you need to push in the little button, then the big button.  Works well.  (I whacked my ankle last summer so I appreciate this!  One of those fluke things)I think my biggest concern is how fast will this blow through line.  Since it feeds automatically, you don't really have a feel for how much line you are using.  It will take a few uses to figure out how much line it eats.  I can say the autofeed feature seems to work just fine.  I was scared of having to use the bump and grind method again - I was really torn between giving up the grass gator and not having to drag a cord.  I'm glad this has the auto-feed feature.  It's WONDERFUL not to drag a cord.  I can whack everything - anywhere in the yard - and then go back and get spots I missed - without it being an ordeal.  I hate it when I realize I missed a spot AFTER I put the cord away.  With this it will be no biggie at all to just go and get that spot.We have a 10,900sf lot with a garage all the way in back of the property - so I have a long driveway to trim, some planter boxes in front to trim around, swing set to trim around, mail box half whiskey barrel to trim around, fence around back yard to trim - fair bit of trimming.  Battery was still going when I finished.  We ordered ours online from a big orange store and right now there is an online promotion to get a free 2nd battery - price is still lower than here as of this review  -I did not need a 2nd battery though.  Might be nice to have at some point, who knows.Now I am dreaming of the 36v cordless leaf blower coming out as blowing away the evidence of my work is another task I tend to put off because of the stupid cord.Very very very happy with this.  Can't say how it compares to gas as I have never used gas.  Lacks a little of the oomph of my corded, because of the grass gator replacement head, but it does what I need it to and the freedom of no cord is...  heaven.  Our yard is gonna look a lot better this summer.  Our neighbors should be pleased.  :-)updating to say I have taken it for a second run and it worked even better, due to no over growth.  I think it takes me about as much time to do my entire property with this as it did just to unwind and rewind the stupid mile of cord on my old trimmer.

"I got these thinking they seemed like a more respectable stand in for Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch which is my guilty pleasure cereal which I will hide from the kids and eat by the bucket once they are in bed.  The flavor is not as intense, and if you really compare the label, a 3/4 c. serving of each has the same grams of sugar.  The cheerios has 1 gram more fiber and none of the bad fat that the PPCC has but I feel like, given the trade-off of weaker peanut butter flavor, the increase in healthiness is very marginal.  They're also kind of pricey, for the box being so small.  (They're actually cheaper at my grocery store than on Amazon, but still have the ""how small is this box???"" thing going on)They're all right and I will buy them again if on sale or I have a coupon - but for what I hoped them to be, an honest to goodness healthy alternative to PBCC, they fall a little short.  If they could just oomph up the PB flavor a bit...If you really want a healthier version of PBCC, I think Peanut Butter Bumpers is the way to go - but they never seem to go on sale, grrr.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VXP14QJ99BQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VOOOPM#wasThisHelpful","R2VXP14QJ99BQM","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got one of these for Christmas.  My dad is one of those grandparents who hits the pre-Christmas sales at big-name toy store and goes completely insane.  Must have been a 2 for 1 Crayola deal as we got one of these and a ""doodle daisy.""  I could tell Doodle Daisy looked like a flop without even opening it but a bubble gun seemed OK so we held on to it, for warmer weather...Let me tell you, it was bad.  It was SO bad.  It was so bad I am kicking myself for not reading reviews and returning it as well but we have had such fun with bubble guns in the past, who would think to look up reviews on bubble guns?This seemed like a cool idea, being kid-powered - no batteries.  But it was very hard to get it primed and going, and once it did, the bubbles were so small.  My girls still seemed to like it, though.  They worked through the purple bottle without incident and then we switched to blue and I guess they got bored half way through and decided to unscrew it and paint the town...  or at any rate the deck, driveway, plants, lawn mower power supply, an unlucky watering can, and each other.And you know how Crayola makes so many awesome washable art supplies?This ain't one of them.I now have blue stained towels, clothes, and children's feet.And driveway, deck, etc.I tried putting regular clear bubble soap in this and I couldn't get it to prime - maybe the colored stuff is thicker or maybe I didn't try long enough?What a let-down.

"I have a regular ergo which I loved, and got a sport one thinking maybe it would be cooler for the summer.It MIGHT be slightly cooler for the baby, but I don't know.  For the parent, it's the baby part of baby wearing that is hot.  I can't say this helped much from my end.  If you are out for exercise and it is feasible - IMO it's best just to use a stroller.  Or if you are hiking, a frame carrier on your back will allow more circulation and you will both be cooler.  (Deuter makes a very comfy frame carrier)As far as a carrier, I loved this for carrying in the front.  I actually preferred it to the original, as it felt lighter and comfier - it is also very soft.  But I didn't like it much for a back carrier.  The waist band is thinner, and combined with the softer thinner material of the ""pouch,"" I just felt like it didn't support the baby as well.  There is also a larger unpadded region of the straps which made it seem the straps were more prone to be twisty and harder to get just right without another person to spot me, if that makes sense.  I used it for back carries with my daughters, who are now 4, and it seemed to work OK - but when I used it with my little dude who just turned 1, the stretch/soft/lack of support seemed more problematic.This is a good carrier for a front carry, especially if you JUST had the baby - the waist band is bigger, which creates a bit of a vanity sizing effect which is nice when you feel all shapeless and flabby.  But for back carrying, I just wasn't crazy about it.  The original performs better even if it is a little warmer.Both styles of ergo, IMO, share the common flaw of not being good for 2-8 month olds, roughly.  Early on my kids would froggy up inside the ergo, no need to use the insert (I found it more annoying than helpful)  Then they would begin to stand up and refuse to stay froggied.  I switched to a bjorn then, some people use a sling at that point.  Once the child was big enough to ""straddle"" I would go back to the ergo.  What age this is depends on how big or small your baby is, and how big or small you are.  I am fatter than I used to be and my 4th child is growing slower than my others, so the awkward gap for him was pretty long.  I know there are people who use nothing but the ergo from birth but for me, it didn't work so well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R181Z5KPLKDN2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PDLHNK#wasThisHelpful","R181Z5KPLKDN2V","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We are not gluten free but my MIL is.  I bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit...  and then never got around to making it.  We just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here, expecting mediocrity at best...  but it was surprisingly tasty!  It had a bouncy, springy texture.  We ate the entire loaf at one meal (with bean soup, which I keep wishing my kids would like, but they won't...  so they ate a lot of bread...) so I can't attest to its keeping qualities, but fresh from the oven it was great.  It smelled AWFUL raw so I was skeptical, but smelled good baking and tasted great.  I think I will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner.  And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.  I may try some of the tweaks suggested next time.

"I grew up in Pittsburgh which makes the Johnstown flood local (enough) history.  Oddly, though, I never knew much about it, beyond it was a really big flood.  A lot of water, people died, move on to the next page in the history book.  This is embarrassing to admit, in a way, because I am such a history nerd - but this was just not an event I knew much about.  I blame an adolescent disregard for other people's tragedy along with the general sterilization of high school history - to understand the entire thing it turns out you need to understand some pretty ugly dirt about some pretty big Pittsburgh figures.  We learned about the steel mills, but for whatever reason, we didn't really learn about this.I moved out West for 6 years after college and at some point, coming back to visit family, I came across this in an airport bookstore.  The title caught my eye, the cover picture caught my eye, I bought it...  and read it...  and re-read it...  It was an amazing book.  I can't tell you what the experience would be like for a non-native to the area.  I am unable to step outside of my own skin and pretend I don't have the attachment that I do.  A huge thing for me, living on the west coast, was just the feeling of home that many southwestern Pennsylvania words evoked in me.  Conemaugh, Cambria, Allegheny.  Pittsburghers are odd birds that don't always transplant well and that was a HUGE part of this book for me, words that reminded me of where I was from.  I know this is not going to apply to many people reading this review, but it will apply to some, and it plays into why I loved this book.  I think if you are local to the region, that will play a part for you as well.Beyond that - I just never knew.  And if I weren't from the area, maybe I wouldn't care as much.  But I had no idea how human selfishness and greed played into the flood happening in the first place - I assumed it was a natural event.  I had no idea how big names from Pittsburgh that many consider to be so benevolent played a role in it - though I do know other ways in which those particular Pittsburghers trampled on the lower class, so it was both surprising and not surprising.  And I had no idea just HOW horrific the event truly was.  This book paints a very clear picture.This book is historical fiction, but it still rings very true.  I later read the McCollough book, expecting to find this, that, and the other thing had been stretched and not really as it was presented, but it really rings very true.  It put a very human face on an unbelievable tragedy.  A few sex scenes that might make it not the most suited for a high school reading requirement, by some people's standards, but something I wish I had read and understood long before my mid-20s.  Definitely ranks up there with ""Out of this Furnace"" to give you a human perspective of the region's history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTBZHWXCWXA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ENBQBK#wasThisHelpful","RDTBZHWXCWXA8","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, the bar was pretty low.  I had been using a purple XL bummi's wet bag as a pail liner and it had seen better days.  I think a lot of things in the diaper world SAY you can put them in the dryer, but it's really better not to - and that pail liner was a testament to that.  So I got one of these to replace it.  Some ""sweating"" which seems unavoidable but for the most part, a year later, no leaks.  I wash it on hot and line dry.  Fits great and holds up great.  Will probably buy a second so I can finally get rid of that bummi's bag which I still use for back-up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SCIQWQ76U5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037NXP18#wasThisHelpful","R28SCIQWQ76U5Y","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a toy I can't put away.  Every time I try the girls get it right back out!  They don't really go through all the steps you can, they don't slice the cookies yet, but they love just to put them on the tray and put the icing on.  I love that the tray is velcro so the cookies don't slide off as they carry it around.  Cute little cookie play set, I wish I had had play food this awesome when I was a kid.  My only complaint is I wish the cookie tube was sturdy plastic instead of cardboard.  Cardboard is more realistic but I worry it will not hold up well in our house - even if the girls are super careful, which is unlikely, I'm sure eventually I will find the baby chewing on it, or someone will step on it, or something.  So a point off because it could be more durable in that regard.  The cookies, icing, knives, and cookie sheet are all great though.  It even came with a cute little oven mitt.

"I got this for my 3 1/2yo twins for Christmas and they LOVE it.  I went with this set over the ""deluxe"" because it was cheaper but the core pieces are, as far as I can tell, the same.  If you pay more you get the wooden box which stores everything, but I thought they'd get a kick out of keeping the ice cream in the carton in their toy freezer, and the other stuff somewhere else - it seemed more realistic.  Then I thought, we can keep the ice cream in the carton, and the carton and everything else in the box, and the whole thing in the freezer - but the box doesn't fit in their freezer (KidKraft wooden kitchen).  So have to figure out arrangements, not a huge deal.Other than the outer box being cardboard, I love how sturdy everything is.  The ice cream carton is sturdy plastic, I was afraid it might break easily before it arrived but it's quite sturdy.  I wouldn't stand on it but it should hold up to play.  The pick-up mechanism of the scoopers works great and it's easy to plop the ice cream on the cones.  It's super cute and very real looking. My only real complaint is the magnets could be a little stronger.  The scoops come off a tad too easily - and pretending to lick them is pretty difficult.  But my girls are having a ton of fun with this.  We will have to get the banana split set to add to it.  Definitely a winner of a toy IMO.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IKFF1FDL62NN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JLNUZI#wasThisHelpful","R1IKFF1FDL62NN","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know what it is about this simple little story, but it's a book I remember loving as a kid and now my kids love it, too.  It's just dated enough that the social history nerd in me finds it fun, but not dated enough that modern kids won't like it.  It would have been dated even when I first knew it, in the late 70s/early 80s - but I never noticed or cared.  The clothes on the mom and daughter, the coal chute, the smoke at the railroad yard - all part of yesteryear.  But the story endures.  Harry hates to have a bath so he buries his scrub brush and runs away, gets dirty, misses his family, and has to convince his family that he, now a black dog with white spots, is really their white dog with black spots.  Just a simple story about a dog having fun and a family's love for their pet.  I love that it's a board book, makes it easier for my girls to handle and I find it easier to read with a kid or two (sometimes three!) in my lap.  Not sure if the board book is shortened from the non-board version - if so, the gist of the story is here and we love it.  This is one I never tire of.

"My brother and I had this as kids.  I don't remember much about it besides it was a flip top head and you made teeth for it, so I can't say how the new compares to the old - but I remember we played with it a LOT.  My girls (3 1/2yo twins) just got this for Christmas and there's a lot of play value here - you make teeth, you put them in the gums, you drill the teeth, you fill the teeth, you can brush the teeth, you can even make braces for the teeth.  It's pretty involved.  Only complaint it when you mold the teeth the root part is pretty thick so it's not super easy to pop in the patient's gums, but otherwise it's great.  (You can squeeze it into shape a little, but it can be frustrating for young ones)  I think it's one of those toys that will last for a while because as your child gets older, they can get more intricate and exact with how they play with it.  Right now they're just making teeth and bickering with each other, but they seem to be having a blast.It comes with white, silver, and red play-doh.  White for teeth, silver for metal - but I saw the red and thought, well that's gruesome...  I thought it was for blood, for when you're cleaning.  Ha!  But my daughter pointed out, that's for toothpaste.  Ah.

"I thought this was the same set sold elsewhere but in a basic white box.  It doesn't light up or play music and it has few pieces - no fences, no cart for the donkey.  You can't always go by reviews because products can change over time - the description really needs to be perfectly clear that this is NOT the same set you will find elsewhere.  If you do a search odds are you will find a Christian book store type site selling the full sized set for less money than here.  It's not fair to give an assessment of price being in the thick of Christmas shopping - Amazon prices seem to change by the hour this time of year - but as of right now, Amazon is NOT the ideal place to buy this set.  Do a little searching and be sure you know what you are getting.

"I got these when my twin girls were 2 1/2.  I wish I had had these when my oldest was a baby.  With him I used prefolds and velcro wraps or nylon pull on pants.The thing about prefolds is they are easy, trim, hold a ton, and are cheap - but while the infant size is IMO nice and simple, once you cross unto the dark-blue serged premium size, they are just so bulky and annoying.  One solution is to sacrifice a dozen and serge a few inches off...  I don't have a serger, though.So.  The BG 4.0s on my girls were SO easy to use.  I loved it.  The only downside was they don't hold as much pee so it would be pushing it to last 2 hours - you will need to be very on top of changing with these, with bigger kids, especially if they are drinking a lot that day.  The ease of changing makes up for it, but if you will be out for a while or in the car - or napping - use a prefold or something else - for example the flips organic inserts hold a TON of pee, compared to BG.  (The flips stay dry inserts don't hold much pee IME - they make good night time doublers though)I am now using the BGs on my 8mo son.  He's a little guy and I really didn't like how this fit him till about 6 months.  He is still on the smallest size.  It's a little weirder to stuff them on the smallest setting, vs. the largest, but I have gotten used to it.  Initially I was unsnapping and resnapping for every wash but have learned they come just as clean if I leave them snapped, which saves a lot of work.  These will last a lot longer on him between changes, compared to my girls as toddlers, just because he is small and doesn't pee as much.I am SO happy they started to make these with snaps.  Coming out with snaps was what pushed me to finally try them.  I hate velcro chains in the washer and I hate how it loses its grip over time.  It also makes for a stiff fit. So far my stash has washed up great.  Some stains but I have not tried too hard to remove them since I don't really care since they're, well, diapers.  We have had some stink issues which were lessened a lot by a good thorough rinse before washing and Tide as detergent.  (I started out using Charlie's Soap and it didn't work well for me at ALL - but it works on clothes, so it's the diapers, not the soap...  I also tried Rockin' Green and was not impressed)  The cover parts look pretty much brand new, after over a year of use.I am also happy with all the bright new colors that they have come out with recently - I sold some of my old pastel and medium colors and bought some brights and they are gorgeous.  I used a color catcher in the wash the first few times but I don't any more and I have had zero issues with colors running.I have never used these as a night time diaper because I don't like how thick the middle of a pocket dipe gets with heavy stuffing.  But for quick and easy day time diapering, these are great.  The only downside is the cost - but they resell well, so that takes some sting out.  I'm using these about 40/60 with flips covers and prefolds, with my little guy.  I love both methods.  Quality is great and the customer service of the manufacturer is awesome as well.I have also tried the fuzzibuns one size on my girls and I felt like they were smaller - they were almost too tight on one of my girls.  The infant inserts on the FB were better IMO - more layers, but cut narrower - but the full size inserts did not hold as much pee.  SO the FB will work sooner, but not be as great later on. Overall I like these much better than the FB.  No plans to stop using them any time soon, but may sell part of my stash and buy some of the new colors they have come out.  Love seeing all the pretty colors hanging up to dry.  :-)  (I only ever line dry covers - inserts go in the dryer)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BIIISGMFKRZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VRGYT0#wasThisHelpful","R3BIIISGMFKRZK","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just ordered two of these - pink and purple - for my girls.  As of this review you will find pink cheaper from cloth diaper natural mom type sites.  Just fyi.  Purple is sold out almost everywhere with restocking being dicey before January.  If you find it odds are it will be priced high but if you want it that's what you're gonna have to pay if you want it for Christmas.  I was a little nervous reading reviews that some have the chest strap and some do not - the purple seems to be a new color so I am assuming all purples have the chest strap, but I think pink is being discontinued which makes it something of a wild card. Are they all old stock?  Are they still being made?  I don't know.  Our pink came today and it has a chest strap!  Still waiting on the purple, as well as Christmas to come to actually give these to the girls.  It seems to be well made and it's very cute.  How much use your child gets out of it will of course depend on how much your child likes it, which no one can really predict.  My girls are 3 1/2 and really getting into caring for their dolls lately, plus they have a little brother who I carry in a real-baby Ergo, so I am thinking they will enjoy these a lot. Everyone's mileage will vary but it is well made and newer versions DO have a chest clip.Updating to say purple has arrived and it has a chest strap as well so I am assuming all recently made ones have chest straps.  Now I just hope my girls like them and I don't find them trying to carry their brother around!  :-DI had thought about getting these last year but I think they were too little then, and I am glad I waited because I like the new color.  One girl likes purple and the other likes pink so it works out perfectly for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SUE83LCAX1RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UN4G0U#wasThisHelpful","R1SUE83LCAX1RL","A1XAYSI96X8YVH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XAYSI96X8YVH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this mattress because of an article I saw on the company featured in The Digg.  It was an impulse buy, because our 10 year old mattress is getting the two grooves from our sleeping positions, and I really wanted something that was a lot thinner than our foot and a half thick mattress.The bed arrived quickly, and when I pulled it out of the box and cut it out of its plastic wrap, it didn't take long to ""inflate"" up to normal size.  It was not stinky at all.  I didn't notice any smell at all.  The cover for the mattress is nice.  The mattress itself is just a block of foam.  It's nothing fancy at all.  We slept on it for 2 nights before deciding it was just TOO firm.  I like a soft, cushy mattress, this is true, but I'm a fit mid-30s woman and this hurt my joints.  I am a side sleeper.  My husband agreed that it was too firm, so we purchased a mattress topper for it.  Problem solved.  I would've liked to not have to get an extra mattress topper though, just to make it a comfortable bed.  So, while I do appreciate the cost is much less than a ""real"" mattress, I feel like for a slab of foam with a cover around it, $400 isn't too screaming of a deal.  But I'm happy now with my bed.  I got rid of the old outdated frame at the same time, and got a nice modern platform bed, and the whole set up is miles better than it was.So, the mattress is great, as long as you want a firm sleeping surface, or be prepared to shell out another $140 or so to add that last bit of comfort.Update:  The company has reached out to me within 24 hours of posting this review, and is doing everything it can to make me a happy customer, so I have to say, I AM a happy customer.  Good customer service is so rare these days, that I have increased my rating from a 3 to 4 stars, and would like to clarify that I do like the bed, once I solved the too firm issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFJAUAZ4FD1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRR8G4U#wasThisHelpful","R1FFJAUAZ4FD1R","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I searched high and low for a winter robe that was long enough (I'm 5'8"") to be mostly to the floor, was warm, cozy, soft, and wasn't ugly or terribly boring colored.  Surprisingly hard to find a robe that fit my criteria.  I love white, but it gets too dingy too fast.  Solid colored robes just looked so boring and plain.  This one was great.  It is synthetic material, but it's super super warm and super soft, so I just decided that I don't care.  This thing will warm you up!  It's on the large size, but not swimmingly so. I'm usually a medium, and the small/medium is absolutely fine.  I wanted something I could wrap around me, and I wouldn't want it to be any smaller than it is.  In a dress, you want something that fits well.  In a robe, you want lots of material to wrap around you.  It's not like it goes around twice, the front edges easily sit right at my sides when wrapped around and tied.  Just right.  It's just a great winter robe (no way can I use this in summer or warmer climes).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4XC6XR433FD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHQ4INU#wasThisHelpful","R4XC6XR433FD9","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a chronic scarf knitter (can't just sit there and watch TV at night, but don't want to have to do something that requires brain power or counting or following a pattern).  So, I'm always buying yarns to make a thousand scarves with.  This yarn is soft (I have used similar that has too much wool in it and is scratchy on my neck and around my face), and the color transfers are only a few inches long at most, unlike some ombre yarn that you have yards of one color before it transitions to another color.  It makes a scarf not stripy looking, but speckily colored, and it looks nice.

"Not all curly hair is created equal.  Many of the reviews on here are from people with thick coarse hair who need moisture for their curls and have found love with Devo Curl.  I have naturally curly hair, but it is quite fine and thin.  I love the curl and always wear it curly because it gives my hair body, which it badly needs.  So, let me preface this by saying I do just fine with normal shampoo and conditioner and daily washings.  My main complaint with my hair that I am looking to alleviate is greasiness.  My hair cannot go longer than 24 hours between washes without looking greasy.  I have tried a couple of times to train it to be washed less frequently, but I just couldn't do it.  My scalp just produces too much oil, and if my hair is ""trainable"" then it is going to take too long of a time commitment while suffering horridly greasy hair for me to weather it.  So, I was hoping this product was a stepped down solution from washing my hair with regular cheap shampoos every day.  I've been using Devo Curl for several days now, and am pleased with the results.  My hair looks nice and clean after washing it as directed.  The sudsless nature of it doesn't bother me, as it was expected by the product directions.  I note that by the end of the 24 hours between washings, it looks a bit more greasy than it does with normal shampoo, but I shower in the mornings in order to activate my curls every day, so that is not a deal breaker, and with longer use, it may even get better (if so I will update this review).  One additional mention:  I dislike the smell of 95% of hair and skin products that I have tried.  I don't want to smell fruity or perfume-y, or really anything at all most times.  The smell of this is heavenly.  It smells like a high end salon, but not in an overly chemically way.  You may not like it, plenty of reviews on here complain of the smell.  But I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH3XD7HZJ6KVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045OR410#wasThisHelpful","RH3XD7HZJ6KVM","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The truth is, these glasses break easily.  They are delicately made, and light as a feather, and sometimes I have to screw the screws back in as they tend to back out sometimes on the nose pads, with a spot of superglue to hold them in there better.The reality is, my husband won't wear any other kind.  He has several sturdier pairs that sit in the cupboard unused because he hates them.  He gets frustrated with these glasses breaking, and then buys other kinds of glasses, and hates them all, and ends up going back to these ones.  He's not a delicate man, and he doesn't treat them well, so we find ourselves replacing them every couple months.  But these are $20 people, they aren't $100, and it's worth it to have glasses that you actually like to use when you have to cart them around all your life because you can't read anything without them.  This is one of those areas in life where it's worth it to spend a little more.

"I like this sweater, but with one big caveat, and one small one.  First the positives:  the color, detailing, fabric in the hood, the fuzzy inside, the warmth, and thumb holes are all great.  The big caveat is the material.  The tag says it is 88% polyester and 12% cotton.  The material is cheap feeling, and not soft nor pleasant.  When I first got it, it was lying on the bed when my husband came home and he said ""ooh, nice sweater"" and grabbed it, and then immediately said ""ew, I don't like the material though"".  It's bad enough that I don't reach for it all the time to wear like I normally would with a new item of clothing, because I just can't get past that material...  The other smaller caveat, is that I'm 5'8"" and the sleeves fit fine when I don't have the thumb loops deployed, but when the sleeves are stretched out to accommodate the extra length to my thumbs, the sleeves are stretched out to the point where it's not very comfortable, and pulls on my thumbs.  For someone with shorter arms, this wouldn't be a problem, but it's the bane of my life finding long sleeve shirts that hit long enough on my arms.  I didn't return the sweater, because I bought it to replace my favorite hoodie that the zipper busted on, and I was going on vacation and needed a hoodie for the cool nights.  But I probably should've returned it.  It's going to be something that sits in my closet instead of getting worn out with frequent usage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYC68YBNSL4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OVNYE6#wasThisHelpful","R2SYC68YBNSL4P","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I searched and searched for a pail that was the right size to use with the BioBag 3 Gallon Food Waste Bags that I use (in Portland, OR, we have to use approved biodegradable bags in our Waste Management compost bins).  I had been using a 10 qt Sterilite blue plastic pail for my composting of kitchen scraps, which was a great size, but not very pretty.  After my kitchen remodel, the blue plastic bucket sitting on the counter when I cooked had to go.  So, this one works perfectly.  It's small enough that the bags can be draped over the lip, but large enough to hold all that the bag will.  I then knot the top using 4 corners, and go dump it in the roll-cart compost bin.  Occasionally the bags ""sweat"" and there is moisture inside the pail after dumping the bag, but that's a function of the compostability of the bags, and a quick swipe with a paper towel takes care of that.  So, if you are looking for a good easy way to compost, this is your best bet.  (I did try to use a stainless steel trashcan that had a foot petal and lid, but I didn't want to have to use a foot or a second hand to pitch stuff.  Also, I fill my bucket up every couple of days at the max, so I didn't find I was having a stinky food problem.

"I've owned the black version of this wallet for about 5 years.  All my previous wallets have been cheap, department store brands (usually bought at Fred Meyer or Target), which wore out and looked ratty after a few months of use.

I recently bought a red one because I wanted to have both, to make it easier to find my wallet in the dark interior of my purse, and it is just as good, though I wish it had the coin purse pocket inside instead of the new cell phone pocket.  I just never use my wallet by itself so won't use the cell pocket.

"The plastic on this pizza wheel seems low quality, and cheap.  The metal blade is thin, and seems cheap as well.  Maybe I'm just comparing to my previous pizza wheel which was replaced by this one, which was overall much more sturdy and higher quality in general.  I don't know that this will last us years like the previous one.  The other thing I don't like is that when I put the handle in the dishwasher, it gets water inside that then will just kind of leak and dribble out afterward.  Maybe the handle isn't supposed to be put in the dishwasher, but I think a piece of plastic should be able to be dishwashed without any problem.  The less I have to hand wash in my kitchen the better.  I'll continue to use it until it dies, which may not be too long, but if I see a better quality one in the meantime I may just give up on it and replace it.

"I am a Patty Women fan, but this shirt just didn't add up for me.  I like that the material is thick, and stretchy, but one of the things that isn't obvious from the description or picture is that at hip level, there is a seam, and then a wide band (of the same material) that is double thickness that sits around your hips.  I don't like the line right there, with the added material for the seaming on the inside.  The shirt is less trim around the waist than other of Patty Women's shirts I have purchased, so it makes me look a bit thicker around the middle than I am, which is not what a girl likes to see.  I do like the color and material, so I am keeping it, but I don't pull it out to wear as often as the other shirts from PW that I have.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z1D3MNOUEHYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8NWJJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2Z1D3MNOUEHYA","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like a big purse.  I'm a mom and I want to be able to tote whatever needs to be toted.  This bag was huge though, and I just found it too cumbersome to use, so I moved back into an old purse after a couple of weeks.  A lot of the problem is, it doesn't look good unless the top is cinched closed at the top like it's shown in the photo.  If you leave the top open more for ease of use, it looks pretty lame.  When the top is cinched closed, it makes for quite a bulky lump of material that hits right below your armpit because the strap is not very long.  I like wearing a purse on my shoulder, and I don't want long straps for cross body purses, but the length of the strap plus the extra material right there made it unpleasant to carry around.  That plus it's overly large size made me stop using it, though I really wanted to like it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GU5AWPKP3P0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BL8JAAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GU5AWPKP3P0M","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought an XS for my 4 year old and a S for my 6 year old for soccer this spring.Plusses:1 - Super long.  Actually goes above the knees, and needs to be rolled down at the top or they look like ladies stockings.2 - Thick, warm material.  The material is thicker around the heel of the sock, and thinner on the legs.  It is also quite stretchy and stays up quite well.3- For thin legs.  My boys are skinny dudes, and these socks are plenty tight on them.  If you have thicker/more muscly legs these may be uncomfortably tight.Minuses:1 - Really too long.  I like a knee high to be long, but on my kids, these went halfway up the thigh and looked rather ridiculous, especially since my 6 year old felt they would stay up better when they were pulled all the way up and wouldn't let me roll the top down to just below the knee.  I'd rather a sock be too long, rather than not long enough, because these are able to be rolled down, so that's why I put it in both the plus and minus category.2 - Not very good quality.  It's rather okay for my kids who only have to wear them 8 - 10 times for spring soccer and then won't fit into them next season, so I'm not too concerned about it, but if I needed them to last longer I'd probably send them back.  The stripes on the top are uneven in places, like some kind of glitch on the sewing machine, which is no big deal, but speaks to overall quality of the production of the socks.  And when I wash them, they end up sprouting long strings at the top that I need to snip off.  So, these aren't good quality for long time use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDF7RIBOO3YNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OCAKJO#wasThisHelpful","RDF7RIBOO3YNI","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a total Patty Women convert, and this top does not disappoint!  It is super flattering, super quality, super warm for the winter, and my new favorite top.  I loved it so much I immediately got back on Amazon to order another color.  I wish there were more than 3 choices.  I found the cowl neck appropriately sized (I tend to like cowl necks, but some are just too much material and quite unwieldy).  The length is nice and long so that you don't have to worry about any bits hanging out over your low cut jeans.

"I've purchased several Patty Women tops, because they are amazingly priced for great products.  My main reason that I love them is that their tops are generally longer on the torso, so that I don't feel like I have to pull them down all the time (I'm 5'8"").  This shirt is not as long as others and is just barely long enough for me.  I like the design, material, and quality of the shirt, I just wish it was longer so I don't have to worry about it with my low topped jeans.

"I really like this jacket.  The sleeves are quite long, which excellent because as a 5'8"" girl, I'm always looking for tops that don't stop high on my wrist, and also hit low enough on the hips.  The length of the jacket is my only quibble.  Most of Patty Women's tops are nice and long (though not all), and this hits about an inch and half higher than I would like.  It is okay because with a long top underneath, I don't have to worry about my low cut jeans, but I do wish the jacket fit lower because it would look a bit better.

"This review is more for the company I ordered this from (Stuff With Attitude) instead of the actual shirt, because as the shirt has never arrived, I cannot speak to its quality.I ordered two t-shirts as Christmas gifts on 12/13.  Amazon indicated a delivery window of 12/9 - 12/24.  Figured it would surely arrive in time for Christmas.  It didn't.  I finally emailed the company on 12/28 asking about my order.  At that point, they told me that they are a small company and were 5000 orders behind this year and had a 12/12 cutoff for guaranteed 'holiday shipping'.  My problem is not that they are a small business that got overwhelmed, or even that they had a cutoff on guaranteeing delivery.  My problem is that they didn't inform me of this at any point, until I explicitly asked after it didn't arrive on time.  Perhaps they updated their personal website with that information, but Amazon was unaware of it, and nothing was updated here.  I surely would not have ordered from them if I knew it wouldn't be here for Christmas.  And today is 1/2, and the t-shirts still have not arrived.  The company's name is Stuff with Attitude, but the customer service rep I emailed was the one with attitude, and not the good sort.  My advice is to use another company for your needs.  It's sad when small businesses don't take care of their customers, because it just makes us go more and more to bigger stores who do work hard to keep their customers happy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJGGPB7BVZH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AP7SRVC#wasThisHelpful","R2RJGGPB7BVZH4","A31SCQ4Y538UA0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31SCQ4Y538UA0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Wild Wild West In The Deep South: The Second Seminole War (Native American History Book 2)  by Author Dwayne WalkerIt is not often that I read and review a history book but this interesting and action packed short story based on the Second Seminole War certainly grabbed my attention right from the onset. As a Canadian, my knowledge of American history is sorely lacking but I have always held a innate curiosity when it comes to our North American Native background. There are many similarities to be found between both the United States and Canada when it comes to our common history in our dealings with our oldest ancestors.The Seminoles were considered to be part of the ""Five Civilized Tribes"" along with The Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee people. Three of the tribes put up little resistance when it came to being uprooted and moved to Indian Territory as designated by the U.S. Government. However, while the Cherokees tried to engage in a legal defense, the Seminoles chose to resist this huge endeavor by using force against the powers that be. The process of forcing these tribes to relocate became know as the ""Trail of Tears"". President Andrew Jackson was instrumental in carrying out this mass exodus and his motives are unclear and have been discussed by numerous historians. Regardless of his reasons, ""he was succeeded by a string of one term presidents who continued his policy in regards to Indian removal in the Second Seminole War.""This well-researched book is definitely worth reading. It is relatively short but filled with plenty of historical facts which many of us may not have had the opportunity to read about in our younger years. I, for one, am one of them. I commend Author Dwayne Walker in his efforts to provide this relevant historical data.Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte[...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WP71W5WN3F3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0181M1V74#wasThisHelpful","R2WP71W5WN3F3R","A1MCV6FTU0785D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCV6FTU0785D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harry Lane is Innocent by Author J ScaddonThe cover says it all...an innocent man is condemned to death by hanging for a crime he did not commit. Harry Lane is a simple-minded, gentle and eager-to-please boy, in a twenty-three year old man's body. He wouldn't hurt a fly if his life depended on it. He has many typical childhood fears such as fear of the dark and creepy insects like spiders. His size and mental deficiencies defy the gentleness of his nature. Harry is the subject of much taunting and ridicule by children in his neighborhood in a quiet London town in the late 1940's.One unfortunate evening when Harry is out running an errand for his loving father, he crosses paths with the likes of the devious and petty criminal Douglas Fields, in Hunter's Park. Unbeknownst to him, Douglas Fields is saturated with alcohol and primed to commit a crime...any crime that might fall onto his path. Peggy is a student on her way home from the local bar. Her parents' house is not too far away and she has walked this very path many times before tonight.  She has enjoyed a lovely evening with her friends and now she is about to walk through scenic Hunter's Park...The events that ensue in this suspenseful, legal thriller are mind-boggling to say the least. Unpredictable and well-written, Author J Scaddon takes his reading audience on one heck of an emotional roller coaster ride. I could not put this mesmerizing and somewhat haunting novella down. Haunted by the possibility that this could actually be a true story, I finished reading it last night and woke up thinking about it this morning.

"I think this book is both well-written and informational. It adequately explains the types of exercises i.e. calisthenics, isometrics, and cross training techniques needed to enhance bodyweight training. This guidebook also targets specific areas of the body that require the most work and the physical activity necessary to accomplish the best overall results. In my opinion, as these workouts are described, I think it would be beneficial to have some basic illustrations to demonstrate the suggested physical activity.I like the concept of doing exercises within the comfort of your own home without the use of expensive equipment or costly gym membership fees. The accompanying diet and caloric tips give a realistic view by stressing the fact that it takes more than one life style change to achieve the desired result of a healthier body. The suggestion of ""cheat day"" also makes these goals more attainable.

"Wendy's Wacky Dogs: Fun Rhyming Book (Rhyming Books 1) by Authors Hadas Korb and Ortal ZeretAs a former elementary school teacher, I can very much appreciate this well-written educational tool aimed at entertaining young children. I always enjoy books that are written in rhyme but I especially like the idea of leaving out the last word so that children have the extra learning opportunity to fill in the missing word. I utilize this teaching technique often when reading to my grandchildren even when the word is provided. This concept requires more concentration and thinking on the part of the child in order to fill in the blank. Therefore, children automatically pay more attention to the story being read to them which further enhances their enjoyment and learning experience.The bright and colorful illustrations provided by Shiela Marie Alejandro really add to the reading pleasure by giving the child the visual clue to help them out if need be. Wendy's wacky dogs are a delightful group of entertainers who provide additional assistance for children to readily discover the missing rhyming word.

"Fireflies: Finding Light in a Dark World by Author Heather Gordon-YoungI agree with Maya Angelou...""There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.""Fireflies: Finding Light in a Dark World by Author Heather Gordon-Young is simultaneously heart-wrenching and heart-warming. I was deeply touched by her words and disclosure of her experiences as she openly shares her intimate journey with her reading audience.  Her older brother Jimmy....with a fragile psyche, scarred by an abusive childhood experience, is forever wounded and unable to overcome his inner torment. Trying his best to survive, at a young age he turns to alcohol to mask his suffering and ease his pain. As the author so eloquently states...anxiety and addiction usually go hand in hand. This proves to be the case with her much loved brother.Heather, spends her early teen years and well into her twenties searching for answers, striving to love and seek help for this broken brother of hers.

"The Lawmen by Author Robert VaughanSome authors just have a knack for spinning an enjoyable tale and talented Author Robert Vaughan fits the bill. This is the second western novel that I have read and reviewed penned by him and it definitely makes me want to read more of his works. I like his down-to-earth style and descriptive ability when it comes to relating a story. I was able to easily visualize any scene he described. I find this technique to be a very enjoyable reading treat. Not all authors are as gifted in this area. At times, I've skimmed over such passages but I did not do so in ""The Lawmen"" as they added so much to the storyline.The setting....Risco, Texas in the late 1800's. Every couple of years, arch political enemies...John Carmack and Charley Dawson, alternate in the role of being Sheriff in this small western town.

"The Errant Flock by Author Jana PetkenThe setting...the small town of Sagrat, Spain in the 15th century when the Spanish Inquisition sparks fear into the flock who goes astray or the ""converso"" who are practicing their religious beliefs in secret. Heretics of the Catholic Church are tortured beyond human comprehension. An era of historical shame perpetuated by the Holy Office during the reign of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.""The Errant Flock"" by gifted Author Jana Petken, which is based on these horrific events, has a credible and authentic ring to it despite its fictional genre. The wealth and scope of her well-researched background information demonstrates the author's painstaking efforts to bring the atrocities committed on many innocent believers to light in present day times.  In my opinion, she manages to do exactly what she hoped to accomplish as my feathers got rankled by the mere thought of what took place in ancient times. I am incensed and outraged by these abhorrent activities as if they are still taking place today....that's how descriptive and precise the accounts are of what occurred so many years ago.David Sanz and his family become victims of Duke Luis Perato strictly by chance. The Duke's young, insane wife is unable to give birth to a healthy baby. He needs an heir and desperately seeks to find one by involving David Sanz in his wicked scheme. After the Duke's unprecedented request upon the innocent militia officer, David Sanz's life nor that of his family, is ever going to return to normal. One extremely painful event after the other befalls the Sanz family. The horror of their infliction is beyond words. David Sanz, victim or villain?

"Inspirational Quotes: 365 Quotes for Daily Motivation by Jonny Fox  (Editor)If there is one kind of book I have a penchant for...it is one that contains inspirational quotes.

"Meditation for Beginners: 5 simple steps to boosting confidence, creativity and relieving stress by Author Jonny FoxThis is the second self-help book that I have read and reviewed by motivational Author Jonny Fox.  After reading 7 Steps to Self-Confidence: Become Fearless, Bold and Resolute within 30 days , I was quite eager to read more suggestions in other areas of this author's expertise. The tips on how to build self-confidence really hit home for me. Now the positive guidelines on meditation techniques and the ""gift"" of learning to live in the present add to the previous foundation of positive thinking.In, ""Meditation for Beginners: 5 simple steps to boosting confidence, creativity and relieving stress"", Author Jonny Fox delves into the positive philosophy and benefits of learning meditation techniques. He stresses that it will take time and perseverance to fully capture a meditative state but it is well worth the effort. The results are profound once the mind can decrease the ""inner chatter"" and learn to settle into the mode of ""mindfulness"" rather than wasting time on mindless and unproductive thoughts.The first step in achieving these positive results is to start with the art of proper breathing. Choosing a quiet time of the day, preferably early morning, will help set the pace for a more relaxing, stress free, and hopefully more creative existence. Although, these steps may seem easy to follow, the author encourages the beginner who hopes to glean from the benefits of meditation to be patient with themselves. The desired results will not take place overnight.  He emphasizes on more than one occasion that it will take time to establish a rewarding and beneficial period of meditation on a daily basis.I fully agree when he concludes that ""mediation is an insightful life practice that works at transcending you to a state of inner peace and acceptance"".  Learning to ""accept and love"" who we truly are is definitely the foundation for all good things to come. As in the first book, Author Jonny Fox writes from the wealth of his own experiences. In doing so, he gives well-thought out and authentic suggestions based on the positive results attained in his own life. In other words, he is the living proof that what he suggests in his guidebooks actually works. He obviously believes in a ""do as I do"" philosophy in life which is a trait I truly admire and respect.Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores AyotteUp The ""Down"" Ladder: Simple Ideas to Overcome Depression","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TED1GJLK4BGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010IZ5STY#wasThisHelpful","R3TED1GJLK4BGI","A1MCV6FTU0785D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCV6FTU0785D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"7 Steps to Self-Confidence: Become Fearless, Bold and Resolute within 30 days by Author Jonny FoxI could very much relate to this self-help guidebook for more than one reason. First of all, I am also an inspirational author and I have written quite a few motivational books myself. However, more importantly...I have also experienced the negative consequences of lacking self confidence and the debilitating effects of extreme shyness. Both of these personality traits have a huge impact on an individual's life and it is very difficult to overcome this type of personality without making the strong decision to do so as stressed by Author Jonny Fox.Making that decision is the first step on the road to improving one's confidence and building self-esteem. I like the down-to-earth, honest and open style, as well as the helpful hints provided by this author. He willingly shares his own experiences in dealing with extreme shyness to better educate others on how to build self-confidence. In other words, he can relate to his reading audience. He offers helpful suggestions in order to enable others to conquer the fear of being in the limelight or by caring too much about what other people think.He admits it is no easy feat and at the end of each chapter, Author Jonny Fox gives easy-to-follow daily exercises on how to improve our self-image. According to this author, using positive affirmations and becoming more fully aware of how others treat us are positive steps in the right direction. If we are surrounded by people who put us down, it is pretty hard to have or develop self-confidence. I also agree with his suggestion to step outside our ""comfort zone"". I particularly like Chapter 6 ""Fake it 'til you make it"". It reminds me of a quote I came across in my reading travels...""if you play the part long enough, you cease to be the hypocrite"" (source unknown). In my opinion, becoming all that we can be starts with playing the part.I am still a ""work in progress"" and Author Jonny Fox's tips help remind me that I must stay the course.

"A Love Story for a Nation by Author Mark W SasseIt is almost impossible to adequately express in words how moved I was by ""A Love Story for a Nation"". The plot of this incredible tale sent shivers down my spine on more than one occasion. Author Mark Sasse is one gifted writer. The depth of his ability to connect with the characters in his stories which permeates through to his readers, to those of us clinging to every word he pens, is beyond description. I'm a huge fan...plain and simple.This suspenseful novel is more than a love story between two people celebrating their first anniversary. Gerald and Rosia Sanpatri share a much deeper connection. Gerald is a banned award-winning author, a former university professor, a man of great brilliance with strong revolutionary opinions...who now lives a mundane and repetitive life as a bank guard at the A.S. National Bank. For personal reasons, he has chosen to keep his past life a secret even from his beautiful and devoted wife, Rosia. Little does Gerald know that she has secrets of her own which are about to tear his heart apart...As both of their past lives come back to haunt them, Gerald Sanpatri decides to take a firm stand to combat his love, his loss, his feelings of betrayal, but most importantly his deep love and devotion for his nation. With a simple smile and the desire and determination to make a difference, Gerald makes the decision to ""stand firm"" with a never ending smile on his face.

"Along the Way - Book One - Welcome to Alberta! by Author Teresa SchapanskyAs a former elementary school teacher, I must say that I am very impressed with this well-written educational children's book. Author Teresa Schapansky sets the pace for a pleasant and fact-based journey for school aged children.In ""Along the Way - Book One - Welcome to Alberta!"" children are introduced to Albert, a fun loving, adventurous Albertosaurus (aka Albert) who is about to take his reading audience on a thrill of an educational tour. He is happy to introduce his friends Jade and Ben. Their story unfolds as their mom and dad explain to them that they could possibly be moving because their dad is looking for a new job. After their initial trepidation, Jade and Ben embrace the idea of this new experience with a more open mind and look forward to making new friends while still keeping in touch with their old ones.A month later, when they actually do move, Albert kicks in again to explain the background, many points of interest, and the surrounding geography in and around their new home town in Alberta. The ""enhanced text"" really adds to this educational experience. A double tap on the bold word further explains or gives a more in depth description of Albert's effort to educate his young readers on such concepts as the seven continents,  Canada...its provinces and territories, as well as explaining about plant and animal fossils just to name a few. With some history of the French Voyageurs and the sights to see along the Yellowhead Highway, Author Teresa Schapansky does a fine job of touching base on several other topics.  This book offers many further learning opportunities. The illustrations are great and add to the reading pleasure and better understanding of the varied teaching goals.I really enjoyed this children's book and look forward to sharing it with my grandchildren!Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores AyotteGrowing Up & Liking It","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZHI7FV99NQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE5YXX6#wasThisHelpful","RTZHI7FV99NQF","A1MCV6FTU0785D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCV6FTU0785D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's Time To Eat: A Children's Picture Book for Early/Beginner Readers by Author Helen H. WuI really like the cover of this children's book. It is both bright and eye-catching. The picture of Marcus Monkey sitting in his high chair immediately tells the age bracket that this book will appeal to...he is definitely a toddler or of pre-school age.Monkey Mom has prepared a delicious meal for Marcus but he is refusing to eat it just as we know all little children do at one time or another. Ms. Wu uses the contents of Marcus' meal as an opportunity to teach her young reading audience how to count...""One guavas, two bananas, three cherries, four grapes, five pecans, six raisins"". She also creates the opportunity for the children to identify these fruits on a well laid out plate.When Marcus chooses to play rather than to eat his meal, he goes out in search of his animal friends. They are all busy eating their own meals as he quickly discovers when he first stops by to visit Pauley Pony who generously offers to share his meal of fresh green grass with him. A third learning opportunity arises as Marcus calls on each one of his friends. All the animals offer to share their meal with him and the young reader sees what each animal eats...from straw, to acorns, to bamboo branches, to worms and so on.""It's Time To Eat"" is a delightful children's book with plenty of teaching tools...counting, identifying fruits, identifying animals and their eating habits, as well as teaching the concept of sharing and appreciation for what we have to eat.

"The Case Of The Tattooed Buttocks: An Inspector Cullot Mystery by Author Alan HardyThis is the first novel I have read by talented Author Alan Hardy and if there is one book I enjoy, it is a well-written mystery. ""The Case Of The Tattooed Buttocks: An Inspector Cullot Mystery"" does not disappoint and is even more than I expected it to be. With a murder to solve, Detective Sergeant Watkins discovers that ex-Inspector Cullot is very much involved in this crime. Police Constable Blunt, the first to arrive at the murder scene, assists in the case by sharpening his pencil to write down every clue in his notebook/notebooks as the mystery unfolds. Blunt...is not the sharpest knife in the drawer or is he really as dull as he appears to be?Irony, humour, satire and a well-honed knowledge of the English language set the pace as Inspector Sergeant Watkins works in tandem with his former partner ex-Inspector Cullot. Their efforts to get to the bottom or should I say ""tattooed buttocks"" of the case is nothing short of hysterical. PC Blunt, as he takes notes, is eagerly lapping up the lesson on learning the differences between homophones, homonyms and homophobes much to the chagrin of Watkins.A mysterious murder of a beautiful blond takes place at Bounderdales, the mansion where the elderly oil magnate, Henry Barble, resides. His red-headed, sexy main squeeze, Miss Andress is constantly at his side. Seven suspects, female and male alike, are all at the top of the list of people to be interrogated but there is an unusual twist in the case. Ex-Inspector Cullot seems to have access to some very odd clues. Perhaps he is a suspect too. Purple or red knickers...what does he know that Watkins and Blunt don't?Wow....if you are interested in a very unique roller coaster ride with numerous twists and turns, you won't want to miss a word of this satirical detective/mystery novel. Very entertaining indeed! I may be tapping into my own puzzle solving abilities or sense of humour but I find the last name of the ex-Inspector quite comical. Cullot reminds of the word culottes...a female trouser-like skirt. Hey...I can't help but wonder if Author Alan Hardy and I share a similar wry sense of humor and he specifically chose this name to better describe the eccentric ex-Inspector Cullot. After all, Cullot does have an odd fetish and I think his name suits him well!Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores AyotteUp The ""Down"" Ladder: Simple Ideas to Overcome Depression","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REX4YBZOKPBWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TA1WAGM#wasThisHelpful","REX4YBZOKPBWB","A1MCV6FTU0785D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCV6FTU0785D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bed & Breakfast Bedlam (A Logan Dickerson Cozy Mystery Book 1) by Author Abby L. VandiverI very much enjoyed this good, clean, and unpredictable mystery novel. Logan Dickerson is a young archaeologist who is following in her mother's footsteps. However, she has a long way to go before achieving her mother's great reputation and level of expertise. Logan decides she wants to make a name for herself by uncovering proof that the Maya may have once migrated to Georgia...""at the Track Rock Gap to be exact"". These ruins are considered U.S. government property with obvious signs stating that there is no trespassing allowed. These signs seem to have the reverse effect when it comes to Logan.Although, usually a person that knows how to follow rules, Logan decides to take a gamble and cross into the ""KEEP OUT"" turf. While there she gets caught red-handed but manages to escape or so she thinks. The next morning, when she decides to clear out by leaving her motel bright and early, she discovers an FBI agent at the front desk asking questions about her. Logan manages to sweet talk and lie her way out of his questions when he catches up to her in the parking lot. She adamantly denies  knowing anything about the break in and states that she is on her way to Stallings Island to investigate another dig site. Little does she know that the FBI officer comes from this exact neck of the woods.To keep in tune with her lies, Logan heads out that way. Soon after her arrival, the whole ball of yarn starts to unravel. While there, the murder of Gemma Burke takes place at the Bed & Breakfast Inn where Logan is a guest. The owners of this quaint establishment are the two daughters of 89-100 year old Ms Vivee...no one seems to know her exact age. Irregardless, Ms Vivee decides to play Nancy Drew with Logan as her partner in crime. Ms Vivee, a spunky and intelligent old lady is full of opinions and is determined to solve this murder case. Before you know it...Bay, her grandson and FBI agent shows up at the B & B much to Logan's surprise. She thinks he has followed her there and tries to keep a low profile. This strategy is virtually impossible now that Ms Vivee, much to Lorgan's chagrin, is deeply involved in the case and on the move for the first time in twenty years...Author Abby L. Vandiver uses humor as well as clever witticisms and puns as she lets this mystery unfold. At touch of romance thrown in makes this fictional mystery novel delightful. It is easy to envision the main characters, Logan Dickerson and Ms Vivee, as this unique mystery novel takes its reading audience on a fun-filled fact finding expedition in order to locate the elusive murderer of Gemma Burke.

"Peter: Darkest Fears - Dark Poetry (Peter: A Darkened Fairytale, Vol 9)by Author William O'BrienThis is not the first book that I have read and reviewed by talented Author William O'Brien and I'm sure it won't be the last. Once again the reader is entertained by being drawn into the dark side of life filled with vampires, ghosts, and haunted souls. Just looking at the mind-boggling and spooky book cover indicates exactly what lies between the pages of this well-written and eerie compilation of Dark Poetry for the adult reading audience.Vampires eating bodies, tasting blood, and leaving behind a trail of fear are enough to send shivers down your spine. Catching a glimpse of the ""Undead"" is also enough to leave a lasting impression.

He states, ""What could be more tasty, and lusty for that matter, than a vampire novel set in France just before the great depression"".Author Simon Oneill has expertly penned one such novel filled with the dark adventures of vampires, witches, and demons. The graphic descriptions of the torturous experiences faced by Delicate Rose are both nightmarish and hellish in nature. The main question is ""can Delicate Rose rise above her hopeless situation and free herself from the macabre cloud that surrounds her?"" This is a well-written novel by talented Author Simon Oneill.

"The Faces Of Struggles Such As Cancers Are On The Journey To God's Glory! by Author Alfancena Millicent BarrettWhat a wonderful testimony to God as provided by Author Alfancena Millicent Barrett! While reading her inspirational book, I felt like I was sitting across the table from a dear friend whom I was getting to know better.She shares her life story with both openness and honesty and manages to draw the reader right into her life and the many challenges she encounters along the way. She starts at the very beginning as she explains her genetic birth defect. With her requiring corrective surgery, she is taken to a rehabilitation center at a very young age. Alfancena is a very positive and upbeat person who is easy to love and embrace.I enjoyed hearing about her life in Jamaica before she moved to the United States. She shares her family history and her relationship with both her mother and father as well as her siblings. The love and devotion she still feels toward them is heart-warming. Her faith in God sustains her through any and all hardships that she faces including cancer and her treatment. I can truly identify with the expression she uses to describe her life and her writing endeavors...she states that she is vessel for God`s Glory. Inspirational Author Alfancena Millicent Barrett has touched the lives of many people and as observed in the one of the final chapters, Contributions From The People God Placed In My Path On This Journey...relatives and friends in Christ have also touched her life in a very profound way.  In Chapter 16, she pens words of love to her readers to ensure that they take care of themselves and listen to their bodies.

"The White Light by Authors Peter and Pattimari CacciolfiThis is not the first fictional novel that I have read and reviewed by this talented husband and wife duo. However, the theme of ""The White Light""...although certainly enjoyable, is quite different from their other books. Tessie and Toni have been friends since childhood and spend endless hours together. Toni purchases a book called The Wizard from a local bookstore and manages to convince Tessie to join her in making a wish. They write them down and place their folded slips of paper in an old desk as instructed in the book. When Toni suffers from an unexplained coma and near-death experience, neither of the girls realizes it has anything to do with their earlier wishes. While in the coma, Toni can hear everyone around her but is unable to respond. She also sees an incredible white light but resists the temptation to draw closer to it. Instead she returns to her old life.Both girls go about furthering their education and eventually pursue successful careers. They forget this silly childhood indulgence for a number of years. However, some time later, Tessie and Toni decide to go home to celebrate Christmas together with their families. While there, they have a frightening, unique, and somewhat eerie experience. It is as if they have been catapulted into another era that only the two of them can share. There are more odd and scary occasions to follow. They therefore decide, along with Toni's boyfriend Bob who has also had a near-death experience, to revisit the past and read The Wizard one more time in order to discover exactly what is happening to them and why...Once I started reading, I couldn't wait to see what happened next!Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores AyotteI'm Not Perfect and It's Okay","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6EG5JH0HC89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4BTDZA#wasThisHelpful","RD6EG5JH0HC89","A1MCV6FTU0785D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCV6FTU0785D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hundred Year Clones: The Warlords of Andromeda by Author Dean C. MooreThis Sci-Fi epic novel is the second book in this series but as of yet I have not had the good fortune of reading the first. However, it is quite easy to get caught up in the gist of things without having done so. Author C. Dean is a talented author with a well-honed and creative imagination.In ""The Hundred Year Clones"" he continues with the epic battle between good and evil which in many ways mirrors some of the activity on our own earthly planet.  This saga is mind-boggling and stretches the imagination to new levels. As one reviewer so adeptly states, it is...""a tale of rebellion and revolution as ordinary humanoids, now spread across galaxies, struggle against a corrupt system"".  The million dollar questions are...who can stop the corruption and plundering taking place?  Who has the power to prevent the stealing and looting happening or quash those who are taking advantage of the weaker planets?  Will Dargan, a hundred year clone, have the courage and wherewithal to fight the war of all wars...?This novel is suspenseful, thrilling, and very difficult to put down. If you enjoy Sci-Fi action-packed adventures, you won't want to miss a word of this well-written series.

"Hot Mines - A Contemporary Bad Boy Romance (Good Girls Love Bad Boys Book 1)""Hot Mines"" is not your typical, fictional, romance novel, at least not from my frame of reference.

She watches as the conveyor belt goes round and round with no sign of her missing suitcase. As she looks up, she catches the eye of the most incredibly handsome man.

Apparently, his luggage is missing too and...this Greek god of a man decides to take her under his wing as he handles their problem. Amber is totally intrigue yet somewhat stunned as he efficiently takes over. Kyle, introduces himself to her and decides to abandon the idea of taking a cab to his hotel. He surprises Amber by sitting in the seat across from her on the train commute home. They enjoy each other's company and eventually exchange phone numbers. Amber doesn't really expect to see him again but...Author Nelly d'Este takes her reading audience on a emotional and steamy roller coaster ride as the romantic relationship between Kyle & Amber unfolds.

Gifted Author Laura Hodges Poole utilizes personal stories from her own life and the lives of others to inspire her reading audience. I can see how she has been very influenced by her father and the love, respect, and admiration she feels toward him.

"Pregnancy Nutrition: Before, During, & After Eating Tips by Author Cathy WilsonFirst of all, I really like the cover of this helpful guidebook. In my opinion, it is very eye catching and appealing to a pregnant mother.  Secondly, if there is one thing I enjoy about non-fictional books, it is the fact that the author speaks from experience and that the book is well-researched and documented. Author Cathy Wilson certainly fits the bill in this regard. When she states in her preamble to the book that ""I'm not Perfect....but I'm REAL"" she really hits home for me. She is the mother of six children and it is obvious that she has done her homework when it comes to the nutritional advice she gives to women for the before, during, and after pregnancy periods. At the end of several chapters she also includes some personal thoughts on her suggestions. An added bonus to this helpful book is the ""Sample Pregnancy Menu"" found in Chapter Eight. The pictures at the beginning of each chapter also positively add to the reading experience.Although I am well past my child bearing years, I have a daughter who is expecting a baby and I will be happy to share this information with her.

"This case is designed for people who ski, kayak, climb, or hike, and it made in a very rugged fashion to be sure that the user's phone is protected if it gets dropped or splashed around in the elements.  For this reason, the case offers top notch protection.  For those looking for an every day case that easy to handle, this X5 isn't the one you're looking for, but it's clear this case isn't meant for that.  Be sure to research what you need, but this case is fantastic as far as protection goes.You can read the basic specs on the product page, and there's no reason to believe it doesn't hit these standards.  I'm not about to drop my phone in to a lake to test its merits, but just gripping the case in my hand makes it obvious this phone is the real deal.  The case easily snaps on and off, and the stratoshield protector works just fine.Ports are easy to access, and the sound coming from the sound doesn't suffer from the thick casing.  The one drawback of this case seems to be pushing the buttons on the casing -- they don't seem to reach the phone all that well, and response can be missed at times.  In my opinion, a thick case like this that is designed for lugging around outdoors on hikes and stuff needs to be thick enough to prevent damage, so I'm not all that surprised that getting the buttons to react can be a bit of work.This case is pricey, but again, it's designed for certain needs.  This isn't an everyday iPhone case you'll be carrying around with you to work and to school, this is a case that's designed to take a beating, and in that regard, it hits all the necessary points.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N9PLCXZDINHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015F9MKBC#wasThisHelpful","R2N9PLCXZDINHB","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This clipper works surprisingly well!  I was a little skeptical in regard to how it would hold, but it turns out to be quite a plus to have to deal with a longer handle so you can reach the harder to get to places.  The clipper comes with nine different adjustment sizes, so it will work for anyone at any hair length.  The blade is strong and quiet, cutting close without pulling, and with minimal noise.  It also will continue to run while it's plugged in which may sound like a no-brainer, but there are plenty of shavers out there that won't.I'm knocking it down a star because the price of this kit is a total mystery -- I've looked all over the internet and found absolutely nothing about its price.  If it's priced between 40 and 50 dollars, I'd give it a full five stars, but anything above 50 might be asking a lot.

"The presentation with this tin is nice, and what's inside it is even better.  The combination of all the elements make a really tasty treat here, and it would work well is an opener-type gift for the holidays, or even a stocking stuffer type present.  It's presented in a tin can that could easily be reused, and the candy itself is super good.  You can read the ingredients for yourself, and I for one am glad there are no nuts present here -- nuts always ruin a good treat in my opinion!  It holds a good amount of sweets inside, and you'll be snacking off the contents for a good while.

It looks pretty amazing and whips along at high speeds no matter if you're streaming a movie, or using an app.  The colors are vibrant and it pops off very nicely.  You can view the memory for yourself in the specs page, and it handles itself every bit as strongly as my iPhone does.I'm using this as an extra phone with my AT&T plan, and as a phone it works just fine.  Calls are strong and signals are good.More than anything, though, the screen on this baby makes it every bit worth the 200 dollar price tag.  It's simply huge, and depending on your needs, could easily be used as a tablet.  I could certainly see someone buying this simply for the apps and video capabilities, foregoing the option of using it as a phone all together.  I have to admit that the build quality isn't nearly as robust as an iPhone or iPad, but if you care for this properly and don't drop it or sit on it, you could be using this for quite some time.I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I do, but I'm a convert now.

"This printer does everything it claims to, and does it quickly and efficiently.  I've had mixed results with Canon printers in the past, but this printer comes prepared with everything you'll need to do fast printing in quantity right out of the box.  Set up for Mac users could be better, but other than that I'm very happy with this experience.As I mentioned, I'm using this with a Mac, so I had to fish around Canon's website to find the necessary drivers and download them first.  Canon's website and support is nothing less than terrible, but luckily I figured this out and set up the printer after some troubleshooting and sleuthing.  In fact, the online manual instructed me to follow a certain protocol when setting up wi-fi for a Mac, and it was completely erroneous.  For those of you who aren't tech savvy, set up might be more of an issue.  Canon could seriously step it up in this regard -- it's 2015, is it that much to ask that the required updates are in the box?  And if they aren't in the box, maybe they could supply the specific driver site address where the drivers are instead of making customers stumble around their clunky website looking for clues?  The actual literature in the box says ""go online and find the drivers you need.""  Oh, really?Once I got the printer up and running, it prints perfectly and quickly via w-fi.  The machine seems to make a lot of noise pre and post print which is odd, but it works well, so no complaints.  The printer comes with all the print drums you need (there are four), and they are about half-yield drums, so unlike most printers that give you just enough to print about 20 copies before the well runs dry, you get a half charge here which is slightly disappointing, but still will last an acceptable amount of time before the need to replace them becomes a reality.  A full run of the four ink canisters will cost you about 75 dollars when it's time to replace.  It prints off multiple copies with ease with no hiccups or problems.The scanner works like a charm with no stalls or weirdness, as well.  I tried regular size scans as well as ID card scans and it all worked perfectly.  The copier is standard and works well, too.  Not a lot of head-scratching or detective work -- it's all very intuitive and works quite well.The touch screen reacts quickly and efficiently.  It guides you through the setup (much better than the manual and included CD-Rom does), and makes it very natural for the user to get to the next phase of whatever you need to get to.  Its error warnings are very useful as well -- I forgot to yank the ink drum cover tags off before printing, and it warned me that I needed to do so before continuing.  Always good to have a printer that's smarter than I am!This is an excellent mid-level printer for anyone with a small business that needs to occasionally print off a few sheets, or needs to print a large quantity in a short period of time.

"This is a very capable and handy wireless photo printer.  It's very easy to setup, and prints out the high quality photos it claims to be able to produce.First off, the printer is much smaller than I was anticipating, but this is a good thing.  It prints off 4"" by 6"" and 5"" by 7"", and the printer itself is barely even two feet long.  I wouldn't say it's 100% portable, but it would definitely be easy to haul it around if you needed to.  As I mentioned before, it's really easy to setup, and I had it up and running within five minutes.It's compatible with Windows and Mac, and the setup was a piece of cake with my Mac setup.  I'm using this wirelessly with my iPhone 6 and iPad 3, and have had no issues whatsoever with response times or setup with these devices.

"This is my second foray into the world of Lenox products, and both times I've been very impressed.  This is a very nice piece of craftsmanship giving off a nice glow without being too bright, and emanating a warmth that is sure to make your living room more festive for the holiday season.  The light is perfect and would look great on a mantle or window sill with all the other lights off, or even better, with nothing but Christmas lights up.  They are very solid to hold, and I can imagine these lasting a lifetime and handed down to future generations of families over the years.  Just a very pleasant and fun piece of art here.

"This is easily one of best bars of chocolate I've ever had.

"Having used several humidifiers with varied success, this Vicks humidifier is simple and easy to set up, and it works quite well with a cool little bonus.  It takes less than five minutes to assemble: the easy to follow instructions guide you through the process of wetting down the filter, filling up the water tank, and then letting it begin to work.  It's rally that simple easy, and the humidifier works well in a normal-sized bedroom.  It is a pretty small unit, so don't expect it to be effective in a large room.  The unit is relatively quiet to others I've used as well -- it has two speeds, and even the higher speed is quite quiet and soothing.  It acts as a decent noise canceler as a matter of fact.The cool little side addition is that it has a slot for the scent pads.  The unit comes with one pad smelling of menthol, and it's quite strong.  It actually tells you in the literature to not touch it -- that's how pungent it is.  They last for 8 hours, and they will fill up a room with a nice aroma without a hitch.  The scent pads are about a buck a piece, and in addition to the menthol scent, they also come in lavender (I would have much rather had that smell).In the end, this is a very nice humidifier which is right for the price, and wins over other similarly priced units due to the scent pad feature.

"Having used several bluetooth devices in the past, this is by far the best headset I've ever seen.  It's functioning power coupled with its features and price make it the best buy I have yet seen on the market.I'm not a big user of bluetooth in general, but the things I look for are comfort and usability, and this Eclipse has both in spades.  The first thing I noticed is how tiny and lightweight this thing is -- at first I thought I'd break the thing pulling it out of its packaging.  Once you grab it and put it on you can tell that its made very well and stays put which is a big plus in my book.  So many bluetooth sets I've used in the past shift around and never stay in my ear, and this one doesn't budge even one tiny little bit.I'm using this with an iPhone 6, and the setup couldn't have been easier, and the sound quality is outstanding.  It's pairing with Google and Siri is absolutely seamless, and you never even have to touch your phone if you choose not to.  Simply tapping the headset will initiate pretty much whatever you want to do including taking calls, and hanging up.I've seen some complaints about sound quality, but none of those reviews were using this with an iPhone 6 -- if you plan on using this with an iPhone 6, believe me when I say that sound quality does not get any better than what you will hear with the Jabra Eclipse.  It stands to reason that if you use a headset with an inferior phone you'll get inferior quality, right?  Make sure you use this with a nice phone that can compliment its features instead of some third rate piece of junk and you'll be fine.I'm loving this headset -- well worth the money!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y7BJB6T6OWWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EUQ492#wasThisHelpful","R1Y7BJB6T6OWWG","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Chamberlain garage door opener is highly functioning unit with cool features and operates very quietly.  It's a bit tricky to set up, but once you get it up and running, it's worth every penny.There are directions included for setup, but I found that each step of the process was a bit longer than it should have been.  I would set something, tighten a screw, or test out one of the features, and it wouldn't work.  It would take some unplugging, rebooting, or fourth or fifth tries to get things running, but once I shook off all of those technical cobwebs, everything started working great.  All of the different ways to operate the machine is what I find most useful about this opener which includes a wireless keypad, an LCD wall control device, two remotes, and of course an app you can download.  I'm using the app through an iPhone 6 and an iPad 3, and the app runs perfectly.  It's cool to get precise timings of how long it will take the door to open and close!  It also has a three-day battery backup in case the power goes out.This is also the quietest garage door opener I've ever heard in my life.  I should say, the quietest door opener I HAVEN'T heard as it really lives up to its ""whisper quiet"" tagline.  This opener is also compatible with Homelink, though I don't use that system and can't vouch for its effectiveness.I've tested the safety sensors, and they work very well in letting you know that an object is blocking the closure of the door.  All of the remotes are very responsive and work quickly.  It's worth noting that garage doors over seven feet high will require an extension kit.All in all, this is a very nice garage door opener that I can see myself using for a long time to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHLP02BIKCA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UGZYOM#wasThisHelpful","R3AHLP02BIKCA5","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having used several Panasonic hair trimmer/shavers in the past with varied results, I have to say this is the best I've used in quite some time.  It's slightly more pricey, but the features you get and high functionality definitely make the asking price worth it.The coolest feature is the trim length options, giving you 39 different settings which is more than I've ever seen at this price range.  It's also easy to clean thanks to the water draining system, and it works like a charm.  A full charge will last you an hour, and it comes with a 2-year warranty.The other things I like is that you can use it while you charge (many shavers won't let you do this), and it really does trim well.  I have a thick dense beard and typically I have no choice but to use a straight razor.  While this isn't going go supplant the closeness I get with a razor, this does get pretty close to what I need.

"This is a great case for your drone offering all kinds of side pockets and protection.  Even if you were desiring to use this for camera parts, computer accessories, or anything else that required extra padded protection, this case gives you a lot of options.The case is actually very compact and small, but that works to your advantage.  It utilizes space excellently, and the adjustable shoulder straps let any sized person conveniently lug around your belongings on their backs.

"This is the third or fourth Belkin keyboard case/folio I've used, and I find them to be easy to use and a cinch to set up.  I've never quite gotten myself used to the tiny keyboard, and always have felt they're a tad on the flimsy side, but for all intents and purposes these work rather well.  I also especially like this newer version that accommodates two devices at once.I'm using this with a third generation iPad, and a sixth generation iPhone, and have experienced no issues thus far.  It was super easy to pair, and toggling between both devices couldn't be simpler.  The keyboard is responsive and is highly functional from the get-go.The stands on these Belkins have always been a bit wonky for me -- the devices stay in place, but I feel like the weight of them is slightly pulling the entire keyboard backwards a bit.  Also, I don't think I'll ever be able to get used to the tiny little keys on the keyboard.  They obviously are smaller than normal, anyone will notice this, but I have bigger hands and it just never feels quite right to me.  That's a personal thing though, so I can't dock it for that.  The kickstand works fine and adjusts well enough.  I will say that these Belkin folio boards have always felt a bit cheap, and for 80 bucks they could perhaps step up the quality a bit.  Calling this a ""case"" is a bit of an overstatement -- you can fold the iPad down on top of the keyboard, but is that really acting as a case?  I think most people think of protection when they hear the word ""case"", and this isn't going to be protecting your devices at all.All in all, another functional folio keyboard from Belkin.  Construction is a tad wonky, but it works and is easy to set up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9E8LS7TQDSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102OA0JO#wasThisHelpful","R1L9E8LS7TQDSQ","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most of the reviews cover what this grill delivers pretty well, and I don't have much to add other than I've had nothing but success using this.  It's easy to assemble, simply to clean, and works just as well indoors as it does out.It is electric, so no charcoal or propane is needed here.  It's grill is 200 square inches and can accommodate 12 servings.  The grill plate is non-stick and has a highly functional temperature control feature for precision grilling.  To move the grill from outside into your kitchen, you you simply remove the unit from the stand and take it inside -- easy peasy.The flavor of meats and veggies I've cooked thus far has been perfect, and I have no complaints at all about this grill.

"...I really like these!  I can't really speak to the anti-fog factor, but these are comfortable, look good, and seem to be very durable.First of all, I have a big head and these fit perfectly -- the two ear-rest things sort of conform to any sized head, so no matter how big or small of a cranium you have these should fit just fine.  The nose stems and pads fit perfectly as well and I pretty much forget they're even there.  I have very light blue eyes and typically have issues with just a little bit of sun, but these block it out extremely nicely.  The only remote issue I have with these is that they don't cover your full field of vision.  The lenses aren't that big, so light or glare from below will be an issue if you're at all sensitive to extended periods of light exposure.  These also don't come with a protective case or bag which is a bit of a bummer.For the price of 20 dollars, though, these are a very decent buy if you're looking for some sporty looking sunglasses that work.  These also work well in the yard if you need to protect yourself from dust and debris, so I can easily recommend these at the current price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3KDK5P4U3OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTK0WRS#wasThisHelpful","R1S3KDK5P4U3OI","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using this lens kit for a number of days, I have found it to be more than worth the price tag.  It depends on what you intend to use it for -- and how picky you are -- but for the most part it acts and performs precisely as it claims.To be as straight forward as possible, this kit is extremely rigid and well made.  It fits my iPhone 6 perfectly, and never moves an inch during picture taking.  Photos are crisp and clean.  The case just slips onto the phone and the lens just pops into place where your camera lens is.  It works intuitively and easily.  This lens kit gives you 35% wider photos which pretty darn awesome if you're using your phone primarily as a camera.  This alone will be worth the purchase price for many.I've seen some grumbling about the fact this kit cannot slide on the phone if there is a case on it, but come on, how realistic is it that this would be a possibility with all the different sized cases out there?  I hardly think that many grounded people will find much room to complain about taking an additional five seconds to slip off your case to use this lens kit.  Hardly a deal breaker -- just don't be a klutz when you're handling your phone.I'm really enjoying this kit and it's giving me newfound interest in my iPhone 6 as a camera.

"I would have loved to own this as a young boy -- any excuse to run around the yard catching critters in a mini-vacuum, putting them under a magnifying glass, then placing them in a critter barn and looking at them again with another magnifying glass?  Sold!  As it happens, I'm a 43-year old dude who has a ton of use for this.  You see, my house gets a lot of little spiders marching through it, and while I usually just ignore the little arachnids and let them chill in the corner, sometimes I do not appreciate them crawling on my feet, dropping on my head, or otherwise just being present.  I tend to just catch them with a tissue and place them outside, but that's far from a foolproof plan.  I've scooped up a few already with this gun, which effectively sucks them up, puts them in a chamber, and holds them long enough for me to either put them out side without risking getting them on me, or throw them into the barn from which I can just dump them outside from there.When you pull the trigger it basically just creates a vacuum and sucks things up.  There is a flap in the chamber that also works as a magnifying glass, so when you're sucking things up, you flip the glass as to give the bugs room to fly into the chamber, then once you have the critter caught you flip the glass once more which acts as a barrier so the bug cannot escape, and also serves as a great magnifying glass.  If you want to put the animal into the barn, there is a hole on top of the lid that fits the tip of the gun, so you just put the tip into the hole and the bug slides into the barn.  The barn also has a magnifying glass with which to look at the bugs, and it also has an LED light to use in darker environments.  The gun runs on AA batteries while the barn runs on three of those little coin batteries, both of which are included.  I've seen some griping about the light on the gun being off-center, but it's straight and true for me.This is a blast to use for any age.

"I was given an extremely brief 16-page sampler of this book which will be 304 pages in its finished form according to the literature included, but what is included here is quite funny.  As most people will know, this book is based on the series from Wisecrack, a chain of Youtube videos that features Sparky Sweets giving his gangsta take on classic literature.  The contents of the book will include (and are not included in this sampler I was given):  To Kill A Mockingbird, Pride & Prejudice, Lord of the Flies, Romeo & Juliet, The Great Gatsby, Frankenstein, Moby Dick, Fahrenheit 451, The Catcher in the Rye, Crime & Punishment, Things Fall Apart, The Scarlet Letter, Invisible Man, A Raisin In The Sun, and The Color Purple.  Just seeing these titles that will be included has me laughing at where they might go with it.As I stated before, this is just a sampler for review purposes, but they do give a taste of what's to come with a few pages from Sparky's take on Romeo & Juliet.  Sparks breaks it down: ""Up in da swanky part of Verona, two hood-rich families called da Montagues, and da Capulets been beefin' since back in da day. Ain't nobody know why, but both a' dem gangs always walkin' 'round town, strapped up, just waitin' fo' a reason to start s***.""  The writing is peppered with funny little images of the characters from these stories with ghetto captions next to them which makes it even funnier.It's hard to give this a five-star review as this is only a sampler, but it's easy to extrapolate from the Romeo & Juliet chapter where this book will go with it.  The Youtube series is much better as seeing Sparky talk and all his mannerisms is part of the joke, but with the pictures and rhythm of the writing here, I can see people loving this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU1V30F2LV2YL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101873043#wasThisHelpful","RU1V30F2LV2YL","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not much of a foodie at all -- in fact, I have little to no passion about food whatsoever.  I do, however, love cookbooks that are creative, funny, and bring something new to the table.  As a video game and scf-fi nerd, I can wholeheartedly recommend this cookbook to just about everyone!The cover may be a bit misleading as it says ""unofficial recipes from Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and more"", but the real charm lies in the little video games and random homages to great and quirky movies.  For instance, the author's love of Zelda is on display in her opening self-illustration, and also dedicates a drink to the game as well (Lon Lon Milk).

The Snacks and Appetizers section is also fun with an Elder Scrolls tribute (Elsweyr Fondue), and Soylent Green, which looks awful, but actually doesn't taste all that bad!  There are also sections entitled ""Soups and Stews"", ""Entrees"", and ""Cakes and Cupcakes"".  This is the best of the lot with recipes based on Portal (Delicious Moist Cake), Bioshock (Creme-Filled Cakes), and my personal favorite of the entire book, 1up Mushroom Cakes inspired by Super Mario Brothers.I've only had the time to cook a few of these recipes, but what I have done taste pretty good.  This book is all about the presentation, though.  It also is clearly a homage to video gaming for than anything else, but movies make admirable appearances as well.  The pictures are very colorful, and most of the recipes are very vibrant, bordering on the electric, but hey, this is sci-fi and video gaming, right?  Kudos to the author for being creative and putting a very refreshing spin on a tired book subject.

"Alien Isolation really starts off well.  Despite a lame story and bad voice acting, the atmosphere created is very interesting as it sets up the surroundings with sharp graphics and cool sounds.  The first few hours of the game are the best as I was in constant anxiety that the alien (or some other hostile) was going to appear and try to take me out.  After about 5 or 6 hours in though, I wish I had just stopped altogether.As I mentioned before, the graphics and sound are top notch.  As you first emerge and your objective becomes clear, you start to hear thumping and banging in the vents, footsteps, and other sounds that cause some legitimate nervousness.  I was definitely tense playing the first few hours of the game.  The way the smoke billows out of the vents and casts ominous shadows on the floors and walls was great too, really building a weird atmosphere and feeling of impending doom.I love stealth games, and Alien Isolation is absolutely a stealth game at its core.  Those of you who want to be running and gunning should look elsewhere because this game is most certainly not that.  I enjoy sneaking and ducking, searching around quietly, ducking into a vent, or hiding in a locker.  It definitely set up a feeling of helplessness that contributed to anxiety.  Unfortunately, this is where the game stops at being fun or interesting.First off, the least interesting aspect of this game is the alien itself.  The game seems to stop following its own framework when dealing with the alien as it seems to teleport itself around the levels, and conveniently land right in front of you out of nowhere, when a split-second earlier it was on the opposite side of the level you're on.  It takes a lot of the tension out when the alien seemingly is some sort of god that can just appear in places at will.  Given how much you die in this game (oh yes, you will die a lot), there are laughably few kill shots as well.  The alien kills you over and over and over again, and you get to watch the same drawn-out and lame kill-cams every single time.  YAWN.  Another painful aspect of the game are the droids you have to fight.  They just lumber around muttering to themselves, and like the alien kills, will strangle you every time until you try and wait for the load screen to pop again.  Just tedious, man.  Additionally, trying to distract the alien with the given tools to do so (noise makers, for example) don't really work because you rarely have opportunity to use them.  The alien conveniently knows your general location, no matter how well you sneak, so when you attempt to throw something in the opposite direction to distract it, the xenomorph can hear you throwing it, and thus kills you.  There is no escaping the alien once it sees you, so after a while I just started ignoring the beast and creeped along hallways regardless of its presence.  I found that just blindly trudging forth and paying no heed to the alien's presence had the exact same effect than if I carefully hid and tried to distract it.  In fact, it seemed to facilitate my progression.  There were actually a few times where the alien literally landed from the ceiling vents right next to me, but didn't see me because it was looking the other way -- I was standing on its damn tail!  Therefore, in the end, I was left with the thought of ""what's the point of hiding and creeping?  Isn't that what this game is about?""  Yet another hair-pulling aspect is when you're in a situation where you have to use your hack tool, you have to give it your full attention, thus turning your back to the surroundings.  So before you use it, it's a good idea to examine the area first and make sure the alien does not appear.  In these situations, I would thoroughly examine the rooms for minutes, and after no activity, I would go to use the hacking tool.  Guess what?  Within 2 seconds of pulling it out, the alien would magically appear and kill me from behind.  I had so many ""oh my GOD, are you KIDDING me????"" moments I thought I was going to hurl the controller at the television.The most frustrating thing with Alien Isolation is the hilariously bad backtracking!  I can't express enough how much idiotic backtracking goes on in this game, and it's absolutely inexcusable.  In 1995 this would have been acceptable, but in 2014 it's just poor design and execution.  This game will SEEM long, but it's only because of the constant dying and endless backtracking you'll be doing to get to the next level.  The backtracking only gets worse as the game progresses as well.  During the last part of the game, it just utterly falls apart with having to cover the same ground, mixed with the game throwing every damn enemy at you you've seen during the game all at once.  There is a difference between a game that is challenging, and a game that arbitrarily changes the rules and makes you repeat actions in order to proceed: this game falls in the latter category.  The game makes up for a relative lack of content by just amping up the walking, sneaking, and treading old ground.  I was truly in disbelief during the last act when it's supposed to be the most tense, but instead I'm literally walking through hallways and being attacked by droids as if I was playing in the third hour of the game.You also have to endlessly pull levers, push buttons, ride elevators, and collect things to build, like SCRAP.  Because collecting scrap is a blast, right?  Ugh.  There was a part at the end of the game where you have to blow something up, and the game makes you run to one end of the level, then the opposite end of the level, then back to the other end.....I was actually laughing at the tediousness of it.  I ended up just wanting to finish the damn level to end the painful experience and move on.  There are also about 5 or 6 false stops to the game that are comical, not tense.  It's like, ""oh, the aliens are gone!  No, they aren't!  Oh, yes they are now.  Oh wait, no they're not!""  Stop it already!  It's just irritating.  Anyone who has seen ""Alien"" will not be the least bit surprised with any of the ""twists"" or ""turns"" of the plot -- they pretty much take the end of the movie and use it with the game as well, so there wasn't anything new or interesting happening.  The ending is, quite honestly, terrible.  You're pushing forward, pushing forward, pushing forward, then, a ponderous meaningless conclusion that ends in a millisecond.I guess the one thing that really got to me is the game was not scary at all in the long run, and there was no ultimate sense of ""isolation"".  Someone is always yammering away in your headset, guiding you through things, so you never feel truly alone.  The game works best when you're creeping around in hallways with noises all around you, but nothing to suggest that any human lifeforms are nearby.  The game sprinkles these moments throughout the game, which keeps you interested just enough to continue, but then it bashes you over the head with repetition and arbitrary ""difficulty"".  People who call this game ""hard"" are missing something major, and that is, this game is NOT hard at all.  It's packed with filler making it SEEM hard.  Just because you die a million times does not make it hard, it just means that the developers integrated unnecessary deaths into the game to extend the story.  And how is that fun?  It isn't.  Finally, what makes Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" such a masterpiece is that there is ONE single alien who lurks in the shadows, picking off people one by one.  It's the idea that there is one entity outsmarting the humans to finally take control.  At the end of ""Alien Isolation: it turns into James Cameron's version of ""Aliens"" with the creatures just bouncing off walls and screeching at you.  Not that I dislike ""Aliens"", but it's clear Isolation is trying more to be Scott's version, not Cameron's version.  When the two mingle, it just annoys.I was going to give this game three stars, but because of the last painfully tedious and repetitious chapter, it gets a two.  It completely fell apart at the end, had a lame and unsatisfying ending, and I was left with more annoyance that I pumped so many hours into an experience.  The atmosphere and tension have moments of true greatness, but the lazy writing, sloppy difficulty, and completely stupid backtracking cannot be recommended.  I feel like with the state of technology these days, and the relative ease with creating awesome graphics and sound, this is easy for developers to create in a game, and they did so here.  The challenging parts come in a game's playability and writing, and they failed miserably with these aspects.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9CE2RAK9BVRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I19TYW2#wasThisHelpful","R9CE2RAK9BVRN","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Skittles are delicious, flavorful, fruity, and fun.  Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that, the second I popped a handful of these into my mouth, the spirit of Marshawn Lynch possessed me and I spun out of all conscious control for approximately one hour.  I started tackling furniture, performing elaborate spin moves in my living room, and shunning the press.  I even sprinted down to the mall at top speed, breaking tackles the entire way, and bought myself some golden grills.  The grills are spectacular and encrusted with real diamonds, but the drawback to this is the Skittles get easily caught in them while chewing.  Eh, a small price to pay.  I did get a bit carried away when my 90-year old landlord (I call her ""coach"") came to collect the rent and I stiff-armed her down three flights of stairs in a moment of Skittles-induced hysteria.  As she laid in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs, I threw the bag of Skittles at her and said ""taste the rainbow"".  A rainbow appeared from nowhere and without hesitation, she rode the colors up to my third floor apartment with a unicorn and immediately gave me free rent for the rest of the year -- her breath smelled of mango tangelo, kiwi lime, and banana berry.

"I've been using this turntable for over three years now, and it's been an absolute beast that is as reliable as anything.  I highly recommend making some extra purchases with it (in fact, you'll have to), but if you do some research this player will last you a long time and be worth the time money and time you invest in it.I have a couple of Technics 1200's that I've used for years, and while they're the old trusty standard when it comes to djing, the Project Debut actually sounds better for mere listening purposes, provided you get the right head cartridge, platter, and pre-amp to go with it.  Quite frankly, the head cartridge that comes with this isn't bad at all, and features some very nice mid-range sound.  I upgraded my head cartridge to a Denon DL-110 and it sounds ever better -- magnificent sound all around.  I also purchased an acrylic platter which reduces hum and general noise that stock metal platter will certainly produce.  This is a must, but I highly recommend splurging on one if you want to best sound possible.  I have a Project Tube Box preamp which serves the rest of the parts very nicely as well.  With these added additions, the sound I get from this table is pretty phenomenal.  These extras will cost you an additional $1,000, but it's worth every penny in the end.  I primarily use this turntable to record my vinyl collection to Flac format, and the vinyl rips produced from this setup is some of the best I, and many of my audiophile friends, have ever heard.One of the things that does kinda suck is you have to pull off the platter to adjust the speed (change the belt).  It's a minor annoyance, but you need to do it nonetheless.  I have a lot of 12"" singles, so I do have to do it quite a bit, but once I hear the great sound I quickly forget about this trivial detail.If you can afford it, I cannot recommend this turntable enough.

"For you Depeche Mode fans out there who remember Martin Gore going on his vintage synthesizer-buying spree back when the band made the ""Sounds Of The Universe"" album, ""MG"" won't be all that surprising to you.  Picture a more brief, instrumental, and ambient version of that album, and you'll get a decent glimpse into what ""MG"" sounds like.""MG"" is a very solid effort of minimal and short vignettes into the mind of Martin Gore.  Some of this album reminds me of vintage DM going back to albums like ""A Broken Frame"" -- final track ""Blade"" has the same tone and vibe of b-side ""Oberkorn"" from the ""Leave In Silence"" single from 1982, which is no bad thing!  Gore is basically playing with his old toys on this release, and his production styles manage to be very tight, yet purposefully roughed up.  The overall feel is slick and updated, yet harking back to older and more rough approaches.  Some of the melodies and beats will undoubtedly please the more seasoned Mode fan, however, if you're the fly-by-night DM fan who only knows the hits, ""MG"" will assuredly disappoint you with its more experimental atmosphere.I've seen some griping about this album being too long, but in my opinion, it's entirely too short!  With 16 tracks totaling under an hour, this album seems way too short on ideas in the long run with pretty much every track lasting at three minutes.  The album would been more satisfying at this length with maybe 10 tracks lasting around 5 minutes per song -- as it stands, a lot of these tracks seem to end abruptly.  A lot of the ideas end up unrealized and rushed for my tastes.For the most part, ""MG"" is a cool exercise where Gore primarily tests out his walls of keyboards and comes up with a slightly retro nod to DM's quirky instrumental b-sides of the 80's.Quick side-note about the vinyl packaging: couldn't be cooler!  All the credits are stamped (not printed) into the gatefold jacket, and the inner sleeves are generic and poly-lined, guaranteeing your vinyl to remain in top shape as you slide them in and out over the years to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXH4WU3N5KIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6WUHSW#wasThisHelpful","R3JXH4WU3N5KIC","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've tried the spreads with the oreo cookies and graham crackers as recommended, and they are super good!I don't feel like it's too expensive as you're getting three full jars of this stuff, and it's presented nicely.  It gives you a little booklet recommending food to use these with.  I also tried dipping these with fruit (I used an apple).  Of course, the peanut spread with the apple is killer, totally love it!Live a little, people -- this stuff is great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZ0CNGAZGNO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZMCGW#wasThisHelpful","R3SZ0CNGAZGNO2","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case looks snappy and sharp and has cool colors to boot, and it fits very well to the iPhone 6.  Thats about all it offers, though, and the protection is borderline non-existent.  This is clearly a case that is made for looks and status, but do not under any circumstance purchase under the pretense that it will protect your phone.  I'm using a case that costs twice as less as this that looks snazzy and protects my phone very well, so there are certainly many more affordable options if you shop around, but again, this is all about the colors schemes.One thing this has going for it is it's very light and in no way bulky.  Lots of cases are lumbering and ponderous, making holding the phone a challenge, but this is super lightweight and easy to haul around.  Then again, that raises the question of why it's so expensive.  It's half leather, so maybe that's why?  I dunno.This case is okay.  Not worth the asking price for my needs, but perhaps someone else will find value here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R49F2EN2USL0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUYVMWI#wasThisHelpful","R49F2EN2USL0U","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not much to say here that differs from what the description says -- this just smells great!  The bottle comes with a pump outside of the bottle, so all you do is take the cap off the bottle, stuff in the pump, and you're ready to roll.

"Very nice looking, simple to install, and solid as an ox, this Brinks Home Security push/pull door is a strong investment.  All you need is a Philips screwdriver and you're ready to roll.  This is being used on a wooden garage door, and the installation was much more simple than I expected.  There are lots of parts and pieces, so from the get-go it can look daunting before you get started, but before you know, the thing is in place and working like a charm.This works on left or right handed doors, and you can pretty much turn the handle any which way and the door opens and closes smoothly.  It fits all doors 1-3/8"" to 1/3/4"" thick, and the latches fit 2-3/8"" or 2-3/4"" backset.The satin nickel looks very nice, and this is built for usage outdoors.  There really isn't much to say other than it's an easy installation given the plentiful and easy to follow manuals, and the performance of the set once it's installed.  I was concerned I'd be totally clueless installing this, but Brinks made it easy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXJQ8HSWZ4AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYRR7X8#wasThisHelpful","R2WXJQ8HSWZ4AO","A1KDUQ2HU0WD68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KDUQ2HU0WD68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have owned this blower for a little over two years. I also own several other 2-cycle engine products, so I understand that they can be a little finicky at times.Unfortunately, this one is beyond finicky, and it has at least one major design flaw.First of all, it is very hard to start. The instructions tell you to prime it at least ten times, an unusually high number. However, even after that, it always takes about 8-10 pulls before it starts. It then runs rather slowly and unenthusiastically for about thirty seconds.After that, it works fine.The big problem, and the reason for the low rating, is that about six months after I owned it, and after only about 8-10 hours of use, it started losing power, and became even more difficult to start. It also started dripping oil, something that shouldn't happen in a 2-stroke engine. After a little investigation, the problem was obvious: the cylinder head had come loose. This created a gap which reduced compression and allowed exhaust oil to ooze out all over the external parts of the engine. I took it apart and found the five torx screws that fasten the head to the block, and tightened them back up.A few months later, they came loose again, but when I opened it up to re-tighten the head bolts, I found that the force and vibration which resulted from the loose bolts had sheared one of them off. I don't have the tools to drill out the broken bolt and then re-tap the resulting hole.I repeated this process every few months, and finally a second ""bolt"" sheared off. (I should note that calling them ""bolts"" is a disservice to real bolts: they are very wimpy, very thin screws).So, bottom line, the build quality is horrible, and this product does not stand up to even moderate homeowner use. Get something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVDQ29XW7W7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YKSOH4#wasThisHelpful","R2PVDQ29XW7W7Z","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to replace the bulb in an old, original design Black & Decker ""snake light."" This light does not have a Mag-Lite-style focus mechanism. I did a before/after test, and there is no doubt that this bulb is brighter, but it also produces a broader scatter of light that, on my snake light, does not get focused into a tight beam. The reflector in this light is designed for the specific pattern of the older, incandescent bulb, and this light doesn't fit that pattern. Therefore, while more light is put out, the net effect, while brighter, isn't as spectacular as I had hoped.However, it is still a worthwhile upgrade, and the snake light definitely is now more useful (because it is brighter). So, it is a good upgrade, but falls short of being a fantastic improvement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MD5J0TY5CWZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HF8ICGO#wasThisHelpful","R3MD5J0TY5CWZO","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several All-Clad frying pans, including their amazing non-stick 12"" skillet. However, I've never owned any of their sauce pans.I needed a good sauce pan to use with my new Max Burton portable induction cooktop. This particular model is at the top of almost every cookware review as the best sauce pan you can buy. Cook's Illustrated has it at the top of their ratings. Sometimes these reviews are correct, and sometimes they are not.In this case the reviews are correct: this is the best sauce pan you can buy.It heats evenly; it perfectly transfers heat from both a gas stove and a portable induction cooktop; and it provides a beautiful, smooth stainless surface that doesn't interact with any food. The lid fits tightly for those times when you want to simmer for a long time without losing much liquid.My only issue -- and almost everyone mentions this -- is that the handle is too long. I guess this was done to keep it out of the heat, and also to let you easily get to the pan if it is placed on the back burner on a large commercial stove. On my more modest home stove, this really isn't needed. The long handle does get in the way of the faucet during cleaning.However, while cooking, the handle is not an issue, and the pan's cooking performance really can't be beat. This is a great pan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C1ECZA4YRSGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004T6M6CG#wasThisHelpful","R2C1ECZA4YRSGB","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was recommended by ""Cooks Illustrated,"" so several years ago I purchased one for myself. I already have a full line of Henkel's top-of-the-line knives, so I am accustomed to pretty decent blades. I was a little skeptical that a knife at this price point could be any good.When the knife arrived I was a little put off by the material used for the handle. The Henkel knives use a beautiful wood which is riveted to the bolster. This knife has some sort of slightly soft material that appears to be pushed over the top of the bolster and glued. I wasn't sure how well it would hold up.Well, I've had this knife for many years, and it has held up just fine. More important, it is a better knife in every way to my much-loved Henkel knives. It cuts better, retains its edge longer, and had great ""feel"" and balance. It is the only knife I use for vegetable prep and chopping, although it also works well for thinly slicing certain cuts of beef, like flank steak.I like the knife so much that I have purchased several for friends and family. You should get one too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2EIF0935FUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000638D32#wasThisHelpful","R1L2EIF0935FUY","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The design of this thermometer guarantees that it will fail. Mine did fail, and after it went kaput, I contacted Taylor and was told, despite what you read in the product description, that this product can NOT be used in a barbecue.Read on.I purchased this as a gift, and we used it for the Christmas turkey. Unfortunately, the unit kept turning itself off after thirty minutes, even though the temperature in the turkey was constantly increasing (it is only supposed to turn off if the temperature doesn't change over a thirty minute period). This ruins the whole concept of having a pager that will alert you when the temperature is getting close to the desired end temperature, and also beep again when it reaches final temperature.So, the first strike against this product is that it cannot be reliably used for anything that takes longer than thirty minutes to cook.Next, the temperature reading went up and down during cooking. This, of course, was not really happening because a large turkey does not get colder in a 350 degree oven. Why did this happen? Well, I read in the reviews here on Amazon, the response from the engineer at Taylor. I read this BEFORE I used the thermometer, and I knew that several other reviewers had the temperature vary considerably, and that the ""solution"" given by the Taylor engineer was to make sure the probe was fully inserted. So, that's what I did. For our turkey, I inserted the probe all the way down into the breast, away from the bone, all the way up to the large bend in the probe.However, the real killer, and the thing that ultimately caused the unit to fail and makes it completely unfit for its intended purpose, is that it cannot be used in the BBQ. Yes, you read that correctly. Again, I read the cautions from the Taylor engineer about making sure the probe wire goes through a hole in the BBQ and is not crimped by the hot lid. I did EXACTLY as he advised, ""snaking"" the the wire through a hole. It was not crimped in any way whatsoever.However, the probe wire melted, after just six minutes, at the point where it went through the hole.Now here is where it gets interesting.After the unit failed, I called the Taylor service line. The woman I spoke to was very helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, and nice. Taylor gets an A+ for good customer service. She could not have been any better. I told her my story, and she then said: ""that thermometer is not intended for use in a BBQ."" I then asked, thinking I had missed something: ""Do the instructions make any reference to this, or are there any warnings or cautions on the box or anywhere else?"" Her answer was no. What's more, I then returned to this Amazon page where the description states: ""For use in oven or on barbecue or smoker.""So, the whole concept of this product is to let you tell, at a distance, whether something you are cooking has reached the proper temperature. The BBQ is the one obvious place where this would be useful. However, it cannot be used in the BBQ -- even when following the advice given by one of the people who designed it -- without destroying the unit.Thankfully, Amazon has a great return policy. However, Amazon should simply not carry this product because ultimately they will get a lot of returns.One final thing. I purchased this because of the reviews at America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated. I am becoming very concerned about whether their testers are really doing the testing they claim to be doing or, potentially more disturbing, are being biased or influenced by certain manufacturers. I am now viewing all reviews from this source with a certain suspicion.I hope this helps!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M01UNY1A6VLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002E1AVT8#wasThisHelpful","R2M01UNY1A6VLH","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did extensive research on this two years ago when everyone was going hands-free. My main criteria was getting the best possible sound. The audio quality -- both for the person speaking and the person on the other end -- is absolutely awful with most cell phones. I wanted to improve that. Almost universally, this headset won all the reviews.I paid $99 two years ago, so the $69 price is a great deal.I'm sure you can get a much cheaper unit, but this product is awfully good. Of course if fashion or other considerations are important, this may not be what you want. It fits over the ear, rather than in the ear, and it has an actual microphone, unlike the ""jawbone"" earpieces that pick up vibrations from your jaw.I often cannot understand my daughter when she calls while walking down the street because of the wind and street noise. This unit has advanced noise cancellation technology that eliminates almost all background noise. I cannot tell if she is in the car going down the street at 60 mph, or in her apartment.I don't own a cell phone myself, but I borrow my wife's from time to time, and when I use the earpiece (I got one for her too), I can hear the other person much, much better than I can just using the cell phone by itself.Battery life has not been a problem either for my wife or my daughter although, like any Bluetooth device, your cell phone battery will not last as long when using a headset. When not using the headset, disable Bluetooth on your cell phone. (Just to be clear, this ""problem"" has nothing to do with this device, but is simply the result of the cell phone needing to use more power to transmit not only to the cell tower, but also to the local headset).Plantronics is an old-line company that has been selling professional headsets to telephone operators, both in the phone company and at corporate switchboards, since the early 1960s, and have made many of the headsets used by astronauts, pilots, as well as phone operators.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RUDTD8UDL2A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027FFZEW#wasThisHelpful","R1RUDTD8UDL2A3","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this meter to understand why my electric bill has become so high. I knew that I had lots of devices connected 24/7 that were each using small amounts of electric power, but didn't know whether that was my problem. Also, I have two refrigerators, but one of them is seldom opened. I didn't know if it was a major contributor to my problem. And finally, I have some devices that we use frequently which clearly consume a lot of power, like our television and home theater system, and I didn't know if watching that for several hours a day was causing a problem.The product provided answers to all my questions.What it doesThe meter plugs into a wall outlet, and then you un-plug the device you want to measure, and instead plug it into the meter. You immediately can see how much power the device is using at that moment in time. When you do this, you have to remember that some devices have a standby mode, where they are consuming some power, but are not consuming as much power as when they are being used. A good example is a TV set. It uses a little power all the time so it can read the ""on command"" from your remote control. Then, once turned on, the TV consumes a lot more power than in standby.So for many devices, you have to measure the standby power, and then measure the power again once the device is turned on.Almost any power meter can measure these two types of power. However what makes this particular meter so useful is that it can accumulate measurements over time, so you can figure out how much power a device will use, on average, over a cycle of many days. A good example of this is your refrigerator. You can wait until you hear it running and then plug it into the meter and read the power. I did this with the old fridge in our garage and found that it uses 248 watts while running. However, that is not a useful figure because, of course, any refrigerator cycles on and off during the course of the day. What you really need to know is how much power it uses over the course of 24, 48, or 72 hours. With the P4460 Kill A Watt EZ power meter, you can plug in an appliance, walk away, and come back in an hour, day, or week, and read the total amount of power used over that period of time. It is easy to then figure out how much power the appliance will use, on average, during the course of a month, and how much it will cost.To help you with the cost calculation, the meter lets you enter your energy cost in cents per killowatt hour (a figure you'll find on your monthly bill) and it will then tell you how much the appliance will cost per day, week, month, or year. This is pretty neat, although there is one flaw in this approach. The flaw is that PG&E (our electricity provider) has a multi-tier rate system where we pay very little for the first 90 killowatt-hours of electricity, then more for the next 30, even more for the next 60, and even more for everything after that. You'll have to come up with your own math if you want to figure out which rate to use. My solution was to use the most expensive rate because our bill always triggers the top tier (as I expect most people's bills will do if they own a home instead of an apartment). Thus, any new electricity usage will always be charged incrementally at the top rate.What it doesn't doThis meter requires that you be able to plug the device into the meter. This means that you have to be able to get at the plug and disconnect it from the wall. By contrast, you can purchase a ""clamp on"" power meter that only requires that you be able to access a wire that feeds the device, and you then clamp onto that wire, without disconnecting the device, and the meter reads the power by reading the induced magnetic field from the wire. This is a much more elaborate way of measuring power, and these devices cost at least ten times what the P4460 costs.The meter also cannot help you measure anything that is built in. Thus, you can't measure the power used by all the lights in your kitchen (we have a lot of track lights which are quite clearly consuming a lot of power, but I can't measure this with the P4460). The Kill A Watt also cannot measure 240V appliances like your dryer or electric oven.Summary -- Is It Useful?So, having used this meter for a few days, was it worth the cost and is it useful? The answer to both questions is a resounding YES! I was able to find out that the almost ninety devices I have connected to the wall in this house use enough standby electricity (the amount used when connected, but not turned on) to cost me almost $40 per month. Some of the whacko ""green"" people try to tell me that I should disconnect these devices, but that is not practical. Do I really want to turn off my Internet modem, my router, my wireless access point, my fax machine, my telephone answer machine, my portable phone, etc. and only turn them on at the instant I'm going to use them? I suppose I could, but it would make them far less useful, and would be a total pain in the neck.However, I did find several devices that used a lot more standby power than I would have thought, and which I CAN turn off. A good example is the furnace. During the summer, I don't need to have these connected (I actually have two small furnaces, instead of one large one). I had never bothered to unplug them. However, the P4460 tells me that they are using 13.2 watts of power, all day, all night, every day. I found that at my electricity rates, every 5 watts of 24/7 power costs me $1 per month. Thus, by unplugging the two furnaces I am going to be able to save about $2.25 per month for about four months of the year.So, I have identified appliances that I can disconnect, without greatly affecting my lifestyle, and by doing so, I can save money. I'll certainly pay for this gadget within the first year, just by doing this.I am NOT doing this to ""save the planet,"" because quite frankly what I do -- and even what lots of people like me doing the same thing -- won't make a hill of beans difference (take a look at how much electricity is used to create a pound of aluminum or roll a sheet of steel ...). I am an electrical engineer, and believe me, you don't change things by operating at the margins of the problem.Instead, I'm doing this because it is going to save money on my electricity bill. The cause may not be as noble as the fiction of ""saving the planet,"" but it is far more real and -- this is the whole point -- far more MEASURABLE!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11CNPKG3432N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RGF29Q#wasThisHelpful","R11CNPKG3432N3","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered a package of 24 60W Sylvania bulbs, despite the many reviews suggesting a quality control problem.Unfortunately, those reviews are accurate. The bulbs arrived totally intact (no broken glass), and the package was in perfect shape. Thus, I don't think there was a problem in packaging. However, because of the reviews, I tested each of the 24 bulbs. 10 of the 24 -- almost 1/2 of all the bulbs -- were defective. I could see the filaments inside were detached. In addition, each bulb had a different amount of frosted coating, and in many cases the coating was non-uniform.So, bottom line, these bulbs are junk, the product of incompetent manufacturing practices. Under no circumstances should you waste your time ordering these. I am returning mine for a refund, and will purchase light bulbs instead at 1000bulbs.com, bulbster.com, or bulbs.com, all of which I have used before, and none of which has shipped even one bad bulb. I don't blame Amazon for this, but I will blame them if they continue to sell such an obviously substandard product.[Edit]The day I wrote this review, I returned all these defective bulbs, and Amazon promptly refunded my purchase. Thank you Amazon! I then ordered several dozen bulbs from ""bulbs.com"". This new order included not only 24 incandescent bulbs, but also many, many other bulbs. I tested all sixty bulbs when they arrived an every single one tested OK. So, instead of 10 out of 24 defective units, I had 0 out of 60. This improvement was due to the fact that bulbs.com shipped quality product, and also to the fact that they did the most unbelievably wonderful job of packing that I've ever seen. My kids had a science project in eight grade where they had to design packing that would let them drop an egg from two stories up onto a concrete sidewalk, and not have the egg break. The folks at bulbs.com would have easily won that competition. So, if you can get things from bulbs.com through Amazon, then order your bulbs there. If not, just go to their site and order from them directly.[Edit #2]December 19, 2013.I have recently received several nasty comments on my review above. The people leaving these comments claim that I am working for bulbs.com because I mention that I eventually purchased A19 bulbs at that site and was happy with the product. You can look at my other reviews and should be able to tell that I am just another Amazon customer because I have reviewed many dozens of products and almost none of them are available at bulbs.com.Also, please note the date on my review. I wrote it in 2011. If you look at other reviews done around the same time as mine, you will find that many other customers were reporting serious quality control problems. More recent reviews seem to be more positive, so it is possible that the product has been changed, or the source of supply is different.So please don't accuse me of being dishonest. I do not represent any company or site, and have no hidden agenda. I simply reported, accurately, on my experience with this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TY7F9QJ8KHLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQPXFK#wasThisHelpful","R2TY7F9QJ8KHLH","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this bulb to use in an old photo/video lighting stand.First, as others have written, this bulb is extremely large. If you remember the old ""mogul"" base bulbs, it is even bigger than those. It is MUCH larger than the 300W incandescent bulbs that I was hoping to replace.Second, the light has an ethereal quality to it. If you have used any of the modern LED flashlights, perhaps you have experienced this feeling: the light itself looks bright when you look directly at it, but objects illuminated by the light seem to be dimly lit. I have heard that, with LED lights, the narrow spectrum of light is responsible for this effect. That is, LED lights supposedly only put out light in one part of the spectrum, so your eye is not receiving a uniform mixture of all colors from light reflected from objects receiving light from this bulb. I don't know if that is a valid explanation, nor do I know if this CF's color output is broad-based. I do know that if you want to use this light to actually be able to see things easily, you may be disappointed.The ballast runs very cool. The bulb itself gets moderately warm to the touch, but not hot.The color is supposed to be daylight color balanced (5500K). I do not have equipment to check that. My impression is that the color probably tends to be closer to the greenish blue of traditional cool white fluorescent bulbs. I am going to try to do some photography with it and see if I can get decent color. Unfortunately, because this bulb is SO MUCH bigger than I expected, I cannot use it with my existing lighting kit. It is my fault for not carefully reading the specs. To save you from finding these yourself, here are the specs: 10.5"" long and 3.9"" in diameter. Thus, it is ALMOST A FOOT LONG!! And, it is almost 1/3 of a foot in diameter.So, if the color balance turns out to be correctable (for photography purposes) this might be a very interesting bulb to use, if you are building your own lighting kit from scratch. However, for insertion into existing fixtures or kits, measure carefully before purchasing this bulb. And if you want to make a room appear really bright, I don't think this bulb is the answer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VK48ZS28NNJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019HZQPM#wasThisHelpful","R1VK48ZS28NNJB","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This program came bundled on my Dell computer a few years ago. Unlike Symantec/Norton Anti-virus which slows your computer to a crawl and is truly an evil program, PC-cillin does its job without causing your computer to slow to a crawl. It is relatively easy to configure.However, I have seven other computers, none of which has ANY anti-virus software. These computers have never had a virus. Guess which computer has had three viruses? Yes, the one with PC-cillin installed. I am a computer programmer, so I know how to spot a virus, and therefore I am quite certain that the other computer do not have any problems.The real kicker on this program, however, is the outrageous Trend Micro renewal policy. Look at the price for this program at the top of this page, and then go to the Trend Micro page and type ""renewal"" in the search box. What you will quickly find is that a one year renewal for this program is $79!! That's right: they are going to charge you almost twice what you paid for the program -- and do that every year -- just to get new virus patterns, something other vendors sometimes do for free.So, even though I was happy with this program when I first got it (because I was coming from the horrendous Symantec fiasco), I am now terribly disappointed because of Trend's customer-antagonistic renewal policy, and its rather poor ability to actually prevent viruses.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QXPTSBNTL9H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018EI3HY#wasThisHelpful","R2QXPTSBNTL9H2","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the desktop publishing business in the 1980s. Companies sent us their printers for evaluation. Since that time I have used or reviewed dozens of printers.Two years ago, a client gave me the Epson R260 so I could print on inkjet-printable DVDs that I was delivering to him.The one piece of good news is that, when it works, the Epson R260 makes beautiful prints on DVD discs.That is the ONLY good news.In every other respect, this is a horrible printer. I hate it.First of all, the CD/DVD tray jams constantly. I complained to Epson tech support and they sent a new tray to me (the jamming happened within a few weeks of my first use). The jamming continued.Second of all -- and this is unforgivable -- every time the printer has any kind of major jam or malfunction (which seems to happen about every 50-75 DVDs), it goes into some sort of reset mode which includes dumping ink. And not a little ink, but approximate 25% of the ink in all six cartridges. Now, I purchase nothing but genuine Epson ink, and in case you haven't looked, a complete set costs $80, plus tax. So each of these episodes costs me a twenty dollar bill. Just imagine every time you have any problem with your printer, you have to reach into your pocket, pull out a twenty dollar bill, and put it in the waste basket.I have own three HP inkjet printers (the P1000, P1100, & HP855C) and I've had them for years and years. They work perfectly every time, use very little ink, and are wonderful in every way.So, do not purchase any Epson inkjet printer, ever. Stay away! Get an HP or Canon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KKFIO9C7YSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I3IXLC#wasThisHelpful","R37KKFIO9C7YSY","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this product for almost five years. I used many other PC backup products prior to this and was impressed by the simplicity of the Trueimage interface, the fact that it would do both drive image backup (for restoring an entire partition) as well as file backup. It was also MUCH faster than products I previously used from Stomp and Seagate.Over the years, I recommended this product to dozens of friends and clients, and actually looked forward to the chore of backing up.But then, Acronis lost its way.Somewhere around version 9, the backups I created sometimes would not ""validate"" (a feature built into Trueimage to tell you whether your backup is going to be able to restore). And then, one day when disaster struck and I had to restore for real, I found out that the image backup of my boot drive was ""corrupt"" and I was unable to restore. Fortunately, I had another image backup that I had created a few weeks earlier and was able to use that.I then spent the next year working with Acronis tech support and posting on their forums trying to get an answer. What I found is that dozens and dozens and dozens of other people are having the exact same problem. Acronis tells everyone that it is due to faulty RAM, but everyone who has the problem goes ahead and runs the MEMTEST32 program, finds out that their RAM is perfectly fine, and are then left hung out to dry. (To be fair a very small percentage find out they do have a RAM problem, so this is not entirely a red herring - although it is pretty close to that).So, what you have here is a fantastic, dynamite product, with all the features, speed, and user interface you could ever hope to have, sold at a reasonable price, but with a fatal flaw that renders it unusable to a sizable percentage of its intended market.So go ahead and buy it (better yet, download the trial) and see if it works on your computer. Make sure to select the ""validate"" option so that you can tell if the backup you just made has any chance of being restored. If you get the message that the archive is corrupt, do NOT purchase this product because it is going to be nothing but a headache.The Acronis tech support people were slow, but ultimately responsive, and did try to help, but it has become clear that they know they have a problem, and that their engineering team is unwilling or simply unable to provide a fix to the flaws they have let creep into this wonderful program.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZFJHJUJ8MMMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VLZCEW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZFJHJUJ8MMMM","AK3PQZZ656VOD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK3PQZZ656VOD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased directly from the manufacturer.  It works as advertised.  It was very easy to install.Couple of points.Doesn't seem like you can play music on your local network at home.  Strange since the original Xbox and the 360 both could.  Perhaps there is an app on the way to facilitate this.Connecting to Netflix and Amazon online video services was very quick and easy.Took about 15 minutes or so to install Ghosts to the hard drive.  That's annoying because no one likes to wait.  But it worked fine and started and stopped quickly once installed.What's coolest is that games run as 'apps' basically so you can just switch right back to the home screen in about 1 second.  This is cool if you have kids that you don't need to be watching combat games or if the phone rings etc. it's like having a pause button built in.  The old system would have required you to quit the game.  This may not seem like much to non-gamers but it's really awesome in practice.Switching between apps on the Xbox is very, very quick.Connecting it was easy.  HDMI cable (buy them at Amazon if you need one longer than provided in the box), power cable, cable for the Kinect.  God bless HDMI.The kids loved trying to tell the Xbox what to do.  It didn't work well but was very entertaining as they tried dreadlocks and redsocks and hexbugs etc.  If you enunciate carefully it works great with the expected gimmicky behavior common to voice input.I had no problems with the disc drive.  Some have reported this to be an issue but wasn't a problem on my device.  The drive played games and bluray quickly.  Oddly it requires a bluray app to be installed but it took about 2 minutes to do this so no complaints.It's absolutely quiet in operation.  A soft white glow from the power supply is it.The revised controller is evolutionary.  Nothing really to report about it that is exceptional or problematic.Not much is a 5 star product.  On a ten scale this'd be a 9.  I think that because the XBone is so app centric that it will allow Msoft to improve it over time.

"Updated 12/8/2014One year in...This review is for the the no-ad 64 GB wifi-only HDX 8.9.I use a Galaxy S5 Android smartphone so the HDX is for media / web surfing / offline viewing for travel.  Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device.  Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion.  This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX.  You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out.  *** Edited 12/21/2013  You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device.  That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content.  +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX.  Also NOT the case.  So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption.  That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity.  You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device.  Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.  Many people will opt up for the 64 GB device like I did only to find that 16 GB would likely do fine since it would be hard to download enough content to fill 64 GB, particularly on 'standard' resolution.  As another commenter pointed out if you downloaded long movies in full HD perhaps you'd really want the bigger device.  Which brings me to the final point.The final criticism is that once you start watching content you have to finish watching the content within 48 hours or you need to reconnect to the internet.  Again, I was surprised to find out that the content I downloaded expired.  This is odd since you'd download because you were likely traveling to a location that didn't have wifi.  Hopefully these criticisms lead to a more informed purchase decision on your part.Here is the official word from Amazon which is indeed on their site and the purpose for my edit.  I was unable to find this prior to my purchase and learned about it only after I acquired the device.*  Many (but not all as I note above) Prime Instant Video titles are also available for download on Kindle Fire HD 2nd Generation and Kindle Fire HDX devices. The detail page for each Prime Instant Video title indicates whether the title is available for download. You can download available titles to only two separate devices at one time. If you have already downloaded a title to two devices, you need to delete it from one of them before downloading it to another device.*  You can have a maximum of 25 total Prime Instant Video titles downloaded at a time across all devices associated with your Amazon.com account. While not all Prime Instant Video titles are available for download, the same videos may be available for rental or purchase from Amazon Instant Video, and rented or purchased titles can be downloaded to compatible devices.*  Viewing Period: If you have a Prime membership or Prime free trial, you can stream any video that is currently designated as a Prime Instant Video title on its detail page. You can watch Prime Instant Video titles that you've downloaded within a limited viewing period, which varies by title. A typical viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the title or 15 or 30 days after the download, whichever is earlier. We'll typically notify you when the viewing period for a title is close to expiring. After your Prime membership or Prime free trial expires or is cancelled, you cannot watch any Prime Instant Video titles unless you've also rented or purchased that title.For about 9 months the camera on this device caused it to take weird pictures.  It seems that along the way a firmware update fixed the camera problems I had earlier so this should not be a concern for users who use their tablet to take photos.Amazon has made subtle improvements to this device over the past year.  It's not 100% Android compliant and doesn't always run YouTube videos very well.  Just hangs and you need to restart it.  Other times w/ the same YouTube content it works.  Weird.  The interface has been improved and it has been reliable for the last year as an intermittent toy.  This is the perfect device for a person new to tablets or heavily invested in Amazon Prime.  The Prime interfaces are outstanding and the device is intuitive and easy to use.  Is it better than an iPad?  It's different.  If you use Amazon a lot I'd give the HDX a try.  If you use Apple all the time, an iPad may be a better choice.  It's very personal and subjective.Amazon really owes it to their faithful customers who purchase these devices to continue to clarify the Prime download experience and this will be a home run.  I hope these comments help you ask good questions and help Amazon continue improve their product and content experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OSONR0PBKHU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLH6DSI#wasThisHelpful","R3OSONR0PBKHU6","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is something to consider if you are going to wear these under a helmet so be sure you can return them if that becomes an issue.  They are extremely light.  The optics are very clear.

"I've used this for a while.  I got a copy cheap from the Microsoft store years ago and actually used it to layout our house.At work I use it for making org-charts and I have to say that's a hit or miss experience.  Sometimes it works the way you want it to and others, not so much.It is highly advanced and probably a lot more so than most of us need.  I mean, do you really need to mess around with importing and exporting data into Visio?  I suppose you could if you had to update it a lot.The schedule thing is pretty cool to do a quick timeline and the calendar function is really great for making jumbo sized calendars assuming you're into that kind of thing.It's great for process descriptions or stepwise type routines that you need to put in a manual or a procedure.I'd say it's sort of the Swiss Army Knife in the Microsoft suite of software.  It can do a lot of cool things but also has tools that you might never use.Overall, it's really too bad you don't get this w/ Office Professional instead of Publisher as this is a much more versatile tool.

"I got a PS3 for Christmas as a Blu-Ray and regular DVD player.  I was an early adopter on the Xbox 360 and was SURE that HD-DVD would be the winning format.  History has shown that to be wrong.  Stinging from my poor decision, I waited it out and well, what the heck, adopted Blu-ray hoping that my purchase wasn't the start of some sort of Blu-Ray pandemic that would 86 yet another own-your-own-media format.  When it tanks, I'm movin' to Uruguay to harvest guano.However, I am one of the few people alive that can comment on the Xbox remote control vs. the PS3 Remote.  The major difference is that the Xbox control LIT UP.The PS3 does not light up.  Which really, is numb.  Oh sure it's Bluetooth but when we watch movies, it's not in a brightly lit room.  We're rockin' the home theater experience which means it's dark and you have to watch out that you don't inadvertently sit on a nesting feline.  The ergonomics are weak meaning that there is no real texture telling you that one button means play and the other stop or pause or fast forward or chapter ahead.  They are sized a whisker differently but really, why no lights?  Or even something that glows?  Or package it with a flashlight.  You're killin' me here.And I'm dying to know, what are the multi-colored buttons for?  Actually, that's hyperbole.  I truly don't care.  Someone will post that the buttons actually have an importance rivaled only by the discovery of the polio vaccine or fire but I could give a hoot.  I'd press these pretty buttons (they sure are tempting since everything else is blacked out) but in the event it somehow controls some behavior on the PS3 that would forever eliminate the color red from existence, I'm keeping my curiosity at bay.That said, when you can actually see the buttons it does work without any flaws and you don't have to wave it around trying to make contact with the PS3 as it's not an infrared signal from the remote to the Blu-ray.  And mixing Bluetooth with Blu-Ray is pretty awesome.  Not really but is it simply coincidence all of this bluish high tech stuff?  I think not.Anyway, Xbox remote which still works on my 6 HD-DVD's which will one day be relegated to ultra-high-definition beer coasters gets 5 stars.  Ho hum PS3 darkened remote gets 2 because it's of very little use in a darkened room and it has the potentially doomsday multicolored buttons.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FFGX80TRIOPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000M17AVO#wasThisHelpful","R2FFGX80TRIOPO","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own and game on an Xbox 360.  This is also used as our media hub.  I was an early adopter and was convinced that HD-DVD would be the wave of the 1080p hi-def own-your-own-media future.  Umm, no.  And MSoft is avoiding BluRay like the plague going so far as to call it a ""big bag of hurt"".  Ouch.  What to do?So I got a PS3 slim 250GB player for Christmas for the primary purpose of playing BluRay movies.It is a very easy installation.Be advised it does NOT come with an HDMI cable so if you order one online, be sure to also purchase an HDMI cable or 2 instead of getting it at the local stores that charge 3 to 10 times as much.  The PS3 does not supply even component cables which is a surprise in a way, but since not everyone has a modern TV I suppose you can see where Sony is covering the primary bases.I have mine running an optical connection out to the receiver; HDMI direct to the TV (Panasonic plasma).  The only reason for this was because I only had one HDMI cable at the time so this is jury-rigged but it works fine.It outputs at 1080p as advertised and is easy to set up.  You'll want your receiver manuals and TV manuals handy but it only takes about 15 minutes or so to rig it up.  My TV and receiver are pretty modern; both are only a year old so they can take full advantage of all of the PS3 digital gee-gaws.  Again, check your TV / receiver first to ensure they can match up to the PS3's digital hotness.  If not you may be chagrined to not get 1080p on your old TV etc.The PS will find your wireless network (if you have one) and connect to it automatically (unless you need to put in usernames and passwords etc.; then it's pretty simple to enter in your information and go).  You can also plug it into a typical CAT5 jack (those blue computer wires are CAT5) if you have one handy.  The internet connection is the way they keep the firmware of the Bluray player up to date.  This was an issue w/ early Bluray players.I was hopeful that it would play lossless .wma files like the Xbox does but it definitely doesn't like those files at all.  It sees them but won't play them.  This is a technical issue that you wouldn't really find by reading the PS3 box and probably isn't much of an issue except for geeks.  Geeks like say, me.As a Bluray player it works fine and is very quiet in its operation.  The Xbox sounds like a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin factory in comparison.  The image is very clear as you would anticipate and the sound is top notch.  It's a little bit of a mystery at first how to operate the usual play / stop / start modes with the little game controller but after dubbing around for a few minutes you can figure it out.  The game controller is a rechargeable unit so after the first hour or so you can unplug it from the mini USB charger that goes on the front of the PS3.Haven't tried Netflix on this yet.  On the Xbox it's seamless and easy; my understanding is on the PS you need a disc to insert and then you can play your 'watch it now' Netflix on the PS.  This is pretty cool on the Xbox as you can occasionally get hi-def content free w/ your Netflix subscription and download.  A selling point for the PS?  For some folks, sure.  Will increase the Wife Approval Factor which can be critical.As a media server, the Xbox seems to be better though it's way harder to set up the Xbox.  Perhaps because I had the Xbox set up already the PS could 'find' media files much quicker.  As noted though, it doesn't 'like' lossless format whereas the Xbox plays lossless .wma.  This is a big deal if you have saved your CD's to an external drive or something.  If you haven't done that yet and buy a PS3 then just be aware of the limitations in advance.  For most people this is a non-issue.As a standalone Bluray player it probably doesn't make sense in terms of its high price.  However, if you don't already have an Xbox but you do have some of your digital media (e.g. pictures / videos / .mp3s) saved on your local network and you don't want a lot of gear to play your .mp3 / iPod files on your stereo then this is a good choice.  If all of your stuff is in Microsoft formats, the Xbox is a better media server / erstwhile game unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGALDQQ1N7U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0J4VQ#wasThisHelpful","R1FGALDQQ1N7U3","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our son wanted a crane for Christmas so naturally we caved to his desires and picked up this sweet Playmobil crane.He spends a lot of time watching the Fred Levine series ""Little Hardhats"" with Rusty and George and is now into the boats / harbors / cranes.  That's a really good series in case you are curious.  We have used this to dodge the Wiggles and Barney so it's worth the $$.The crane is well constructed but I'm not sure how durable it will be over the long haul.  If it lasts a year I'll be surprised.  It's an indoor only toy.  The tower and arm of the crane are plastic trusses.  The crane hook is steel and goes up and down with the press of a button.  The crane arm rotates by pressing a button on the crane and the hook moves back and forth along the arm using a third set of buttons.The issue that I see is that if you pick it up and move it the electrical connections can imperceptibly pull apart causing some frustration on the part of the young crane operator.  You'd expect that this connection would be a more positive engagement and I was surprised it wasn't better.Otherwise it comes with two dudes who operate the crane, each with a tiny cell phone that will be vacuumed up shortly to the chagrin of the young crane operator.Everything worked out of the box as advertised, and as usual, it arrived on time and in perfect condition from one of Amazon's vendors.I would recommend this with the reservations stated above.  Our son doesn't share my concerns and loves it so from that perspective, ""mission accomplished"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37B7H4F1DEKU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002H7NYM#wasThisHelpful","R37B7H4F1DEKU2","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping for more from this but it was busy paying homage to the prior Terminator catch phrases and not focused enough on plowing its own ground.  On Blu it was amazing to watch at home.

"I have the 120 Zune.  As a die-hard Microsoft user, I have found the Zune software very easy to use and the Zune itself is more or less idiot proof.  My wife has an iPod 16 gb touch that I got for her because it can sync contacts and surf the internet; 2 things missing from the Zune which is numb where most folks who go the Msoft route would likely be at work, older farts like me who use it at the office and would like a means to sync w/ Outlook.  Anyway, the Zune is way easier to use as its drag and drop interface is intuitive compared to the cumbersome iPod software which doesn't appear to be simple as both my wife and I have struggled to understand it.  An example is the recent Madonna CD Hard Candy.  Ripped to the Zune, it files under ""Madonna"".  Done.  Ripped to the iPod Touch, some files are filed under Madonna and others are in Various Artists.  What the...  Just an example of the frustration we've had w/ the iPod versus the Zune.The key selling point for me was that the Zune will play lossless music which means it's supposed to be as good as listening to a CD.  MP3's are not the best sounding because they're compressed.  Lossless WMA on the Zune is great and you can listen to it on a home theater and appreciate the quality.  I listen to mine at work on a Bose AWMS so you can tell the difference.  The problem is lossless music takes up a crapload of space which necessitates the Zune's mechanical 120 GB monster hard drive vs. the dinky solid state 16GB stuff that it competes with.I don't travel any more so I can't say if the Zune lasts for days on a battery.  I unplug it from my laptop at work and it seems to play lossless tunes for a couple of hours so that's not too bad unless you're flying to Afghanistan in which case you have far larger issues than just battery life.  I would say it ranks as a 'meh' on the suck to awesome scale with 'meh' squarely in the middle there.I don't watch video on my Zune but I suppose you could.  It's just wicked small so really, what's the point?  I don't get it but some folks are all worked up if it won't play HD video.  I understand the newest Zune will play HD video but it doesn't have a big hard drive so I'm not sure what the advantage is there.The Zune is bulky but since I grew up in the 80's, it's a long way from the original Walkman or the Aiwa tape decks we used to cart around.  A Nano iPod seems to be about 1/8 the size so if you're a jogger, go w/ the iPod.Is it tough?  Dunno.  It works all the time for me but I haven't accidentally dropped it, kicked it or parked a cross-town bus on top of it.  I think it's a glass screen so though it is really clear and nice looking, glass isn't renowned for its resilience to blunt force trauma.Gripes?  The cord stinks.  I keep mine plugged in all the time and it's all frayed.  That said, it still works but jeez.  No other real gripes.As for features like the awesome iPod touch screen etc well, Zune ain't an iPod.  But if you have a Blackberry for internet and contacts and stuff but want a solid unit to play very high quality tunes on and you don't want to hire the neighbor's kid to show you how to make a freakin' playlist, Zune is simple, easy and is an outstanding unit for playing tunes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2685H68F747S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EQ0HAW#wasThisHelpful","R2685H68F747S1","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an older Garmin V that I have used for about 7 years.  The old Garmin is great for driving around provided you plan ahead and update the maps to show where you're traveling.  If you forget, you miss critical detail and you'd better have good local maps.  I still have that unit and use it mostly in the woods due to its limited memory.So on a recent trip to Sacramento, I decided to upgrade to a newer unit that had more memory.  The 205W worked so well out of the box I was a little disappointed.  The tech on these is so simple now it's almost 'boring' to use.  It navigated rapidly and accurately and provided clear directions within minutes.  Most amazing to me was how well it picked up satellites compared to the Garmin V.  Extremely fast and even worked resting in the space between the seats of our rental car.  Pretty cool.I'm not sure you can go wrong with the 205W.  I've been a GPS geek for about 10 years and we use them at work.The 205W is intuitive enough for most folks to use right out of the box and the routing is good.  By 'good', I mean it's fast and accurate.  If you accidentally drive by something it quickly recalculates a route for you.The screen is nice and bright too, even in daylight.  It is wise to bring along the supplied 12 volt cigarette lighter plug as it seems to last for very short times on battery alone and there is no way to replace the battery or bring along a spare.  Fortunately, you can charge it off a mini-usb port from your computer too so it's not a big issue but if you're the forgetful sort, perhaps a replaceable battery model is better for you.This is not a unit you'd really use in the back-country.  It's designed for highway use and works great for that.  There are other more costly units that more effectively marry the needs of sportsman and the occasional traveler.It does nicely link up with Google Earth via your computer (you'll need to latest free version of Google Earth).  It does not appear to provide a real-time GPS position signal to your computer (my 7 year old Garmin V does though) so if you're looking for that capability this doesn't appear to be a solution for that specific problem.  However, if you are traveling and wish to save the addresses / places that you visited it easily imports that information and it's pretty cool to see those points overlaid on Google Earth.You can add an SD card and put photos and stuff on it like you might on a USB memory stick but I don't think many people use that sort of capability.You can easily download different icons to show your position.  I downloaded the tank.  The tank rules.  It's a gimmick but it shows the folks at Garmin have a sense of humor.You can view your route in the traditional overhead routing or 3D; both work really well.The provided suction cup mount works very well.  It uses a ball mount that allows for infinite positioning.  If you want a really rugged mount I'd strongly recommend the Ram-Mount systems available online.  I bought one for my ATV and it's amazingly stout and simple.  I digress.If your primary need for a GPS is a very simple, plain and effective unit for over the road travel, this will exceed your needs and your expectations in an easy to use package.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5F8G0RD26WKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015F1L7A#wasThisHelpful","R5F8G0RD26WKN","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not sure who likes this more, our 15 month old little guy or me.  You should buy Season 1 of the Muppet show too just to bring back how much fun this was growing up.  Back when specials were just that and getting to watch the Muppets was a reward for good behavior.  I still think this is a reward for good behavior.  You can't help but grin at the witty lyrics and the very real threats that Miss Piggy unleashes on hapless foam rubber Kermit.

"I have a 36"" Sony XBR TV from 2002 connected via component cables to an Xbox 360.  The TV is supposed to do 1080i; who am I to disagree?  I installed the HD DVD today in about 5 minutes.  Very simple to do which is key considering the time it saves (and component cable space on the back of the TV) from hooking up a non-USB device.So far as I can tell, there are no drawbacks to this device.  Very easy to use, connects quickly w/ one USB wire to the Xbox.  Slick.The remote is slick, but now I have one more remote.  No drama really.My wife now needs another ""how do I play a movie?"" education as this is different from the standard DVD player that we still use to play standard DVD's.  I've not tried playing a standard DVD on the HD DVD rig, though I've read it's dreamy.I watched King Kong today and it was a noticeable improvement over the standard DVD, though most folks wouldn't likely pick up on it.  However, if you're researching HD you're an ""early adopter"" and you would probably point it out to your friends who likely don't care any more than your cat does.One review said the sound was bad.  On my setup, sound comes out via an optical cable; I thought it was fine and most folks would agree.I read one review that said it only plays 1080i via component cables and that there is no timeframe yet for Microsoft to make an Xbox cable that goes from the 360 to HDMI which apparently allows full progressive 1080p and hence even better quality.  This would not help me one bit since my TV is old school and has no HDMI anyway, so I guess it's a mixed blessing.  That said, the picture is very good even if it's not fully digified to my TV.At $200, it's a cheap, easy way to get at the HD DVD format.  If blu-ray wins in the end, I'm not out much dough, and with the ease of set up, I think this will be very popular w/ the 360 crowd.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APVSRUVNPA2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JHO4L0#wasThisHelpful","R2APVSRUVNPA2M","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this microphone to facilitate recording meeting minutes.  It works well in a conference room setting w/ say, 10 to 12 people.  We connect it to a Dell laptop's microphone jack.  Using the mid-boost built into the Sony mic helps a lot.  We also use a free version of Audacity software to record the meeting directly to the computer.  Audacity allows you to rip it to .mp3 format directly for long term archiving which is very handy.  It also makes it easy to distribute minutes widely.  The product works well in these conditions and I'd recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EGAGGIQDHX7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00001W0DU#wasThisHelpful","R3EGAGGIQDHX7F","A1IYZS46NB2CKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IYZS46NB2CKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have this cover, a US-Mil issued cover, and a cheaper cover. Of all 3, this one is my favorite. Plenty of room in the main compartment, and also the side compartments. The Molle on the back can be fitted to a pack or belt, alice clips can even be installed. On drawback, that is easily fixed, is the lid/cover. It just felt too high and floppy. I made a triangular cut, following the ""V"" of the straps, on the lid. Now the top of the canteen can protrude through the pack, the top of the pack tightens down snuggly (photo attached. sorry they rotate it 90-deg). I did this because I also carry a GI-style cup/stove/lid which the canteen nests into. This method keeps everything ""tight"" and quiet. On a side note, I store the lid for the cup in the very bottom of this cover, so far, this is the ONLY pouch I have found that I could do that with. The cover is thick and very rugged.

Wash your only pair while in the shower, lay them flat on a towel and roll it tightly to get the excess water out. 2 minutes with a blow dryer and you're good to go.

"I love this knife! This is my second one. My first got lost or stolen, so I replaced it immediately. I have many popular knives by many popular makers. This is by far my favorite and is my EDC. I was turned on to karambit blades about 12 years ago, they are all I carry now. Anyone that has carried a quality karambit blade knows the benefits. If you've never owned one, you're missing out!

I'm ok with ""tactic-cool"" gear, but I needed something in between hatchet and tomahawk. I wanted a tomahawk that was a ""work horse"". It works well as a hatchet and I have no doubt it could split a wig as well as it splits wood. The sheath can be worn on a belt and is molle compatible, by way of velcro belt loops.

"We were sent this tray for our independent review and gave it two stars simply because the idea behind it is solid, but that is basically the only thing about it that is solid. It is our job to screen items of poor quality - this is one! The tray is priced too high for what you get. Ours arrived cracked, and as I was reviewing it, one whole side broke off! Sure, I could have asked for a refund but as a top reviewer, I instead want to screen these products for the rest of the Amazon ecosystem. Thus, here is the unfiltered review:Acrylic is a heavy, breakable material that does not ship well. So why is this tray being tossed in Amazon boxes and shipped all over the US in big brown trucks?? Bad idea all the way around. I just glanced at another buyer's review about this tray not being too heavy. It is not only too heavy, it is poorly designed with too much weight held together by thin sides, and the choice of material cheapens the product even further! All of those elements together lead me to say you should keep your money.Buyer - do not purchase this product unless you want a 50/50 shot that it will be break. Forget about serving anything with it or carrying it long distances, it is best suited to sit and look pretty from afar. Thus, for the price point ($30+) save your money and consider other options.See photos for more details.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIMQHI6AIBJ9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153VZBM2#wasThisHelpful","RIMQHI6AIBJ9E","A1K3QII0DFSTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3QII0DFSTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a regular reviewer of dildos and vibrators, I am no stranger to their construction. So when I was asked to review this King Kong version independently I was more than open to it. The medical grade silicone is one of the key distinctions this model brings to the market. That type of engineering creates a high-end luxurious quality that others lack. The switches are sleep and the design is life like yet not distasteful. I gave this product 4 stars because I would have liked to have seen two C batteries as opposed to two double A batteries. The double A batteries do not give the device as much of a range with the 7 functions as two C's would. If this is your first vibrator, you probably wouldn't notice the difference. However, if you've been using toys for a while you will want to find a C battery version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZE9ZPLNVS7MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9KXVCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZE9ZPLNVS7MN","A1K3QII0DFSTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K3QII0DFSTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good cookbook for the novice cook, which would include someone who is both new to cooking and new to the logistics of cooking for two.  Much of it is common sense -- such as estimating portion control  by dividing a given recipe in half.

"Very useful introduction and guide to juicing.  I""m someone who never juices, as I need a lot of fiber to fill up.  But having received this book for free, and after looking through it, I found some of the recipes so attractive I sampled them. Can report that the Green Energy Juice is indeed a good pickmeup and energy tonic for breakfast.  And the Green OJ worked well, despite the unlikely combination of orange and spinach.  Very much appreciated the introduction which discussed the various types of juicers -- all information I was aware of.  Also extremely useful to this novice juicer was the clear listing of amounts of various ingredients of the different recipes. Other juicing recipes will be somewhat vague on this, I've found. For the more experienced juicer, I wager that the nutritional breakdown of each drink will be useful, especially as it includes the grams of sugar, a measure that many recipe books omit. The only reason it doesn't get all five stars is I feel this book downplays all the prep time it takes to make these nutritious wonders.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B3Q7S4K19KEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG83COG#wasThisHelpful","R3B3Q7S4K19KEN","A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no reason to think I am gluten intolerant but periodically like to make sure my body has a 'time out"" for wheat products, especially because gluten is everywhere.  I also go through bouts of using a slow cooker, especially in the fall and winter months, when making batches of hot food and then freezing them for later meals comes in handy.  So this book is very useful for me.  It is well written and well organized.  I especially appreciated the list of foods to avoid,  and the tips on how to stock my pantry.But white ""gluten-free"" may be in the title this is actually a collection of recipes of service to vegans and vegetarians, as well as paleo and whole foods dieters.  Probably my chief criticism is that while these recipes seem easy enough to prepare, they do take time and look to me like afternoon projects.

"I see most of the reviews of this book concentrate on its discussion of the science and rationale for adopting a candida diet.  Readers should know that this discussion comes in the introduction, but that the book is, at least for this consumer, first and foremost a cookbook full of recipes,. And I find the meals and snacks it describes as being very tasty, filling, and, in being made mostly from scratch and from whole foods, 'clean.'  So it is a very good whole foods recipe book for anyone looking to eat healthily while not depriving their palate of those interesting sensations that make life worthwhile.  Particularly like the coconut, almond waffles for breakfast and the cayenne spiced walnuts as a snack choice.That said, while the discussion of candida seems to fairly responsible, in that the editors concede the lack of empirical medical evidence for its existence, I found myself rolling my eyes at the questionnaire meant to self-diagnose it.  Who doesn't at times feel irritable, or subject to mood swings and fatigue? And the number of maladies that could produce these symptoms is endless.  Nevertheless the authors are to be commended for how they propose people adopt the candida-free diet, which is, after all, a very healthy one.  They have all sorts of recommendations for how to transition, and emphasize that it does in fact amount to a change in lifestyle, not just eating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R163Z0U70ND8FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJGG1V0#wasThisHelpful","R163Z0U70ND8FT","A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A real gem.  I don't have celiac disease, nor am I gluten-intolerant (that I am aware of), but every so often I try to give my body a break from it, because it is in so many foods and foodstuffs, it just seems like the healthy thing to do. These recipes are great -- especially the ones that offer wheat flour substitutes, like the pumpkin cinnamon pancakes.  Especially useful is the guide to the different type of flours and grains that can be used in place of wheat (coconut, almond, brown rice, millet).  This book also serves as a good introduction to the health benefits of the gluten-free diet, giving what looks like responsible overview of the medical science in support of it.  My only quibble likes with the claim that each dish takes ""30 minutes or less.""  Don't feel that's  realistic, given that some of them need advance preparation.

"This book is very useful for people considering veganism or open to changing their diet to a more plant-based, whole food approach.  It doesn't hype the health-promoting benefits for going without dairy or animal products, which makes many of its recommendations more credible.  For example, rather than urging readers to totally transform their eating habits immediately, but rather suggest to ""begin slowly."" Eliminate one food group at a time, beginning with ones LEAST essential to your daily eating, while giving yourself ""time to adjust"" to the changes.While the advice is generally sound it's also a bit meager, and perhaps misleading. For example in the recipe for sweet potato and kale hash we're told that the orange vegetable is a good source of Vitamin D. Never heard that before -- I wonder if the authors had Vitamin A in mind instead? Also, there is a cheerful recommendation for vitamin supplementation, though it seems to medical studies keep refuting the supposed health benefits of these usually pricey pills.That said, it is the recipes that this books' value rests on, and here it delivers. I've tried quite a few, and have in the past made variants of some of the ones listed here.  They are indeed quick and easy and flavorful.  The breakfast ones are especially useful -- concoctions like the pumpkin pancakes and broiled grapefruit look like great finds.  Look forward to using this cookbook quite a bit in the future.Btw, I received a free copy of this book in exchange for writing this review, but was free to say whatever I wanted in it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21EQ0Z7UCRGFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQ99LK4#wasThisHelpful","R21EQ0Z7UCRGFU","A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an important magazine.  It's not simply that many of the stories in this issue are well -- crafted, but cumulatively they offer a portrait of America, or open a window onto what it means to be alive and struggling to walk the lonely tightope straddling hope and delusion, realism and despair.  Every story revolves around the struggle and point of view of some character who is lonely and profoundly isolated, engaging in marginal and/or taboo behavior, whether its a young slacker male succumbing to the allure of 'forbidden' sex in a BDSM Craigslist ad, as in  Don Boles' Swimming With Sharks, or the older nominally successful businessman and family man of J.A. Bernstein's An Affair, who flies halfway around the world to consummate a passion kindled decades ago by a fleeting glimpse of a woman (prostitute?).Many of these protagonists in this  story seem to be on an unacknowledged quest for passion, or authenticity.  Their journey generally culminates in a deepened insight into how limited their lives and possibilities are -- they remain as isolated at the beginning of the story as at their end. The true standouts, for me, in this collection is the last one, On Bread Alone, Josh Goller. T he story of a how a hapless homeless man became the matrix for a short lived religious movement, as told by his first supporter, is at once funny, sad, and horrifying -- because utterly believable.  Not all the stories felt especially inspired -- some felt more like story ideas forced into production, as With Janna Layton's Oddly Precious Melancholy -- the premise sounds irresistible on paper -- parents organizing to dispose of their debt-ridden, financially dependent children -- but what might work as, say, a screenplay, falls short in a short story, where some psychological plausibility needs to be in evidence.Another reason why this collection only merits 4 stars is the poetry. None of the selections were especially well-crafted,  and all seemed to have been willed into existence to serve an intellectualized idea, as opposed to inspiration.  Which isn't to imply that all the stories are perfectly realized works -- but it does feel they have been written because they NEED to be written.A final note on this issue:  A number of reviewers of this magazine cite Bukowski and Selby as influences. I honestly -- and it may be a strictly idiosyncratic response on my part -- feel as if I were more encountering the echoes of Flannery O'Connor -- the dark satire and ending of On Bread Alone certainly resonates with her work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5WWLJ9LVT5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KB2R1B8#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5WWLJ9LVT5M","A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is fun novel with some depth.  Morgan is a hard-driving, wealthy, self-made businesswoman who has climbed to the top of the high stakes, ruthless world of trading.  She has nerves of steel and much inner strength, but also, is, in her own words, 'damaged goods.  Flashbacks reveal a childhood marred by tragedy that left Morgan an orphan, with no one to take care of her. Crossing the busy New York Street, focused as ever on her pursuit of wealth and the 'killer trade,' she is herself nearly killed by an oncoming massive motorcycle, helmed by the enigmatic, honorable, but tough as nails Cabe.  In short order the plot has Cade offering Morgan his home to stay in until she can  get back on her feet (literally, the acccident broke her leg.)And this leads us to what makes this novel interesting. It is not just that this proud Wall Street businesswoman finds herself attracted to this rough and tough biker. Through Morgan's eyes, we are taken on a journey into the world of motorcycle outlaw clubs. Because Cade is the head of this club, and on his firm and strong shoulders rests the responsability for this 'tribe.' Morgan, and the reader learn not just about honor and the subculture of this club. But then Cade's story, and his past heartbreaks and tragedy that turned him into not only a warrior but a leader, is what makes us truly care about him.Morgan and Cade are not the only characters in this novel. Stacy, Morgan's assistant, all corporate polish on the outside, but vulnerable and passionate as hell on the inside, has her own story to tell. And then there's Cades' treacherous twin, brother, whose vendetta against Cade fuel much of the plot's narrative.There are some plot details that go unexplained. Early on we find out that Stacy is related to one of the central characters. But that issue is dropped -- as if the fact that she's Asian and her relative is white and western. One of the reviewers said she stopped reading shortly before the end. Pity. Because the very end is a shocker -- won't give anything away, except to say I didn't see it coming.  But I believe it means that Morgan is not finished with her experiences with the Filthy Few outlaw club. Be interesting to see where her next journey takes her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJYYLS2S99YX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZXH2BM#wasThisHelpful","R3VJYYLS2S99YX","A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PV7WPGDCQ1WF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And that's been getting me down -- have even found myself avoiding looking into the mirror.

But then I had lunch with a friend who I hadn't seen in a few months -- and I noticed her skin was seriously smoother and brighter.  She had gone from being more wrinkled than me to less! Figured she was doing the Botox thing but no -- she said it was this product.  Really grilled her but she was very firm -- no surgeries or procedures were behind her suddenly refreshed look, just this DNA serum. So, yes, I went home and ordered some.

"""I was still falling at unstoppable speeds- only in his arms, as his body claimed me without a single word spoken, I was suddenly falling....up""Aly Martinez... If you wanted me to fall, then you have succeeded. I have indeed fallen. Fallen in love with your writing, stories, characters, and the raw emotions that you evoked through your words. And I will continue to fall for your books every single time. Aly's books has been somewhat an addiction for me. She never fails in delivering books that can grip you to the core, strip you naked and make you FEEL. And in her newest standalone, The Fall Up, Aly Martinez DELIVERED. She more than delivered. She held me HOSTAGE as she drowned me in one of the most heartfelt, beautiful, touching stories that I have read.""No words were exchanged. Everything had been said as we both came on the gasp of the other's name. I'd claimed her. And, in turn, she owned me. It was almost as exhilarating as it was terrifying. Almost.""The Fall Up is truly one of those reads that you want to savor and re-read again. In this spellbinding tale, Aly perfectly weaves a romance like no other. A romance that was palpable and tangible right from the start when two strangers meet on the ledge of a bridge. An unconventional meeting of two broken people. A young woman who is lost in her guilt, pain, and loss. And a man who feels the need to help with his Spiderman complex.""She wasn't the princess. And I wasn't the pauper. She was just a sad girl who liked to write songs. And I was nothing more than a simple guy who was lucky enough to have made her fall in love with him.""On a cold rainy night in San Francisco, Levee Williams meets a tattooed stranger, who saves her. Saves her from taking that jump. The jump to end it all. When Sam interrupts Levee from these thoughts to jump, he saves her in more ways than he knows. Whenever he sees Sam on the bridge, he continues to disrupt her and forms a special friendship with her. When Levee finally takes Sam offer to get a late night snack, she finally lets her guard down. As Sam learns of her true identity as Levee Williams, the pop star celebrity, he doesn't seem faze of her celebrity status. All he sees is Levee. Levee, the beautiful brown eye girl who stole his heart the moment he laid eyes on her. The girl who has bewitched him with her beauty, honesty, witty personality and vulnerability.""Levee, I'll tell you anything you want to know as long as it means you're with me to keep asking.""As Sam and Levee embark on a relationship, a connection is formed. A deep raw tangible bond where there are not enough words to describe this connection they feel for another. A connection of peace, of hope, of love, and new beginnings. As they continue to fall for each other, Levee must face with the realization of the truth. The truth that she needs help. If she wants any chance to have a real relationship with Sam, Levee goes to a rehab facility to help deal with her anxiety and depression. As Levee undergoes her treatment, will it be enough to keep her off the ledge? Will she let her issues prevent her from truly living her life and the possible chance at love? Or will she find herself falling in love with Sam Rivers?""Hell, I could probably pretend for the rest of my life if he continued to hold me the way he did. Kiss me the way he did. Touch me the way he did. Save me the way he did.""The Fall Up has to be one of my favorite books that Aly has written. Aly has once again perfectly weaved an emotional and heartfelt story-line with witty humor and of course sexy steamy scenes. This book is definitely a book that needs to be read, experienced, and savored. I loved every aspect of this book from the raw and flawed characters to the emotional heartstrings that can tug your heart. As I stated earlier in my review, Aly Martinez will hold your hearts and attention hostage. She will grip you with a love story that will leave you breathless. A story that will make you want a real life Sam Rivers to catch your fall. So if you are looking for a book where the author tackles an important issue in such a deep and profound way, you NEED to READ this book.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TAXCJZLFZQVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176JLJDE#wasThisHelpful","R2TAXCJZLFZQVU","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rules of the Ride is my first H.J. Bellus book that I have read and I'm scolding myself as to why I haven't read any of her books before because if this book was any indications of the raw emotional touching storyline that can grip your heart, then H.J. Bellus you have my full attention now. I honestly didn't know what to expect when I first started this book. At first, I was thinking a hot sexy cowboy who ropes in the woman that catches his eye. But Ms. Bellus completely surprises on how deep, touching, and emotional Rules of the Ride was as it weaved the depths of forgiveness, acceptance, love, and second chances.There was only one woman Maverick Slatter loved. And that was Ella James. She had the power to destroy him and yet a part of him yearned for her love. When she walked out of him and never looked back, he never thought that their paths would collide. What he once thought was finished business with Ella, turned out to be unfinished as sparks begins to flicker and reignite. When Mav learns of the reason of why Ella ran away, how far will Mav go to get the woman he has only loved? Can Mav's love heal all the brokeness that Ella feels? When it comes to love, there are no rules...so will Mav and Ella get their second chance at love?""Love doesn't follow the rules or view of life the way our eyes see it.""H.J. Bellus has a way of pulling and tugging those heartstrings in this beautiful well-written book. I have always been a fan of family themed books and Rules of the Ride is a great example of a strong united family who are willing to go beyond the means to help one another. As I have said earlier, this definitely won't be my last H.J. Bellus book. I look forward to reading what lies ahead for the Slatter's Family and as well as what other books Ms. Bellus has in store. So if you are ready to get swept away in a sweet and heartbreakingly beautiful second chance love story then Rules of the Ride might be the book for you.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SI86ANPKVL3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TSEDFO#wasThisHelpful","R1SI86ANPKVL3G","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""I want Emma Burke. I always have. And I'm going to fight like hell to make her mine. I know a thing or two about fighting.""Ginger Scott.....there is only one question I have for you. Can I claim Owen and Andrew all to myself?

When I first read about Andrew Harper in Wild Reckless, I wanted to know more about him. And let me just say, Ginger did not disappoint me with this book!!! Ginger Scott DELIVERED!!!! Wicked Restless was an emotional, slow burn second chance romance that was brimming with so much passion, angst, loss, hope, forgiveness and a palpable unforgettable love story.Ginger Scott has been one of those authors whose writing speaks for themselves. She never fails to deliver a book that is refreshing, touching, and heartbreakingly beautiful. I love how her books always finds a way to grip and tug all those heartstrings. And the story of Andrew Harper and Emma Burke was a devastatingly beautiful love story where readers are taken on a Ferris Wheel ride, where sometimes you are up, sometimes you are down, but in the end, you just need to enjoy the ride. I can't explain how much I loved this book because Ginger held my heart hostage with Andrew and Emma.Wicked Restless is one of those stories that allowed readers to be consumed with it's characters. Andrew Harper, the genius of the Harper boys. The brother who could get into college that he wanted to. But living in a small town, people talked and they automatically labeled the Harper Boys as bad seeds. When Andrew first laid his eyes on Emma Burke, it was like something in him click that arrows and neon signs were pointing to him that Emma is the one. As a young sixteen year old teenager, Andrew knew without a doubt he was in love with Emma Burke. He fell in loved with her vibrant personality, beautiful soul and her charisma. He would do anything for her. And Andrew proved that when he took the blame on a car accident that forever changed his life. Fast forward to five years later, Andrew is angry at the girl who didn't bother to write back and wait for him. He resented that his time away changed him to a broken man.

A storm where he knew he had to face head on to find out why the girl he loved broke his heart five years ago.""The more she talks, the more I feel every scar on my body all at once- the burn marks, the stab wounds, the broken bones that never healed quite right- abuse I took so Emma Burke didn't have to experience anything sad.""They say every story has two sides.

A story that says, you have survived. And for Emma and Andrew this sentiment holds true. They are both survivors. They have both lived through the ups and downs of life and through all the hardships, they were able to find and fight their way back to each other.

"If you ever read a book from River Savage then you are fully aware that this author takes her readers on a whirlwind of raw emotions and surprises. And in her newest release to the Knight's Rebel's MC Series, Ms. Savage holds her readers hostage as she consumes us with raw emotions, grittiness, intensity, and passion. Infatuation was so much more than your typical MC romance of a good girl meets bad boy biker. This book sends a powerful message that no one is truly broken and life is full of second chances.Infatuation centers on the story of Beau McIntyre and Mackenzie Moore. Ms. Savage introduces her readers to a broken, beaten Mackenzie Moore. A woman who has first hand experienced physical abuse from her husband. A woman who lived the tale of what it means to escape from a monster and be a survivor. Mackenzie Moore is a resilient woman, who just needed time to really see how strong, beautiful, and tough she is. And the only person who was able to transcend and help bring out this side to Mackenzie was Beau McIntyre.""I'm consumed by everything he gives me. Everything he takes from me.""When Beau first rescued and helped Mackenzie, he never thought he would see her again. But eighteen months later, she shows up at his MC clubhouse asking for help and protection. There was something about Kenzie that instantly gravitated him to help her. There was this strong sexual, emotional, and physical connection that was buzzing through the air whenever they were around each other. As Kenzie and Beau continued to spend more time with each other, they soon found themselves crossing that invisible line and they knew once that they crossed that line, there was no going back. Kenzie is well aware of Beau's need for control and submission, can Kenzie submit and let go knowing that she was abused by her husband? Can Beau heal the shattered pieces of Kenzie and show her that she is not broken?""The truth is I do. I love the way he is. Love the way he speaks, the way he treats me. I love it all and yeah it scares me. Oh, God, does it scare me.""As always, River Savage did another phenomenal job writing Infatuation. It was an emotionally raw book that evoked a wide range of emotions. Infatuation was brimming with grit, passion, grief, loss, hurt, pain, love, and second chances. I loved that Ms. Savage continues to blend and integrate layers of suspense, romance, and raw vulnerabilities. The story of Beau and Kenzie is a reminder that love has the power to shine in our darkest and weakest moments. The strongest light is the light that shines within you.... and for Mackenzie Moore, it lead her way to Beau. Although this book exposes all facets of love and second chances, I loved that Ms. Savage raises awareness on domestic violence. River did an amazing job showcasing that LOVE HEALS and that starting over is a gift that we should not waste. So if you are looking book that reminds us all no matter how much you may think you are broken, you can always build yourself back up and start over again. It's never too late to start over; never too late to love, and never too late to be happy.P.S.~ River Savage please tell me the next book is Brooke and Kelly because I seriously can't wait for their story. This couple's story gripped and tore my heart. Please don't keep your readers waiting long.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QFZFM4T9B6K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BHRN4W#wasThisHelpful","R1QFZFM4T9B6K0","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The scars are faded, but they'll never go away.""An irresistible twisted dark erotic romance!!! Pretty When You Cry by Skye Warren is one of those reads that hooks readers instantly as she introduces a young heroine, who has been brainwashed by a religious cult leader that she is a sinner and that she belongs to his flock. For years, Candace has been ingrained with scriptures and teachings from her cult leader. When Candace finally escapes the religious compound and heads to the city, she finds herself in the streets looking for shelter and luckily she meets a man who saves her from danger. Alone, scared and with only $20 in her pockets, Candace, who happens to be 16 years old at the time finds housing with Ivan, an owner of The Grand, a seedy strip club. Ivan takes its upon himself to house the young girl providing education, clothing, shelter, and a job for Candace. When she turned 19, Candace who now goes by Candy decided that she want to earn her keep and become a stripper at The Grand. Ivan never wanted her to strip but Candy insisted that this is something she wanted to do. The relationship of Candy and Ivan is a complex one. Both of them, craves and needs each other emotionally and physically. Candy needs the mixture of pleasure and pain and Ivan needs the control. As much as Candy wants to leave Ivan and be free, she couldn't because there is this tangible bond between them.

Or will she retreat back to the young fearful girl? Can Ivan be the home and salvation that Candy needs?""He hurts me and he soothes me, but never enough. Back and forth. Never enough pain or pleasure. He always leaves me needing more.""Pretty When You Cry is not your typical romance with hearts and flowers. There is no prince charming and white knight but there is a hero, who is broken, flawed, imperfect and domineering. Ivan may not be your ideal hero but he is indeed a hero in his own sense. He saved Candy and in turn she saves him too. He may show a different way of his affection and love with his control but it's love nonetheless. So if you are looking for a book where the author perfectly weaves a love story in the backdrop of abuse, sex, control, and suspense then I would definitely recommend Pretty When You Cry. Ms. Warren will remind us all beauty and hope can be found in the ugly. And in this case, it's about finding beauty in life's scars.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SH8O6DIEE1B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SFKK0U#wasThisHelpful","R1SH8O6DIEE1B9","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tempting the New Boss by Angela Claire was a quirky fun and yet a sexy read!!! I enjoyed this book a quite a bit since this is not your typical book hero. Mason Talbot is a successful wealthy business CEO. Usually in most books that deals with CEO's, the hero is typically found to be dominant, total alpha male, and exudes confidence but in the case for Mason, he is none of those things. Mason is your hero who is socially awkward and has no filters. He lacks the social skills and comes across sometimes as aloof, brazen, and brash.

"When I read the first book, Slow Ride of the Playing for Keeps Series by Cathryn Fox it was more on the romantic and emotional connection between Chase Cooper and Julia Blair. And in this second installment Wild Ride, Cathryn Fox definitely took this book up a notch on the wild side. And when I mean wild, I don't mean wrangling horses but wrangling deep sexual fantasies that only Tyler Mackenzie can fulfill for Jess Gray.For Tyler, Jess was the one woman from his past that he knew was perfect for him since he has been harboring deep feelings for her since they were high school friends. So when Tyler invited Jess to his ranch that he co-owns with his friends, he wanted one week with Jess to show her that they are perfect for each other emotionally and physically. And Tyler is the only one who can fulfill all her deep sexual fantasies since he knew she was a shy girl who had lots of dirty naughty fantasies. One week was all it took for Jess to be awaken sexually, emotionally, and physically to Tyler. So when their week is up, will Tyler be able to wrangle the woman that he has been in love with or will she be too scared to take a chance with this sexy cowboy? Is Jess ready for one wild ride?Wild Ride was definitely a fun, naughty, and sexy read!!!! I enjoyed reading this quick sexy romance between Tyler and Jess. Though the book started with insta-lust, I didn't mind it all since these two shared a past together and had feelings for each other. I really enjoyed Tyler's character since he really wanted to show how much he knew Jess and her sexual fantasies. I loved that Tyler did these sexual fantasies for her pleasure alone. So if you are looking for a quick steamy read where a couple explores their sexual fantasies, then Wild Ride might be the book for you.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKMYO9UNDP3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151VLBQY#wasThisHelpful","R3KKMYO9UNDP3M","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ilsa Madden-Mills has always been on my list of authors that I adore and love. When I first read her debut book, Very Bad Things, I was instantly addicted to all her books. There was no ifs, ands or buts about it, Ilsa has reminded me as to why I enjoy and love reading the New Adult genre. Personally, I think she has the magic touch when it comes to this genre because I have always found myself spellbinded and bewitched with all her stories. There is never a dull moment in her books because all her stories have always been so raw, captivating, emotionally gripping, sexy, and breathtakingly beautiful. And in her newest release, Dirty English, Ilsa truly has outdone herself with this book and I personally think this is my favorite book that she has written so far.""Loving Declan was like the rain storms I loved to dance in. Crazy and unpredictable, sometimes turbulent, sometimes gentile.""The Brits are coming!!!!!! And I might just say I am loving this British Invasion of Declan and Dax Blay!!!!! Ilsa Madden-Mills if you are reading this review, can I just say how I much I freaking love you for writing this fab book. Dirty English was more than your typical romance of hot tattoo British bad boy meeting a young American lady and falling in love. This book was so much more than an ordinary college romance. Dirty English spoke volumes of love, forgiveness, second chances, redemption, hope, and new beginnings.""I'm the guy who's going to take you up against this wall. I'm going to bury my c% in you and own your body and you're going to love it. But I'm not going to hurt you. Ever.""I have always been a Jane Austen fan and Pride and Prejudice has always been one of my favorite literary classics. As a romantic at heart, I have always wanted my version of Mr. Darcy. And in Dirty English, Ilsa has put a modern twist to a beloved literary classic. Well if I thought Mr. Darcy was a man to swoon for, then ladies Ilsa will have your knickers in a twist when she introduces us to Declan Blay. What's not to love about Declan Bay...he's hot, single, smart, sensitive, loves literary classics, and he's BRITISH!!!!!!! Oh yeah, he also has a hot twin brother named Dax. That's right TWO BRITISH MEN!!!!! So let the swooning begin!!!! And oh yeah, Declan's leading lady is named Elizabeth Bennett. Jane Austen gave her readers Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy and now Ilsa Madden-Mills has given us Elizabeth Bennett and Declan Blay.""She was my queen and I wanted to be her king. I wanted to sit at the throne of her body and love her forever, but it wasn't just sex, although that had been over the f&%#@ing moon. No, with us it was about two broken people who looked deep into the eyes of the other person and just-meshed. Call it fate or destiny or just plain old karma, but whatever it was, the moment I watched her dance in the rain, my heart had known, only it had taken my head a while to catch up.""Right off the opening pages, I was emotionally hooked with Dirty English. Ilsa consumed me with such strong emotions for Elizabeth Bennett for what had happened to her in her senior year of high school. My heart ached and broke for her. Elizabeth learned the hard way that sometimes the people whom you thought you loved could have the power to destroy and break you. So fast forward to two years later, Elizabeth learned that the only way that she could control her life is to not let anyone have the power to destroy her emotionally, physically, and sexually. Elizabeth doesn't have many friends but she has two best friends that she allowed into her heart. Shelly and Blake are all aware of what had happened to Elizabeth and hopes that their friend can finally move on. And the first step in living life, they forced Elizabeth to attend her first college frat party where she meets not one hot Brit but two.""And no matter what came our way, I was in this for real. If he wanted to use his fists, I'd stand in his corner and kiss him before he put his gloves on.""When Declan Blay first laid his eyes on Elizabeth Bennett, it was game over for him. He felt the instant connection to her. Her brokenness spoke to him and there was nothing he wanted to do but help heal and piece back the shattered pieces of her heart. Declan Blay did not see a broken woman but a woman who held his heart hostage. He saw a beautiful woman inside and out, who just needed to fight through her emotional demons. Declan and Elizabeth's relationship stole my heart. It gripped me emotionally on how Declan was able to heal Elizabeth's heart. I love a book that can make you FEEL. And let me just say, Dirty English was brimming with such passion, intensity, raw emotions, tangible bonds, and a palpable love story that will leave you yearning and swooning for more Declan Blay. Can a scarred fighter heal a broken woman? There is only one way to find out... go read Dirty English and I promise you that you will not regret it.The writing and story-telling in Dirty English was well executed. Elizabeth's brokenness gripped my heart. I wanted to hug her and cheer her on as she learned to move on with her life. I have always been drawn to books with strong heroines and Ilsa Madden-Mills did an amazing job showcasing and highlighting a strong heroine, who has gone through hell and back. Elizabeth Bennett reminded readers that there is always hope, second chances, and new beginnings. Declan Blay may have been the fighter but Elizabeth was the true fighter in every sense of the word. She survived her demons. They say love hides behind every corner, and for Elizabeth Bennett love was literally next door. Dirty English was a great reminder that one should not be looking for someone who will solve all one's problems...but looking for someone who won't let you face them alone. So if you are looking for a book that will have you chanting THE BRITS ARE COMING!!!!! then I highly recommend you to read Dirty English.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBMX1CIP9F97B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517687462#wasThisHelpful","RBMX1CIP9F97B","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erin Noelle continually spellbinds her readers with her newest release Transparent, the final conclusion of the Luminous Series. Ms. Noelle truly has outdone herself with this emotional consuming romantic suspense that had me intrigued right off the opening pages. I went into reading Transparent without really knowing that I had to read Translucent first but luckily for me, I was able to get a gist of where Erin left off in the last book but I do highly recommend that you read the first book because after I finished reading Transparent, I knew I had to read Translucent next in order to find out how steamy and sexy Madden is of course.Transparent was such an enticing gripping suspenseful read!!! Erin Noelle had me glued to my kindle as I await the fate of Blake and Madden's story. I was so absorbed with the many layers of suspense and intrigue that Ms. Noelle incorporated into the storyline. Each fiber of raw emotions and vulnerabilities were seeping through the pages allowing readers to be consumed with such strong passion, devotion, and sacrifices one must go through in order to fight for one's love. Transparent really captures your attention as you await the plot of revenge and chicanery in order to fulfill one's mission. I loved that Erin not only incorporated such craftiness into her storyline but she was able to pull in her readers to see a love that is not blurred or obscured. But a love that spoke volumes on sacrifices. A love that you are willing to fight and die for. I know readers will fall in love with Blake and Madden's story but Erin Noelle stole my heart with her secondary character, Raze. Raze's character instantly caught and held my attention throughout the book. The raw and tangible emotions that Raze evoked really made Transparent to stand out for me personally.I have not read many books from Erin Noelle but I can attest that Transparent is a book that was beautifully well written. Ms. Noelle did a phenomenal job integrating so many layers and elements into this story that there was never a dull moment. This book was an exceptional romantic suspense that was raw, passionate, deadly, and full of surprises. So if you are looking for a book that reminds us all that love enables you to see the one you loved in a way that nobody else can see. It sees everything; the good, the bad, the flaws, the in between, the strength, the weakness and yet you still choose to love that person then I highly recommend you to read Transparent because this is a love story that was able to find light in the shadows of the past.P.S.Erin- If you are reading this review, PLEASE PLEASE (see I had to put please in all CAPS) write that certain character we were chatting about a book!!!! You know how much I loved that character and if I must BEG then I will beg. Hahaha. ;)~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNWAJ9MB7F7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VNYOQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3QNWAJ9MB7F7L","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am huge Aleatha Romig fan ever since The Consequences Series. She has been one of those authors that I gravitate towards to ever since she made me fall in love with an unlikely hero in Tony Rawlings. Ms. Romig constantly surprises her readers with her wicked brain as she continually writes stories that pulls, shocks, and hooks readers like myself. Aleatha Romig is an evil genius!!! And in her newest release Betrayal, Ms. Romig delivered a book that has me begging and craving for more.Alexandria Collins is a recent Ivy-league college graduate and will soon be attending Columbia University for law school in the fall. Wanting a much needed escape and relaxation, her best friend and her are off vacationing at an exclusive resort. Alex wanted to reinvent herself and let go of all the pressures that her mother and stepfather expected her to do so she decides to be ""Charli"" for one week. What Alex didn't expect was to meet was a tall dark mysterious handsome man who invited her to his penthouse suite. So when Charli decides to live for the moment, she begins a one week hot and sensual affair with Nox. The rules were simple. One week. No last names. No past. No future.As Charli begins to spend time with Nox, he opens this new sensual, seductive and sexual side that Charli never before had experienced. So when their one week comes to an end, she decides to close that chapter of Charli and begin a new one as Alex Collins. When Alex is summoned to returned home to Savannah, she was stunned to hear what had become of her trust fund. Betrayed by her mother, Alex is stuck in a dilemma as she tries to figure out a way on how will she pay for her tuition and apartment in NYC. She is forced to call her cousin who lives in New York if she could stay with him a couple of days while she reassess her financial plans. While there her cousin informs her a way that she can make some money. How far will Alex go for survival?""Is it really cheating if you're doing it to yourself?""Betrayal was perfect title for this story. It was so fitting as to what the heroine Alex Collins had to do in order to survive. Though this book is not the typical dark romance that I have been accustomed to by Aleatha Romig, I will say that this book will shock you especially in the last couple of chapters. Of course, Aleatha wickedly will have you craving and begging for the next book because I need to know more... As always, the writing and storytelling was brilliantly done!!!! Betrayal was an amazing start to the Infidelity Series, which I forsee will be a dangerously addicting series. If Betrayal already hooked me with this first introduction to Charli and Nox, I can't wait to see what Aleatha Romig has in store for them in the next book.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3166JWDN9AFL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016J2HJMY#wasThisHelpful","R3166JWDN9AFL0","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Monica Murphy continues to spellbind her readers with this fun, fresh, and deliciously entertaining read. I loved how the author was able to showcase changes in Tristan's demeanor but still kept him as the lovable dirty-talking hero who can make our hearts flutter. Slow Play reminded me of a modern day Cinderella fairy tale.

"In life, we all have reached a breaking point. We can decide we can give up or we can learn how to stand up again in the face of adversary. It is the marking point or what we like to call the defining moment. And in Hard to Break by Bella Jewel, we are introduced to Quinn, a female mechanic who lives and breathes fixing cars. She took on the responsibility of running her family's mechanic shop when her father became alcoholic due to his severe depression of losing his wife. Quinn struggles to keep the shop afloat while helping her father. So when she falls through hard times, she didn't expect her garage to be bought by Tazen Watts, a sexy, famous custom car builder. Quinn can't stand Tazen and his arrogant personality but at the same time, she can't stop her attraction to him. So when she forces herself to annoy him at the garage, she didn't expect this sexual attraction to be revving with such sizzling chemistry. When sparks begins to fly between these two, will Tazen be able to show her how her beauty outshines everyone in a male dominated profession?Hard to Break is an easy simple straightforward story line with little angst that has your sweet happily ever after ending. I enjoyed the book but did not love it since I really just couldn't connect to the characters. It felt a little too insta-love for my taste but I do love that the heroine is a bad ass mechanic who can show the boys at the shop that she is knowledgeable when it comes to fixing cars. So if you are a fan of enemies to lovers trope with lots of love/hate banter, then I suggest you give Hard to Break a try.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32BLDMPGMKPHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRFUEK2#wasThisHelpful","R32BLDMPGMKPHQ","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I'd be inside your body. Your mind. Sometimes both.""Ella Frank has always been on my list of authors that I MUST read and one-click. I have practically read all her books and always found myself devouring every book. When I first heard that she was releasing a new book titled Alasdair, I knew I had to read this book stat. In all honesty, I knew this book was going to be a paranormal/supernatural romance but I didn't know it was going to be an M/M vampire book. Well since Ella was the first author who popped my M/M cherry with TRY, I think it was fitting that she popped my first M/M paranormal erotic book.""This man was all the things he shouldn't want, but as Alasdair continued to stroke his lip, all Leo could think about was him replacing that finger with his mouth.""Alasdair was dangerously spellbinding and alluring!!! Ella takes her readers on a sexy bewitching journey of intrigue, suspense, and hot sensual erotic vampire love. When Alasdair meets Leo, a human, he couldn't understand the tangible and palpable bond that he had to him. There was something about Leo that made him want and need him. And as for Leo, he is well aware that Alasdair is dangerous but a part of him lust and craves him. Will this pull that Leo has for Alasdair be a deadly attraction that will alter the course of his life?Alasdair wouldn't be your typical paranormal romance book since I felt this wasn't quite a love story with your standard HEA. But I thought it was brilliant that Ella Frank wrote and told the book the way she did. She allowed readers to feel the palpable sexual tension and desire of the characters. Alasdair was a well executed paranormal book that had elements of lust, suspense, mystery, and forbidden desire that were integrated in the story. So if you are looking for a hot, sensual, steamy M/M paranormal book with sexy Greek vampires, then Alasdair is the book for you!!! I can't wait for book 2 and see what Ella Frank has in store for the other characters.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5PUYU6P80BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122DD7HU#wasThisHelpful","R3S5PUYU6P80BX","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Calling all Derek and Melissa fans... Tia Louise wrote a paranormal romance and revamped the retelling of ONE TO HOLD. In all honesty, I love anything that Tia writes. Her stories are always sexy, touching, and dangerously addicting. She has a way of sucking you in and wanting to take a bite of all her alpha male characters.One Immortal was sinfully bewitching and captivating. There is no other way to describe this book because right off the opening pages, Ms. Louise will entranced readers with one hot sexy meeting of Derek and Melissa. And let me tell you Ms. Louise will have you begging for more for those sexy and steamy moments. I swear Derek and Melissa's interaction in this book was HOTTER and SEXIER than before.When I think of New Orleans immediately I think of voodoo magic, witches, and the rich history the city has. And so, this is a perfect backdrop to set this modern spin of Melissa and Derek's story. Melissa is a vampire and she came to New Orleans to seek out answers and possible find a cure. Derek on the other hand is a vampire hunter, who works alongside with two shifters, Patrick and Stuart Knight. Derek is on the search to hunt down the Old One in New Orleans. So when Derek meets Melissa, he is easily bewitched by her beauty and the lure of the sexual attraction they have for each other. One taste of her and he wanted more. One taste of him and she was addicted. As Melissa and Derek further get entangled emotionally, physically, and sexually with each other, the secret of who she is begins to unfold. As Derek tries to saves Melissa in order to help her reclaim mortality, what danger awaits for these two?One Immortal was dangerously spellbinding. Tia Louise masterfully created a perfect blend of the supernatural and erotic romance. She hypnotizes her readers in the rich world of vampires, shifters, gypsies, psychic, and vampire hunters. I love this paranormal twist that Tia has woven with the added elements of romance, suspense, and mystery. As always, the writing was bewitching. All I can say, Tia Louise did a magically fabulous job with One Immortal. So if you are ready to fall in love with a sinfully hot vampire hunter, then this book is definitely for you!!!!~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K2LNJHU2PBOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CAJO9G#wasThisHelpful","R3K2LNJHU2PBOS","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fun and sweet read!!! Slow Burn was just the perfect sexy and sweet read to get lost in!! If you are a fan of second chances and taking risks then this book is for you. In Slow Burn, Ms. Cathryn Fox introduces two high school ""friends"" get their chance at love and romance. I use the term friends loosely since technically they weren't friends since the hero, Coop was best friends with Julia's twin sister, Mari. Fast forward to ten years later, Coop gets his second chance to finally admit to Julia that she has always been the girl on his mind. Julia always assumed that Coop only liked and wanted Mari and had blinders on when it came to her but as it turns out she was wrong. When Julia arrives at Coop's ranch, she didn't expect the same feelings she had for Coop ten years ago would be just as strong.

Will Julia be able to let Coop into her life?Slow Burn was the first book that I have read from this author and it surely won't be my last.

"Regrets...let's face it, we all have one whether we like it or not. In life, we make mistakes and it is up to us to learn and grow from them and to never repeat them. And when it comes to the matters of the heart, the regrets and the what ifs are something that can never be fully forgotten. Love can be a defining moment in one's life. It can be refreshing, hopeful, beautiful, poignant and yet heartbreaking. And when our chance at love is lost, it can be so devastating and life-altering that it can put into perspective of the people who really matters in your life. If we really reflect on our choices, there comes a time where you can't blame someone for walking away if you didn't do anything to make them stay. And in Desperate Chances by A. Meredith Walters, we are reminded that life is about choices. The choice to fight for one's love, the choice to forgive, and the choice to walk away.""Because every single minute of every single day that I wasn't with you was wasted time.""Gracie Cook wholeheartedly was in love with her best friend, Mitch Abrams. All it took was one night for her to ruin everything. Sex with Mitch changed the course of their friendship. Mitch has always been in love with Gracie. He thought the one night that they shared was magical and a turning point in their relationship. He saw it as the time they both finally gave each other their hearts but when Mitch woke up the next morning, his Gracie was gone.When Gracie walked away from Mitch, she was at a stage in her life where she was trying to get her life in order. She was a recovering alcoholic who had just came back from rehab and also trying to conquer her eating disorder. At that time in her life, she was afraid of ruining everything with Mitch and it took her a year to really see that she loved him. For one year, Gracie distanced herself from her friends because she was trying so hard to avoid Mitch since she ruined her chance at love.""I see all of you, G. Even the parts you try to hide.""Mitch was devastated when Gracie walked out on him a year ago. He tried so hard to put Gracie behind but he never really could because she was the only one who ignited passion, desire, lust, and love. She was everything to him. She was his home, his life, and best friend. So when she walked away from him, it angered him. He wanted to hate her but couldn't. When Gracie's friends tells her that she needs to talk to Mitch and tell him how she really feels about him, she faces one of the biggest challenge in her life...to put her heart on the line. Will Mitch find it in his heart to let Gracie back in? Can Gracie grab that one desperate chance to get her second chance at love?Desperate Chances was one of those reads that gripped your heart from the opening pages. It was such a beautiful, poignant, touching, heartbreaking, and compassionate tale on love, healing, and second chances. In this emotionally charged book, A. Meredith Walters did an amazing job showcasing all facets of friendship, love, heartbreak, regret, healing, and second chances. I loved how Ms. Walters stripped Gracie and Mitch's characters to be so vulnerable and flawed allowing readers like myself to understand and relate to their emotional battle. Their struggle with their friendship was written so raw and poignant that it tore my heart to see two people who love each other so much hurting. But in true A. Meredith Walters form, the author was able to break our hearts and yet heal them as she reminds us all that love shouldn't be a secret. If you love someone, tell them. You will always regret it if you don't. So if you are looking for a book that is brimming with emotions and palpable chemistry, then I highly recommend you to read Desperate Chances.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CXK6AH2L4C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VOHOUS#wasThisHelpful","R15CXK6AH2L4C1","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahhh....the Capital Confession Series comes to an end and it's such a bittersweet feeling to say goodbye to this series after I've been so wrapped up with the scandals, gossips, politics, family drama, romance, and unexpected surprises. In the third and final book, Falling for Danger, Chanel Cleeton reunites her readers with one final thrilling, surprising, and romantic suspense that will have readers on the edge of their seats.In Playing with Trouble, we all learned what happened to Kate Reynolds and why she distanced herself from her parents. The Reynolds family is no stranger to having their family name blasted through the gossip blog, Capital Confession and so Kate uses that to her advantage when she decides that she is willing to discover what happened to her fiancee, Matt. For four years, Kate mourned for his death in Afghanistan when his team were killed in action. She has never been able to truly moved on and when papers were sent to Kate showcasing that her father and Matt's father were possibly involved in the military attack, Kate will stop at nothing to bring down her father and the corrupt men who destroyed her life.As Kate delves deeper into cover-ups, her life is put at risk when danger begins to threaten her safety and well-being. When Kate is targeted, she never imagined who would come to her rescue. Matt. For four years, Matt kept the secret that he was alive and didn't die in the ambush. Together Matt and Kate must work together to discover if their parents were involved in the murder of young military men. In order for Kate to find the evidence that she needs, she must keep her enemies closer and that means she has to have a little reunion with her parents. While working together, Matt tries to keep Kate away because he doesn't want to taint her life with his PTSD. Matt has always been the one in her heart and so she won't allow Matt to push her away and she will do anything to show him that she will be there for him. Will Kate's love slowly heal the broken pieces of Matt? And what danger awaits for Kate as she discovers the truth?Chanel Cleeton ended this series with a BANG!!!! Falling for Danger was filled with so many unexpected surprises, twist of events, suspense and danger. If I thought the first two books of the series was scandalous, Falling for Danger took it to another level as we really see how corrupt on some politicians are in Washington DC. But as always, Ms. Cleeton does a perfectly job in orchestrating and interweaving suspense and romance in such an addicting way!!! So if you are ready to fall and get addicted to a series where scandal, gossip, fourberie, and tangible romance are intricately weaved to produce a beautiful provocative and deliciously scandalicious series then look no further than the Capital Confession Series.~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GFGBE2CF19ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMPN1XS#wasThisHelpful","R2GFGBE2CF19ZN","A33ULGLKE24W5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33ULGLKE24W5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mari Hart is a 21 year old naive virgin who certifiable genius. She is 21 years and already has two doctorates. Accomplished academically, she has it all but she is lacking in a social life. Mari doesn't have friends and doesn't know how to interact with the opposite sex. Tired of being inexperienced, Mari decides for one night that she will let loose and have sun fun. Well at least try to have fun and do what normal 21 years do. When Mari attends one of the hottest new nightclubs in Florida, she didn't expect to witness two homicides. Her night of being reckless lands Mari to be targeted by the Greek mafia. As Mari tries to escape, she finds herself getting help with one hot Greek billionaire, Alexi Kosta and all of sudden married to him.The relationship of Alexi and Mari was an insta lust and love which I found didn't work with this book since the author should of showed readers more interactions with them. And I wanted Alexi and Mari to really get to know each other instead of them professing their love. And I honestly thought the story of John and Sylvia piqued my interest more than Mari and Alexi.

"I really have loved Sabrina's past stepbrother books.This one there was many things I enjoyed and many things I didn't.I liked the flashbacks to a point, I felt it helped connect the characters and their feelings and thoughts. But on another note, I felt there was TOO many flashbacks and it took away from the story as well. Does that make sense? it helped and hurt it, I felt. And I would of liked more interactions and things going on. I felt just a sexual connection between them. Nothing much more. Towards the end I started to feel more for them. But at the end was when it started getting good and then the epilogue. Wish that would of been in the story and more on that. It had lots of potential, but fell pretty flat for me. I will continue to read her books though, GREAT writing, very hot characters and scenes. This one just didn't do it for me like prick, Tool, etc. But worth a try. Someone out there may love it. It wasn't horrible. But wasn't as great as past books from this author.""You are mine, Addy. It's a fact. But when I mark you as mine, you'll f****** know it.""""

"I honestly don't know what people expected with this book? a new book?Because it IS FSoG just from Christian's pov. So not sure why everyone is so upset over this. We asked for it, for years. Erika delivered. And we got MANY new scenes that we did NOT get to witness in Ana's pov. His interactions with her, his deepest thoughts, his dreams, fears, his relationships with his staff, family, co-workers, etc. We got to see many things we never from the original. So, no idea why people are not pleased with this?Yes, some stuff was repetitive, dragged out, yes, I found Christian sounding rather British. But I choked this up to his love for British literature, and what not. Do I remember him being that way in the original? not really? but it's been a while since I read the original. There was some stuff that I didn't love. His inner monologue at times was annoying and over the top. But who cares? overall I thought it was well done and I truly enjoyed it. And Christian. I enjoyed it more than Ana's pov actually. We got exactly what we have all been asking for. And I want more. The ending. His realization. I NEED book 2 and 3 from Christian's pov. Especially since book 2 was my favorite. I truly hope Ms. James gives us those other books. The one thing I enjoyed the most and found VERY refreshing was Christian actually has a sense of humor. I really enjoyed Grey and I hope there is more. Well done and THANK YOU Erika, you cannot please everyone.But, pleased me you have :-) be proud of this story!""I wake, with a start.""

"Been looking forward to Rory and Houstons book.I wanted to see where it would all go after Rory read the letter. And it went to hell and back. I felt bad for Rory, my heart broke for her. But her leaving with Liam on a whim really bugged me, I have always had an uneasy feeling about Liam and it seems it was true. I think Rory being gone was good for her in a way. I think Hannah was good for her. Liam,however, was not good for her. And I hope she never goes back to him. Houston I liked a lot better this book. I actually really started to like him and all he was willing to do for Rory and to get her back. And Kenny, well who doesn't love Kenny? he's the best.All in all the story was much better than the first book in my opinion. I enjoyed it and even though I felt it dragged at some parts, it was a enlightening, touching story that I think many could relate to on a level and that many will enjoy. I would for sure recommend this story to others and I'm excited and nervous to see where the last book goes. I just want everyone to find their happy :-)""No matter what your destination is, there's no safer road than the one you take with someone you love.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXY4M2E6SE24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFCS1CS#wasThisHelpful","R3TXY4M2E6SE24","A2A96H9YA1LG7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A96H9YA1LG7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was given a arc in exchange for my honest review.I really can't give much away. You will want to read the finally installment for yourself and find out what happens and if Theo and Cassie have their happily ever after.But I can tell you this, you will NOT be disappointed. This was the BEST in the series. Best writing, best everything. And Justine, unlike MANY authors does not drag stuff out the entire book. And if you have read the books you will know what I am talking about. So that is a TINY spoiler. But this was beautiful from start to finish. It was a fairy tale and I loved every single second. I never wanted it to end and my heart breaks that it's over. The epilogue was perfect, but I will always want more. As I'm sure many of you will also. So if you loved the Lane One series, you will love this breathtaking addition to the series. I highly recommend every single person out there read this series!""I'm starting to.

"I was intrigued by Jace and Ash in Gabes book and couldn't wait to read it. It started off very well and I loved how they hooked up and the plot line that she was homeless and had not such a wonderful life. I really enjoyed the first half of the book and then it started dragging for me and I started really not liking Jace. He seemed to be a douche, hypocrite, et cetera. He really started grinding my gears. I loved that this series has had REAL aspects of a dominant and submissive relationship. But Jace pushed it for me. And Bethany, I really loved her in the first half of the book also. My favorite moment with her was when she let loose, took control, and she of course was drunk. I felt that Jace was truly bad for Bethany, I dunno. I really didn't love their story and it went downhill for me. The ending felt rushed and I was feeling like I am missing something. Not sure. The first book was the best so far and I LOVED Gabe. He is my new man, way better than Christian or Gideon. That book was a 10 star, this, well, not sure about this one. I feel a bit let down and I feel like Jace should of been better, maybe I seen something in Rush that I didn't actually see. Maybe this one just wasn't my cup of tea, mot sure the reason. It wasn't horrible, but was NOT great either. I will give Ash's book a read because I am curious, as was I with Jace. To see what happens and see what happens to him. And of course, more Mia and Gabe! love those two. Now those two I could read about FOREVER! I would recommend the series though, others may love it.  It's worth a try.""The truth is I want you in any way I can have you. The truth is if you told me right now that you could never submit to me, never give me what I want so badly from you, that it wouldn't matter. I'd take you any way I could have you.

"My boss talked me into reading the series. I have seen these books out there, but I felt it was too soon after Gideon and Christian. Felt like it would be similar. And in many ways it was. But Gabe was 100 times better than Gideon or Christian. He is my new favorite billionaire. Sexy and suave. I loved every single second of this book and I'm on to Jaces story now. I think everyone should give Rush a try. Promise, you will LOVE IT!""Not love you?I'd slay dragons and lay them at your feet. I adore you.""""I've waited just as long for you, Mia.

"Have you ever a read a book that was so terrible it was good?Well this would be it for me. It had HUGE potential to be more than was it was, had it been worked and twerked. But I feel if this is some of the authors starting work, it is pretty decent for a first go. I have read stories very similar to this. But I didn't get the ripped off vibe. I really did not like her mother at all, she was a horrible woman. Her roommate was a little...hmmm...odd? creepy? not sure. Haha. She and this story was something else. It was a little far fetched and many scenes I was like that would NEVER happen. And a doctor would NEVER do or say these things. And Shantelle was totally out to left field hahaha. Naive, too trusting, etc. But again, it's fiction and that makes for a story. It was pretty hot though. And by the end I was wanting more and I actually hope there is more haha. Kinda left off on a cliffy and I kinda wanna know more? For 99 cents it was worth it. It wasn't great, wasn't horrible. It was worth 99 cents and for the 20 minute read. I would read more and recommend it for s***s and giggles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FXHAC7AJ4Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJSXJJM#wasThisHelpful","R31FXHAC7AJ4Z0","A2A96H9YA1LG7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A96H9YA1LG7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a ARC in exchange for my honest review.I LOVE Christina's stories so very much. Each story is beautiful and unique. You do not have had to read the previous books in the series to get it. But reading the previous ones so you have an idea of the characters personalities and what not is always good.Dakota and Shane had a relationship years ago and they ended it for many reasons.Fast forward to the future when Dakota's father passes and Shane wants to be there for Dakota. The story was humorous, sweet, touching, made you sad and happy. And there was some mystery as to what was going on in the casino and all of that stuff. It kept you in suspense a little and wondering WHAT IS GOING ON!!?!?!Dakota is a strong girl. But she does not want to let her father down. Will she live in his shadow or break out on her own? can Shane break down all those walls and insecurities? do the two have a chance at a happy life? you will have to read to find out :-)But promise, just like ALL of Christina's books, you will NOT be disappointed :-)Great addition to this amazing series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R326NMCLBX0LON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG9J9U#wasThisHelpful","R326NMCLBX0LON","A2A96H9YA1LG7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A96H9YA1LG7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have very few words for this story.All I will say is...It. Was. AMAZING! and one of the funniest books I have ever read. I could not put it down once I started. A real page turner. Sometimes you get tired of the touchy feel books. The feel good and typical book. The everything is too perfect book. I loved every single moment of this enthralling story. I only wish there was more and hope there will be more Violet and Alex and even Buck and Sunny.

"REALLY, really wanted to love Rock Solid. I have loved all of Rileys previous stories. And I was excited for something new and fresh. But I feel a tiny bit let down. Maybe I was expecting too much? maybe I'm holding her previous characters on too high of a pedestal? I'm not sure. But something feel off with the story, the characters and the connection. I loved the plot between it. Trevor being an addict. Simon being a surgeon and with the tragedy that happened to his hand, he may never be able to perform surgeries again. The concept was great and promising. I just did not feel like Simon was gay. I knew he was bi, but I just didn't get the connection for him as much as I got it for Trev. Trev was great. In some parts the story felt overly rushed and then some parts I felt like there wasn't enough. I felt like the two were really great friends and not too much more. At about 80-90% it started to change for me and I felt the connection more. And then I was really getting into it and loved the last 10-20% of the book. There is a major twist that I didn't see coming and I was in shock and that changed the story around for me. I started to feel more and love more. Some of the intimate scenes I felt were rushed also and didn't feel a strong connection or bond there. Although they were hot, just didn't do it for me. Overall the story was pretty good, the characters were pretty decent. Didn't LOVE Simon. The guy has some issues, but he grew on me more towards the end and once he admitted his feelings and actually showed he gave a damn about Trevor. I hope there is more or even a Blake story. I would and will continue to read and give everything Riley has, a try. It wasn't my favorite. But it wasn't horrible by any means and I'm sure others will love it. But I would still recommend this story to everyone.""You think you took my life from me, too, but you didn't.. you gave me one.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVZ9YUWSNIM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W421QB4#wasThisHelpful","R3DVZ9YUWSNIM9","A2A96H9YA1LG7G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2A96H9YA1LG7G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trust was breath taking.Every word touches your senses. I simply did not want it to end. Couldn't put it down once I picked it up. There was highs, lows and memorable moments. Many obstacles and challenges to over come this time around. Family. Ex lovers. Tragedies.  Things that can happen to any one of us at any given time. Tate and Logan must learn to trust one another and their decisions. And that in the end, they will always make their way back to each other.So much happens in this book. This is all I can pretty much say without giving anything away. But I promise you this. Ella does NOT disappoint. Trust was perfect and beautiful and I truly hope for more Logan and Tate.

"I was given a ARC in exchange for my honest review.Lex does it again.This was as beautiful and touching as the others before it. I loved every single, sweet, moment. Maddie is a sweet, funny, charming reporter. Who one day happens to catch her boyfriend cheating. She heads for the hills. To her friend. Who happens to live next to the next big NFL star. She soon learns that she will be covering him on the news. The two get friendly and fast. The two start in a secret romance. But their romance has many obstacles. The risk of losing her job,the risk of things getting out that they don't want to be, jealous ex's, trust and commitment issues, and much, much more. You will have to read to see how Daren and Maddie's story ends? but if you have read the other stories, I'm sure you possibly have an inkling on how it ends.

She needs to change and give a crap about her children. Try to find some way to make up for being a horrible mother. I hope maybe in another book to come she will do this. Cole, I was proud of and hope one day he has his own book. Jacob and Leila were amazing as always. I love these guys and never want their stories to end. And of course I am DYING FOR A WHITMORE BABYYYY!!!!! PLEASE!!! LOL!!!! Very proud of Jacob also. From the start of his entire series to now. The person he has become. Very impressed and proud.

"I was given a ARC in exchange for my honest review.This is unlike anything Kandi has written in the past. So for that I would love to applaude her for writing something totally differen't and not like her normal romance stories. Proud of her for stepping out of the box.That being said, I did not love nor hate this story. It was in the middle for me. It wasn't that there was anything necessarily wrong with the story, I just found it hard to get into, hard to follow for me. And it didn't grab my attention and COMMAND I read this NOW. It could be in the start I was a bit confused with the poker stuff and the fraternity stuff. I know absolutely nothing about either and I found it hard to pick up or keep me interested. So, that is the reason I do not love and would probably not read it again. The story all on it's own was fine. Kandi writes beautifully. There was a really good story going on there with Kip and what was going on. The characters were pretty amazing, Skyler at times I got a little annoyed with, but over all I enjoyed her. And Kip, WOW. SMOKING is all I have to say. Really enjoyed him. The story is intriguing and sometimes catches you off balance with things that happens. Always a welcoming surprise. The book made me laugh on numerous occasions, so that is ALWAYS a HUGE bonus. Has drama, angst, HOTNESS, everything you could want to read. I would give this book a recommendation for sure. It was wonderful in it's own way. It just wasn't my cup of tea, per se. I will continue to read anything Kandi writes and eagerly wait for her next hit :-)Love doesnt play our games because love is a completely different game in and of itself.

And sadly, I was disappointed in many ways. I can't really say much more, because there is so much that can give stuff away. And you guys need to make that up for yourselves. The story itself was very good. Intriguing. Many twists and turns and unexpected who did its and all that. It was a very cool story and very good twists. I just felt like a lot of certain relationships were forced, didn't feel right and in the end I guess I was just happy that everyone was happy. I didn't love it, didn't hate it.

"Loved, loved, loved Shaken, Not Stirred. I have read every book in this series and loved every single one. This one may of been my favorite though. I LOVED Tenn! he was very HOT and he broke down Casey's wall one by one. I really loved Casey also. She had a crappy thing happen to her in the past and that is why she became the man-eater she was today. She was sassy and didn't back down. Loved it. Casey is scared of anything that involves feelings or commitment, and that is exactly what Tenn is looking for. The two become close and Casey starts to fall head over heels for Tenn. But a death in Tenn's family occurs and he has to rush home. Will everything change? or can Casey be the one he needs when it really comes down to it? you will have to read, this witty, hilarious and amazing book to find out. Promise, you will NOT be disappointed. I enjoyed every second and enjoyed having all the characters from the previous books we loved. You do not had to of read them all to figure this out, you can do it without reading them. It's wonderful by itself.

"I was given a arc in exchange for my honest review.This book is seriously unlike anything I have ever read from Justine or anyone. And possibly my new favorite read of 2014!From page one it captivates you and keeps your interest piqued . Theo is one sexy , rich, alpha. And he has a secret.He slowly starts to fall for the sweet and ""frumpy"" girl in lane one. For almost a year he watches her and slowly becomes obsessed with her every move. He finally works up the nerve to talk to her and they realize they have more in common than they would of have ever guessed. The two are attracted to each other, but Cassie pulls away. She knows Theo's past and doesn't want to be another notch on the bed post. Theo is desperate to show her who he truly is and that he has changed and actually has genuine feelings for her. Will she let him have a chance?He follows her throughout the whole story and its very mysterious and humorous. It keeps you guessing and gripping your Kindle the entire time. I loved every single minute of this book. Could not put it down once I started. I know everyone will love it as much as I do.

"This vacuum is lightweight compared to some larger models, but heavier than I would expect for a vacuum named the Ultra light weight. The good thing is that for its size, the vacuum has great pick-up and did a good job cleaning both carpeting and area rugs. The smaller size is easy to maneuver, transport to various areas of the house, and easier to store than larger models. The pet attachment worked well to remove cat hair from our rugs. The dust cup is described as being easy to empty and it is, so that is a benefit.Black and Decker is a brand I trust, and I have had good results from other products they make, so I expect the vacuum will be as durable as it looks. I have had no issues so far. Although not a heavy-duty model, the vacuum works well for routine clean-up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXAWWQS0NADH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T1QZMG#wasThisHelpful","R1EXAWWQS0NADH","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Archie and Wolfes latest case involves five main suspects who have been accused of making threatening calls against an arrogant, abrasive gossip columnist for the New York Gazette. When the columnist is found dead in his apartment by his young protg, Wolfe is hired to investigate. Archie and Wolfe work their usual magic to solve the case, with the conclusion announced dramatically at a gathering of all the suspects and interested parties in Wolfes office, as expected in a Nero Wolfe mystery.I am so pleased that Robert Goldsborough has continued the Nero Wolfe series. Each new book brings back fond memories of reading books in the original series by Rex Stout, as well as enjoyment of reading a great mystery. Wolfe is a brilliant detective and his right-hand man, Archie Goodwin, is one of my all-time favorite characters, so Im always thrilled to get the chance to read new books spotlighting Archies charm and wit. Goldsborough captures the essence of the characters perfectly, as well the interactions between Archie and Wolfe.  Im pleased that Archies longtime girlfriend Lily Rowan also makes an appearance in the book. I love her character and love her and Archie together.The case at the heart of this story is interesting. I enjoyed the interviews with all of the suspects, each which are on record as despising the victim and had a motive for the murder. The case turns out to be more complex than it appears and I loved the twist at the end and was pleased to be completely surprised by the results of Wolfes investigation. Stop the Presses! was a quick, enjoyable read and fans of Wolfe and classic mysteries will enjoy reading about this latest case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LCN0NOTUX5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504023579#wasThisHelpful","R4LCN0NOTUX5Y","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"California zookeeper Theodora Bentley gets a rare opportunity to travel to Iceland. She is sent to pick up a polar bear cub for a new exhibit at the Gunn Zoo. Soon Teddy is helping police detective Thorvaald Haraldsson with her murder investigation and has to be careful that she doesnt become the next victim.The Puffin of Death has the excellent writing readers expect from author Betty Webb, but is lighter in tone than her Lena Jones series. The book has the perfect mixture of a fun-to-read cozy with intelligent writing and interesting characters with whom you enjoy spending time. Another positive is the book provides the reader with a unique Iceland setting, without the darkness of a typical Scandinavian mystery. I liked learning about Icelandic customs and language, while being entertained by a top-rate murder mystery.Since Simon Parr, the murder victim, heads up a bird-watching club, the story includes a lot information about the birds the various characters see. Bird-lovers will enjoy these details, while others may think it slows the action of the book. I enjoyed most of the information, but sometimes the plot did seem to slow, but that was only partially due to the birds. In spite of some slow spots,I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Poisoned Pen Press in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14JFFQ404WL34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204160#wasThisHelpful","R14JFFQ404WL34","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of Robin Burcells suspense novels, so I was intrigued when I saw this new book by Burcell. This time, Burcell has written a police procedural based on a series by Carolyn Weston, on which the television series, The Streets of San Francisco was based. I hadnt read any of Westons books and I have only a vague memory of some of the old television episodes starring a young Michael Douglas. Burcell says she has merged some aspects of the original books with the television show and I think the result is a success! I really enjoyed this book which pairs veteran detective Sgt. Al Krug with the younger Casey Kellog, who is eager to put what he studied in school into practice. The two work very differently, but are ultimately a good fit. They each learn to be more flexible in their crime-solving methods and bring out the best in each other.The characters are appealing and the procedural elements are both believable and interesting. Descriptions and dialogue in which Krug and Kellog are on the job make excellent reading. On the other hand, while it is tied into the novels main plot, Kellogs love life isnt as interesting to read about, partially because one of his potential love interests wasnt that likeable. I was eager to find out how things turned out in the case, which had plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing about the solution. I enjoyed the rapport between Krug and Kellog and hope Burcell keeps this wonderful series going.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Brash Books. The book was provided to me in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMCFPTDKCY5OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941298850#wasThisHelpful","RMCFPTDKCY5OK","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series by Shelley Freydont is charming and has such a clever premise. The town of Celebration Bay, New York really enjoys each holiday that comes up all throughout the year. Liv Montgomery, whose job it is to organize all of the various festivities, seems to spend her free time solving murders on the side.Trick or Deceit is set during Halloween and I enjoyed reading about all of the events, such as a haunted house competition, in Celebration Bay. I like Liv, with all of her energy and plans for the town, along with her enigmatic assistant Ted. I love the idea of celebrating each and every holiday with gusto the way they do in this festive town. This installment started out slow and it took a while for me to get into the story, even though Ive read and enjoyed each of the prior books in this series. My affection for the characters got me through and I wanted to keep reading to discover the identity the actual murderer out of the various suspects Liv investigated. Because of the slower pace of this book, I would give it 3.5 stars, but because I enjoy the characters and this series so much, I have rounded up to four stars. I am looking forward to the next book and hope it has the spark and excitement of the earlier books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AD6ZTENWI3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425281477#wasThisHelpful","R3AD6ZTENWI3O","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deputy Mattie Cobb, along with a German Shepard named Robo, make up the first K-9 unit in Timber Creek, Colorado. Mattie is assigned to a disturbing case when a young girl is murdered and left in the mountains. Mattie is driven to solve the case to prevent further violence, but also to prove herself as a police officer and as someone worthy to be Robos partner. Mattie is kind and caring, but somewhat prickly. Its fun to see her gain the respect of local veterinarian Cole Walker and no-nonsense detective Stella LoSassio because of her dedication to her job, to Robo, and to doing the right thing. My favorite parts of the book were seeing how well Mattie connected with Robo and with a couple of children who are key to the story, as well as the parts of the investigation when she and Stella worked together.This is a well-written book and the author uses simple, straight-forward language to tell the story. Readers who enjoy M.L. Rowland, Jessica Speart, or early books by Nevada Barr will enjoy this book. I think there is a lot of potential in this series and would enjoy reading further books about Mattie and Robo, and hopefully Stella.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2IKE7SN2V9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629533815#wasThisHelpful","R1K2IKE7SN2V9A","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attractive, stylish diver-style watch with a gold face and a black leather band. It doesn't look too flashy, but it does have a very large face. It is definitely sturdy and feels heavy on your wrist. The larger face would appeal to teens and younger men and is a nice-looking casual watch.It has a second hand, tachymeter, small 24-hour dial, along with small dials for the date and day of the week. It does glow, somewhat, in the dark, but it's hard to tell time without other light.On a side-note, this watch is packaged in one of the largest, heaviest watch boxes I've ever seen! There is a yellow cardboard outer box and then an imitation leather, hinged box that holds the watch. It would make a nice presentation for a gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22BWB73OS798/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y3US#wasThisHelpful","R22BWB73OS798","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robbie Jordan has just moved to South Lick, Indiana, and with the help of her no-nonsense Aunt Adele, she opens a country store/caf. She works so hard preparing for the grand opening and is devastated when a murder throws a damper on the festivities and her fledgling business. Now its up to Robbie to find the killer to make sure her business and her new life in Indiana isnt over before it starts.I enjoyed this cozy mystery and there is enough uniqueness in Robbies character and her circumstances to make the premise of the main character settling into a small town to open a business fresh. Robbies personal situation gave added interest, although the fact that her family kept secrets to begin with, as well as how easily Robbie figured everything out, seems a little hard to believe, but it does set up an interesting situation which could play out in a future book.Some of the side characters could have been developed more as a few were easy to mix up. Even the characters who stood out, such as Robbies friend Phil, needed more background information about them shared. I liked Phil and Robbies young assistant Danna, and others on the surface, but wish there had been more details that brought the characters to life a little more. A cozy wouldnt be a cozy without a potential love interest for the main character and happily Robbie has two, so things could get really interesting in future books.I think Flipped for Murder is a promising start to a new cozy series with a likeable, down-to-earth heroine and an interesting Midwest setting and I would enjoy seeing how Robbie continues to make a new life for herself in the small town of South Lick, Indiana.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Kensington in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U6SU666P0SJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617739251#wasThisHelpful","R2U6SU666P0SJL","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am very pleased with these earrings. They look nice and have an attractive shiny, gold finish. The round portion of the earrings is a little larger than a quarter. They are large enough to stand out, even with long hair, but are surprisingly lightweight. The clasps seem well made and easy to open and close. They are comfortable, but secure, when wearing.These earrings are perfect for treating yourself, but would also make a nice gift.

"Homicide detective Livy Reynolds doesnt have much respect for private investigators, but she agrees to help PI Alex Jennings investigate the disappearance of a senators daughter, Samantha Jo. Livy doesnt really care for Alex, but she needs something to get her mind off her administrative leave from her job and the case is very similar to her cousin Robyns disappearance two years earlier. Although some think Robin chose to walk out on her family, Livy thinks there is more to the story. The case takes some unexpected turns, as do Livys feelings for Alex.This is the third in the Logan Point novels, but the first Ive read. Gone Without a Trace is an enjoyable romantic suspense novel, and I was interested to see what would happen with Robyn and Samantha Jo and also if the romance between Livy and Alex would progress. I found all of the characters interesting, but there were more than a few plot holes. Robyns actions in particular dont always make sense and the premise surrounding her disappearance is difficult to believe.If you dont mind suspending disbelief, this is a quick read with characters you will root for. Ive rated the book 3 stars, but because of the likeability of Alex and Livy, would actually say its more like a 3.5.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Revell, in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OUJSBEWOD7O8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800722825#wasThisHelpful","R1OUJSBEWOD7O8","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reading a new book in the #1 Ladies Detective Agency series is a special treat. Although they are technically categorized as Mysteries, these tales set in Botswana are first and foremost, beautiful stories. Mma Ramotswe, who started the agency, is a compassionate and wise woman who solves all sorts of problems for her clients. In this story, she feels pressured to take a holiday and leave an important case in the hands of her former assistant, now Co-director, Mma Makutsi. With her knowledge of human nature, Mma Ramotswe is usually teaching others, both her clients and her friends. However, in this book it Grace Makutsi, who teaches Mma Ramatswe about friendship and trust.I have never been disappointed by any of the books in this series and The Woman Who Walked in Sunshine is another five-star read. I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end and the highlights are touching scenes between Mma Ramatswe and Mma Makutsi, as well as an amusing scene with the two detectives and Mma Makutsis nemesis Violet Sephotho. Both new readers and those who have read the prior books in the series will enjoy the latest by Alexander McCall Smith.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTK015N7CJ9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030791156X#wasThisHelpful","R3NTK015N7CJ9P","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have followed this series for a long time, and I enjoy reading about Monk and Hester. Anne Perrys novels are always well-written, and there are some very touching scenes with Monk, Hester, and Scuff, the young man they have basically adopted, which were the highlight of this book for me. Overall, however, something was lacking in this installment compared to others in this long-running series.In Corridors of the Night, Monks case with the Thames River Police takes a backseat to a case involving Hester. In fact, the focus was so much on Hester that events with Monk and his team were really meaningless and didnt add much to the book at all. I would be okay if Monks case wasnt the focus, but unfortunately, Hesters case was also lacking. The background on the history of the first blood transfusions was interesting and Hesters situation was definitely suspenseful. It may have been just me, but Hester didnt seem like herself to me. She seemed wishy-washy about the fate of one of the characters who performed atrocious acts in the name of science and that just didnt seem like the Hester Ive gotten to know who is always a protector of women and children. The book kept my interest while I was reading it, but isnt one that will stay with me now that Ive finished it. I am hoping the next installment is up to Perrys usual excellence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TVZ9V8444MZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391380#wasThisHelpful","R2TVZ9V8444MZB","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bella Jordan is recently widowed and unemployed and has run out of options. For the good of her son, Max, the two leave Bedford, New York and head for Chicago to temporarily stay with her judgmental mother-in-law. Car troubles, an unexpected storm, and a pregnant cat in need force them to stop in Lily Dale, New York. Young Max loves the friends he has made in the unusual town, but the penchant the residents have for regularly communicating with the spirit world, as well as a very human murderer, leave Bella unsure about calling Lily Dale their new home.Wendy Corsi Staub has a successful Young Adult series set in Lily Dale, New York, but this is the first book in a new cozy mystery series for adults. I enjoyed the setting and the characters very much. Readers familiar with the authors thrillers will find this mystery just as suspenseful, but less intense and without any graphic violence. A little research show that many of the events, such as the Message Service, and places such as the Sweat Lodge and Inspiration Stump described in the book, actually exist in the real town of Lily Dale.In addition to the appealing setting, the book is enjoyable because Bella is a relatable main character. She is a young widow with a smart, sweet five-year-old son, looking for a fresh start after her beloved husbands death. She isnt over her husbands death, but is trying to move on for her sons sake. Its logical and in fact smart of Bella to be careful who she trusts in Lily Dale, since there has been a suspicious death and other strange events which could be related. However, it gets really old hearing Bella repeatedly say she has to leave Lily Dale as soon as possible, since she at least has a temporary job, a beautiful home in which she and her son can stay for free, and several new friends. The only thing waiting for her in Chicago is the prospect of sharing a small apartment with her disapproving mother-in-law who isnt eager to open her home to Bella or her young son. It also isnt unusual that Bella would be skeptical of some of the self-proclaimed psychics in the town, but she goes a little overboard in her fear. However, the plot kept my interest from the beginning to end and the town is full of quirky, likeable characters.It wouldnt be a true cozy without a cat, but Chance the Cat, based on a real pet of the authors, isnt just something to add to the cozy feeling of the mystery. Chance plays an important role in leading Bella to Lily Dale and to helping her solve part of the mysterious happenings at the Valley View Manor. Everything is wrapped up at by the end of the book, but the stage is definitely set for a sequel, which I would love to read. I recommend this book for those who dont mind a bit of the supernatural in their mysteries. However, there is nothing so over-the-top that it makes the book far-fetched, so its a great balance of the natural and supernatural.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WA09FFN5198H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532487#wasThisHelpful","R2WA09FFN5198H","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a major set-back in their house-hunting caused by a dishonest real estate agent, Hannah Ives, and her husband Paul, have finally purchased a seaside cottage they love. Its a historic building, so it needs an abundance of restoration work to make it inhabitable. When work is being done to repair the chimney, the contractors discover the mummified body of an infant. Its obviously not a recent death, but Hannah will not rest until she is able to find out who the baby was and why the body was hidden.This book is part of The Hannah Ives mysteries series. Ive read a few of the prior books, but its not necessary to have read any of the other books to enjoy this story. Hannah is a likeable main character who is intelligent and independent and also has a great relationship with her husband who is also smart, kind, and unlike in many mysteries, supportive of Hannahs investigating. Their kids are grown and they were looking forward to enjoying their new cottage before the horrible discovery of the infants body. I enjoy reading about Hannahs quest for the truth. Some of the middle parts of the book grew a bit repetitive and the story doesnt have the suspense of Dark Passage, an earlier installment in the series. However, this is a very well-written book containing many interesting historical facts, including information about interracial marriages in this country in the 1950s and 1960s that I wasnt aware of.  I found this to be a satisfying mystery with a touching ending.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Severn House.

"This book is nice for some light reading to get you in the mood for the holidays, but is not my favorite book by Wanda Brunstetter. Although the story is upbeat and often amusing, I feel the characters dont have enough depth for the book to warrant a rating higher than 3.5 stars.The main characters in the book are twins Thelma and Elma Hochstetler who are almost identical in looks, but very different in personalities. Thelma sometimes come across as flighty, but she is kind, loving, and fun.  Elma is organized, serious, and sometimes nagging, but has a good heart. The twins are supposed to be in their early thirties, but come across as much younger, not all of which can be explained by their Amish way of life. The story would have been more enjoyable if their ages matched their actions. They are away from home for the first time and as a way to become a part of their new town, they agree to bake something to sell at a charity auction. Their lopsided Christmas cake serves the purpose and leads to them meeting two eligible bachelors, quiet, hard-working Joseph and handsome, outgoing Delbert.The twins have never been married, but they havent given up on marriage, so they are eager to get to know the two men and see what happens. Thelmas outgoing personality is the perfect complement to Josephs shyness, while Elma and Delberts strong opinions and no-nonsense attitudes creates obstacles to their romance. The couples have various ups and downs and a well-meant girlhood promise almost gets in the way of happiness for one of the pairs. The bond between Thelma and Elma is a highpoint of the story.Ive read and enjoyed several of Wanda Brunstetters Amish novels. This book was written by Wanda, along with her daughter-in-law Jean. What I like about this book is its written so that there is the expected happy ending, but the story takes some unexpected turns. Everything doesnt turn out perfectly for all the characters, and I appreciate this realism. The Brunstetters give us a glimpse of the Amish way of life and show us that not all Amish people are the same, even identical twins. The book has a fun plot with some very touching moments, but unfortunately, there is too much silliness and not enough depth to the characters in this short book. The authors do provide a nice bonus, though. The recipe for the famous lopsided cake is included at the end of the book.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Shiloh Run Press.

"Maggie Crozat has returned to the bayou of Pelican, Louisiana to help her family run their bed-and-breakfast. The Crozat family plantation makes a beautiful place for guests to stay, but its barely turning a profit, and thats before the family are suspected in the murder of one of their guests! Its up to Maggie to prove to the police chief, who happens to hold a serious grudge against the Crozats, that someone outside her family is guilty of murder.I really enjoyed this Southern mystery. The book has an interesting mix of characters, both the natives of Pelican and the guests of the bed and breakfast. Most of the characters are unique and some a bit quirky, but still realistic. Only Rufus Durand, the police chief, is a bit over-the-top in the animosity he has against Maggie and her family. The mystery provides plenty of possible suspects and Maggie is a likeable amateur sleuth. She has plenty of chemistry with detective Bo Durant, in spite of the fact that hes Rufus Durands first cousin. As rude and narrow-minded Rufus is, thats how pleasant and kind Bo is and hes a great match for Maggie.This is a wonderful debut in what is hopefully only the first Cajun Country Mystery. It has a cozy feel with a warm, Southern setting and fully developed characters, an interesting plot, and plenty of humor. This fun mystery by Ellen Byron reminds me of a cross between a book by Anne George and Debbie Macomber and I look forward to reading more from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ICDCKZ9S2PR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532509#wasThisHelpful","R2ICDCKZ9S2PR0","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Its almost Halloween and Lucy Stone and her family are getting ready the upcoming celebrations taking place in their hometown of Tinkers Cove, Maine. In fact, Lucy thinks her husband Bill is going a little overboard in the preparations and is tired of Bills friend Evan making himself at home while they work on their contest entries. However, Lucy never would have wished for Evan to meet the fate he did and is devastated when Bill becomes the main suspect in his friends murder. Lucy knows her husband is innocent, so she wont stop until she finds the real killer.I like the main character of Lucy, who is likeable and fun and has a great sense of humor. I liked Lucys friends and family members as well, especially her easygoing husband, Bill. I hated how the local police officers latched onto Bill as a suspect without a proper investigation, but was glad to see that Lucy didnt give up and that their friend and lawyer was there to help.There were a couple characters I didnt care for. One was Lucys daughter-in-law whose over-the-top rules for her young son left me shaking my head, but luckily she was only in the book briefly. Lucys grandsons preschool teacher, Heidi, was equally self-righteous and annoying and I was surprised to see the other women in the town allow Heidi to get her way in planning a ridiculous Halloween party for the children of the town.Overall, I enjoyed the book. I like the cozy writing style of the author. However, I did confused about who was who in the Cousins family, which made it hard to follow all of the plot details. I have to give kudos to the author for dealing with a serious subject in such a creative way. Flashbacks of a young woman from 1979 tie into the overall mystery as well as the domestic violence theme which plays an important role in the story. This gave depth to an otherwise lighthearted mystery novel and was very well-done.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Kensington Books.

"Grace Blade is a caring, compassionate psychologist specializing in the treatment of patients who have gone through traumatic events. Its not just her training that helps Grace to get results  Grace survived horrific events in her own life and knows what it takes to survive. However, the calm, cool Grace has a secret life that nobody else knows about. When her personal and professional lives collide and put Grace in danger, she finds herself involved in a murder investigation and playing a very dangerous game.I have read almost all of the books in Jonathan Kellermans Alex Delaware series, so I was eager to read this book, featuring a different main character. Both Grace and Alex are intelligent, clever, and excellent therapists, the two characters are very different, as is the tone of this book compared to the Delaware novels. Graces childhood years spent with her biological parents and then a series of foster homes had an everlasting effect on Graces life. She is extremely intelligent, but regularly behaves recklessly. Although I admired her courage and intelligence, it was hard to relate to some of the things she did both before and during the investigation.Not all of the story is believable, but I still found it to be an exciting book. Although I didnt fully connect with Grace, I cared what happened to her and found the flashback scenes of Grace with her various foster families to be very interesting. When she was fortunate enough to be given a good home, the interactions with those families showed another side of Grace. After a big build-up, the ending was a bit of a let-down, but I still enjoyed the book and found it hard to put down.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Ballantine Books.

"Electronic Scrabble Twist is a great idea and it more like an electronic version of Boggle in which players can make as many three, four, or five letter words as possible from a random group of letters before time runs out. Simply press the buttons on the unit to spell the words and twist to save the word - the bigger the word, the more points you receive for that word. Unfortunately, I love the idea more than the execution. There are both good and bad features of the game, which Ive summarized below.Good: Games are quick and rules are basic The game can be played by anywhere from 1 to 8 players, depending on the game mode There are different games that can be played and different levels of difficulty with varying lengths of the time players are given to find words The game quickly shuts off automatically if not in use The letters will automatically display in the right direction even if the unit is turned, which is good for the party mode in which the unit is passed and also means it works well for both left and right handed players The Turbo mode, for head-to-head play between two or more players is fun The sound can be turned off for quieter playNot So Good: The worst part of the game is that the letters are hard to read and is a strain on your eyes after playing for a while. People in my family of all age groups said the same thing. Three AA batteries are required, but theyre not included The instructions on using the game unit arent clear (I was able to figure out how to use it by playing the game a few times.) The solo mode tracks high scores, but not by name. It doesnt feel like youre working toward anything since you cant really compare scores from game to game since it depends on the letters you had for each game. When the sound is on, its loud, even at the lowest level. Different sounds do alert you that youve played a valid word. A second sound plays if the word youve played is invalid or a duplicate. Sounds also let you know if time is about to run out, but I found that this distracted me from finding my final words","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VU9T1VD7RPG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THAGEJA#wasThisHelpful","R2VU9T1VD7RPG1","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eddie G. has just been promoted from his job as a pit boss at the Sands and is trying to get used to his new position of Casino Host. He doesnt mind catering to the high rollers coming into the casino, but it feels strange to him to be getting paid for just sitting around at the hotel bar. Eddie doesnt have much time to think about things because he soon finds out, the hard way, that somebody is trying to kill him. Eddie would have helped him anyway, but when he gets a request from his friend Frank Sinatra to help Judy Garland with a problem in Los Angeles, its the perfect reason to temporarily leave Las Vegas!I really enjoy reading the books in the Rat Pack series. The atmosphere and characters are perfect and the books transports you to 1960s Vegas, and in this case, old LA as well. There isnt as much involvement in the book by Frank and Dean, but I enjoyed getting to know Judy Garland. Although the book is fictional, I learned some things that actually happened in Ms. Garlands life that I never knew before. The fictional characters in his series are just as appealing as the real ones. Eddie is a tough guy, but an honest person and a loyal friend. His part-time bodyguard Jerry is a great mixture of toughness and vulnerability and he and Eddie make a unique and likeable pair. I enjoy seeing them get into scrapes, dodging danger, and helping their famous friends.This installment of the series has an intriguing beginning and is action-packed throughout the book, wrapping up with a touching ending. There are other books in this series that Ive liked more, but its still a fast-paced, fun read that will make you feel like youve taken a step back in time and spent some time with the real Rat Pack.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Severn House Publishers.

"Caprice De Luca enjoys her career as a home stager in the small town of Kismet, Pennsylvania, but is wary of her newest client. She agrees to help Alanna Goodwin sell her home, only as a favor to Ace Richland, a prior client and friend. Alanna is difficult to work with, but when Alanna is murdered, Caprice is saddened and also worried about her friend Ace, who seems to be the main suspect. Caprice is determined to find out who is really responsible for Alannas death, even if her informal investigation may made her the killers next target.Ive not read any of the Caprice De Luca Home Staging mysteries before, but Drape Expectations is the fourth in the series. I was able to quickly get to know Caprice and her friends and family. Caprice is a free spirit, preferring Beatles t-shirts and flats to business suits and heels, but she is intelligent and creative and makes an excellent amateur sleuth. I love seeing Caprice interact with her family since they are all there to support each other in times of trouble. Caprice is also right in the middle of a love triangle. She would love to see if she could make a relationship work with Dr. Seth Randolph, but he is away in Virginia for a one-year fellowship and his future plans are unsettled. She has known Grant, who is now an attorney, since he roomed with her brother Vince in college, but recently their long-time friendship seems to have potential to become much more.I found the mystery to be interesting and Caprice a refreshing and likeable character. The dialogue is well-written, although some of the transitions between the characters conversations and the books narrative could sometimes be smoother. However, I enjoyed the book and would love to see what happens next for Caprice. I enjoyed reading about her custom-themed open houses, which are really spectacular real estate events, and this unique profession makes an interesting addition to the story. Cozy mystery lovers will like this clever, fun-to-read mystery.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Kensington Publishing.

"American Pru Parke is now a permanent resident in England and is now planning her wedding to Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Pearse. However, before they become husband and wife, Pru agrees to complete a short-term assignment at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. This assignment will challenge her gardening knowledge in a new way. She has hired to determine if a journal was actually written by botanist and explorer Archibald Menzies. Not everyone at the garden is happy with Prus involvement and when a difficult co-worker is killed, Pru herself becomes one of the main suspects.I feel fortunate to have discovered author Marty Wingates cozy novels. This is the third book in the Potting Shed mysteries and it doesnt disappoint. Pru balances the stress of a new assignment, planning a wedding, and then investigating a murder with her usual intelligence and grace. She is an interesting main character and I love reading about her relationship with Christopher. The premise of this installment, as well as the investigation, is equally interesting. I enjoyed this book and am eager to see what will happen next for Pru and Christopher.

"This is an excellent portable speaker with a lot of fun packed into the design. Even the packaging is fun. Its like a poster with the speaker rolled up inside. There is one drawback, though, since the few instructions that are included with the speaker got torn when opening the package!The speaker itself has a cool design. Its lightweight, but sturdy and comes with a small bungee cord attached to make it easy to carry. I also like the unique bright yellow color of the charger, which is just another thing that makes this speaker different from others Ive seen or used.I was pleased that the speaker was charged right when I took it out of the package. It was easy to pair, which is good since the torn directions were hard to read. Most importantly, the speaker has a great sound at both low or and high volumes.

"Im very pleased with this Lightening charger from Belkin, which is a name I trust for electronics accessories. The charger worked well for charging an iPhone 5. I like that there is a light to indicate its plugged in. I also like that its not bulky once its plugged into the dashboard. The charger, also can also be used in the house, so its not strictly a car charger, which makes it even better.The length is awkward. Four feet is long for a car, but even in my small car, it doesnt reach from the front to the back seat, so the extra length gets in the way more than it helps. However, I still like the charger and am happy it works so well with iPhones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGDXFIL417JU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCGL8HU#wasThisHelpful","RQGDXFIL417JU","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chilling Effect is the second in a new series by author Melissa F. Miller. I read (and enjoyed) the series debut, but its not necessary to do so before reading this excellent follow-up novel. As in the first book, Aroostines Native American background and reliance on her spirit guide for wise advice put a new twist on the typical legal thriller.Aroostine is supposed to be relaxing on a romantic vacation with her husband, Joe, but she cant resist getting involved in a case when her boss in Washington, DC calls for a favor. What looks like a routine embezzlement case at a Native American casino turns into a dangerous dance with a killer. Aroostine and Joe work together to tackle this case and once again, Aroostine uses her Native American background to help in solving the case.I really enjoyed this book and would love to read additional installments in this series. Aroostine is a strong, independent woman and makes a great main character. She is brave, caring, and compassionate and does what she thinks is right, usually ignoring the consequences. Sometimes her husband Joe seems selfish to me, but he really grows personally and in his support of this wife in this book. The case is intriguing and will keep you guessing at who the killer really is. I enjoyed the fast pace and the authors writing style. I would recommend the book for fans of Thomas Perry or James Doss.I received this book from NetGalley through the courtesy of Thomas & Mercer.

"When you pick up a new Barbara Delinsky novel, you expect to read about a strong female character, some sort of conflict to be overcome, and of course some romance. Ms. Delinsky delivers on all counts in her latest novel, Blueprints. There are two main characters, a mother and a daughter, each with strong opinions which provide obstacles in their relationship. In the midst of all their problems, somehow each finds romance.I liked Caroline from the beginning of the book. She learns she is being forced out of her job for someone younger. This is becoming more common in the workplace, but Carolines situation is unique  she is being replaced by her own daughter! Caroline hosted a home improvement TV show and network execs want her daughter, Jamie, who previously took a back seat to her mother, to take over the lead role. Caroline becomes suspicious of Jamie and unfortunately when a tragedy strikes, the two become estranged, just when Jamie needs her the most.It took me a little longer to warm to Jamie, but once I did, I was rooting for her and found myself taking her side in her problems with Caroline. I dont want to give anything away, but Jamie was forced to take on a huge responsibility and she definitely rose to the challenge.The book was fast-paced and kept my attention from the beginning to end. There were parts of the story that frustrated me, though. The male love interests of both mother and daughter are both wonderful, but the male leads who arent so nice seemed one-dimensional. Jamies relationship moved unrealistically fast, even though the story is sweet. My biggest complaint is that it doesnt ring true that a mother who had previously been so close to her daughter would abandon her when she really needs her because of pride. Maybe this would have been believable if their relationship had been strained, but the two adored each other before Caroline lost her top billing on Gut It! The ending is great and even though I didnt love every part of the book, I liked the book and I think other fans of Delinsky will enjoy the book as well.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of St. Martin's Press.

"Lucy Toomey always looked up to her big sister Alice, especially when Alice saved in life. Later in live, Alice is the one who has an accident that leaves her mentally impaired. Alice remains self-sufficient and happy with her life in the small town of Nilsons Bay, Wisconsin, but longs for her sister Lucy to come for a visit. Lucy talks to Alice on the phone almost every day and takes Lucy on trips, but having left Nilsons Bay for an exciting life in politics, she has no desire to revisit her hometown and many of the unhappy memories she has of that time in her life. Just when Lucys hard work may be leading to a job in the White House, sad circumstances lead her to a forced sabbatical in Nilsons Bay. Lucy is now forced to examine both her past and her future. I like the character of Lucy and the way the story unravels. Lucy is forced to evaluate her career, where her life is heading, and what she wants in the future. Before she can do that, she has to remember some events from her youth she would rather forget. I like the message of the book and how the story shows how hard forgiveness can be, especially when the person you most need to forgive is yourself. I was fairly certain how the story would turn out. I wasnt wrong, but I liked the ending and was happy for the ways things turn out for Lucy.This is the first book I have read by author Marie Bostwick. Although some parts of the story were predictable and some a bit melodramatic, I enjoyed the book and story of Lucy and Alice.

"This is a fun ride-on toy for kids. I like that it sits close to the ground, which makes it better for younger kids, but the design is still cool enough that older kids will still like it. The dune buggy has a lot of good features. First, the blue color will appeal to both girls and boys. The vehicle has two speeds, which is nice. However, the parent lock-out needs to be removed to access the higher speed. The lock-out is a screw thats fairly difficult to remove because of its location. The higher speed is definitely needed to easily ride in the wet grass, even on flat ground.  Its fairly easy to steer the vehicle and is a lot of fun for kids to drive.To stop the vehicle, take your foot off the gas pedal. It will still slide a little on pavement, possibly because of the plastic wheels. It also will continue to slowly roll going downhill, even on a small incline. Thats why even though the guidelines say ages 3 to 7, I would use caution for younger kids unless you have a large, flat area with no nearby hills. Older kids, up to 11 or 12, will like it, too. However, with the position of the steering wheel, their height will determine how well theyll comfortably fit in the dune buggy and be able to easily steer.Be sure to charge the battery the night before using the first time. The battery only lasted about 15 minutes right out of the box after being putting the car together. I also learned the hard way that the dune buggy is heavy to push if it does bog down or if the battery dies. (The battery is rechargeable battery, but there isnt a battery indicator, so I wasnt expecting it to go dead so quickly.)Once the dune buggy is assembled and the battery is charged, its a lot of fun for kids. The assembly is a chore for adults, though. I took almost an hour and a half to assemble. Most of that time was spent putting on the wheels. The directions arent clear and some of the screws are hard to get to and there isnt room to use an electric screwdriver. As long as you allow enough time for assembly and charging the battery, this dune buggy will be a hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWJYA0HT6YZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTYXTGY#wasThisHelpful","RYWJYA0HT6YZD","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Critical Vulnerability is the first in a new series by author Melissa F. Miller. The main character is federal prosecutor Aroostine Higgins and when the story kicks off, she is having the worst week of her life. It all starts when Aroostine is assigned a high profile case with little time to prepare and a very unsympathetic judge presiding. Things go downhill from there when Aroostine is plagued with mysterious clerical errors affecting her case, a fire in her home, and a near fatal surgery. Soon she realizes this isnt just a run of bad luck - someone is trying to ruin her life and she is determined to find out why.This is the first book Ive read by this author and I really enjoyed it. I liked the main character and the plot kept my interest throughout the book. I would have liked the characters to have been fleshed out a little more and a more backstory given. However, the narrative did get right to the heart of the plot and resulted in a fast-paced book. Also the information given about Aroostine really sets the book apart from other legal thrillers. Aroostine was adopted at a young age, but still follows some of the Native American customs she learned at a young age from her biological grandfather. Aroostine uses the tracking skills she learned as a child and in times of trouble, her spirit guide is there to help her.The fast-moving story, unique main character, and Aroostines interesting background make this a great book.

"I have the pink and white polka-dot case and I love it. It's a cute case for a reasonable price and fits my Galaxy Tab 4 perfectly.

"I have read both books in this authors Potting Shed series and liked them, so I wanted to give this debut book in her new series a try. Im glad I did, because as much as I liked those books, I enjoyed this one even more. The pacing of this book is better and I found it a quick and fun read. In the beginning, the main character, Julia Lancaster, seems a little stubborn as she refuses to accept that her father has remarried. However, as the reader learns more about the situation, its easier to understand Julias point of view. I soon came to enjoy the character very much.Im not a bird watcher, but I do enjoy watching birds at my backyard feeder, so I found the bird watching aspect of the story interesting. As mentioned, I like the main character. Julia is down-to-earth, which make her easy to relate to. I love the chemistry between her and Michael. Not everything runs smoothly in their growing romance, but I like that the misunderstandings they experienced werent allowed to continue too long and instead provided a realistic and entertaining romance that added interest to their investigation. The murder mystery itself is interesting with enough suspects and red herrings to keep the reader guessing and eager to find out what would happen next.Readers who enjoy a cozy with an English setting as well as bird watchers, will want to read this charming book. I hope there is a sequel soon because I can see this series becoming one of my favorites.I received this book from NetGalley through the courtesy of Random House/Alibi.

"Assistant Prosecutor Elsie Arnold regrets that someone has been killed, but cant help but be happy she has been assigned to her first murder case. A woman has been brutally murdered and the prime suspect is a fifteen-year-old boy. This is a case that could help Elsie make a name for herself or could backfire because of the suspects young age. As the case goes on, Elsie feels like everyone is against her, including her boss, co-counsel, boyfriend, and even her own mother.  Elsie has never felt so alone, but is determined to learn the truth about the murder, even when it appears the investigation could be putting her own life in danger.A Killing at the Creek is author Nancy Allens fast-paced follow-up to The Code of the Hills. I read that book first, but dont worry if you missed the debut in this series. This book stands on its own and can be enjoyed without having read the prior book. I really liked the first book, but enjoyed this one even more because of the intriguing plot. It first appears to be an open and shut case, but the plot takes a few turns that kept me guessing about the murder and the accused.As much as I loved the story, the best part of the book is the richly drawn characters. The characters are human, and none of them are written as all good or all bad. Even Elsie, the main character, is an imperfect hero. Elsie is strong and intelligent, but she doesnt always have all the answers and quite often makes poor decisions, especially in her personal life. This is what makes Elsie so believable and likeable. I was rooting for Elsie throughout the book, hoping things turn out for her, both in her career and with love interest Detective Bob Ashlock.A Killing at the Creek offers suspense, humor, insider legal background, and relatable characters with many complexities. I also enjoy the Southern Missouri setting and hope this isnt the last we see of Elsie Arnold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DTPYIQPJJV92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325973#wasThisHelpful","R2DTPYIQPJJV92","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The colors and font are appealing for kids, but the pictures are actual, color photos and not cartoons, so older kids or even teens would not be put off by the appearance of the book.The cookbook starts with an overview of various information about what makes up a healthy diet, weights and measurements, safety and hygiene in the kitchen, photos and names of a variety of kitchen gadgets, and more. Then, more than 150 recipes follow, organized into categories such as Breakfast, Light bites, Main meals, Desserts, Party time and others.I love the way the recipes are presented with a list ingredients, as expected, but also a list of kitchen equipment that is needed to prepare the dish. All have full color photos of the completed recipe and many have photos which accompany each step of the preparation instructions. There are also tips for preparation, storage, or for substitutions with many of the recipes, and are presented in a way to keep things fun while still teaching kids about cooking.The recipes themselves are real meals and desserts and not childish twists on standard recipes. I cant wait to make the white chocolate and raspberry brownies, the BBQ Chicken Skewers, and the baked potato and carrot chips myself. Some such as the cream puff may require some adult help, but others such as the fruit crumble or the beef pasta are straightforward and easy to prepare.Clear, colorful presentation of a large variety of tasty recipes make this a great cookbook for all ages!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4FQ0H52H97V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465435468#wasThisHelpful","RG4FQ0H52H97V","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vanished is the second in The Profiler series by Elizabeth Heiter. Dont worry if you missed the first book. I hadnt read it and had no trouble following the storyline or connecting with main character, FBI profiler Evelyn Baine. Evelyns work with the FBIs Behavioral Analysis Unit is never easy, but her latest case is especially difficult because she has a personal connection to the case. A young girl in South Carolina has disappeared and the crime seems to be related to an abduction that occurred eighteen years ago. That little girl, Cassie Byers, was Evelyns childhood best friend. This new case brings back all the memories and determination Evelyn had to solve Cassies case and she wont stop until she does, no matter what the consequences are.I really enjoyed this book. I wasnt familiar with the works of this author before reading the book, but Im impressed. The book could be classified as romantic suspense, but holds its own against thrillers written by more famous authors. The main character is likeable, but complex, and seems like a real person, with real problems and fears, and who makes mistakes. She is good at her job, but feels like she is always having to prove herself, but doesnt let the politics of the job get in the way of seeking justice for the victims. The case is scary and suspenseful and very entertaining. I also enjoyed the details of Evelyns personal life and her interactions with her partner Greg Ibsen and her love interest Kyle McKenzie. I like the profiler angle and think it adds depth to the story.I had my own suspicions about the identity of the murderer. I was able to correctly guess part of the solution, but the ending still held many shocks. I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next in the series. I would rate the book 4.5 stars and recommend it to those who enjoy a thrilling, romantic suspense story with complex characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K2LTCJGLKOIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317382#wasThisHelpful","R2K2LTCJGLKOIR","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joanna Brady has a busy life  she is a happily married mother of two and is the sheriff in Conchise County, Arizona. In her job, shes currently juggling two murder cases and trying to make sure there are no further victims.This series just keeps getting better and better. All of the main characters are likeable and I love seeing how they have grown. I love seeing Joanna both on the job and interacting with her family. Both cases in Remains of Innocence are suspenseful and one of the cases has a shocking conclusion which I wont spoil by saying too much. The book is completely accessible to anyone new to the series. Those who have read other books in this series will be thrilled with how suspenseful and satisfying this latest installment is.As a bonus, the edition I purchased included a novella featuring Joannas husband Butch. I enjoyed this peak into Butchs life before he had met Joanna and think this is an excellent story. I would definitely recommend the novel and the novella to both Jance fans and anyone who enjoys a well-written, suspenseful mystery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQYNGTH2MXNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006213471X#wasThisHelpful","R1UQYNGTH2MXNP","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monster power high def bluetooth speaker came a few days ago and I tried it out several times over the weekend. First the packaging is top notch and it comes with a usb power cord and a carry bag, instructions were included. Setup was straight forward for bluetooth connectivity, after charging the speaker it connected right away. My issue was with the sound. It did not sound as rich as other speakers I have. I played around with several equalizer settings but never quite got the sound to the levels of other speakers I have, it was good but could have been a little better. An odd note if the phone is in close proximity to the speaker it tended to ""pop"" at high volume (can't say I have ever run into this in the past). The life of the battery was very long compared to others and I spent the whole day listening to music on it. All in all a nice unit with tons of battery life, I may try music off a tablet that I have that has a much better equalizer app than the phone equalizer and see how that affects it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37L25DLUHK2ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4DUVR6#wasThisHelpful","R37L25DLUHK2ZX","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read and enjoyed all of the prior books in Margaret Graces charming Miniature mystery series, and Manhattan in Miniature is no exception. Gerry Porter and her granddaughter Maddie get the chance to travel to New York City right before Christmas to assist Gerrys friend Bebe at a huge craft fair. Gerrys friend Cynthia is thrilled Gerry will be in New York because she needs Gerrys help investigating her Aunt Elsies suspicious death.I love this series and really enjoy the friendship between Gerry and her granddaughter Maddie. Maddie is a tween that usually manages to be cute and precocious without being obnoxious. I think she is at her best in this book. She is growing up and is a huge help to Gerry as she tries to balance her obligations to Bebe with her determination to help Cynthia. Cynthia is sometimes unreasonable in what she expects of Gerry, but other than that, I really enjoyed the book. Its wonderful seeing New York at Christmastime through Maddies eyes and the case of Aunt Elsies death kept my interested from the very beginning. I enjoyed my time with Gerry and her friends and family and can't wait for the next installment!Its not necessary to have read the other books in this series to enjoy this clean cozy. Fans of this series and this author (who also writes mysteries under the names Camille Minichino and Ada Madison) will enjoy Gerry and Maddies newest adventure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEVO6PC3B7QJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564745627#wasThisHelpful","R2GEVO6PC3B7QJ","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some long-running series seem to have books with recycled plots, but author Anne Perry keeps the series fresh with her latest installment in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series. The storyline in The Angel Court Affair is about Sofia Delacruz who is visiting London from Spain to preach her controversial message about love and Gods forgiveness. The events in the book take place at the end of the 19th century and most consider Sofias beliefs to be blasphemous. Even those who arent as judgmental feel uncomfortable by her message. When a vicious murderer strikes and Sofia is missing, its up to Thomas Pitt, commander of Special Branch, to solve both.I enjoy the uniqueness of the plot, even though some of the major points in the story were a little repetitive. It doesnt take long to realize Sofias message is offensive and its not necessary to keep saying that in different ways. Also, there is too much drama surrounding Thomas and Charlottes daughter Jemimas reaction to Sofias message and her disappearance, although she and Charlotte have a touching moment in which Charlotte encourages Jemima to be herself.My favorite parts of the investigation are the ones in which Aunt Vespasia and her new husband Victor Narraway, former Special Branch commander, are on the case. They were an unexpected, but delightful couple and I love their scenes. I like the book because the storyline is so different, but whats really missing in many of the newer Pitt books is Charlotte. Thomas acknowledges the high profile and high stakes of the cases he now investigates mean he has to keep many things about this cases confidential and cant discuss them the way he used to with Charlotte. As much as I enjoy Aunt Vespasia, I miss Charlotte having an active role in Pitts cases. I hope Perry finds a way to have her more involved in future books, because to me she was the heart of this series.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Ballantine Books, in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8YIBFKITYOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391356#wasThisHelpful","R1K8YIBFKITYOW","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the Fall is the first book I have read by author Patricia Gussin. The book has several subplots that do eventually come together in support of the main plot of dirty dealings going on during the approval process of a new drug that could help save lives. Laura Nelson is the main character who after a tragic accident is forced to change careers and gets caught in the drama of those who want the drug approved and someone who would do anything to delay that process.The suspense throughout the book is wonderful and once I started, I didnt want to put it down. Laura is intelligent and determined and I enjoyed reading about her. Some of the male characters didnt have a much depth and were clearly the good guy or the bad guy. The bad guy was a jerk without many redeeming qualities, but Lauras love interest seemed too good to be true. At one point in the book, Laura confides to him that she had been keeping a major secret from her deceased husband, one that could speak to her integrity and he barely blinks and says its okay with him. I would have expected a little bit of a dilemma on his part. I also found some of the dialogue to be unnatural which made some of the scene awkward. However, the plot grabbed me enough that I was able to ignore the flaws and still kept reading, eager to find out what would happen next in Lauras life and in the fate of the new drug going up for approval. Although it doesnt have all of the elements of conspiracy, I think fans of Robin Cooks medical thrillers would enjoy this book.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Oceanview Publishing, in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFY8P6F32GSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608091279#wasThisHelpful","R1OFY8P6F32GSM","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main character and reluctant amateur sleuth in See Also Murder is a book indexer working from her farm in rural North Dakota. Marjorie Trumaine has the responsibility of creating the index for each new book assigned to her by her New York publisher. She puts her organizational skills to use to try to figure out the identity of a murderer before its too late.The idea of someone creating a book index from home, after learning the trade from a government correspondence course was intriguing to me and it was just as interesting as I hoped. I enjoyed learning more about the course and the profession, which apparently really was offered to farm wives in the 1960s.Marjorie has a rough life and the murder of her neighbors which begins the book is just one of the tragedies she has experienced. Marjorie tries to remain stoic, but she becomes the most likeable when she lets her show through her exterior toughness. The atmosphere of the book is oppressive due to the small town, Marjories responsibilities at home, and the danger of a killer on the loose. You can feel her burdens and isolation throughout the book. For this reason, the book isnt a light, cozy read but I was still able to finish the book quite quickly. The tension continues to build as the story progresses keeps the reader interested in what will happen next. The reader is kept guessing at the identity of the murderer and especially the reason behind the crimes.This is an excellent book and it author Larry D. Sweazy has follow-up books planned, I would be interested in reading more about Marjorie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D0DUD744P6L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880060#wasThisHelpful","R2D0DUD744P6L8","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a surprise that such good quality sound comes from such a small speaker. When I received this speaker I thought it was on the small side and wondered about its performance. I linked it up to my phone and BAM! The quality sound and the shear volume was just surprising coming from a speaker this size. It was simple to link and overall was very straight forward in its operation.

The bath mat is a little smaller than I had expected, but is a nice size for a smaller bathroom.The pink in the curtain, mat, and hooks has a purple tint to it and goes well with the gray and white.

"This product is a very large bag (approximately 160 pieces of candy, per the description) of only Blue Raspberry flavored Jolly Ranchers. The weight printed on the bag says its 88 ounces or 5 pounds, 8 ounces of candy. Blue Raspberry is my favorite flavor because to me it has the perfect level of sweetness  sweeter than apple but not as sweet as the cherry or grape flavors. The candies were in perfect condition when they arrived and those I tried tasted great as expected.This large bag isnt resealable, so this is best suited to purchase for occasions when a bulk supply of candy is needed and you want all of a particular flavor or color. The light blue color of this specific flavor would be perfect for making party favors or a large bowl of candy at the center of the table at a baby shower.  Depending on school colors, this could work for a graduation party, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22H14E459HXJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3WWWMO#wasThisHelpful","R22H14E459HXJ3","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a dark, dark wood with snow-covered roads and a home with spotty cell phone coverage and a broken landline, Nora Shaw is attending a weekend hen party that goes wrong. Nora is an author and loves nothing more than staying home writing, but surprises herself when she accepts an invitation for a weekend in the English countryside to celebrate the wedding of Clare Cavendish, an old school friend she hasnt seen in ten years. She and friend Nina barely arrive when they both have second thoughts about the weekend. By the time they decide to cut the weekend short and return home, its too late!The story is told in the first person, narrated by Nora. Most of the book takes place at the weekend bachelorette party for Clare, but then there are other scenes which are first are hard to tell if they are flashbacks or flash-forwards. There is tension and a strong sense of foreboding throughout the whole novel. Its a face-paced book, and about half way through becomes very intense and impossible to put down. Part of the ending is satisfying, but also heartbreaking and left me full of what-ifs, wishing things could have turned out differently.One thing that was a bit jarring to me is that the author, setting and characters are English, but the mixture of British words and slang (mum, hen party, postcode) is mixed with talk about Texans, rednecks, and running nine miles. I dont know if this was the authors wording or a change made by the publisher, but when I came across one of the clearly American words, it took me out of the story.I was able to guess at some of the pieces of the puzzle before they were revealed, but still found this to be an enjoyable, suspenseful thriller and I came to care about Nora even when it wasn't clear if I should be rooting for her or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I3LPY579L9RU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501112317#wasThisHelpful","R2I3LPY579L9RU","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Manhattan Mayhem is a collection of all new short stories by some of the most popular of todays mystery writers. The collection contains almost twenty short stories, each focusing on a different area of Manhattan, such as Jeffrey Deavers story set in Greenwich Village, a story by Julie Hyzy which takes place in Central Park, and a tale by Mary Higgins Clark with a Union Square setting. The book has nice touches to support the theme. There are small maps at the beginning of each story showing the street location of the books setting. There are also actual photographs of New York included.I had the opportunity to read an advance reading sample that included only the first four stories of the collection. The first is Nancy Pickards story of a young woman who receives tragic news and is then murdered. This story is set in the Upper West Side of Manhattan which fits the story well. I was surprised by the twist this story took and enjoyed it very much.The second story is by author S.J. Rozan and is set in Chinatown. Its told from the mother of Rozans beloved detective Lydia Chin. Lydias mother is frustrating in Rozans novels, but Chin Yong-Yun is a clever and entertaining detective in this story.I wasnt familiar with Ben H. Winterss mysteries before reading his Chelsea-set story in this sampler, but I enjoyed his story about actors in a play written in the format of a play. I love the humor and laughed out loud several times.The fourth and final story in the sample I was able to read is by Brendan DuBois and takes place in post-World War II Times Square. The historical setting is interesting and the ending is surprising.If the first four stories are any indication of the rest of the book, this will be an excellent collection of mystery stories for those who love New York or just love a well-written, entertaining mystery. I would definitely like to read the entire collection!Update:  I was able to receive the full book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Quirk Books.The entire book lived up to the promise of the first four stories I had previously read in the sampler. Of course as is to be expected with an anthology such as this one, my reactions to the stories range from love to dislike. However, there were only a couple in this collection that left me confused or unmoved. Most are excellent and worthwhile for those who enjoy a well-written short story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IYBDHDOJOBY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159474761X#wasThisHelpful","R3IYBDHDOJOBY4","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been reading Mary Daheims Alpine series for a long time. I enjoy main character Emma Lords sharp wit and seeing the inner workings of a small town newspaper. The banter between Emma and her co-workers has always been amusing and the friendly bickering between Emma and Sheriff Milo Dodge entertaining. Best of all has been Emmas friendship with co-working Vida Runkel. The two women dont always see eye-to-eye, but have always been there for each other when it counted. Sadly that element is missing in the prior installment and much of this one.I was glad to see Emma and Milo finally realize how much they love each other a few books back, but their funny squabbling has been replaced by two much mushiness, even for newlyweds. This book is a little better than the previous installment. Emma and Milo are still acting like teenagers going steady, but seem more like themselves. Vida is completely obnoxious in the beginning of the book. Although her tirades are somewhat humorous, Emma and Vidas friendship has been the highlight of this series. I like when things get closer to normal by the end of the book and Emma could confide in Vida and trade theories about the strange things going on in Alpine. Those things are an eccentric young woman coming to town with a strange story about her parents being murdered and the current danger she is in, as well as a dead body found at the town dump. The various subplots are interesting, but the most important part of this book is the wrapping up of various things in the characters lives since I have come to care about these characters after reading each of the books in this series. I had assumed this would be the final installment of this series, but the author's website said this isn't the end. I recommend Alpine Zen to readers of other books in the series, but new readers would be better off reading a few of the earlier books before reading this one.I received this book from NetGalley, through the courtesy of Ballantine Books.

"Single mom Kate Page is one of three investigative reporters trying to land a full-time reporting job with a well-known news agency. Kate uncovers a story about a young mother who becomes separated from her baby during a deadly tornado. This is a tragedy, but it appears the baby may have been kidnapped. Despite the objectives of her new would-be boss, Kate refuses to give up on this investigation, both for the sake of the story and for the mother and baby.Whirlwind is the first book by Rick Mofina featuring investigative reporter Kate Page. I first read the follow-up to this book, Full Tilt, and because I liked the character of Kate so much, I went back to read the series debut. I enjoyed seeing Kate fight for a job in the face of strong competition and office politics and I admire her determination to cover the story of the missing baby. Kate feels a connection with the young mother, who feels guilty that her baby is lost, perhaps abducted, in part because of the guilt Kate feels over the disappearance of her little sister many years ago. Kate also wants to land a full-time job so she will be able to better provide for her young daughter.The story is told from multiple points of view, which allows the author to move the story forward with information that Kate would not know about. However, I prefer the chapters told from Kates point of view. The others often interrupt the flow of the story and sometimes causes it to drag. The story behind the babys disappearance is complex and some elements, like the involvement of a Russian mobster, are far-fetched, but overall the book is interesting and exciting. The information presented about what people must face in the aftermath of a natural disaster provides an excellent backdrop to the story. There are a few random events toward the end that deflate the drama that had been building, but the story is suspenseful and I was glad for the chance to read another of Kates adventures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGN4T3QEBCB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778316092#wasThisHelpful","RKGN4T3QEBCB4","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Investigative reporter and single mom Kate Page is no stranger to tragedy. After twenty years, she still hasnt gotten over her feelings of sadness and guilt over her little sisters disappearance. A body of a young woman is found in upstate New York, possibly the victim of a serial killer. Kate is shocked when she learns there could be a connection to this case and her sister Vanessa. When the investigation becomes dangerous, Kate refuses to let it go until she can finally find out the truth about her sister.The is the second book by Rick Mofina featuring reporter Kate Page, but the first one I read. I had no difficulties getting to know Kate or catching up on important details about her life. The mystery about Kates sister was intriguing and the reader is left guessing how or if Vanessas disappearance is connected to the horrific crimes under investigation. Kate puts her reporting skills to use getting to the bottom of the case and refusing to give up until she finds out if Vanessa could have survived the long ago accident and if she did, has she now become a victim of murder.The chapters told from Kates point of view are the best. Details like Kate putting her young daughter Grace to bed before she can get back to researching her story make the book realistic and helps the reader get to know Kate. These are also the most exciting and fast-paced chapters in the book. Those told from the point of view of Ed Brennan of the Rampart police department and other law enforcement and forensic personnel arent as successful. The supporting characters are interesting and these chapters serve to move the plot ahead and give insight into the investigation. However, they arent as compelling as the chapters focusing on Kate and end up slowing down the story. Ultimately, as all of the pieces of the book start to fit together, the story remains exciting no matter who is telling it.I enjoyed the book as well as the main character and would read other books featuring Kate Page. Readers who enjoy Hank Phillip Ryan will enjoy the character of Kate and the premise of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CF6NT97PT8DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317455#wasThisHelpful","R2CF6NT97PT8DI","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ani FaNelli is petite and beautiful and appears to have it all. She has a glamorous job in New York City and a rich, handsome fianc. Even though Ami seems to have a bright future ahead of her, she cant seem to forget her traumatic past, when she was known as TifAni and struggled to fit in with her peers, which may just get in the way of the new plans shes making.TifAni makes a lot of poor choices in her youth and as an adult, shes hard to feel sorry for as she complains about starving herself to get down from a size 2 to a size 0 and not being able to afford to buy the latest from designers the average person hasnt even heard of. However, Ani does grow as the story progresses and I think most people can relate to feelings of not fitting in or being judged based on your physical appearance or your background.The book has been compared to Gone Girl, but it reminds me more of Bond Girl by Erin Duffy. Both deal with what happens when your dreams seem to be coming true, only to discover what youve always dreamed of may not be what you thought it was going to be.  The twists and turns in Luckiest Girl Alive are not just surprising, but downright shocking, and sometimes difficult to read. However, the story has stayed with me and Im glad I read it. I was pleased with how Ani chose to overcome the tragedies she had experienced. There is more to Ani that what it appears in the beginning, so its worth sticking with the story to find out all the details of her school days and how the story progresses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16B8CWYDE2ND9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789630#wasThisHelpful","R16B8CWYDE2ND9","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compulsion is a follow-up to Notorious and is the second of Allison Brennans novels to feature investigative reporter Maxine Revere. Max is covering the trial of serial killer Adam Bachman, who is accused of killing five people. Max thinks a missing couple who havent been seen in almost a year are also victims of Bachman. However, when Max starts digging into the case to try to prove her theory that Bachman is working with a partner angers her boss and the prosecutors office and may just put her in the targets of a dangerous killer.Max is a driven, sometimes bossy character, but her determination to help victims wins my respect and makes me like the character very much. I enjoy seeing the contrast between the toughness Max shows with the bad guys and when facing the politics of her job with the softer side she shows when dealing with victims family members. Supporting characters such as Maxs personal assistant/body guard/friend David Kane and Queens, NY detective Sally OHara have depth as well and play an important role in the story. In fact, I could easily see David and Sally in a spin-off story of their own.Compulsion starts out as a compelling, but typical thriller in which the main character learns something in a course of an investigation which puts him/her in a killers crosshairs. However, the book takes an unpredictable turn which is as exciting as it is surprising. I love this latest Max Revere novel by Allison Brennan. Fans of Hank Phillippi Ryan or Rick Mofina will enjoy this suspenseful novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30JOEXIKW7SLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250035023#wasThisHelpful","R30JOEXIKW7SLM","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enjoyed this standalone book by Debbie Macomber. I enjoy her Blossom Street, Cedar Cove, and Rose Harbor Inn Series. This book is different than all of these, but will appeal to Ms. Macombers fans that enjoy the Blossom Street series. Last One Home features a strong female character who fights adversity to make her life better.Cassie is a single mom, a hair stylist, and also volunteers as a victim advocate for abused women. Cassie experienced abuse in her own marriage and although she is currently free and safe from her ex-husband, her life will be forever changed because of what she went through and is currently estranged from her sisters. I liked how the book opened with a prologue showing the reader how close Cassie was with her sisters Karen and Nichole at one time and makes you even sadder seeing how their relationship turned out when they grew up.As the book progresses, I enjoy seeing Cassies life turn around for the better and seeing her interact with her daughter, Aimee. I also like seeing Cassies growing friendship with her Habitat for Humanity mentor, Steve.  The details about the Habitat for Humanity program are interesting and make a relevant and unique setting for the book.Overall, the book is enjoyable and it was a quick read for me. Less effective was Aimees matchmaking attempts. I was happy to see that after all she had experienced in her young life, she was open to her mom getting involved in another relationship and possibly even re-marrying, but her blatant matchmaking wasnt as realistic and seemed silly. The characterization of Cassies sisters was a little too over-the-top for me, too. Their dismissal of their sister seemed harsh and their characters seem very harsh and judgmental at the beginning of the book. By the end, they are more likeable, but I never could relate to their characters.Last One Home isnt my favorite book by Debbie Macomber, but judged on its own, still a sweet story of friendship, forgiveness, and second chances at love that her fans will enjoy. Readers who enjoy books by Luanne Rice will also like this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVXBOGW1TPMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391887#wasThisHelpful","R2QVXBOGW1TPMD","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lap desk by LapGear is small and lightweight, which makes it comfortable on my lap, as well as easy to store. I like using my netbook small PC to type in Word documents, respond to E-mails, and surf the Internet while sitting on the couch, and this lap desk has become invaluable. Its perfect for holding my PC and the wrist rests make it comfortable to type.The media slot holds a variety of sizes of tablets. The Kindle Fire HD fits well for watching videos. I have a large smart phone (LG Vista), and it fits well, too, and would also be great for watching videos.In addition, there is a no slip area on the surface of the right-hand side of the lap desk to place your phone so you can keep it handy and keep it from sliding down the desk.I am very pleased with this lap desk. It has been a while since Ive used one, but the compact size of this one makes it more useful and more comfortable to use. I definitely recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NE5GJILUTYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ19TXE#wasThisHelpful","R34NE5GJILUTYR","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small/Spot carpet cleaner that does the job well. I used it to clean carpet in the car and the size was great. It really got down and cleaned out spots and dirt that were deep in the carpet. I also used it on upholstery in the car and in the house. It cleaned the vehicle seats so they were looking new. Also used it on a chair in the house and it cleaned that chair more than I ever thought it would.The unit is self contained which helps when moving around the different areas of the car and made the task easy to complete and quick to finish.

"Trixie Matkowski enjoys serving the residents of Sandy Harbor, New York the best in comfort food from the Silver Bullet Diner. Shes happy to learn that her best friend Antoinette Chloe Brown has decided to open an old-fashioned drive-in movie theater right next door. A fun groundbreaking ceremony is planned, but the excitement turns to horror when the digging reveals the dead body of Antoinette Chloes missing boyfriend, Nick. Trixies friend is devastated over Nicks death, but if thats not bad enough, Antoinette Chloe is arrested for the murder. Trixie knows her kind-hearted friend is not the guilty party, so she decides to start her own investigation to find the real murderer.The best part of this book is how funny it is. Reading the title, ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Death"" is so clever and the writing in the rest of the book is just as humorous. The quirky characters and funny situations as worthy of a Janet Evanovich novel. Fans of that series will enjoy the adventures of Trixie and Antoinette Chloe. This is the third novel in the Comfort Food series, but this is the first one Ive read. I was able to quickly catch up on who is who in Sandy Harbor. The only thing I cant understand is why Antoinette still seems half in love with her ex-husband, who apparently tried to kill both her and Trixie in a previous book.I enjoy the comradery between Trixie and Antoinette Chloe as well as the friendship between Trixie and Ty. I dont know if the hunky deputy Ty will be more than just a friend to Trixie in future books, but its obvious there is chemistry there, even though Trixie tries to deny her attraction to Ty. This may sound picky, but the name Antoinette Chloe is a mouthful. Sometimes Trixie and Ty refer to her by the nickname ACB, but unfortunately most people call her by her full first and middle name each time they talk to her or about her, which soon becomes monotonous to read.The book is entertaining because of the interesting characters and funny dialogue, but Trixie could use some help in the sleuthing department. At one point in the story, Trixie and Ty acknowledge that ACB is in danger from another possible suspect in Nicks murder. Strangely, only a couple of paragraphs later, the two are completely baffled as to who would possible have a motive for framing ACB. There are a few other times when Trixie isnt able to figure out some pretty obvious clues. Perhaps in future books, even if they dont get together as a couple. Trixie and Ty can work together so they are better equipped for an investigation.Everything gets wrapped up at the end and the epilogue is cleverly done in the format of an e-mail from Trixie to her Aunt Stella. A few recipes from the diner follow this to wrap up the book. There are some missteps in the book, but overall, I enjoyed the story and would read another in this series to catch up on whats happening next in the lives of Trixie, Ty, and ACB.This review was originally written for Smitten by Books. The book was provided to me in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCHZXIIN32LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451415108#wasThisHelpful","RJCHZXIIN32LW","A1H88L8X6HM1BQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H88L8X6HM1BQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this goal zero recharger. This is the second Goal Zero product I've used, and I like this one a lot better than the other (a solar powered portable speaker). I'm not a serious hiker, so my use-case for this is less about trips into the woods and more about emergency preparedness. I was once in a situation in which a phone was out of battery at a time when it was very much needed, and since then I've taken steps to ensure that that'll never happen again. In this case, I find this to be an outstanding product to keep in my car.It's easily rechargeable using a USB port, and it also has solar panels. It can charge a phone, act as a flashlight, or spin a handheld fan. Having this on hand brings me a peace of mind that I think is very important. It's compact, easy to store, and easy to tote.

"These Philips Fidelio Headphones are simply outstanding.1. The materials: Leather padding, strong materials.2. The fit: The headphones fight snugly, not overly tight, very comfortably. The result is the best noise-blocking I've ever experienced with headphones.3. The sound: Fantastic. The music comes through clearly, well-balanced, better than any headphones I've ever used.The only thing I would change is not a fault in a product, only an item on my wishlist: If only they could plug into standard jacks and not just the newer Apple products. I have some other devices I would love to use these with, but that's not what they're made for. Do note, if purchasing these, which product they're compatible with.Though I do not consider myself an audiophile, I do appreciate good comfort and sound (both of which are necessary).

"I won't say The Dark Knight Strikes Again is the worst graphic novel ever written, but I will say it's the worst one I've ever read. I simply could not find things to enjoy as I experienced boneheaded decision after boneheaded decision. I will not go on at length, but essentially it boils down to this:1. The plotting is a mess, with too many characters and no solid foundation.2. The art is poor throughout.3. The jokes aren't funny.4. The core ideas are not interesting.5. The presentation is questionable at best (multiple splash pages of a Superman/Wonder Woman sex scene, for example)Others have written about all these things extensively. For me, it's important to say that I knew it would be less-than-great going in, but I had no idea it could be this bad. With a third Frank Miller Dark Knight graphic novel due to come out, I was hoping this wouldn't be too bad and the third would make up for it. As it is, I don't think I can ever read Frank Miller's later work again. I regret having read this. My advice is to enjoy The Dark Knight Returns and stop there. As a completist in most things, I normally wouldn't say that, but in this case I think it's the wiser move.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14W6490E7SN0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1563899299#wasThisHelpful","R14W6490E7SN0T","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two problems with this product:1. It does not making my charging area less messy. To charge devices, you still have to have long cords very close together. It's still a bit of a tangle and not very attractive.2. The slots aren't big enough, and they are not adjustable. The phones in my house all have cases. Without the cases, the phones would sit happily in the slots, but with the cases, they are a tight squeeze or just don't fit. Most people with phones have cases, and phones are larger than they used to be, so I'd advise anyone looking to purchase this to note whether its thin enough to fit right.The hope for this is that you can get a lot of charging done in a consolidated area while using just one outlet.

"One thing's for sure: Florence + The Machine have a distinct sound. Big, bombastic, emotional, cathartic, dense . . . no one else sounds like this. At once modern and timeless, this is a band (and especially a singer-songwriter) who is in it for the long haul, carving out a place that will outlast the trends of a season or a year.On their third album, F+TM have created their most immediate music, delving deeper into the sounds and song styles that made their first pair of albums such successes. One could easily argue that it is a retread, and perhaps doesn't push farther away from their core sound. I think that would be a valid criticism, but I also think there's something very special about a band at its peak. Especially looking at the first three songs here, I could already assemble a ""best of Florence"" playlist that would be as good as many long-established artist's Greatest Hits collections. These are the defining years of the first era of this group, and I do hope they are able to expand further on this sound in the future, as well as explore some different lyrical territory, but for now I'm excited and captivated by this new set of songs.Ship to Wreck, What Kind of Man, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, Third Eye - these are instant classics. Meanwhile, the rest of the album thrills and haunts in equal measure. This is a great album, one that will most assuredly satisfy Florence's fans, and I suspect it will continue to draw newcomers in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZWVDH5T5EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THEH4UY#wasThisHelpful","R3FZWVDH5T5EH","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For technical details, there are some very good reviews already written for this product, so I really recommend you check them out. My review concerns my own behavior as a limited user. I'm not using this as a complete backup in coordination with time machine, but am instead interested in this cloud drive as a second backup for all my digital music, and I'm interested in how it is used when accessing my entire collection remotely.My first issue when I got this was that my mac (bought in 2011) didn't have a recent enough OSX. It needs a minimum of 10.8, so I spent $20 to upgrade to 10.8.5, which isn't the most current OSX but meets the minimum requirements. It was a helpful coincidence that my internet was upgraded at this same time, so I've got a very strong connection in my house. Having done that, I plugged in the Personal Cloud, it found the internet, interacted with my computer very quickly, and was set up in mere minutes.One thing I didn't like during the set up was that other download windows popped up during the product registration. Seagate should not let that happen. Their site should be free of that kind of nonsense. At first, it seemed to indicate I had to download some extra software, but then I realized it was just spammy sites that had nothing to do with this product.It was very easy to set up a password and to install the associated Seagate Media app on my phone and tablet. One thing I didn't realize at first, due to the lack of documentation provided by seagate (you can get some info online, but they should really include more in the box), is that you can only access the things in the ""Public"" folder remotely. The stuff in the folder with your user name is only accessible when connected within your network. This raises certain security questions. ""Public"" doesn't mean accessible to anyone in the world, but it's unclear to me how the limitations are established so that only people who are logged into this cloud can reach it.I was able to stream music remotely while at the gym, as well as from my house, but the Seagate Media app is, so far, not a particularly smooth means of selecting music. iTunes remains the gold standard as an interface, and I'm fine with the music app on my android phone or the amazon app. The seagate interface is not great in this regard, but may be ""good enough"" if I'm only using it occasionally.This comes preloaded with some classical music, lame photos, and videos. The music is a nice little bonus, but the photos and videos were pointless, so I just deleted them.There are a number of features I don't expect to use from this that enable streaming to a television or automated backups. Overall, I'm very pleased with this backup for my music.I'm increasingly paranoid as my collection has grown quite large that something will happen that results in my losing all those mp3s, and this is an excellent tool for me to use in addition to my other external hard drive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUBF2YAAEENG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZZZN84#wasThisHelpful","R1NUBF2YAAEENG","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family's used air purifiers for a few years now, starting even before we had our child. The first one we ever got was much too big and noisey, and the second one was a pretty nice size, with some different settings. This AeraMax is every bit as good as that other one, and possibly better, with one small caveat: the blue display lights.This purifier is extremely easy to set-up, right out of the box, and it has some different fan settings, which is great, because it can run very quietly or go up to another setting, which mostly helps in terms of being a white noise maker. The only thing, as I mentioned, is that it has glowing display lights. In this age of electronic everything, it sometimes seems like you can't escape glowing lights, when you just want the room to be dark at night. The solution is simply to turn it to face away from the bed, but that would be the one thing I'd change about this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HEEI7VJXNTKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V31B14E#wasThisHelpful","R2HEEI7VJXNTKV","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very good, basic electric toothbrush. There are other toothbrushes with bluetooth that work with apps to track habits, or light up, or do all sorts of extra things that I think just go too far. The features here include: adjustable speeds, vibration to help time your brushing, and that's about it. To be clear: I like that.Charging is easy, and charges last a very long time. The brush head itself is smaller than I'm used to, but it's fine, and I didn't notice the size much after only a few uses.The main thing I like about this is that they don't overload you with features that get in the way of simply brushing your teeth. When you have lots of features, there are more things that can break, and an investment in an electric toothbrush is one that should last a while, so that's the only remaining aspect yet to be seen. Hopefully this will last for years to come, as it's a good tool to keep my teeth feeling good and remaining healthy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16V47WOG8KG0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67T3O#wasThisHelpful","R16V47WOG8KG0N","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Curious George Teach stuffed animal has been a very nice addition to my daughter's stable of animal pals.Her first reaction when she saw this was, ""The monkey!"" because she knows him from ""the monkey book"" we have, a Curious George collection that we've read with her numerous times. The second thing she said was, ""Monkeys don't wear clothes!""George's outfit has a few features that kids can use to explore their developing dexterity: a button, a snap, velcro, a buckle, string. Another thing I like is how extremely soft he is. Most stuffed animals are soft, of course, but this little guy is just fabulously soft and smooth. I highly recommend this as both a learning toy for young children and as a treat for fans of the Curious George stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31Q7GDSV35BPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOSSYSA#wasThisHelpful","R31Q7GDSV35BPD","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice, simple magnet set. It really is exactly what you see pictured: all the letters of the alphabet with accompanying pictures, made of wood, with a good strong magnet on the back. My daughter is 2.5 years old right now, and she had a set of animal magnets that she uses on our refrigerator. The instant we handed her this box, she launched into a little dance and cheered, ""magnets, magnets, magnets!"" It's a really good, portable, easy way to keep her occupied in the kitchen, and I think is the perfect gift for kids of that age, especially since it's not a noise-making toy that could irritate parents. Also, it's a good way to support teaching kids their letters. I was pleasantly surprised when my daughter picked out the first letter of her name, recognizing it as such. I definitely recommend this magnet set without reservations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YDY6IBU6T340/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NF7OAI#wasThisHelpful","R2YDY6IBU6T340","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steve Earle (whose hobbies include political activism and getting divorced) is truly one of the great musicians of our era. His songwriting is second to none, and his gift for melody and tone are outstanding. His post-prison run of albums were astonishing, with Transcendental Blues being the peak of his greatness, along with El Corazon and The Mountain. Since that time, his albums have gotten a little more uneven, with a lot of great songs, but also a few clunkers, and a little less of the magic that made the first couple phases of his career so exciting. Earle is at his worst when he slips into his ""spoken word""-style poetry, as he did on ""Warrior"" back in 2004. He only slips into that mode once on Terraplane, but it's not so egregious a misstep. The rest of the album is Earle doing what he does best: creating music that fuses country with roots rock and, in this case, a whole lot of blues.The sound suits him well. Though his voice isn't quite what it once was, it's still quite expressive, and this style of music fits his gruff singing and lyrical style better than his New Orleans-inspired songs. These songs are not boring retreads of old blues riffs, though blues riffs abound. There's a variety of tones and tempos, from gentle balladry, with Earle's distinctive finger-picking style, to thumping blues-rock. If it doesn't match his high points of late '90s into 2000, that's understandable. It nevertheless returns him to a place that I think was missing a bit from his recent albums. Terraplane is every bit the album I was hoping it would be, and it is a welcome addition to one of the great catalogs in modern music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37T153K6ER3YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYXHY20#wasThisHelpful","R37T153K6ER3YY","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tone Pro is really quite good, but it's very important to note this particular style of earbud and neck band is not suited to everyone. I've had a lot of trouble with different products with this style of earbud, as they tend to fall out of my ears. Other people I know swear by this kind and generally have better results than I do.The most notable, and unusual aspect of this product is the band that sits on your shoulders. Again, this is not suited to everyone. I would be too self-conscious to wear something like this for all to see, but, conversely, it's an improvement over clunky bluetooth earpieces if you have it under your jacket in the winter so that only the earbuds are exposed.The sound is quite good through the earbuds, and the controls are very easy to use. I had a little trouble reading the instructions, as the print is excruciatingly small, but luckily the product was pretty easy to get used to.A big issue I've had with bluetooth headsets has not been a problem with this one: connectivity. Music has been playing fine, without losing connection, even when interrupted with a phone call. Switching to and from a call has been surprisingly easy, and overall the function is the best I've used in the past few years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGN81S430AKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO0IHMY#wasThisHelpful","RGN81S430AKD","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember my father's pillow from when I was growing up. It was very thin, a little lumpy, and seemed like it had been completely beaten down over the years. By contrast, my mother's was puffy, not unlike the kind you get at a decent hotel. I wondered why my father used such a worn out old thing, but as I got older I found myself having the same preference for thinner, somewhat harder pillows. For a while, I'd been using a pillow I'd describe not as thin, but as very firm and quite heavy. It was good. This Classic Brands pillow is a little better.It's firm, but it does give to accommodate the shape of the head lying upon it. It's a very nice size, and, best of all, the cover is the exact size of the pillow and zips around perfectly, so you don't get any of that pillowcase-slipping-off stuff that can be a bit irritating. I find this pillow very comfortable and hope it can maintain its shape and behavior for the long run.AS for the ""cool sleep"" aspect, I confess I can't fully analyze that at this time (the middle of winter). In truth, I doubt that it'll be that big of a deal. The main most important aspect of any pillow, by far, is how well it supports your desired sleep comfort level, and this pillow has thus far met my needs wonderfully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OXQG1DURDP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLM47AG#wasThisHelpful","R39OXQG1DURDP4","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lock was very easy to install and set-up. It's sturdy and secure, and we were very happy to install it at my brother's home. I mention that specifically because I felt a bit leery about installing it at my row home that only has one major entrance (the back can be accessed, but only through a narrow back area).My only concern about this is the fear of the battery losing power. There is a way to jump the battery, but I fear that that would ever happen and leave me stuck outside for any reason, even temporarily, especially with my young child still in the house.For my brother's house, though, he's got a few entrances, including a garage door. Having this combo lock gives a great keyless option for any visitors to get in without the need for transferring keys or (something I've never liked) using a hide-a-key. Ultimately, I think I would feel slightly better if I could only use keyed entry systems, but I really like the idea of having both options available for a home with multiple entrances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNN1VTUUEYD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N12FD10#wasThisHelpful","R1KNN1VTUUEYD7","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many parents fantasize about sharing their interests with their kids, whether it's loving Star Wars or going to baseball games, weaving or reading, or any number of things. One thing I've looked forward to is sharing my love of tennis. One question is, how young can one get their child out there playing? Even if you have access to public courts, there may be a time limit, the net may be too high, or it may be too inconvenient to get there on a regular basis. One of the great things about this set is that it gives younger players a new option, as well as equipment that can be used by younger kids before venturing out to play full-size (think tee-ball before baseball).A problem for me is only that I live in a place that does not have a lot of flat surface area. I can't help but laugh at the demo video, showing people playing on a perfectly flat driveway. I'm not aware of any non-sloping driveways anywhere I've been, and, living in South Philadelphia, I don't even have a driveway or parking or any place nearby to set this net up (at least, not safely, as the only option near me would be the middle of the street), However, I do have a relative with a cement back ""yard,"" and my brother and I used to play all sorts of games back there growing up. This net fits that space perfectly.It's easy to set up and put away. It comes with a case, so traveling with it in the trunk of a car is minimally intrusive, and it's got everything you need to get started. I love that I can play with my nephew, and in just a few years my daughter as well.

"I give this Linksys router a good rating, but I'd like to relay the story of how it was problematic for me to install and resulted in my not using it. Instead, we installed it in my brother's apartment, where it installed and works great. (Details about that are at the end of this review, if you want to skip down.)I went to set it up, and things started out okay. And then I got a message on the Web that my internet provider had temporarily disabled my account. (In fairness, I won't list the name of the company for the purposes of this review.) But the site wouldn't let me log-in to my account to deal with it. And so the customer service dance began.I called the provider and went from mildly frustrated to red-hot mad as the automated system, over and over again, told me to log into their site for support. When you can't access the internet, that kind of stuff is not helpful.When I finally got to a customer service guy, I tried to explain that I couldn't access my account, and it took us a while to get on the same page as to what was going on.As it turns out, my account wasn't suspended (connecting the computer with the cord worked fine), so the error message wasn't accurate. And, ultimately, the guy said to me, ""You know, we could test out the connection problem with the Linksys for who knows how long, but there's a different solution that take care of all your problems. Our latest modem has built-in wi-fi, so you don't need a third-party router, and if anything breaks, it's all stuff we can control and deal with.""They upgraded me to their latest modem/router at no charge, so I went with that. In the time since then, I have had no connectivity issues, and I'm confident if something goes wrong that they'll be able to address it.So, my first experience with the Linksys router was that it was incompatible with my older modem and unnecessary for the new one. I contacted my brother and sister-in-law to see if they'd like to try this router, so we installed it at their house. They had long suspected, as it turns out, that their current router was not giving them a good enough connection. The sense with the Linksys is that it has improved the connection. Installation and set up took a total of 5 minutes, and we had no issues whatsoever with suspended accounts or any other hassles. The router itself looks nice and modern. It came with a number of disks, none of which were necessary to use.In conclusion, I'd advise you to confirm you need a third-party router of this kind. If that is in fact the best route for you, and you have a compatible modem, the Linksys works well, with an easy install and improved speeds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWN5OT8MDZA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I21EA2#wasThisHelpful","RWN5OT8MDZA2","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These clippers keep things nice and simple. I've owned a number of clippers over the years. My *favorite* was a device that caught fire while I was using it. I'll never forget that day when I had to go to a store (on a warm day, with a winter hat on) to get a replacement so I could finish the job.These days, I don't go for the crew cut, but I'm still a hairy guy, and it definitely grows faster than I'm willing to go to a barber, so I need to take care of my sideburns and my neck on my own. I have some clippers with a dozen pieces and various settings, but after a while, you just don't want to deal with the bulk and the big case when it's really just a small, quick job that needs to be done.With this Remington, though, you get two great things, if your needs are just trimming a bit: A name brand that you can trust for a long lasting product (I'll update this review should it fail prematurely) and a small, easy to handle product.

"This is a solid water bottle. The textured grip is very comfortable, and this is an ideal size to replace purchasing bottled water with this filter that should last anywhere from two months to half a year or more, depending on your frequency of use. It's easy to take the lid off and twist it back on, and it has a cover to prevent any minor leaks when tossed into a bag.When you first use it, the instructions tell you to fill it with water and squeeze it out so some black gunk can come out. Heed this instruction. You certainly would not want to drink that. Once cleared, though, everything is easy as can be, the water tastes good, and it can easily become part of your regular routine.The one criticism I have is that there isn't a line marked for how much to fill the bottle to get it full after the filter piece (which is part of the lid, basically) descends. If you fill the bottle all the way, you'll displace some and get some spillage. I fill it to the top of the textured grip, but there's more room. I think the bottle should mark the ideal height of the water before the lid is replaced. It's easy to figure out, though, so it's not a big deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y36X1ITM52KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2SPF9M#wasThisHelpful","R1Y36X1ITM52KM","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this scale. Its base is a good size to stand on and see the numbers without a struggle, with a large text display. I found the set-up very easy and intuitive. When I get devices like this, I like to try setting them up without reading the instructions, and I was able to do so without any problems. (I then read the instructions to confirm I hadn't done anything stupid.)The scale seems accurate, though my wife complains that it gave a reading of 2 lbs heavier than our other scale. I kind of think this one is the correct one, as it's newer, with a fresh battery, but she's unconvinced. (By the way, I think it's funny how the sample weight listed in the product images is 126.4. Interesting that they don't make the sample reading 210 or higher, isn't?)I'm not sure the BMI reading can really be trusted, as it's a calculation without the ""pinch test,"" as there's an obvious health difference  between muscle and fat in terms of where exactly one's weight comes from. I find it is best taken with a grain of salt, but is a good tool in terms of comparative measurements. There isn't an exact weight that's perfect for one's height, as some people are wider or slimmer due to genetics, but having these numbers available can be very useful when tracking goals one might set for oneself.Another good aspect is that it is consistent. I've had scales before that gave slightly different numbers if you stepped off and back on a few moments later.

"I'm always curious about new gizmos, and I love to use technology to make my life, if not easier, then at least more interesting. The Oral-B Bluetooth toothbrush is at the very least an intriguing idea, offering a service that simply never would have occurred to me. The problem is, I think it wouldn't have occurred to me because it's just so unnecessary.The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is based completely on the toothbrushing experience itself. To put it simply, this is just plain the best electric toothbrush I've ever used. I have never in my life gotten the same ""fresh from the dentist"" feeling at home from any other product. I'm not sure I can do it justice with this description, but it's just so much better than my previous brushes, a noticeable improvement where I didn't think there was room for improvement. It's great.As for the Bluetooth aspect, I tried to approach it with an open mind, but it just doesn't feel worth it at all for me. I have so much to think about in life, integrating an app with my brushing habits is just taking things too far. I can't judge what other people will enjoy on this front, but go in with an understanding of how much thought you really want to give to your brushing.Bottom line, though, is that this device gets your teeth feeling great.

"I really like this Diono Booster. It has two major advantages for my family. First, it is much narrower than our other carseat, so people can sit comfortably in the back seat without the armrest/cup-holder of the car seat jabbing at your elbows. Second, it is good for a wide range of ages. While we have a different brand in our car, we installed this in my mother's car so she can shuttle around my daughter as well as her two other children, the oldest being 6.My brother and his family have had a different Diono car seat for a while and really like it, so that is a good indication that this one will also be good for the long haul.

"This Belkin charging set is a 3-in-1 deal that is very useful. I've had a number of Belkin products in the past, especially their routers, including my current one, and I've generally found them reliable. So, seeing they made this charger kit, I thought it worthwhile to pursue.There are three pieces: The usb cable, which can of course plug directly into a computer, and the two adapters, one for the car and one for an outlet. The picture makes the wall-charger look a bit large, but it's really not. It's rather compact, as is the car charger.So far, it's functioning exactly as expected, without any set-up or hullabaloo. I don't mean to sound corny in saying this, but given how expensive technology can be, and how personal tech items are (I know I wouldn't want someone else picking out my devices), this really fits the bill as a great gift to give someone who already owns an iPhone or iPad of the current versions.

"There's a great Genesis compilation called the Platinum Collection that also goes in reverse order, but there's a huge difference in doing that for Genesis compared with Bowie. For Genesis, going back in time puts the big radio hits first and then gets increasingly more interesting and adventurous as you work your way back to the excellent 70s work and the Peter Gabriel era.David Bowie's career has so many more peaks and valleys, and it's hard to pin down whether certain eras represent an ascent or a descent. There's no way I could come up with a perfect compilation for him, that's for sure. Themes of subject matter, different eras, pop vs. art, and so many more aspects - I think part of Bowie's greatness is how hard it is to pigeonhole him or whittle him down into a career-spanning collection.I originally did not plan to buy this, since I have all of Bowie's albums, including a number of live albums and most of his b-sides and rarities. Some of the non-album tracks that might attract buyers here, like the songs from the lost Toy album, are already in my collection, so it seemed at first that all I'd need is to get the new song, ""Sue,"" and I'd be all set. What ultimately made me take the plunge, though, was the fact that Amazon offered an auto-rip with all of the songs from the main collection even if I purchased the vinyl set. While I don't consider myself an audiophile, I do have an appreciation for vinyl and like to occasionally add to my record collection. This way, I got a collectible, a wonderful set of music on record, and the digital music, so I'm more than satisfied with this purchase. Also, these mixes are in fact noticeably different in some instances, like with Seven, which is much peppier here than the plodding original version. The other remixes/alternate versions are also welcome, like the version of Hallo Spaceboy here, which fares very well in this context, and the outstanding Time Will Crawl, which just plain sounds fantastic.The song selections on the records is great, and I have no complaints about that whatsoever. More interesting to consider are the song selections for the main set, which span Bowie's entire career and will inevitably draw criticism from those who think that his latterday albums are overrepresented at the expense of his earlier classics. I, too, feel that's the case, which is why I've rated this 4 stars instead of 5, though it is easy enough in the modern era to supplement this set with some additional favorites in a playlist (and also easy to remove the Dancing in the Street duet, which is probably the low point of his career and can be happily traded for something else from that era, like As the World Falls Down.) I definitely need a handful of songs from Low, Heroes, and Station to Station to make any Bowie mix more satisfying, as well as Conversation Piece, Watch That Man, Teenage Wildlife, Looking for Satellites, and a number of other must-haves from all eras.As a longtime David Bowie fan, I hope this helps draw more fans in, as there's so much wonderful music here for people to appreciate and then perhaps decide to dig deeper into his catalog. There are plenty of collections out there, and some people will be better served by something shorter and more glam-centered, but this is definitely a great overview of a tremendous career. Newcomers, this is definitely not a bad place to start. Established fans, this might not be a vital addition, but the remixes and alternate versions may make this worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKBOKW8S1QLYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0UQHNU#wasThisHelpful","RKBOKW8S1QLYA","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are few bands who have meant as much to me throughout my life as U2. I was 8 years old in 1987 (one of the greatest ever years of music) when The Joshua Tree came out. I remember my babysitter playing the cassette and finding myself completely enamored with it from start to finish. Since then, I was hooked, especially when Achtung Baby came out and completely redefined the band--and my conception of what music can be. U2's run between their debut and Zooropa is one of the great career arcs in pop music history. Though they stumbled with Pop (and I hesitate to mention the disaster that was the Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack), they have made music that has ranged from good to great since All That You Can't Leave Behind, when they fully embraced rock clacissicm and a big ""U2"" arena sound, a wise financial move even if it perhaps closes the door on the greatness that they achieved in their first fifteen years.All of that is just for me to say that a new U2 album is not just a record release: it's an event. Of course, Songs of Innocence will, for better or worse, be remembered for its release more than its songs, at least for a little while. I don't need to say much about the huge iTunes free release, which has been well documented and debated, except to answer the question, with the album available for free, does it make sense to buy? The answer, for the die-hard U2 fan, is an unequivocal yes. Yes, because the CD sounds so great. Yes, because the bonus tracks are incredible. Yes, because my physical collection of U2 albums simply wouldn't be complete without this standing proudly beside their last few albums.Rolling Stone gave this album 5 stars. Most other reviewers that I trust gave it 3 or 3.5. I'm somewhere between that, giving it 4. I think this is undoubtedly the best U2 album since All That You Can't Leave Behind, and I'd even tentatively say it's their best since Zooropa or Passengers. It's a fantastic collection of songs, Bono is in fine voice, and the band is tight as ever. Lyrically, it's more personal, like Achtung Baby, rather than preachy, which can be a little wearisome at times.This is what the bonus disc reveals in the deluxe edition: the strength of the songs. U2 is well known for their produced, sometimes overly produced, music. By stripping the songs down, they show that these really do hold up without all the production tricks. Not only that, but the entirely new songs on the bonus disc are very strong, and one could easily question the decision to leave them off the album proper.Without entering too much into the debate about whether the iTunes release was the right thing to do or not (I was happy about it, though I understand the concerns about invasion of privacy), I will say that I am proud to be a U2 fan. There are only a few bands and musicians that mean as much to me as this group, and I am thrilled that they put so much effort into every one of their releases. That they could make an album this good this deep into their career is extraordinary. It doesn't reach the same heights as masterpieces like War, The Joshua Tree, or Achtung Baby, but it's a truly outstanding album that only adds to their legacy. Casual fans will be satisfied with the album as originally released, but devoted fans like me will likely agree, this deluxe edition is indispensable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ICOX9D10GA4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI5RLOW#wasThisHelpful","R3ICOX9D10GA4X","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is recommended for children aged 4 and up. I set it up for my 2-year-old and her cousin of the same age, and they really enjoyed it. (Their artistry is was quite haphazard, but hey - that's not the point.) I really like the way this gives the kids a big canvas to draw on and play with. Any toy that keeps kids active and creating things is better than a gizmo with flashing lights, as far as I'm concerned. This is definitely a good size, sturdy, and has provided a lot of enjoyment.One thing I'll mention - and this does not affect my rating of the product - is simply that I've felt my daughter has had at least as much fun playing with giant cardboard boxes when I've flipped them on their side and cut out some holes for windows. This kit provides a more direct route to a fun coloring-house, and I think it would appear in particular to kids who enjoy organizing things and being precise. For other kids - and some could go either way - taking a shipping box from something else and wrangling it into something new could be a good way to go, too. Again, that's not a knock on this toy, but it's something to think about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRD4TH1HTBQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYW4ZM6#wasThisHelpful","RKRD4TH1HTBQW","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept of the Goal Zero Rechargeable Speaker is a good one: It's totally rechargeable, either through its built-in solar panels or through a USB connection. The charge lasts a long time, and this is the best aspect of the speaker.It has a built-in cable to either daisy-chain the speaker or to do a wired connection. For me, this is necessary, as I feel it has rather poor bluetooth connectivity. I've used both my iPod Touch and an Android phone to connect with bluetooth. The iPod did terribly; the Android did a little better, but the connection has been hard to establish, and it disconnects at random times.The sound quality is an upgrade over simply using your iPod or phone's speaker, but it's not as good as some other portable speakers I've used. It's mediocre, nothing to celebrate or disparage.This is marketed to hikers. The instructions are easy to follow but strange, referring to ""your crew"" in what appears to be an attempt to be hip and appealing to young outdoorsy people. I admit, I wouldn't use this while hiking, though it's built to strap onto your bag and has a sleeve dedicated to putting your ipod/phone, which is a good idea. I have found it best fits my needs by putting it on my kitchen shelf and connecting my iPod (with the cable) if I want a little music while cooking. In that way, I'm getting a good use out of it, and it's cute enough that it doesn't look terribly out of place.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO1380SWIVQPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPMK3GW#wasThisHelpful","RO1380SWIVQPB","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Hoover vacuum is easily on the better side of vacuums I've used in my home. It has all the standard stuff you'd expect as far as attachments and retractable cord (something that I consider an absolute must in a modern vaccum). My home has a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors, some with area rugs. This vacuum has no trouble going from one surface to another while doing a more than acceptable job sucking up the dirt and crumbs that plague a house with a small child in it.In general, I hate vacuum bags, so going bagless is always the way to go. It just plain makes sense and removes an entire level of hassle, so this Hoover Windtunnel really fits the bill for my tastes and needs. Assembly was no problem, and its ease of use is notable. For a solid vacuum for your house or apartment, I think this is equal to or better than the comparable vacuums on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2929X6RYTY4I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEJUH56#wasThisHelpful","R2929X6RYTY4I2","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter is at the very earliest stage of potty training. She's got three different potties at this point. One is a freestanding one that is as much a toy as anything, with a little handle that makes it cheer when you ""flush"" it. She also has a toddler potty seat in our upstairs bathroom and this new OXO Tot Sit Right Potty Seat in our downstairs bathroom. So far, she hasn't shown a particular preference for - or aversion to - any of these seats. I would say that the OXO seat is at least equal to the other brand's seat we have upstairs.One thing that's very easy to see even from the picture is how simple the design is: there's nothing to click into place, so it's easy to put on or off, and it's designed not to slide so it stays steady. It is also smooth, without a bunch of design flourishes, so cleaning it is also a very simple and direct process. I also like the handles, as it's certainly very important for a child to feel balanced when on the toilet.Overall, this is a very light, well-designed product that I fully expect to get a significant amount of use from. Potty training is a formidable enough task, so adding worries about the state of the seat is not something I'd want to have in the mix. With this seat, I know I've got a solid tool to help us out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BIJ6UG0FRJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4C0HEW#wasThisHelpful","R4BIJ6UG0FRJU","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great set of blocks. It's 136 pieces in a wide variety of shapes, are a great next-level toy for a kid who has thus far used mega bloks and legos. The box is rather large and sturdy, which is cool. It's actually a lot larger than I had expected. One feature I like a lot is that it comes with an instructional booklet, so you have the option to carefully create something predesigned, or you can play and invent for yourself. One of my favorite aspects of any building toy like this is that it's something a parent can enjoy along with the child, as it's really quite relaxing, interesting, and fun. (It certainly beats all the blinking lights and loud noises of other childhood toys.) It's also educational without beating you over the head with dumb lessons: playing with blocks teaches balance and basic principles while encouraging creativity and three-dimensional thinking.This is definitely the finest block set I've encountered, on a par with - and perhaps better than - comparable products by companies like Melissa and Doug or even Lego (both of whom create outstanding toys). I definitely recommend this for any child who is old enough not to put small pieces in their mouths, as these could be a choking a hazard for younger kids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCLO1DT5L3PI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMQT4D8#wasThisHelpful","RLCLO1DT5L3PI","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps my main need for a new toaster oven was just the fact that my old one got so grimy that it was beyond ever getting clean again. That said, when I started using this one, I was impressed by how quickly it heated up, how roomy it is inside, and how easy it is to pull the crumb tray out and wipe it off after each use.The dials are easy to use, though I would be a bit more comfortable if I could be sure of the exact temperatures, rather than spinning the dial to what appears to be the proper spot. This is essentially ready to use right out of the box. Just stick the trays in, plug it in, and you're good to go.Having proven that it can cook well, and evenly, the key factor at this point is simply longevity. If something should happen that indicates this one doesn't last, I'll return to this review to update it with those details.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHNDCGV9BTUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HVDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3LHNDCGV9BTUL","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little charger is great. When I first opened the package, I was a little skeptical, because it appeared I could only charge it via USB and my computer, as it only came with the one USB cord. I soon discovered I could plug it into the wall using my Android phone's charger. That method charges this faster, but both methods worked.I then took this on an 8-day vacation, in which a lot of driving was involved, and driving for my family means listening to music through my iPod. My device for charging through the wall broke a few months ago, and I didn't bring a computer through which to charge the iPod. Using the TP-LINK, I was able to recharge the iPod whenever I needed, and there was plenty of juice left at the end of the 8 days. In other words, it worked perfectly, and I was very satisfied. The fact that it works with both iPods and Android phones is my favorite aspect, as I need both of those things to function if I'm away for an extended period.Overall, this has been an outstanding performer, and it gives peace of mind that I won't find myself in a situation where I've got a phone that's out of battery. There are certainly some times in my past in which that would have been a huge help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MSMIJ7A8P30F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G0AMUE8#wasThisHelpful","R2MSMIJ7A8P30F","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just plain a great game for kids. It's a matching game, simple and pure. One thing I love about it is that it packs up into a small tin, the coaster-sized pieces contained well so that you can pop this into any bag or purse and have it with you if traveling.Last year, I bought the regular Spot It! game for my nephew, who was 5 years old. It turned out that he already owned it, but he immediately popped it open and started playing with it anyway. That's the kind of game this is. Even if a child has it and is familiar with it, he or she can still get excited for it. This version is a new variation with different images from the original, so it adds a little bit of newness to a classic game. I've had a lot of fun playing with my nephew, and I look forward to when my daughter (now 2) is old enough to enjoy it as well.I feel I should add: if you're like me and don't necessarily have a ton of money, but need to get a child a gift for his or her birthday or for a holiday, this is a real winner that won't break the bank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE67R33HPHNGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ER6N5ZK#wasThisHelpful","RE67R33HPHNGU","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I loved the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies (especially the first two), I have to say that Marc Webb's entries thus far are even better. I can point to a number of reasons for this: the action scenes have more weight, the stories dig a bit deeper, and - standing out in particular - the acting is extraordinary. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 could have easily slipped up and become overcrowded with villains and bombastic action sequences. But everything stays contained throughout, balanced, and anchored by two outstanding actors, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, especially Stone, who is pitch perfect in this role.I'm keeping this review very short, because I mostly want to point out that the fate of Gwen Stacey is no secret. It's part of Spider-Man's history, arguably the most important part. The way it is weaved into this film is nothing short of astonishing. When dealing with such important scenes, everything has to come together just right, and I really think it did in this movie. I could quibble with a few bits here and there for this movie, but so many things go right, especially in the key scenes, that it's almost hard to remember what I might have done differently.This product itself is packaged well, and I love having both the Blu-ray and DVD discs. It's my favorite way to own movies these days, and I'm satisfied in what they've delivered. First and foremost, though, it's about the movie, and we've now got a pair of Marc Webb films that I am sure will stand the test of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GF2X2KT9VAOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPQZSFM#wasThisHelpful","R1GF2X2KT9VAOU","AYQP8XMHTG2YR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYQP8XMHTG2YR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"--Summary:I have seen a lot of mixed reviews on this set, a lot of them from people that bought through Amazon. I'm wondering if sitting in the amazon distro centers or if amazon stock are of lesser quality or something, I'm not sure. I got my kit from a local radio shack ($10 cheaper retail, and I had a $10 coupon so $20 less than current price on Amazon). The kit I received was great, I inspected every bit with a magnifying glass, not even a hint of discoloration let alone rust or anything. I will walk through each section of the kit with a summary of my thoughts on this great kit.--Carrying Case:Overall the carrying case is very nice. A solid durable nylon material with a very strong Velcro seal to close it up. It is a tri-fold and the fold is off centered with is odd at first but it does close well and i think will stand up well to many years of use (and abuse)--Spudgers (plastic and metal):The plastic spudgers are a dime a dozen, they are given away for free with any ""iphone screen replacement kit"" you order online. I have about 20 of them. That said, if you don't already have them they are good to have, better to start with these than the metal ones in some cases.The metal spludgers and scrapers are nice and solid. Textured handles ensure a good grip. They are heavy and solid where they need to be and on the ones that are supposed to be a bit flexible they do have a bit of a give which is important when popping off parts of phone cases or what have you.--Tweezers:I have read in one of the main reviews how bad the tweezers are in this kit but I have to say, based on the set I have there must be a some rea quality control issues resulting in a wide range of tolerances to get through. The Tweezers I received are all amazing. They all have nice rubber ESD proof grips as advertised, but more to the point, quite literally, they ends are amazing. Each of the ends grab with great precision and hold tight. They are precise and tight enough to pick the skin right from your finger. All three pair hold the precision through a full grasp. The curved set and the fine most pointed set hold the most precision, with the very end staying completely closed even with a full grasp. On the thicker of the 2 straight sets, the pointe end started to open a bit but not until about 90% strength applied to a full grasp. Still in my opinion these are very nice and precise.--54 Bit Driver Kit:The driver kit is wonderful. I read many other reviews where people had issues with missing bits, or bits with rust on them. As a result when I got my kit I reviewed each one as noted in the summary and not a single issue. So for me im saying the set of 4mm bits are all great. The driver itself is nice. Again it's got good weight, and a very solid feel. The included extension fits in the hole on the end to create a T-bar for added torque, which can be helpful since you can't always get a lot of leverage with these types of drivers. The palm spinner also works nice, I have had no issues with it getting caught at all. I have also found that these bit work perfectly with the General Tools 500 Cordless Precision Screwdriver and getting that with this set really is a great match. The bits themselves are not magnetic but the driver has a strong magnet to hold the bit in. As a result the bit, when in the driver carries this charge and when the bit is in the driver it will have a slight magnetic charge which is generally a very helpful thing and will allow it to still pick up small screws. The added magnetic bit is also very nice to have. I haven't really had much use for the flexible extension bar. Its decent quality, but a bit hard to turn with an angle over 45 degrees from what I can see.This may seem really nit-picky but in all honesty my biggest issue is, with the quality and precision that went into this kit, and its not a cheap $20 kit. The Driver kit pieces all sit in a very thin, cheap as hell, white plastic mold. Just seems that an extra dollar or 2 to make the setting a bit more solid would have been what made this perfect.--Others:With the misc other stuff there isn't much to really say. The Suction and ESD strap are standard. The Razor is nice quality heavy/solid feel to it. The ruler was a little underwhelming. The ruler itself was fine but with the quality of everything else I was a bit disappointed with how cheap the attached cross bar was. It just didn't have the high quality precise feel of everything else.--Overview:Overall i highly recommend this tool set, there seems to be some questionable quality from the kits fulfilled by Amazon, but my kit from Radio Shack had none of the issues noted by others.**If you find this review helpful please click the button below.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PR2QMV53M63J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XGWQ2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1PR2QMV53M63J","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off this is actually a very nice precision powered driver. It comes with a few common bits that are very helpful to get you going.The handle and feel of the unit overall is good. those with large and small hands alike should find themselves comfortable with this device.This is a precision screwdriver, please make sure you are getting it for the right reason. this is for working on small finely details projects that. the rotational speed of the bit is not fast nor should it be, but it has some good torq, so if you are driving into a soft material make sure you stop just before the end and finish turning by hand. When not powered the bit is pretty much locked so you can tighten it down by hand without the risk of stripping anything.**Optional Bits**This was one of the biggest issues i have read when i went through the reviews, well i want to tell you all that there are lots of options and i will give you 2 VERY amazing ones right now. This driver is the ""perfect' companion to the iFixit kits. Both the iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit and just the iFixit 54 Bit Driver Kit come with a crap ton of bits. Actually each comes with 54. In addition the top row of bits in each kit are varies sized adapters so you can use any bits sized from 2mm up to 5mm in this precision screw driver. Buying this driver with one of those sets is really a match made in heaven. I have the pro kit and this driver and i have yet to find something i cant tackle.The battery life of the driver is pretty good too it lasts me quite a while. i haven't actually times it but others have reported ~100 hours or so and i cant disagree with that. Im currently using the supplied Alkaline batteries, and once i can find my AAA NiMH batteries i will be giving those a try.Overall this is a great driver, with no issues, regardless what others are saying.I would totally recommend this product**If this review was helpful please click the button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWT9L5OLIG6ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XZLTQO#wasThisHelpful","RWT9L5OLIG6ER","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its a low cost Keyboard and it works well but its def has its goods and its badsPro:* Its the basically the same keyboard you find on other sites and in certain kits (especially Raspberry Pi) for $40+ or so.* It works just as good, no issues with any of the mini computers i have tested it with. Raspbery Pi, UDOO, BeableBone Black, pcDuino, etc.* Its RF not Bluetooth, so no special drivers, just pug in in the dongle and it works* recharble, so no replacing batteries* Built in storage for the RF Dongle, surprising how great this feature is until you have something like this and its impossible to keep track of the dongle.* The laser point is dumb, but makes for a fun cat (or dog) toy :-)Cons:* The range is not the best, couple feet at best before keystrokes start to get missed. I would say about 5' give or take, maybe more with Line of Sight* The form factor makes typing anything more than a few keystrokes very awkward* the longer length keys long the backspace, space bar, and enter key have 2 physical buttons under them making it very easy to double press leading to typing mistakes.* while the built in battery is rechargeable, it is not replaceable. but at price of this unit, its probably better to just buy a whole new one anyways.overall this is a good keyboard, but unless you must have the laser pointer, i find Hausbell  Mini H7 2.4GHz Wireless Keyboard with Touchpad to not only be cheaper, but far more comfortable to hold, use and has better button placement","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6SKV0NB4KWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UE52ME#wasThisHelpful","R2D6SKV0NB4KWN","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We get the bags of small peppers from costco and pretty much every pepper int he back is too large for even the large holes in this rack.I wanted to give this 3 stars but will give it 4 since the main issue has been on my side. I should have paid more attention to the hole sizes, so in closing i will leave that as my word of advise. Check out the hole sizes before you buy and check with some of the peppers you will work with. you may find it will work well, you may not. But ignoring the hole size as i did and assuming it will work for small peppers may leave you like me, with a rack that is collecting dust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPIZUIP5720D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047ZFFMC#wasThisHelpful","R1PPIZUIP5720D","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The plastic is great and durable, the containers are nice and all fit well in the overall case.I purchased this for someone who just recently had gastric by-pass surgery and it has allowed her to very easily portion out her lunch foods, take them to work, and eat comfortably. Since the inside containers are easily removable they make for great holders for her on short trips. She can separate out a couple portions of left overs for the next day or setup  the whole lunch. The extra room in the case works for utensils or other items.Overall its a bit pricey for a 'lunch box' but for a gastric by-pass patient, or anyone with similar needs this was the most perfect thin. It has received near daily use for many month now and has held up great. its very durable and nice.**Please click the button if you find this review helpful","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U58CKMGAPDR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088N30YO#wasThisHelpful","R2U58CKMGAPDR5","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summary:This is a great idea and a good product.It works good, but the bends in the metal don't seem to be exactly right. Things are tight where they should be loose, and loose where they should be tight. Not in major ways, but enough to be noticeable. It works good for what its supposed to do, so for that i give it a good rating.Thoughts:The metal is a bit thin and while i have only used it a couple times i'm don't see this holding up to a year or two of heavy grilling. Im not taking away points for this since its only a thought and i haven't had the time with it to prove or disprove. I will update later after i have had more time with it and got more use out of it.In closing in only taking off 1 star because i feel the craftsman ship is lacking a bit. If i could, i would do 4.5 stars. For the price this is still a pretty good product and even if it only lasts 1 or 2 years i'm sure many will still feel they got their moneys worth out of it.Overall i like it, and i would still recommend it to a friend that asked about it**please click the button below if you found this review helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFN8C02D86FRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E5GGFI#wasThisHelpful","RFN8C02D86FRF","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summary:Good design, decent buttons, features, attaches well, and sounds pretty goodPhysical side:Starting with the physical aspect of things with the suction cup. the device has suction cup the same diameter as the device it self and seems to hold on quite well. its made of a plastic that has a soft finish, but a hard slick plastic, its a nice feel. the buttons are large pads with a single pushpin button about 3mm in diameter so you want push right in the middle of each to actually get the button under it. There is a single LED under the rubber power button that indicates the state of the device, on, off, charging or in Bluetooth pairing mode. when its turned for the first time its discoverable by your phone and connects easy.The charger is a standard USB plug on one side with a proprietary 2mm barrel jack on the side that goes into the device. this is a bit of a bummer, as i dont see putting a water gasket over a micro USB that much harder that this, but regardless this is what it is. Just means you better not loose the cable.Software:The Bluetooth connection established quick and easy. i had no issues on my GS4. it worked as expected with any music app i had, Slacker radio, Pandora, Tune-in, Google Music, etc all worked as expected. Pause/Play, skip track all worked normally. The ability to answer an incoming call worked quite well also. I didn't test this in the actual shower, but in a quiet room, the receiving person just noted that it sounded like i was on any normal speakerphone, as expected. I could imaging it would be a bit hard to hear in the shower, but have no doubt it will work. will post an update/correction if i get contradictory info.Sound quality:As to be expected, from many devices like this, the sound is lacking in the bass/low areas. As with most of the tons int he mids and highs.. it has enough lows to still sounds good and by placing the speaker in the back it deflects the sounds off the surface its attached too with an outward angle added from the suction cup itself. This allows the small device to really fill the area with sound. Again now the most complete sound from a range stand point, but it does have more low tones that i have seen in many common ""shower radios"" which seem to be just tweeters.Overall:* This is a very good, low cost waterproof shower speaker that will do well for most people.* I dont have good batter duration info at this time, but will try and add it when i can* The proprietary charging cable is a real negative, replacing this if lost could be challenging.* Yes, overall i would recomend this product to others.**if you found this review helpful please click the button below","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R155Y4VQMFG6PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4OFYKY#wasThisHelpful","R155Y4VQMFG6PQ","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are quite solid, thick, durable lead cables. The cables themselves are much thicker than i expected, each lead cable is about the thickness of a good USB cable. Making the combined pair pretty thick and durable, more than expected. Its also worth noting that these cables come combined as a single cable. They could be pulled apart if desired, but i found this to be nice. its easier to store them.The banana clips are normal/common, the metal banana clip end is completely attached to the plastic part, i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard, these are solid. Additionally on the alligator clip end the screw into the lead wire is clean, solid and holds up very well. I have used these in a few projects and given them some good pulls/tugs.These are not $1-$2 cheap leads, they are worth the money and i think will serve me well for a while, im happy i got 2 sets when i did.**Update** 1/9/14I have been using these in a test project, been in use nearly 24/7 for at least 2 weeks now and been running very good.

"first regarding the version, from what i can tell reading the iFixit website, this is in fact the pro-model.It has the non-slip backing and a decent magnet.. not that i have another one to compare it toThe magnetic board in 2mm thickThe foam bad is about 0.5mm thickThe total thickness is just under 3mmQuality:Overall this is a very good project pad, well designed, thick enough to be strong and useful but not too think to be in the way on the desk (note thicknesses above). The non-slip backing works well to keep the pad from sliding, but it will move if pushed intentionally. The whiteboard quality is also very good. Many types of whiteboards like this will leave residue, or ghosting when erased, this one is very good and cleans up easy.Intended uses:This is the key thing, Please make sure you are getting this for the right reasons. This pad is intended to help you work on small electronics. Tearing apart and fixing laptop, cell phones, robots, drones, circuit boards, Arduino projects, etc. the magnetic backing is safe for most all electronics including memory cards. For these use cases the pad is wonderful. it holds the tiny screws in place with your written labels making re-assembly much quicker. If you are trying to fix a toaster oven, AC unit or some other large project, then this may not be what you want to use.Overall:Overall this very nice quality mat. its heavier than i expected (good thing). Its seems quite durable, and i was very happy to see that the the dry erase marker was really a fine tip marker, of really nice quality. It also has a small dry eraser on the back to clean up the board like a pencil eraser.I quite like this pad, have already used it a couple times with some Arduino related projects and love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5H6IODCPT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00876JHBM#wasThisHelpful","R2L5H6IODCPT2","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the better DMM i have used. its got pretty much every feature available (except temperature) and it works very well.- In comparison to other DMM and testing equipment its proven to be very accurate.- The leads are interchangeable with other types, which is very convenient. They do have these covers to cover the 'sharp' points. these covers are great idea, but they are a bugger to keep track of. The idea of a tether would be nice, but i can see that just causing them to get in way as they dangle. either way. Not a huge issue but notable- It runs on standard batteries so no crazed searching when you have dead DMM. Comes with standard 1.5v Alkaline, but seems to work with rechargeable 1.2v NiMH also.- internal fuse to protect the unit.. oddly enough mine blew at some point, i had no idea, the meter has still be working and i have some new ones on order.. odd.- It has a nice kickstand and strap so you can sit it upright on your desk/bench or attach it to your hand easily. The elastic band does really get in the way of the kickstand which is irritating, but again, not that big of a deal.Overall: i like this DMM, would recommend it and at this point if i lost or broke it, i would probably buy this one again.**[...]**","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4XFT9NG56IRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVYGZA#wasThisHelpful","R4XFT9NG56IRI","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So with over 900 reviews i doubt this will get read by many but i wanted to get this published all the same.I do a lot of testing with various portable batteries and cables, and i have found this cable to do just fine with data transfer speeds at the expected USB 2 speeds, but find that its power transfer rates are quite sub-par.The look and feel of this cable would lead you to believe its a good quality cable, but it doesn't charge like one. On a 1000 mA power source it will only pull 800 mA, i have occasionally seen it get a bit higher, but not consistently. A quality cable can allow all 1000 mA to a normal USB device like a phone. Even when upping the load current to 2000 or 2100 mA there is little change. USB Standards do not require a full 2000 mA through a USB cable, but most good cables will max out at 1200 mA based on my testing. Again this is cable sits tight around 800.Overall this may not be something most people care about but it should be noted that it will caused longer charge times to your devices.Update: Corrected mAh to mA","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3990544TGTF49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C28L5UW#wasThisHelpful","R3990544TGTF49","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was purchased for a rarely used point and shoot camera. so i cant really say how high the quality is or the performance, and since its for a used camera that came with no battery i cant compare with the OEM.What i can say is that it is NOT a 1200 MAh batter which was the main reason i bought it, i thought i was getting a higher capacity battery. It is actually an 880 MAh. I contacted the retailer and gave the the chance to change the description before writing this review.

This couldn't be farther from the truth. These two ear tweeters are small but handle the mids and highs well, what you miss at first glance is that it leaves the rest of the device to act as a huge woofer box.

"I am the owner of at least 10 different types of external battery packs, ranging from 1,850mAh to this behemoth 18,000mAh pack. For the most part they all work well and do what they are supposed to, they are just batteries after all.The Limeade Blast really sets itself apart in a few ways that make it worth checking out.1.) The exterior is a really nice design and material, soft/tacky to the touch and very clean design.2.) The Auto-On is a great feature for many that don't really realize it. The simplest use case would be:Get this battery, stash it in a pocket in your backpack with a cable or 2 and just have a quick 'on the go' way to recharge. Most battery packs, once you plug-in your device, you have to then find the pack and push a button to turn it on. The auto-on allows it to function just like a wall outlet, but say in your backpack. (first world problems, i know right?) just think if you are on the train, or something, charger hanging out.. you are pulling your device out every so often to check a mail or text. You just plug it in, no digging for the pack to start the charge.3.) The LED flashlight is a nice touch, the pack itself is a bit large and heavy for this to be a primary feature, but its nice to know its there if you need it, and to be fair, it actually works decent.4.) Capacity, this is kind of an obvious one. While this thing sure can take a while to charge, it really lasts. Using the backpack example (#2 above) you can really just leave it in there and forget about it. It will charge most phones 5-10 times over before needing to be charged itself. It can even pump a full charge into a tablet/iPad, and with the 2.1A output it will do so at the normal wall outlet speed. The only note here is that this device is not exactly lite, but to be fair, its friggin 18,000mAh.. its really good for its capacity. Trust me i have of these to compare.5.) This device has 2 Outputs, one 1.0A for most small electronics, phones, headphones, etc. and a larger 2.1A output to allow normal full speed charging of larger devices like tablets, iPads and some newer larger battery phones like the GS4. With the capacity of this battery you can use both without a concern. If you are not sure which one to use, look at the original charger for your device, the plug will state 1.0A or 2.0/2.1A and then you will know.6.) Extras, the included 2-in-1 cable works good. its a bit cheap feeling, but its the ONLY part that even kind of feels cheap. Being a secondary item that is really just a free add-on, i didn't really care. The quality of the actual battery pack more than makes up for it. There is also a very slick case for the Limeade, is worth checking out, another great design.7.) The price point really comes in good, especially now with it on sale, but even overall. Compare for yourself and you will see that this is a great product at a great price.As a Kickstarter investor, i think its also worth of making a note about the company itself. Not only did Limeade build the product they advertise, they did so exactly as laid out. Timelines and deliverables were met, expectations exceeded and the Limeade blast is one of the select few projects who exceeding delivery expectations and timelines.. something like 80-90% of all kickstarter projects come in late. To me this shows that they really have it together, and i would continue to invest in their projects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34M3KKTZNMD8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C78YJQY#wasThisHelpful","R34M3KKTZNMD8S","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's perfect to get the light I need where I need it. The light is emitted very directionally. It will not light up the whole room but will light up what you point it at very well.

After you get past that you will quickly find out its more that a pretty folio.The combination of built in white boards and notepads, three rings and plastic sleeves allow this folio to cover any business you throw at it.

"One of the better small WiFi Dongles for the Raspberry PiIt also has a nice blue LED on it to show when its connected and working, other dongles i have tried dont always have a light. This helps if you leave your Pi powered up for long periods of time. Personally a quick look at the top shelf of my closet and if i see the LED i know its ok.CompatibilityI have setup the WiPi with both Wheezy ([...] and Adafruit's Occidentalis ([...]). Occidentalis is im personal favor, but both come with the right drivers and everything ready for this, and other dongles like it to work.I have found that this WiFi dont does not seem to support AP mode which is required if you want to set up your Raspberry pi tyo run as a wireless access point or to try and run it as a wireless TOR router. If this is your intention, then you will need to check out another dongle. Adafruit sells one with their OnionPi kit that you can buy separate that will work properly.PowerThis is actually the most important part. Most WiFi dongles actually need to be plugged into a USB hub in order to word due to the Pi's really low USB power output. The WiPi is actually designed, and does work very well directly connected. In my case, i run my Pi headless and access it over the WiFi network so this part was important to me. you should be able to get a USB Keyboard and the WiPi working together but it may be real tight on power.If you want a WiFi dongle that you know will just work and not cause any power resource issues, this is the one to go with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODSIYZ2IBRZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDW6D7I#wasThisHelpful","R1ODSIYZ2IBRZJ","A3P4T1DKRWTL36","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3P4T1DKRWTL36?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Through her personal experiences, the author gives us a broad knowledge of the othersde that love continues and our soul continues.  what I particularly like about this book is the experiences are raw and innocent, of her early discovery of her experiences and trying to find the vocabulary as well as finding out she has a unique gift.  I can relate as I have a gift and it is hard to realize why you don't fit in and no one else gets it.  The whole book is about her learning and discovery, very readable.  For those who are new to mediumship, grieving, this book really will help to alleviate the loss, and learning that our energy lives on and our loved ones are THAT close to our world.

"great economized footprint for our space!  We are a big fan of the Brita brand and have owned a number of filter pitchers over the years.  We currently own the 10 Cup filter, which is the same design as this one.  As with all brita brands, the filter is a one-that-fits all, so very transferable and you are wasting your inventory.Love this filter in the one key improvements: the lid does not flip off [otherwise you have to hold it down when pouring] when you pour.

"We own an ironging board/iron that is connected such that the water is held in the ironging borad, and the iron produces so much steam that ironing is a breeze.  So how does the new Black and Decker compare in terms of its claim to more STEAM production?The iron has 3 level of steam settings, and i used the maximum level:  still did not produce enough for me and I had to use the button on top of the iron to pump out more steam.  there is also a button for water jet too.  The extra umpf helped. but rather a bother to use to expedite the ironing process.  Also that uses the water in the iron ratehr fast too.Whether you have a mnaule dial or a digital button to move the temperature: I am indifferent.The iron is heavy without the water, and after using an iron where the water is held elsewhere, it was harder to use.  Compared with other B&D's irons we have also used in the past, I am not convinced that this one provided more steam, and with the added weight, I am not sure it was an easier ironing expereince.  I still rate the B&D brand as top of the pile, and would still buy one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8XS5AFQ0TXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","R3R8XS5AFQ0TXY","A2OWR5G2OAQF7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OWR5G2OAQF7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First time reading anything from this author, and I am very impressed.  The subtleness of the plot was unique, and whilst you are drawn into the politics of Zimbabwe and South Africa , you are also learning about the power behind the election process; the world powers view of let us not rock the boat even though doing the right thing should be for the good of the people.I loved the characters and the complicity they played in the plot, and to say the least, everyone is not what they seem to be on the surface, and then all is explained!  Sometimes the power does not lie in the title that you have, but in the information you have and how you can use it!  Build your own super powers!  Loved it.  Well written, nothing dragged and the story moved very smoothly.  Whilst some violence was necessary as we are talking about the atrocities that has plagued that part of the world, it was not over the top to make a point.  I love when there is some history behind the fiction, as I would not have known about many of what the people in that part of the world faces: beautiful,  very enjoyable read, and I look forward to the next novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12IKT3CR163TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168680#wasThisHelpful","R12IKT3CR163TL","A2OWR5G2OAQF7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OWR5G2OAQF7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

To 6 three recoveries from 20 to 30 minutesAside fromantic the programs, there is th e intensity strength that is separate for each apd, which was great as one tighter set of muscles can be worked on more than the other.  Actually it took up to level 40 for me to feel the pulse!  So it can be that gentle.  I used the 30 minutes recovery for my upper back, and I noticed slightly looser back!The premise of this apparatus is based on 'pulses' and the frequency of these pulses.  We didn't find the pulses uncomfortable at all, which I was afraid that it might over twitch ..very comfortable.  Easy to set up and to use.  Hmm, nice little relaxation after work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMDIL0PFVO1GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EDYF3O#wasThisHelpful","RMDIL0PFVO1GY","A2OWR5G2OAQF7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OWR5G2OAQF7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"this apparatus is not for those who hates to work on their core muscles and wants to loose some inches without doing the real exercise,.  I am one such person.  The premise of the apparatus is to work on your base muscles and to strengthen it along with the other core exercies.  any lost of belly fat is incidental!  I have used another brand that claims to build muscles, but if you are that keep you would use the old fashion method,  I am sure this will end up beign a gimmick for me.  The vibrations work through a series of intensity and it is intiially uncomfortable to get use to, and if you have never used anything like this, dont be too ambitious and work with a lower settign for the first week or so, before increasiong the intensity.  if you are like me who is prone to motion sickness, you may want to stay on the low intensity and do some housework to take your mind off it.compared with an older model, i like that the vibration pack is separately attached to the band, which makes it easy to wash, as you do generate a sweat around your tummy area.  the band will fot 50 inch waist line comfortably.  i dont know why the batteries compartment is such a funcky shape as it was nto easy to slot in batteries nuimber 2 and 3.it comes with 3 AAA batteries, but I will switch to rechargeable as this can get very expensive along with the gel pad replacements.  I will try some of the life extension recommended in the other posts.  to get any resultsm, you really have to stick with the recommended program, and like me- it is tough to remind myself.  I think this apparatus needs to be used along with a proper exercise regiment and calorie controlled diet.  seriously, I am not looking for miracles.Not recommended if you have weak ab muscles - ie hernia or plannign to get pregnant.  or is pregnant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B5ZC3EF0DPBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0YTB1K#wasThisHelpful","R3B5ZC3EF0DPBU","A2OWR5G2OAQF7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OWR5G2OAQF7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The WEMO Link and WEMO OSRAM Bulbs are my first entry into the world of home automation. Setting up the WEMO Link took a bit of trial and error. WEMO only supports 2.4GHz 802.11n. If you have a 5GHz network you are out of luck. Hopefully you have a Dual Band WiFi Router that supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks.Connecting to the WEMO Link (I used an iPhone but this works with Android as well). Plug in the WEMO Link somewhere central in your home or apartment. Wait a couple of minutes for the unit to boot itself up. Go to the WiFI settings on your iOS/Android device. You should see a new WiFi network called WEMO.xxxx.xxx. Connect to this network. Once connected, launch the WEMO App (which you should have previously downloaded from the Apple App store or the Google Play store. It will automatically start setting up the WEMO Link device. It will ask you which WiFi network it should join. Choose your 2.4GHz network. You will be prompted for the security password. Once entered it will connect the WEMO Link to your WiFi.Activating the Bulbs. For best results I set these up one at a time. Screw in one light bulb and turn on the lamp. Wait a few minutes and then launch the WEMO App. The App should detect the new Bulb and ask you to give it a name (like Bulb 1). Save your changes and you should now be able to control the Bulb from the WEMO App. Continue through the above steps for as many bulbs you may have purchasedUnfortunately the WEMO Link is not supported by Amazon's ECHO device. I think there is a way around that by using the If This Then That (IFTTT) website.Once you have the bulbs all talking to the WEMO App you can group them together (this is helpful if they are all in one lamp).I was disappointed about the no Amazon ECHO support (as I have one) so I went ahead and purchased a couple of WEMO Insight Switches. These are supported by Amazon ECHO. The setup is exactly the same as the WEMO Link device.Now that it is connected to the Amazon ECHO I can say ""Alexa, turn on theliving roomlights"".  Poof, the living room lights come on.WEMO Link is also accessible from outside your home if you enable the Remote Access Feature from within the App.If you want to get started with a bit of Home Automation, WEMO seems to be a good start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E9Y2JM6MLA7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XREGUVY#wasThisHelpful","R1E9Y2JM6MLA7X","A2OWR5G2OAQF7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OWR5G2OAQF7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay, bring the knowledge of biolofpdy, nature, the birds and the bees, a deep refresher course for those who enjoyed studying these subjects at school; and throw in the theory of quantum physics.

The book did a good job in providing the fundamentals before adding the quantum aspect in it, and yes, I couldn't believe how far quantum physics has come and if nothing else, you will be more impressed in the wonders of nature.

"This is the real deal, BUT YOU ARE GETTING ONLY 1 PILLOW!!  This is 100% down and excellent quality in a firm Queen.  These will be sold at full retail at around $200 each and I am not making this up.  Have had down bedding since a teenager and know what to look for.  It is great for back sleepers with shoulder issues as I bought these for my Mom who has 2 rotocuff tears in her shoulder.  It was time to replace the pillows and I saved up the money over time as I knew these would be expensive.  I also bought 2 King size, soft with 700 fill power from someone else for $140 for both, still waiting for and will review upon receipt.  Below is a link to those pillows and I contacted the vendor and he confirmed they are 100% White Goose Down and 100% guarantee on quality.  We will see...LUXURIOUS Two (2) Goose Down Pillows - 1200 Thread Count 100% Egyptian Cotton Cover , Soft, King Size, Set of 2 PillowsThe way you get scammed is that a vendor will state ""High Quality Down"" but do not state how much of the filling is down and you have to search for it, if that is the case then run away.  Usually these sellers are selling crappy pillows with 95% duck feather and 5% duck down.  Here is what you want to see and if they are selling good quality 100% White Goose Down they will always state that:1.  Description states up front that it is 100% down2.  Description states ""White Goose Down"", which is a whole lot better than duck and ""White Goose Down"" is the best3.  The fill power on Queens should be no less than 500 and on Kings 7004.  You should usually get med-firm if you like softer pillows as ""soft"" are usually really soft.  ""Firm"" pillows are firm but you sink down into them and they cradle you.  This is just a suggestion before getting a ""soft"" pillow as you may be disappointed but it is not the pillow but  your choice of firmness as long as all the above criteria are met.If you are looking for an alternative that is not as pricey, you can try pillows that are 50% ""GOOSE"" feather and 50% down, but I prefer to save up and get all down.  But, a lot of people like the 50% - 50% who prefer a harder pillow, I would also buy a body pillow that is 50/50 and never 100% down, kind off a waste of money.And to put price in perspective, pay $88 for a Queen pillow now and it lasts 10 years with proper care and sleep like a baby or buy the crappy ones at around $30, toss and turn, they make crunchy noises and replace them every 6 - 12 months = $360 at the least if replacing annually, and you will because the crappy ones will start to stink and are not hypoallergenic.Also in general, it is really important to have a good pillow to sleep soundly otherwise you will toss and turn or the pillow will make noise when you move and wake you up, like a crunchy sound, which are the crappy feathers. So while pricey for AMAZON, I do recommend this pillow.  They also have these in a King size for $99 each pillow.So, that is what I know and I hope it helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BZRJ7FWAQLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSH8CAI#wasThisHelpful","R8BZRJ7FWAQLZ","A278S61JJ5Y95L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A278S61JJ5Y95L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"11/05/2015 UPDATE:Took away 1 star because when taking pictures of the same item, the colour is not consistent.  Say I take a picture of a rose coloured blanket trimmed in light pink.  Some pictures are true to the actual colours, but other pictures of the same thing, the pink looks like and entirely different colour, even though it should not.  For that reason I took away 1 star and downgraded this from a 4 star to a 3 star rating.  I also have a very robust photo software package, and no matter what I could not get the colours to be accurate across the board.  Also, it only had 4x optical zoom and I wanted/needed more.  I still believe in CANON so when I bought yet another camera, got a CANON, just an upgrade from this one.  Basically this camera is for fun shots or facebook and stuff.Since I had to get another camera with a much higher optical zoom range, I bought ANOTHER CANON with 30x optical zoom, but had to buy a flash separate.  I got the PowerShot SX400 and once I get it and use it I will review it.  I actually needed something more, but not an actual professional camera as it was overkill for me.  I sell items on the internet and needed an upgrade from this to get better pictures, that look like the items I am selling and looked true to the actual colour.  Also bought a 5 foot tripod.___________________________FINALLY BOUGHT A CANON!!!!! I got an older model with 10.2 megapixels but when buying a camera that is one of the things you look at but not the most important with ""Point and Shoot"", it is like the third thing as you can buy a 15 or 21 megapixel and still get really bad grainy or dark pictures, like I did, and anything over 18mgp does NOT do well in low light.  Also, camera manufacturers push out new lineups every single year with only minor upgrades, so phased-out models can be a real steal for the same thing costing 2x.TIDBIT on Optical and Digital Zoom:If you are using a digital point and shoot camera you may have something called ""digital zoom"". For great pix AVOID digital zoom.  If you have the option of optical zoom, use that instead.DIGITAL zoom is basically a digital crop within the camera and is NOT true magnification. Basically you are only capturing part of an image with LOWER RESOLUTION  and not the full frame.  So it is like fools gold, it looks like gold but not worth anything and in fact makes things worse.OPTICAL zoom IS magnification created by the lens. This is a TRUE ZOOM and should not degrade the image quality. Optical zoom should ALWAYS be your first choice for magnification to make sure the quality of the pix is high.Also, Optical zoom is the most important zoom measurement because it measures the Focal Length of the camera.  For example, a 10X Nikon zoom lens might have a 35mm film equivalent of 24mm-240mm, while another might have a 35mm-350mm equivalent.The 24mm lens would have MORE wide-angle capabilities than a 35mm lens, and a 350mm lens has more zoom than a 240mm lens.  So, if you can start with a 25mm  100mm zoom in optical, which is usually the first number.So that is why megapixels really is the third of fourth option to look at since such numbers refer to the magnification and wide-angle capabilities of the lens and the quality of the pix is in Optical or Digital Zoom, and NOT JUST megapixels.___________________________So, after trying 2 highly rated point and shoot cameras, reviewed next, in the $200 range I finally just spent the money and bought a CANON, which I have used since a teenager and still have my film camera, which to me is the only way to take photos.(9/17/2015 - Full Retail $250) CANON POWERSHOT A3000 IS: 10 megapixel, 4 times zoomSet Up:Easy enough, but check the site for updates AND there is a lot of great support and information about the model, so thumbs up.  Also, you can option in the descriptions when looking what to set the camera on in the LCD screen, like with the OLYMPUS.Picture Quality:First, the megapixels of this camera is  of the NIKON @ 21 and the OLYMPUS was 14 and the quality is actually very good where there is a lot of light with the ISO at 400 or under and excellent at 100. I especially like the vivid shooting option which beefs up the colours as I am taking pictures of hand knitted items to sell.  And while it has image stabilization, I turn it off as I use a tripod.  Video quality is par for the course, but I did not buy this for video.CONS:Shooting speed is slow, slower than most at 4 seconds in between shots with the flash and 3 seconds without the flash.  Most others are at half thisEditing Software:The same as everyone else, I do not think is it better or worse.  I use Corel anywayCamera Quality:Overall for a camera that was around $250 full retail and you can now buy for $150 new I would say a top contender for ones costing over $200.  It feels like it has a metal housing, it has weight and feels substantial in your hands, so if dropped I think it would survive, which I could not say that of the plastic cameras I tried before I finally bought this one.  If you are looking for something basic that takes great pictures in optical mode, then this one is a great little camera.  Taking off 1 star because of delay in between shots and slight picture noise.So, again hands down I go for the CANON, needless to say that from now on I will just stick with CANON.  They are the higher priced point and shoot, and in general if on sale not much of a discount, but I think this is because of the quality of the camera.  My film camera is 30 years old and still works like a charm.  External reviews rate between 4 to 4 1/2 stars and B+/A- on average.If something changes, I will update the review.______________________OTHER CAMERAS: NIKON AND OLYMPUSI first bought an Olympus, then a NIKON before the CANON and I did not like them.  Also, I did buy these used, but I do buy products on AMAZON that are used about 25% of the time and usually do not have issues, but always buy items stated as LIKE NEW. Here are my reviews:1. (9/3/2015 - Full retail $200) OLYMPUS STYLUS -5010: 14 megapixel, wide angle dual image 5 times zoom,There is not much support on the OLYMPUS website, so that is a bummer, and it did not come with a CD.  From what I read in the very basic manual the driver, software and manual should download when you plug it into your laptop, so if it is pre owned, this does not happen. The pictures it took were grainy and mostly out of focus.  Also, there is a lag time from when you press the button to take the pix and it actually taking a pix so the moment for all intent and purpose is gone.Upside:  Newer models may perform better, I do not know.  But, I did like that when I scrolled through the different options on taking a pix, a brief description pops up on the screen as to why you would use this option.  This I have to say is a great option as I am not a photographer.  The editing software is average, but I have Corel for that.  Also, it is a dual lens so it has optical and digital options.External reviews rate OLYMPUS highly, but more of the high end cameras costing $450 and up.  Can be as high as 4 stars and a B+ grade, much higher than NIKON, but not better than CANON.  My camera failed miserably, I could not even download my pix, so I got a refund.2. (9/8/2015 - Full retail $150 - $185) Nikon CoolPix S3600: 21 megapixel, 8 times zoom NIKKOR lens, video 720HDThe photos are really bad, something about the lighting just does not work and when you hold the button for a shot it takes forever, so as with the OLYMPUS the moment is gone.  Also, not very user friendly.  In addition, when using video it barely captures any audio, so the speakers are either really bad or whatever it is that tapes is really bad.It may be a dual option lens as I am assuming the NIKKOR lens means digital, but there is no upside to that, as stated above optical zoom is the best.On the upside, the photo editing software does allow you to apply the different filters in the camera after you download them, I like that option.  The manual is comprehensive, but the website support is minimal, as it seems with all point and shoot.Con, the camera body feels very cheap, like thin plastic so if you drop this one I doubt it would survive.  External reviews give NIKON mostly an average score, 3 out of 5 stars and a C grade, and after seeing one I understand why.Sent this camera back and got a refund._________________I know a long review, but I hope this helps with your choice.SIDE NOTE: Anyone can get a great picture with a digital, especially since you can alter the pix after, but a real photo artist to me is one that uses film.  I am not that, but I can really admire that type of photography and the skill required from taking the photo to developing it in their own dark room.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J46KVNAGHOLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032JRRWK#wasThisHelpful","R1J46KVNAGHOLA","A278S61JJ5Y95L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A278S61JJ5Y95L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Issue is when you go digital zoom which is not a true zoom, but a crop of the picture being taken, it degrades the snapshot, what you want is high zoom with the regular lens and anything over 18mgp does not do well in low light.TIDBIT:DIGITAL zoom is basically a digital crop within the camera and is NOT true magnification. Basically you are only capturing part of an image with LOWER RESOLUTION  and not the full frame.  So it is like fools gold, it looks like gold but not worth anything and in fact makes things worse.OPTICAL zoom IS magnification created by the lens. This is a TRUE ZOOM and should not degrade the image quality. Optical zoom should ALWAYS be your first choice for magnification to make sure the quality of the pix is high.First I bought an Olympus Stylus 5010 with 14MGP and 5x wide angle zoom and it was  dud.  But I gave it 2 stars as it is very user friendly.  This issue again was the quality of the image it took.  No matter what kind of lighting, in or outdoor, it was still grainy and dark, just like this camera.  It had fairly high mark, as this camera, but no where near the quality I would expect with a 14MGP camera.Tried this camera next, the Nikon CoolPix S3600 20.1 megapixel with 8x Zoom and I am assuming the ""NIKOR"" lens is the digital zoom. It is a wide angle lens BUT the photos are really bad, something about the lighting just does not work.  Also, when you hold the button for a snap shot it takes forever to focus and then there is a long delay before the picture is taken so the moment is gone.  Also, not very friendly as far as controls.Here is the deal with OPTICAL zoom, IT IS magnification created by the LENS - Digital zoom is not. Optical is a TRUE ZOOM and should not degrade the image quality. Optical zoom should ALWAYS be your first choice for magnification to make sure the quality of the pix is high.  So spend the money on this option and not megapixel or digital zoom for point and shoot cameras.So, I finally spent the money and bought a CANON AS3000 POWERSHOT which is well over $150.  I have used CANON since a teenager and still have my film camera, which to me is the only way to take photos.  Giving this 2 stars as some people might like it, I did not.Anyone can get a great picture with a digital, especially since you can alter the pix after, but a real photo artist to me is one that uses film.  I am not that or even close, but I can really admire that way type of photography and all the work and expertise that goes into it through to producing the final picture in a dark room.  Like Ansel Adams, such a magnificent photographer!!Still waiting to get the CANON, will review that when I get it and use it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E41NGEWB3O76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ4W58I#wasThisHelpful","R3E41NGEWB3O76","A278S61JJ5Y95L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A278S61JJ5Y95L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 09/15/2015First updating to 2 stars because user friendly, also the seller took great care of me, so no complaints there.I BOUGHT A CANON POWER SHOT AS300, I got an older model with 10.2 megapixels but when buying a camera that is one of the things you look at but not the most important with ""Point and Shoot"", it is like the third thing as you can buy a 15 or 21 megapixel and still get really bad grainey or dark pictures then take a picture with a 10 megapixel camera and it will look better than a high end 20 megapixel camera.Tried the Nikon CoolPix S3600 20.1 megapixel with 8x Zoom and wide angle lense and photos are really bad, something about the lighting just does not work and when you hold the button for a snap shot it takes forever, there is a long delay so the moment is gone.

Like Ansel Adams, such a magnificent photographer!!Still waiting to get the CANON, will review that when I get it and use it._______________This particular model is a dud, I did get it used and was given a full refund, but OLYMPUS has nothing to help you with finding a driver or the software needed to download pictures.  If you buy this brand I think you need to buy a current model but i would first go to the website and see if they have any support software, drivers or manuals.  Very hard to find, had to do a search and I am throwing this away as OLYMPUS has no support for this model.  If it is used, then the hard drive or reformatted and you cannot get to the driver or software to download pix, very bad for anyone trying to sell a used one and if you do not install and charge properly you lose that feature with no way of downloading it from OLYMPUS, so I would say stay away from the entire OLYMPUS line. Very disappointing.Stick with CANON, pricier but the best cameras around.  I just bought a Nikon 21 mgp and will review that one when I get it next week, wanted to try it out and sold by AMAZON so no worries if I do not like it.  Got a deal and found it for $51!!  If this one does not work will save up and by a CANON, but looking to take photos of items to sell on line, so do not need a really professional camera just one that will take good pictures and dl to my pc.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A40EY2AQE08X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031RGEPY#wasThisHelpful","R3A40EY2AQE08X","A278S61JJ5Y95L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A278S61JJ5Y95L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE 09/24/2015I spent the money and bought the following 100% down and they are excellent but you will need to pay for qualityPremium 100% White Goose Down Firm Pillow, Queen Size  and it is a Queen, firm for $88 and you get only ONE (1) pillowThe other ones are King size, soft, for around $140 for TWO (2) pillowsLUXURIOUS Two (2) Goose Down Pillows - 1200 Thread Count 100% Egyptian Cotton Cover , Soft, King Size, Set of 2 Pillows__________________________UPDATE 09/10/2015DOWNGRADING, no pun intended, to 1 star, if I could I would give negative 3 stars.  I do not know who wrote the postive reviewes but the had to have been planted.  THESE ARE THE WORST PILLOWS EVER.  I usually buy my bedding from ""The Company Store"" and they are NOT inexpensive, but the quality is the best around.  I guess it does matter what you pay for pillows:Negatives:1.  VERY VERY uncomfortable, you feel EVERY feather2.  The get flat within 30 minutes3.  They weigh a ton4.  they do not fluff up easily6.  They feel very hard when you lay your head on them, the are basically like a brickMaybe will use them for the dogs, but nothing else.  Next I will buy pillows from AMAZON that are at least 75% down, they have 2 Queens for $89, will try that first, 550 fill power and 100% down.  Will review those when I buy and use them.__________________________These are ONLY 5% down, so I consider them ""FEATHER PILLOWS"" and very firm.  It will work in order to support my Mom's shoulders, she has 2 tears, but will get 2 more pillows that are at least 30% down next.  When it comes to pillows, you do get what you paid for.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQT7Z4QWJQBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJFKNRS#wasThisHelpful","R2FQT7Z4QWJQBE","A278S61JJ5Y95L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A278S61JJ5Y95L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first bought this item I think about a year ago, and it was for my artwork.  I paint and draw.  But I did not like it for that since it had such a small area that it lit up, so I did not give it a great rating but an average one.  This time it is 5 stars but I bought it for my sewing machine area.  I am older and when you get older it gets harder to see, especially in the dark or a room that is not well lit.  Part of nature and part of getting old.  But this is perfect for my sewing area as:1.  Small footprint2.  Illuminates a big enough area so that I can see clearly, the light on my sewing machine is not enough even though quite bright3.  The light is excellent on it's brightest setting as you can see even the smallest detail4.  The quality of the light is excellentAlso, I paid 1/3 the cost of the item, which is another plus.  I gave the black one I bought to my Mom for when she crochet's and she loves it.  So, if you are looking for a study lamp, a lamp to light up what your sewing or for crafts, for crochet or knitting, even a table lamp then this is the one.  And no need to spend $100, when you can get it on AMAZON for around $35.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1HJNFEIOP97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KO2ZSE#wasThisHelpful","R2V1HJNFEIOP97","A278S61JJ5Y95L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A278S61JJ5Y95L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far it seems to be in par with my Favorite TAO Embroidery thread.  I bought this only because TAO was out of black and I really needed balck.  This is a 60wt polyester ""BOBBIN"" thread and would not use it for any kind of stitching that needs heavy duty, but I am going to try it on regular sewing, as in garments as a bobbin thread.  Some complain about this thread bunching up, that has not happened to me and I use a CURVY SINGER 8780 computerized sewing machine, so an intermediate machine.If you are looking for one that I really liked, try this or the ones below by TAO, pre-wound and on large spool.Prewound Bobbins - 36 Pieces of Polyester Thread Perfectly Match Brother Embroidery Machine Size A (156) ++ FREE BonusesTAOindustry 40 Variety Embroidery Thread - Best For Personalizing, Quilting, Monograming, Customizing all + Free Color Card Matching to Brother Color Catalog. 550Yardsor TAOindustry Embroidery Polyester Thread - 1 Large 5500Y White Spool Best For Bobbin Match Brother Machines+ FREE BonusesSold by: TAOindustry$9.99","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CRQGCOATWGPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHVJ38U#wasThisHelpful","R2CRQGCOATWGPB","A278S61JJ5Y95L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A278S61JJ5Y95L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
