"There are a lot of expensive range hoods out there and many of them are not worth it.  Sure they look pretty but under the hood they just aren't that good.  This is one of Zephyr's most expensive hoods and for a good reason.First of all, this hood uses LED lights instead of incandescent or halogen bulbs.  This has 3 very distinct benefits.  1) No heat.  2) Less electricity 3) Longer lasting.  There are not many range hood makers using LEDs but Zephyr is one of themThe second reason and one of the biggest is this model uses a brushless motor for its blower.  Brushless motors are quite a bit more expensive than regular motors (Think Dyson) but is what makes this hood so special.  1)  Brushless motor is quieter.  2)  Brushless motor is stronger  3) Brushless motor uses less electricity.  This brushless motor is what enables this range hood to be almost whisper quiet on its lowest setting and also be able to push out 715 cfm while being quieter than most range hoods at 250 cfm.Finally, the thing that makes this one of the most expensive in the Zephyr line is the unique LED lighting on the ""hood"" itself.  This allows the hood to be either blue, white, or orange depending on your kitchen or your mood.  I know of no other hood which can do that and is a great talking point when people see it.Overall, Zephyr make amazing range hoods and this is one of their best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GK945P6QQYCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EM3NRQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GK945P6QQYCP","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are perfect and the best cards to get.  They are quite a bit more expensive than the other cards I've seen but are completely worth it.First off, there is only one problem per card.  One side has the answer the other side does not.  This is what you want as you are trying to get your kids to memorize the answer not figure it out.  Therefore, I have my kids go through the side with the answer and say it out loud.  This hits visual, verbal, auditory methods of input into the brain.  After something becomes too easy I remove the cards ( 0, 1, 10 etc).  I have them go through the cards 2 to 5 times depending on how many cards are left.  After they have done that I have them do a 5 min drill sheet to see what they have learned and I will sometime go through the cards with them looking a the non-answered side to see which ones are still hard and which ones are too easy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DM5QQRWTMTGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062TM538#wasThisHelpful","R1DM5QQRWTMTGN","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Obligatory Warning:  I am not a doctor and nor am I pretending to be one.  I am not giving any medical advice all I am doing is reviewing a product and how I use it.  If you are interested in finding out more about Ozone, I recommend watching some of Dr Robert Rowen‚Äôs, MD videos or trying to find the medical research by the German medical establishment or Cuban medical establishment.  Both of countries have made some pretty impressive headway.I am going to be reviewing and comparing the Steam Sauna Durherm Portable Personal Folding Home Steam Sauna and the Far IR Sauna DURHERM DIF-202 IR FAR Infrared Indoor Portable Foldable Sauna with Heating Food Pad and Chair.  Before talking about the saunas I will briefly touch on why you would want to sauna.Why Sauna?Sauna relieve stressSauna relax muscles and soothe aches/pains in both muscles and jointsSauna flush toxinsSauna cleanses the skinSaunas can help fight illness ‚Äî One of the most powerful way your immune system fights illnesses is by generating a fever.  The only problem when your body does it is it also raises the temperature of your brain.  This has obvious impactions as are felt when you have a fever.  By keeping your head out, your body temperature is increased while your brain‚Äôs temperature is not raised nearly as much.  Also, while ozone has many befits of providing oxygen to your body, it is an irritant for your lungs, so you could not use ozone in an enclosed whole body sauna.I‚Äôm not going to go into the benefits of oxygenating your body with ozone.  I will say that I run a water bubbler in between the ozone generator and the sauna.  This provides 2 benefits  then it will humidify the ozone before it reaches the sauna which is more important for the Far IR than the steam but it also makes a nice glass of ozone water to drink after the sauna.Overall, both of these saunas provide the benefits of hyperthermia.  It is amazing that you can do this for $100 to $200 and not take up a room in your house.  Modern technology is great.  Below is a rundown of the pros and cons of the two saunas.  I far prefer the Far IR sauna and I feel it is well worth the difference in price and is the much better value.Pros Steam SaunaCheaperBetter at warming the legs than the Far IR oneWarms up in 5 min from room temperature water.  No need to boil water first.ConsMore water in the sauna afterwards.  More to leak out of the sauna onto the floor.  I only had this problem when I moved it.  However, I do keep a towel under this sauna.- I use distilled water so this is not a problem for me but if you use  water with minerals you will have do clean the minerals off the steam generator with white vinegar or citric acid periodically- Steam nozzle can get moved accidentally and aim the steam at you which can be painfully hot- Fairly intensive to set up so it is not something you are really going to want to disassemble and reassemble daily.  Takes about 5 min.- Rudimentary controls.  The steam generator has one of those wind knob to roughly set the time.  That is the only thing you can set.  Can‚Äôt change the timer while in the sauna.Can only accommodate a little over 6 feet  (My guess would be maybe unto 6‚Äô 3‚Äù depending on how much you scrunch.)More difficult to set upHave to bring water to the steam generatorNo chair.  I bought a $20 plastic chair.Pro Far IR SaunaBetter controls - Can set temp between 130 and 150 in increments of 5.  Can set time from 5 to 30 min in increments of 5.  You can easily set the timer longer while in the sauna.  Can switch on the foot warming pad or leave it off.Warms up quickly.  I set it at 150 deg and 5 min and at the end of the time I reset the time for 30 min and jump in.The panels do get hot and are not comfortable to continually touch but they are not so hot as to burn you on contact.Incredibly easy to set up.  Simply fold open.  If you don‚Äôt want to leave it out, it folds into a slim package you could put in a closet or under your bed.Has a floor piece.Includes chair.Better control for heating specific parts.  If you want your arms warmer you can hold them closer to the 2 side Far IR heaters.  Want your back warmer, lean back a little further.  This is somewhat restricted by the neck collar which is designed to prevent you from being too far back and getting burned from the rear heater.ConsLegs not as heated as well as arms and torso.  I wish they could put 2 smaller heating plates in the front by your legs one on each side of the zipper.More plastic inside.  The wire for the footpad and the foot pad itself are plastic and therefore will eventually be corroded by the ozone.  However, all of the plates and the wires for the plates are outside.  Also, I am guessing it is going to be years before the ozone eats the plastic.  I only flow 1/8 liter per min.  If this becomes an issue sooner I will update.Can only accommodate a little over 6 feet (My guess would be maybe unto 6‚Äô 3‚Äù depending on how much you scrunch.)Overall, I greatly prefer the Far IR sauna and I think it is well worth the little bit extra you pay.

"D.M. Cavalier is very much mistaken.  This sauna does not make NEAR IR and nor does it make Medium IR.  I will provide some links in the comments but here is how you can tell it is not near IR.‚ÄúNear Infrared‚Äù, ‚ÄúIRA‚Äù, ‚ÄúShort wave‚Äù or ‚ÄúBright‚Äù Infrared heaters and ‚ÄúHeat Lamps‚Äù operate between 780†nm to 1,400¬†nm and emit temperatures of 1300¬∞C and more plus a bright red visible light. Emitters are typically Quartz with a reflector to concentrate the heat in a particular direction.‚ÄúMedium Infrared‚Äù, ‚ÄúIRB‚Äù or ‚ÄúMedium Wave ‚Äú infrared heaters¬† operate between 1,400¬†nm and 3,000¬†nm and emit temperatures¬† of 500 ‚Äì 800¬∞C and produce a deep red light (like bar fires).‚ÄúFar infrared‚Äù, ‚ÄúIRC‚Äù, ‚ÄúLong wave‚Äù or ‚ÄúDark Radiators‚Äù operate in the wavelengths above 3,000¬†nm.¬† Far Infrared elements emit much lower temperatures, typically¬† around the 100¬∞C mark and no visible light.¬† Human and animal skin absorbs Far infrared specifically well, because of its 80% water composition, making Far Infrared a biologically significant heating wavelength for humans and animals.Far Infrared heaters use a number of different elements, with popular ones being nickel or fecralloy wiring or more recently carbon fibre.He is also incorrect that only ceramic semiconductors  are used as FAR IR heaters.  Carbon while not the best material, is used extensively for its inexpensive price.It is very obvious that D.M. Cavalier  does not have the faintest idea what he is talking about and doesn‚Äôt own the product.Obligatory Warning:  I am not a doctor and nor am I pretending to be one.

"In the picture these marbles look like cat eye marbles.  They are not.  They have some sort of exterior shimmery coating which gives a nice appearance.  I am not sure how durable this coating is and I don't know what it is made of.  Additionally, these marbles are not round.  They are roughly round but they are not round.  They are also not a uniform size.  I have uploaded a photo to show what I received.As far as price goes, they seem overpriced.  A quick search of Amazon and I found these two items.  200 Pieces Cats Eyes Glass Marble / Sling Shot Ammo for $8.93 or JMK 100 pcs Glass Marbles with Shooter for $5.88.For me this is not a product I would recommend.I was provided a sample of this product for a fair review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UARJ6USY1ELH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNS4L9C#wasThisHelpful","R1UARJ6USY1ELH","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic sink.  The blue fusion color is gorgeous.  Everything about this sink is top notch.The reason I give this sink 4 stars is this is a replacement sink.  I originally bought the sink faucet combo which is also amazing.  However, the installation instructions for the sink leave a little to be desired.  Also, the installation as it currently stands is flawed.  The bottom of this sink is not flat.  It is fairly curved.  So it does not sit on a counter top very well.  If you buy a round vessel sink, then you get a part for the sink to sit on in-between the counter top.  This part is curved on the top and has a gasket on the bottom.  This sink needs a piece like that as you don't want your glass sink sitting directly on a stone counter top.  The outside of the sink is the blue leaf and you don't want that rubbing on the counter top.  Also, since it is curved it is not very stable like that.  My first attempt, I tried to put a gasket in-between the sink and the counter top.  I couldn't really find one that fit very well so the sink moved too much and caused rubbing on the blue leaf.  So I needed to replace the sink.This time what I did was put down a fairly large patch of clear silicon around the hole on the counter top.  I then lowered the sink onto the patch and then screwed the drain in.  This has worked great so far.  The first install, the sink was very wiggly.  If you looked at it funny it would move.  With this install, the sink is much more solid.  With how wide the sink is, it still barely moves in a rotational direction. However, laterally and longitudinally, it is very solid.My other note is vessel sinks are not the best for smaller children as they like to use them as a handle for pulling themselves up.  Just something to consider.Overall, this sink is amazing and beautiful but I am not sure what Kraus was thinking with the installation.  They need to include a curved part to cradle the sink with a silicone gasket on both sides to keep it from moving.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6LRR8VLYBQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00590WDR4#wasThisHelpful","RU6LRR8VLYBQG","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these sheets based on all of the wonderful reviews.  When I first got them, I was amazed at how soft and comfortable they are.  Really amazing sheets.Since I read the review I about the ""morons"" who can't follow directions, I have been exceedingly careful to follow the washing directions, cold water, low heat dry etc.None of that mattered as after about a month, the sheets have little balls all over them.  Since, the balls are mostly located on the points where ones body interacts with them with the greatest force, I conclude they are created from the friction of sleeping on them.It doesn't really matter how they are caused, the only thing that matters is they are exceedingly uncomfortable and I am looking for a replacement.Overall, if you don't mind spending $100 for new sheets every 2 weeks, these are fantastic.  If you think $100 sheets should last longer than 2 weeks I would recommend shopping elsewhere.  I have used DreamFit in the past and they have worked great.  I am thinking of trying their DreamFit 5 which are also bamboo sheets but after this experience I don't know if I want to risk the $200.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWMH829OVHKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YB83HZC#wasThisHelpful","R1CWMH829OVHKN","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are great sounding ear buds.  I give the sound quality a 7 which is the highest I feel qualified to give.These earbuds are also very comfortable.  I give them an 8.  The ear buds fit comfortably inside your ear.  However, the actual ear buds are slightly larger than others I have tried so I doc 1 point for comfort on that.  Also, the cord is slightly longer than some others I have.  I prefer the shorter cord, so I doc another point for that.The controls on these earbuds are easy to use and this was very easy to pair with my iPhone 6.  So a 10 for the controls.Overall, these are really nice bluetooth ear buds and are my second favorite pair.  For me the cord is longer than I prefer but for others the added length my be welcomed.

"This oil is expensive.  Of that there is no doubt.  However, it is more than worth it.  Our bodies need oil to function and this oil is a very good oil for that. Here is what this oil can do for you.  1) It helps you to feel full.  2)  It provides a slow even burn for your body so your insulin levels don't spike and it provides you energy throughout the day.A lot of reviews of this product have mentioned not cooking with this oil and I completely disagree with that.  First of all, this oil is exceptionally good for your body.  Second and most important for cooking is this oil is exceedingly stable with heat.  So while olive oil is great for salad dressing, it is a very poor cooking oil.  This, however, is a fantastic cooking oil.  As it doesn't smoke or burn up in the 300 to 400 deg range.  That means it keeps working as a lubricant with your pans and it doesn't convert into burnt substances which are not good for you.  Now this is not something you want to deep fry in.  Not that you really want to deep fry anything anyway.  But this oils is far too expensive to do something like that.  I use this oil basically as a replacement for butter.  One thing to note is this oil has no flavor so you need to add your own.  It is a blank flavor slate upon which you make your own flavors.So I use this oil for cooking my eggs.  I use this oil when cooking broccoli.  I use this oil for baking.  I use this oil on my popcorn.  Put on some Himalayan Pink Salt and you have some of the best tasting popcorn you have ever had.Do yourself a favor.  Stop using vegetable oils and butter for cooking.  Use this instead.  It has allowed me to reduce my portion sizes and still be comfortably full.  I can't recommend this Oil highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376NBI63JVALM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW5UVY#wasThisHelpful","R376NBI63JVALM","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have received 3 pairs of wireless bluetooth ear buds to review and these are my favorite of the 3.  All 3 of them have amazing sound.  I would give each of them a rating of 7 for the sound.  I don't really feel that I have a good enough ear to give anything a higher rating than that for sound.All three of the ear buds were exceedingly easy to pair with my iPhone.  All 3 ear buds have controls to answer a phone call, change volume, and change tracks.The place where this pair exceeds the others is comfort.  All 3 pairs have changeable sizes for the ear piece, so all of them are good that way.  However, one of the other pairs has the controls on the wire instead of the ear piece.  This causes the wire to pull in that direction and I find it fairly annoying.  The other set is about equal in comfort but has a slightly longer cord and slightly bigger ear pieces.  It is for this reason this pair is my favorite of the 3.Subjective Ratings of this HeadsetSound 7 (the best I feel qualified to give out)Pairing 10Easy of function 9Comfort 9Overall, these are a very nice set of bluetooth ear buds and I highly recommend them.I had to pay shipping but I received the sample for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R170YI7YTIRFZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3MTT22#wasThisHelpful","R170YI7YTIRFZO","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great tea and coffee maker.  It is very light.  It fits over most sizes of cups and mugs.  Perhaps one of the most important features of this beverage maker is that it is exceedingly easy to clean.  Since it doesn't come apart it looks like it might be difficult to clean.  However, simply dump the grounds out into the trash and then rinse from the bottom side.As far as making coffee goes, just put in your favorite freshly ground coffee, fill with almost boiling water and let stand for a minute or two.  Then just put it on top of your mug and you have some amazing coffee.  We like to use this for Cafe Du Monde coffee also.Overall, this product does what it claims to do, is inexpensive, is light, and is easy to clean up.

"This book is a great little book just by itself.  The artwork and printing is first rate.  The story is a cute story and well written.  The AR (augmented reality) is a nice feature also.  My 7 and 6 year old children really were thrilled by it.The story itself teaches teamwork and redemption which I think are admirable traits to teach.The AR is a neat feature and the kids enjoyed it.

"These mats are wonderful.  They make cooking on the grill a real joy.  Below are some of the benefits you get from using these mats.1) Your food will cook in its own juice.  This keeps meat nice and tender.  I made some amazing tender and juicy chicken breasts.  If you want a dry crispy exterior simply move it off the mat onto the grill after cooking and sear the outside.  One thing to note is because it cooks in its own juice, you can tone down the marinate a little otherwise it can be too overpowering.2) Easy clean up.3) Much less mess on the grill.  If there is too much grease it can overflow.  However, any that doesn't overflow, you just let cool and then scrape off.4) Cook small and delicate food without it falling through or caking to the grill and then breaking.5) I have IR grill so this keeps the grates clean without the need for scrubbing which can cause rust.6) Use it in your baking pan to make cookies.  Keeps the pan clean and the cookies just slide off.7) Use it to cook really crispy chicken wings in your oven. Then instead of scrubbing the grease off the pan or oven, you just scrape it off.While I don't think this ranks up with the invention of the wheel or fire, I do think this is an amazing product which can change the way you cook and clean up the cooking.I don't have the other cheaper version of this mat so I can't directly compare them.  I can say these mats have a good stiffness to them and work great.  A solid 5 star product.I was provided a sample for an honest review.  However, I liked them so much I bought myself another set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E41MLSNW2D5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJVTB96#wasThisHelpful","R1E41MLSNW2D5T","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For day to day use, I find this bottle a little weird to use.  when it is full it is fairly rigid so one handed use is practical.  As you drink the water, the bottle becomes floppy which makes it difficult to drink with one hand.  You need two.  So this is not something I would really use on a day to day basis as I have a nice stainless steel, double insulated bottle which keeps my water wonderfully cold.However, this bottle rolls up into a very small and lightweight package.  This perfect for camping or to put into a survival bag.  Most bottles of that type are made of a plastic which is much thinner than this silicone.  It is strong but I still very much prefer this over those bags.  The silicone has a very nice texture and feel to it.  This bottle also has a handy carabiner to attach it to a backpack or belt loop.Overall, this is a great little bottle made of food grade silicone.  Day-to-day it is a little weird to use.

It allows you to see the port in the dark to plug in the usb cord but it is not very bright so it doesn't bother you when trying to sleep.When I travel, I actually prefer a multi plug device that has 3 regular outlets and 2 usb outlets.

"These headphones are light and sound great. However, for me I have never worn a over-the-ear head set that doesn't hurt by ears.  For the first hour or two these do not hurt my ears.  However, after that, my ears do start hurting so because of this I rate them 4 stars.  I've gone back and forth between 4 and 5 stars because I am sensitive to this and not every one is.  However, I will hold the 5 stars for the first pair that doesn't.  So if you are like me and over the ear headphones generally hurt your ears, these will also.I was also very pleasantly surprised by how nice these sound.  The price of these makes you think they will only sound mediocre.  However, I have paid much more for corded headphones that only sound marginally better. The sound makes for very pleasant listeningOverall, these are really nice headphones that sound great, and are very easy to pair with your phone.  They are light on your head but if you are prone to over-the-ear headphones hurting your ears then these will hurt your ears also.  For people who are not sensitive to over-the-ear style these are a solid choice.  If you are sensitive then I would recommend either on-the-ear or ear buds.I was provided a sample for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33Z9SFEUIQL12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STPHMI6#wasThisHelpful","R33Z9SFEUIQL12","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one solid accurate scale for a great price.  There are 2 really nice features this scale has which not many others have.The first feature is the readout is removed from the scale.  This means with oversized packages you can still read out the weight.  Other scales I have used without this feature, you either have to do gymnastics to see the readout or hope that it locks in for when you remove the weight.  With this scale you can see the weight as it is still sitting on it.The second feature is the TARE button.  This allows you to put an object on the scale and then reset the scale to zero.  This allows you to measure items such as liquids, dirt, etc which you normally could not weigh.  Simply put on a container, press the TARE button, and then put your items in the container.This scale is built like a tank.  I was amazed how heavy and solid this scale is.  Very nice.I have tested this scale against 2 others and it was dead accurate.Overall, you can't go wrong with this as a postal or general purpose scale.I was provided a sample for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HDNMBN72TN4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9D5IFM#wasThisHelpful","R3HDNMBN72TN4R","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a comfortable Travel Pillow.  It kind of has a beanbag feel to it and it conforms to your head and neck very nicely and comfortably.  Also, I didn't really feel like it got too hot either.The price of this is just a little over a regular travel pillow.  For that couple of dollars extra you get the massage option.  For me personally, I thought even the lowest frequency was too fast for a nice massage.  Too me this is a buzz type vibration instead of boat rocking or pendulum speed vibration. I would have preferred about 1/2 to 1/4 of the vibration speed.  My wife, however, thought the massage feature was very nice and enjoyed it.So if you are thinking about this for the massage feature, figure out if a buzz vibration is slow enough for you.I was provided a sample for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28YG3WHX41D3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY0J536#wasThisHelpful","R28YG3WHX41D3S","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Right out of the case this keyboard and case work really well and feel very nice.  It has a built in battery and the blue tooth sinks up easily with my iPad mini.  This is the perfect size for my iPad mini.  The keyboard feels nice to type on and the claim is for 5 million key strokes.This case came with a charging cord which you plug into a standard USB port.The reason I have the title I have listed is I had a keyboard and case previously which looked and felt exactly like this one.  I had no problems with it myself.  However, occasionally, I lent it to my 7 year old to play with and shortly thereafter, a key came up missing and the case started to come unglued.  So I would recommend being gentle with the keyboard and don't let little kids play with it.I don't know for certain this is the same keyboard so I can't review it based on the other keyboard.

"I loves these measuring cups.  Because they are collapsable, 2 sets takes up about the same amount of space as one non-collapsible set.  These are easy to uncollapse but the easiest way I have found to collapse them is to put them on a flat surface and push down.That fact these can withstand 400deg and can be microwaved is very nice and useful.The only downside I have found with these cups verses regular ones is if you are trying to scoop something semi-solid like butter or coconut oil.

"First off, JJCEO's review of this is so through and detailed there is really not any more to be said with regard to a review.  Everything he says in his review is very accurate and very informative.  So watch his video to see how this product handles and functions.With that said, I am going to focus more on why you would want a sound level meter.1) The first and most obvious would be to check sound levels in your house.  If there are places in your house that you spend considerable amounts of time in and they consistently read 60db or greater you may want to do something about trying reduce the noise levels.  Also, if you are trying to soundproof or quite your house then a meter like this will be crucial to test the success of your efforts.2)  Another very important area to check could be your work.  If you have a consistently loud work environment it can seriously damage your health (Headaches, tinnitus, hearing loss, fatigue, etc).  For example according to OSHA occupational noise exposure 1910.95, you can only be exposed to 100db for 2 hours per day without hearing protection.  Your office may be louder than you think and you won't know without testing.3) You have a neighbor who thinks it is cool to drive a vehicle with no muffler (especially motorcycles)  The EPA adopted a 80db at 35mph standard for motorcycles (less for cars) which took effect sometime around 1986.  Many states have a lower requirement (78db).  After market parts have to meet the same standards.  If you have a neighbor who refuses to abide by this, you could film the vehicle and noise meter and then go to the police and try to get them to enforce the standard.  I had a neighbor who like to start his illegally modified Harley at 0500 every morning and leave it running for 30min to warm up.  I wish I had this meter back then.4) Spot level testing.  If you are setting up a PA system or any sort of music system, this would allow you to test different spots in your space and ensure sound levels are adequate for the purpose required.5)  Show your teenagers how loud their music is from speakers or headphones (ear buds would be hard to test but I did test headphones).  Refer to OSHA noise guidelines.6) Noise ordnance violations.  Maybe you have neighbors who like to party late into the night especially on weeknights.  Maybe you live in an apartment complex with a loud neighbor.  You can show your landlord just how loud they are or be able to tell the police how loud the neighbors are being.Noise pollution can be hazardous to your health and this tool gives you the ability to find any noise pollution which might be impacting your life so you can do something about it.I was provided a sample for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQ611APQXZE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A13M9D2#wasThisHelpful","R3SQ611APQXZE4","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These are pricy and only you can decide if the price it worth it but needless to say I will be purchasing more of these in the very near future.

"I've had Phoenix since V3 and it has worked great.  Also, I now own V5 as a free upgrade from V3.0.  You cannot beat that for customer support.  All of the models are free also.If you want to learn to fly a RC Helicopter this is where you start.  You want Phoenix over RealFlight because of the great support and also because it comes with the helicopter model I recommend as your learning helicopter; the Nano.  Welcome to the adventure.  The first thing you need to do is get the version of this that doesn't come with a radio.  You will want to buy the DX6i Transmitter Only MD2 radio or better radio.  This radio will carry you through the Blade 450 and you can bind up to 6 aircraft to it and it only cost 130 bucks which is dirt cheap for what it does.When you get this program download, make sure you download the Blade Nano CP as this is what you are going to buy further on down the road (Just go ahead and down load everything but especially this aircraft).  Next download the Nano CP Spektrum DX6i setting from the web (Something to note, on the helo, the collective channel is reversed.  To you the same profile in the sim you need to reverse the collective channel in the program because it is setup normally).Now you have the radio you are going to use to when you get your helo, you have it set up the same way as you will use it, and you have the helo modeled in the sim.  You are pretty well set up for success now.  One thing to note, is the sim is easier in some ways and more difficult in some.  Also, there is a big difference between sitting in front of a screen and having this little angry bee flying at your head.  So keep that in mind.Before continuing, I will answer your question about why the Blade mCP X Bind and Fly RC Helicopter.  There are really 3 main reasons, the first is it doesn't have a stab bar.  To compensate for that, this helo is actually comparatively stable.  The second and most important is damage resistance.  I will tell your right now.  You are going to crash.  Even after hours in the sim, you will crash.  Got that.  If you, use your throttle cut before you actually hit anything, it is very likely, this helicopter will be flyable after the crash.  This is because of the light weight and lack of a stab bar.  Almost any crash with the 450 is going to put it out of commission (weight and stab bar).  The 3rd reason is repair costs are very cheap.  If you think I am off the mark on this, try flying the Blade 450 or Trex 600 in the sim.  See how many times you crash)I tried to learn to fly a RC helicopter twice before the mCP X and came away frustrated and significantly poorer both times (Hirobo Shuttle and TRex 450).  And the Nano CP is even better to learn on than the mCP X was.Start with the sim and you are going to save tons of money and frustration.  With your radio hooked up to the computer and the Blade mCP X running, practice your hovering (The sim has hover training but I personally did not find it very useful  Hover nose out until you can stay in one location.  Hover nose left and right until you can do the same.  Hover nose in.  Now do all of the same upside down.  Practice 30min a day every day.  After a few months, maybe sooner, you should have your hovering down.  Don't get frustrated, these little things are incredibly difficult to fly.  The biggest thing you are going to do is make your control movements to big.  If you are conscious of the stick moving, your movements are too big.Once you have that down, get yourself a Blade Nano CP BNF and start your practice all over again.  Move slowly  Don't expect to be able to do in real life what you can in the sim but you will be able to move rapidly because of your practice.Ok so I talked about how to learn to fly, but why this simulator.  The main reason is it has the Blade Nano.  Period.  However, I will say I have a very old computer and this program runs very smoothly on it.  So that is another plus.  I have seen some people knocking this sim because it has picture environments instead of 3D.  My response to that is big deal.  I really don't care that much about the environments and picture allows this to run smoothly on a slower computer.  Also, in V5 there are some 3D locals.  Everything I have seen and read about this sim says it  is realistic.  I would agree with that statement as much as any sim can be realistic. (Blade mCP X experiences tail blow outs and nose rotation during autorotations which does not happen in the sim)As far as the training and lessons go,  I am not really impressed.  There is a ton of work that needs to be done to make these more useful learning devices.  The programmers of this program should look at what was done in any of the Gran Turismo to see how they could make the training much better.  You will need to come to this program with your own training syllabus.  As I said before, there is an autorotation and hovering training mode.  The hovering mode gives you 1 control at a time.  Maybe useful for starting but you will quickly outgrow it.  Additionally, there are some demo lessons but the instruction goes far too fast to keep up with.  The training part really needs to be re-thought and improved.The extras can be useful and fun.  One extra is balloon pop.  The nice thing with this is it takes your conscious mind off of flying and put it on hitting the balloons.  As they said on Last Samurai, some times you have ""too many minds"".Overall, this is a great program which is an invaluable tool to help you learn to fly RC helicopters.  It will make you better quicker and cheaper than would otherwise be possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZO19F8FE2VJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK0CZBO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZO19F8FE2VJI","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't use Compact Flash cards very much any more.  I only own one old camera which uses them.  So the card that I own is an old Lexar Platinum II 4GB 200x.  I have tested this reader writer compared to the other USB 3.0 reader writer I own.  This CF memory reader wrote to the card at an average of 13.3 MB/s and read at a very fast 44 MB/s.  With the other reader using the exact same card and data, the average was 8.2 MB/s write and 30 MB/s.  So the manufactures claims about this reader being faster than other USB 3 readers is accurate from my experience.One of the things I have always disliked about the CF is the fact pins can be bent especially in expensive cameras.  From my experience with this reader are that the card fits in snugly to prevent any pins from getting bent.  For me it worked very well.I was provided a sample for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YM4SIZYXRFVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IMFX2K#wasThisHelpful","R1YM4SIZYXRFVX","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter just finished Black Beauty in her class and love it.  So I decided to surprise her with this book.  I was very impressed with the length and thoroughness of this version.  I was expecting  it to be around 50 pages and it clocks in at 170+ pages.  About 150 pages are dedicated to the story and 20 pages are dedicated to story boards.  That bonus was most welcome also as my daughter loves to draw and seeing the story boards shows her the process.This graphic novel obviously doesn't contain 100% of what the book has in it but it is pretty close.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T00JDJUDJ3IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014240408X#wasThisHelpful","R1T00JDJUDJ3IV","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please be aware that learning to fly a helicopter like this is going to be difficult and frustrating.  You may be able to do magic with your fixed pitch helicopter but that experience has more negatives associated with learning to fly a full collective helicopter and very little in the way of positives.My first piece of advice is to not look a helicopters just yet and purchase the Phoenix R/C Pro Simulator Version 5.0 (As a note, I purchased this back at version 3 and I have never had to pay for an upgrade or for models.  Hats off to the developers for that.) and a Spektrum DX6i Transmitter Only MD2. Obviously since you now own a very good radio, I recommend the BNF version when you do get the helicopter. BNF stands for Bind N Fly and includes everything except the radio. RTF stands for Ready to Fly and comes with everything you need to fly. However, the radio is no where near capable as the DX6i and you are just wasting your money on it.Put your time in practicing how to hover in all aspects with the Blade Nano before purchasing this helicopter. Otherwise you will be tempted to fly this which will most likely end in a crash.Now the good news with the Blade Nano CP is that does not necessarily mean you will need to rebuild your aircraft and this is why I recommend this helicopter for learning how to fly a helicopter.  I learned on the Blade mCP X and while that was a very good helicopter to learn on it was bigger which makes it more prone to damage and it had tail blow outs which this helicopter does not,  Before the Blade mCP X, I tried twice to learn to fly RC helis and both times I came away exceedingly frustrated and much poorer for the attempt (Hirobo Shuttle and Align T-Rex). There are 3 main reasons I recommend the Nano CP. The first is the lack of a stab bar. The electronics which replace the stab bar actually make it more stable then it has any right to be. The second and most important is listed above. The lack of damage from a crash is huge. You can get right back up and continue learning. The 3rd reason is even if there is damage it is not very expensive to repair. All of these 3 reasons have made my 3rd attempt successful.The Nano CP is a joy to fly. It is incredibly nimble and powerful. In some ways it exceeds its bigger brethren. However, it is definitely not a replacement for them.So going back to the sim. First off set the DX6i up using the 3D setting for the Nano CP (As of right now, the actual aircraft requires collective reversing for the DX6i while the sim doesn't. Don't let this catch you out). Set the F Mode (flight mode) to Sport mode so the throttle is disconnected from the collective and is set at 100%. Start out by learning how to hover with the nose out. Then learn nose left and right. Then learn nose in. After you have done all of that. Learn upside down nose in. Then left, right, and nose out. Practice this 30 min a day everyday and you should have it very shortly. There are a couple of things to know about helos especially for hovering. Because the helicopter is dynamically unstable, everything takes three control movements. The first is to either stop or start something. The second movement is cancel that input by putting in an opposite input. The third movement is to neutralize the controls. When you start out you are put in way to much 2nd movement and you are going to miss the center. This is going to lead to huge over controlling. Get this under control in the sim.Now when you start flying your helo don't try your toughest hovering trick right off the bat. The sim is good but it is not perfect. Go through the sequence for the sim and once you have each mastered then move on. Another thing. The instructions say to not touch the right stick until you have the bird in the air. That is semi-good advice. If you look down and see the blade arc is not straight to the ground the helo is going to do something funky when it comes off the ground. Use the right stick to level the blade arc. Also, use the left stick to stop the helo spinning while it is on the ground. Then as the bird comes off the ground if it is moving in one direction of the other fix that.One thing to know about learning to fly a RC heli is you are going to crash. The most important thing to learn about this heli is when you are about to crash into something make sure you click your throttle hold switch which should immediately cut power to the rotors. Fight your instinct to slam the collective down as this will cause some nasty crashes. If you are able to cut the power before hitting anything, then damage to the heli will be minimal to none. Here are some things I have learned and some recommended spares.1) If you have any power still driving the rotors when they hit something, this will push the main gear down the main shaft. When you look are checking your helo make sure the main shaft cannot move up and down. If it can, push up on the main gear and push down and twist on the rotor head until there is no play. So far no trouble with the main shaft but I would have an extra main gear floating around.2) If it drives the gear down too far it can crack the landing skids. You can use super glue to put it back together but it is helpful to have a couple of skids on hand also.3) You are going to lose the rotor head pitch change links. There are 2 things you can do. First off, get the aluminum rotor head. This has a closed cage to hold those little buggers. You will lose less of them. Second, buy the rotor head linkage set.4) My first set of blades got pretty well beat up. They still worked fine but did not track as well as they should have.5) I have not had any problems with the feathering spindle, but if you have a bad crash with power on, you can be sure that bad johnny will bend. Get the titanium one and have a couple of spares.6) The parts are tiny. Get yourself one of those lit magnifying glasses or a strong pair of reading glasses so you can see the parts.7 Two batteries is nowhere near enough. Get yourself these Lightning Power Li-po 300mAh 3.7V 1S 35C for mCPx (4) battereis. These batteries or 300 mAh instead of 2oo and they are 35C instead of 25C so they last longer and give better response. Six batteries is good and is enough for 24 min of practice.The mCP X was revolutionary.  Never before had some much capability been available in such a small package. The Nano is a welcome evolution on the mCP X.  While not bullet proof, this bird can survive quite a few wrecks without damage. Almost any 450 crash is going to set you back a significant amount of money. If you're not crashing, you're not learning because you are not pushing your boundaries. That is oversimplified but not by much. Practice in the sim and then push your boundaries in real life. If you have a good instructor, then that person can help you progress without so many crashes. Now some of you may be wondering about starting with the Blade mSR. My recommendation is not to. I own the mSR and it is a blasts. However, it taught me bad habits I had to unlearn on this bird. Start with the sim and then get this.Pros:Amazing capabilities in a tiny packageCan come through certain crashes without damageCheap to repair after a crashPowerful and fastPriceNo stab bar(more stable, can't bend in a crash)ConsNoneIf you want to learn how to fly RC Helicopters, get the sim and then get this helo. It is the best training heli that I have found.Warning: If you don't know what you are doing with this you can seriously injure yourself or others. Practice in the sim. Practice in an open space with no one else around. If the helicopter is coming toward you and you can't stop it hit the throttle cut or just kill the bird (dump the collective These blades could easily blind you if they hit you in your face.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1TNHN2PZCFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F0HGY4#wasThisHelpful","R2O1TNHN2PZCFS","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used ear plugs for work for over 20 years and I use ear plugs for sleeping and for loud activities like mowing the lawn.  Needless to say, I tried many brands and shapes of ear plugs.  After all that the 3M E-A-R Classic Plus Uncorded Earplugs, Hearing Conservation 310-1101 in Pillow Pack (affectionally know as the yellow foamy) has always been my favorite and worked the best for me.  It fits my ear the best and blocks the most noise.So how do the e-Plugz stack up?  For me, it is the best material I've felt in an ear plug.  It is very soft, comfortable and moldable.  It also, equals the yellow foamy for noise reduction.  For me, however, I have never really liked the bullet shaped ear plugs as it always feel like the put pressure on my ear drums.  So for me, this ear plug has better material than the yellow foamy but I am not as fond of the shape.  So for me, the yellow foamy is still my preferred ear plug.  However, if e-Plugz made an ear plug in the shape of the yellow foamy, it would be my number one choice.My wife on the other hand loves these ear plugs.  She loves the material and loves the shape.  She gets great sound reduction and great comfort.These are some exceptional ear plugs and I highly recommend them to anyone.  If you like bullet shaped ear plugs then these are a no brainer purchase.  Even if you don't prefer the shape it is worth a try as my wife generally did not prefer the bullet shaped ear plugs but she loves these.  I can say these are made of the best material of any foamy ear plug I have tried and with the class leading NRR33 noise canceling you cannot go wrong.  (The yellow foamy also has a NRR of 33).I was provided a sample for a fair and honest review.  These are highly recommended and I will be purchasing these for my wife in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5J2BFD811C1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZWDG7Q#wasThisHelpful","R5J2BFD811C1B","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"B+W is the brand I use for my filters.  They are exceptionally well made and have never failed me.  The construction is brass and the threads always fit so nicely on my lens.This filter is perfect for the GH4 or any other daylight video needs and here is the reason why.  During a normal bright sunny day at ISO 200, and around f/1.4 you are going to need around 1/8000 shutter speed.  Well that is going to make strobie looking video.  You basically want to shoot the inverse of 2x your FPS.  So at 30 fps you want your shutter speed to be 1/60.  To slow your shutter speed to 1/60 from 1/8000 you need to cut 7 stops of light.  This cuts 6 stops of light and you can cut the 7th by increasing aperture to f/2.So this 6 stop ND filter is the most flexible.  The 10 stop filter cuts too much and the 3 stop filter doesn't cut nearly enough.  So the 6 stop is just right.  While you can ""stack"" ND filters on top of each other you are really risking serious vignetting so it is not something I recommend.  If you only need to cut 5 stops of light then simply bump up your ISO 1 stop.For me, 6 stop ND filters have worked the best to shoot 4K video I can use as video and pull 8mp stills.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A1HDXLZN0W0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005YTK5WK#wasThisHelpful","R2A1HDXLZN0W0U","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This speaker is better in the higher range than the lower ranges.I haven't really needed to use the suction cup but I did test it out and it worked fine.

To me these speakers are in the same ballpark for price so I would pick the bluetooth one every time.  If $30 is too steep for a speaker, then this one will work.  However, there are many choices for speakers in this price range.Overall, this is a decent speaker and if bluetooth is not important to you or the ability to stick the speaker to a window or other smother surface is important to you, then this could be a great speaker for you.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1810MRK5U1422/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSV594A#wasThisHelpful","R1810MRK5U1422","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off the version I noticed many people who have reviewed this product complained of the talking during blue tooth operations.  The version I have does not have the talking for blue tooth.  It makes a beeping sound.  When you first pair it does talk to you but after that it is just a beep.This product is an obvious copy of the Jambox and since I have one of those I thought I would compare the 2.  First of all, to my ears the sound from both is very similar and the battery life is similar also.  The blue tooth is easy to set up on both and each speaker has about the same range.  Like the Jambox you can use this as a speaker phone when paired and like the Jambox it works great.  So based on that and price alone this speaker is a great value.However, it has a really nice feature the Jambox is missing.  It allows you to pause, rewind and fast forward through the music you are listening to.  I really like this feature as sometime I like to listen to a song multiple times are skip a song.  Now I don't have to go back to the computer or pull out the phone.The only con I have for this speaker is that it is possible to turn it up to a volume which is too high for the speaker which causes distortion.  The speaker is plenty loud in the normal range and there is no reason this speaker does not limit power to not cause distortion.Overall, this is a great speaker for listening to music around the house or even providing background music for a party.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5SO041P4MOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5NE2KG#wasThisHelpful","R1D5SO041P4MOK","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice and sharp machete that does a great job of clearing brush and chopping branches or smaller trees.  I had no problem cutting 4-6inc branches.The 16"" size of this machete is just right and the curve of the handle allows it to fit just right to the hand.  So it is very comfortable and I find less fatiguing on my hand.The handle is made out of plastic which worked well but I wanted a little more grip.  So I wrapped it in hockey tape.

"When I got this the first thing I did was put the batteries in and then plug the charger into the xbox one using the included usb cable.  Then since I had seen Tanker-X review I decided to try to take the batteries out.  Like Tanker-X said, the batteries were next to impossible to remove... the first time.  The way I got them out was to put tape on the back of the battery and then I slipped a utility knife blade between the battery and controller.After that, the batteries were snug but removable by hand.  It took about 2 hours to charge the batteries.  I knocked off a star for having to get a tool to remove the batteries the first time.The batteries themselves slide into the controller very easily.  The charger is much smaller than I thought it would be and it looks very good next to the xbox one.The instructions do say you need to remove the controllers once they are charged.  All companies will say that with a lithium batter for product liability reasons.  Lithium batteries are prone to thermal runaway so if that happens and it is plugged into the charger it can cause a fire.  Since the lights on the charger change from red to green when the controller is charged I am willing to bet that it also stops charging.Overall, a nice product that was only marred by how difficult it was to remove the batteries the first time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIRHPMT1K627/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2Y1CH4#wasThisHelpful","R2EIRHPMT1K627","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also comes with 2 screen protectors so if you mess up or have another camera with the same size screen you can use it for that.

"This is the GM1 kit to get.  I have purchased from Cameta before and everything went well.  For the same price as the camera you get a ton of accessories.  While none of them are top quality, they all work and most are useful.  Throw the cleaning kit away.  In 5 years of extensively shooting m43, I have never had a single dust spot on my camera.While I was first shooting and playing with this camera, I really liked it but I was stuck in my paradigm of it needs a grip, an EVF, and external controls to be a serious camera.  I was wrong!  In fact I bought this camera with the idea I was most likely going to return it.This camera is freaking amazing and so much fun to use.  It is the most exciting and revolutionary camera to come out in a long time.  That is a bold statement with the release of the Olympus E-M1, Nikon Df, and Sony A7.  Well I have all of those camera on hand and have shot all of them.  My favorite to shoot and carry hands down is this GM1!  The others are great cameras in their own right but this camera shifts the paradigm of what a small large sensor DSLM is.  It does this by an amazingly refreshing clean and non-cluttered physical interface.  It marries that with the slickest touch screen system I have seen to produce the least intimidating and best handling camera I have ever used.  That is saying a lot because I have used some amazing handling cameras.  The revolution of this camera is that there has never been a camera this small, that handled this well, has such great image quality, and, drum roll please, is stupid grin inducing fun to use.It is also a dead silent camera.  There is actually no need for the stealth mode this camera has because it is silent to begin with.  If you turn off all the default beeps and squeaks on this camera it is silent.No other camera that I know of has a 1/16,000 shutter speed.  This one does and for using fast 1.4 lenses in bright sun this can't be beat.Another super cool feature if you have the Olympus 12mm f/2 or the Olympus 12-40 f/2.8, when you click the focus dial to manual, it automatically turns on magnification and focus peaking.  Click it back to auto and that switches off.  Sweet. In the accompanying video, I am going to show you how to set it up and how simple and fast it is to use.The camera shares it sensor with the GX7 so this camera has the current state of the art when it comes to m43 sensors.  Another thing it shares with the GX7 is that Panasonic USA is only selling the black and silver version.  Right now there will be no black version, no white version, and no orange version.  Boo Panasonic USA.The lens on this camera is a gem and is optically superior than any other kit lens.  This all the more amazing considering how small they made it.  Shrinking the size like that usually entails all sorts of optical problems which need to be digitally corrected.  While it is a very nice all purpose lens, no one is going to confuse it with a fast prime.  It would be nice if it were a constant f/3.5 but that would increase the size.  The construction on the outside, however, is plastic so you need to be careful not to scratch it.  Right now the only way to get this lens is with this camera.  I am sure that will change in time.My first reaction to this camera is that it does not have a grip.  If this had an EVF that might be a problem.  However,  this camera is too small and is not designed to be held like a traditional camera.  It is small enough and is designed to be carried by 2 to 4 fingers on the top and bottom.My next reaction was this camera does not have an EVF.  For me an EVF is a must.  A camera would have to be exceptional for me to overlook this.  This camera is.  The handling on this camera is specifically setup to not shoot with an EVF.My third reaction was this camera does not have a traditional control dial to set shutter speed and EV.  Instead it has a rotating dial on the back.  This control setup works exceedingly well.  I would not have believed it before trying it but the Digital fusion (couldn't resist) between physical controls and soft touch screen controls is perfect on this camera.My forth reaction was this is a great looking camera.  Very clean and stylish.This actually leads me to what I think is one of the most underrated features on Panasonic cameras and is on the GM1.  This is intelligent auto plus (iAuto+).  I don't think most people understand what this does for you.  With most intelligent autos, the user is locked out from making any decisions at all.  Very nice if you are new and don't have any idea what you are doing but want to take nice pictures.  (Most DSLRs pop up the flash which actually makes this mode pretty worthless).  With iAuto, the camera scans the scene and the decides whether it is a portrait or landscape or flower etc and then makes numerous setting to the camera to optimize the picture.  It would take a person several minutes to make all of these changes.  That part of iAuto is great.  What is not good is you can't usually change the EV or the aperture setting.  But with iAuto+ you can.  You can set in EV, change the Aperture, and even change the colors.  On the GM1 you press the up arrow on the control wheel to scroll through the options of EV, Defocus control, and Color settings.  This is an incredibly powerful feature and I don't know of any other manufacture that offers it.Another really nice feature this camera has is a function button located on top and 5 virtual fn buttons located on the right side of the touch screen.  This means whatever controls you use most frequently you can program and have instant access to.  For a camera with very minimal physical controls, it handles very well and very quickly.Next is Panasonic's Q (Quick menu system).  You press the bottom left button which brings up the quick menu system on the screen.  This allows you to change any shooting setting that you want.I did not think I would really be able to use the large lenses on this camera.  I was wrong.  This camera is so small and light that you are basically just using the lens.  You support the lens not the camera because it is so small and light.My fifth reaction was Holy Smokes Batman, this camera is amazing and revolutionary.  I bought this camera to mostly for the lens and was most likely return it.

"Cameta Camera sells a kit version of this product on Amazon for the same price as the camera only.  The product link is as follows.  Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM1 Micro Four Thirds Digital Camera with 12-32mm Lens with 32GB Card + Case + Tripod + 3 Filters + Kit.  None of this extra stuff is top notch but it all works.  Some of it is useful.While I was first shooting and playing with this camera, I really liked it but I was stuck in my paradigm of it needs a grip, an EVF, and external controls to be a serious camera.  I was wrong!  In fact I bought this camera with the idea I was most likely going to return it.This camera is freaking amazing and so much fun to use.  It is the most exciting and revolutionary camera to come out in a long time.  That is a bold statement with the release of the Olympus E-M1, Nikon Df, and Sony A7.  Well I have all of those camera on hand and have shot all of them.  My favorite to shoot and carry hands down is this GM1!  The others are great cameras in their own right but this camera shifts the paradigm of what a small large sensor DSLM is.  It does this by an amazingly refreshing clean and non-cluttered physical interface.  It marries that with the slickest touch screen system I have seen to produce the least intimidating and best handling camera I have ever used.  That is saying a lot because I have used some amazing handling cameras.  The revolution of this camera is that there has never been a camera this small, that handled this well, has such great image quality, and, drum roll please, is stupid grin inducing fun to use.It is also a dead silent camera.  There is actually no need for the stealth mode this camera has because it is silent to begin with.  If you turn off all the default beeps and squeaks on this camera it is silent.No other camera that I know of has a 1/16,000 shutter speed.  This one does and for using fast 1.4 lenses in bright sun this can't be beat.Another super cool feature if you have the Olympus 12mm f/2 or the Olympus 12-40 f/2.8, when you click the focus dial to manual, it automatically turns on magnification and focus peaking.  Click it back to auto and that switches off.  Sweet. In the accompanying video, I am going to show you how to set it up and how simple and fast it is to use.The camera shares it sensor with the GX7 so this camera has the current state of the art when it comes to m43 sensors.  Another thing it shares with the GX7 is that Panasonic USA is only selling the black and silver version.  Right now there will be no black version, no white version, and no orange version.

"This is a nice and small 2 port charger.  This little charger replaced a far more expensive one that I owned and it works much better.  It is also very small and fits snugly in the cars's power port.Some things to note on this charger is there are two different rated ports.  The first is a 2.1 amp useful for iPad and the second is a 1 amp for phones.  You can use the 2.1 amp for a fast recharge of your phone but that can cause the batter to heat up and shorten the life span.  So I would recommend that as an occasional thing.  The ports are marked but it is exceedingly difficult to read which is which.  Using a pair or reading glasses and another pair as a magnifying glass I could finally read it.  However, it is easy to remember which is which as the 1 amp is closest to the blue logo on the front.The second thing to note is you only get the 2.1 amps if only one device is plugged in.  If there are 2 devices, you get 1 amp from each port.The materials on this product are a cut above the standard.  The plastic feels more solid and this is very well put together.  I also like the little blue light.  It is not too bright at night but it does provide a little guide for plugging your device in.This product also has overheat and overcharge prevention circuitry built in to provide a little more protection to your device.All in all, I liked it so much I bought another one for my other car.I was provided this product for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFSL2ZMGLG52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D64PN36#wasThisHelpful","R3KFSL2ZMGLG52","A7FDGFK0KN7QG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7FDGFK0KN7QG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do not like misrepresented products. These are not wool socks. They are - according to their label - a blend of wool and other fibers. Artificial wool is not wool. Wool comes from sheep and sometimes legitimately from other animals. Another misrepresentation is the term ""super thick"". They are not. In fact by the time they stretched to fit onto my size 9 female feet, they had become quite thin. In spite of being so stretched, they are comfortable and reasonably warm over liner sox, for this in-between season. (I have now purchased some similar ""offshore"" socks in men size which does solve the size problem but these don't have the cute patterns that I love. A choice of sizes would be logical here.)That said, they are well woven and come in very fetching patterns. Also the price is good although I was not happy when they became three dollars less after I purchased them. So far they have held up through my way of washing wool blend socks, which is in cool water and hung to dry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158VDITREJHP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ER0JUK#wasThisHelpful","R158VDITREJHP1","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For 19 years of retirement I have able to buy this standard Planner at Walmart. Prior to that they were supplied by my department, which is how I became accustomed to their use. Somehow they are just the right combination of portability and space and feature.This year Walmart had a bunch of ""updated"" planners. Why change what works? Now I'd be the first to say that in this town we have the World's Smallest WallyWorld so perhaps if I travelled elsewhere I would have discovered my faves on the shelves. But that wouldn't make sense. It's at least a 60 mile round trip to the next Walmart. So I was happy to discover this tried and true version on Amazon. Yeah, it cost a little more as somebody has to pay for home shipping even though we've already paid our Prime memberships.

"I find Fage Greek Yogurt absolutely top-notch - creamy and never too acid - but this container has a design flaw. Let me say too that the preserves are the best. But you need a special tool to get them out of the too-narrow, specially-designed container. A normal spoon won't fit in there. And no, the fruit mixture doesn't flow out the way the picture shows. Some may come out that way but a significant amount must be somehow scraped out. So you can't get at what you paid for and go off to find some narrow implement to use as a scraper. Yes, a table knife will work. But other brands that package the fruit sauce separately from the yogurt have managed to design the container so that even a large spoon can be used as a scraper. What were the Fage people thinking? This goes along with their use of a pesky little paper on the top of their regular containers that always drips on its way to the waste can. Not thinking. But their foods are the best despite these annoyances.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW38AKX27ADPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0021J6GIS#wasThisHelpful","RW38AKX27ADPA","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all the yogurt is very good, dense as Greek yogurt should be (in other words not runny like the brands that leave too much liquid in so not good value) and not at all acid - again as some brands can be. The blackberry/raspberry preserves are perfect: not too sweet, not too tart. Couldn't be better!Another plus is the design of the container. Frankly, I am liking this configuration with the topping packaged separately. But you should know that some other manufacturers' container designs have too-small partitions for the topping so that you can't even get a spoon in and then you have to go looking for a special tool to remove the food you paid for. Not this kind. Both compartments are wide enough to use a regular spoon, even a tablespoon.

"I will start by saying that this reproduction is just fine, no problem. The old documents appear to be copied as opposed to reset.I bought this due to my fascination with a Tory reprisal visited upon residents of the Middle Line Road area in 1780, masterminded by a vicious and vengeful Tory named Joseph Bettys (Bettis), in reprisal for the defeat of Loyalists (British forces) in the American Revolution just four years before. This lawless massacre and capture was not noted in history books when I was a student. Of course the old documents are written in a flowery and indirect manner, with which anyone who has studied 18th and 19th century original source material is familiar.This history has many illustrations and chronicles the lives of many original inhabitants thus is of great interest to anyone whose ancestors lived in the Ballston Spa, Saratoga County, New York area.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CCVKZ0U5DTAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1149333782#wasThisHelpful","R2CCVKZ0U5DTAG","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Florida is on your radar for more than a short vacation, get this book and read it. I would have bought a Kindle version if Amazon offered it, but since that is not the case, I went to Stack's publishing website and ordered a PDF version there. Worked fine on my Windows laptop.Every place has a good side and the ugly. It's the unexpected that may ""get"" you. Stack makes it clear what you need to know if you are relatively happy where you are. My brother is going through his first full Florida summer in St. Pete and I am waiting for a report. That happens to be an area that gets fewer direct hurricane hits than others but is not immune. Plus his condo is in effect on stilts with special hurricane-proof windows. (Expensive but he has the bucks.) Still, he could face a mandatory evacuation. Stack lists that hurricane threat as the primo reason that people become quickly weary of Florida life. He probably could stuff even more helpful info but what he does give is most thought-provoking. Plus you can go to hs blogsite and learn more specifics and he will answer comments.In my case I am not happy where I am, do not have family around for holidays, have adjusted to a long winter indoor life and would like a more social existence. But my financial position does not allow an easy answer to snowbirding or sixing as Stack calls it, so I must think twice. Or three times. Snakes and giant cockroaches? Sudden torrential rains that flood dwellings even though not in flood zone? The need to be protected from far stronger sun exposure all the time?

This smaller one could work for that but probably the traditional larger ones would be better for rough terrain. This has the excellent characteristic of being easy to store whether in the vehicle or home, as it is compact to start with and then has the telescoping handle. I'd say this is best for specific lighter uses both indoor and outdoor.In my test runs which I double-checked with a high quality measuring tape, this wheel was sufficiently accurate for most uses, using the axle point to point.

THEN when they reappeared on Amazon, they were off the S&S option and the price had more than doubled.

Nope, considered trying it on the fridge but had a nice place with studs by my workbench. Only thing was I had to find longer screws than those supplied. But I suppose if the manufacturer supplied longer screws, the customers would be saying they had to go out and buy shorter ones.

"They say there are as many different recoveries as there are those in recovery. Therefore, an approach that works for one person may not work for another, and a diversity of approaches is good. If this book and the author's ideas save even one person from the misery of addiction, the publication is so worth it.Tommy Rosen talks at length about his multiple addictions and what led to them. While he does at times seem to be ""blaming"" (not encouraged in 12-step programs), it is what it is and everyone's story is helpful to someone else out there. It is said, just wait and you will hear your story from others in the (12-step) rooms, even if only in parts here and there. I found Rosen's story good reading although at times appalling. (About things that you didn't do when ""out there"", you hear that those are your ""not yets"" - the depths to which you might sink if you ""go back out"" or relapse. Thus it is good to hear about what is called ""low bottom"".)Rosen gives piece after piece of wisdom, speaking from his own experience, strength and hope.Then he gets into moving beyond the ""program"" as we know it. At that point I feel he is doing what is not encouraged - he uses the program in a commercial way. Sure this goes beyond the traditional 12-step approach but it definitely uses it. You see, we soon realize that he is promoting a business he has set up. Sure, he may help some types of people a great deal as there are always those with the money who will benefit from following a guru.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQH7JDGUCG10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401944485#wasThisHelpful","RZQH7JDGUCG10","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a relatively elegant solution to an inelegant problem. While I have forced myself to deal with the reality of trapping and disposing of the inevitable rodents, it is always a challenge to my sensibilities. But I live in the country on a river and my supply is constantly replenished after I get rid of what wants my warmth and food supply. Hmm.Another positive aspect is that with the full housing, there is far less danger of getting fingers or kitty paws or whatever damaged accidentally as we forget where we've set traps when going about daily business.So they're more expensive if you have to throw them out with just one use. It's still worth it. Just set these up where mice will run, notably along walls, and wait. You can catch a fairly good-sized rodent with these.

"There actually is a very slight smell of a component, similar to the way window cleaner smells, but thankfully no heavy-duty odor like the Pine-Sol that I have been using for years. What is useful about the heavy-duty cleaner smell is that if you want to mask something you can't get rid of, that just may do it. Temporarily, anyway, as most folks associate the strong odor with cleaning. Trouble is, what if someone who has to be there is allergic to that odoriferous ingredient or just can't stand it. I've had that happen. That's where this Nonsense comes in. First you have to realize that we associate strong masking odors with cleaners and then realize that is not necessary and may even be a problem. Just CLEAN is a good odor in the long run.Next question: How does it clean? Now obviously that is hard to quantify so I gave it a good test, using it spritzed full-strength right from the bottle, used it on a nasty situation, you know the kind of thing where you get used to the built-up paw prints on a refrigerator door. Well, I had such a mess to be cleaned. It was a combination of smears from food-covered hands and dirt and grease from people working on machinery projects grabbing something to drink without going to all the trouble of washing up. Sounds awful but life happens. So I went to work on it and this formulation cut right through that combination of foods and tough greases. No problem. Pretty good. Fridge clean.Plus I like that for general cleaning I can dilute this product so it will go much farther when cleaning lighter jobs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZR8IPF7GDW0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANA3UTK#wasThisHelpful","R2ZR8IPF7GDW0N","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a good idea to put some research into the project of buying an outdoor padlock that will be exposed to the elements, especially where any water that gets into the works will freeze and make it impossible to open the lock, at least until you've found your extension cords and hairdryer.So the issues are:- how does the lock's design prevent water from entering?- how thick is the shank? (too thick and it won't enter a narrower existing hasp)- the other normal lock questions like resistance to bolt cutters etc.This lock has the thick plastic drape on top but of course water can still enter where the shank slides so I put vaseline there to help even more. Time will tell. I was careful with the vaseline as I know that excess lubrication then attracts dust and dirt which over time gums up the mechanism. There is also a plastic cover on the bottom, that snaps into the keyhole. It is attached to the bottom of the lock and swivels. When it snaps all the way into the keyhole, it is difficult to snap out and requires something like a flat screwdriver blade to jimmy it loose - fingernails won't do it, not mine anyway. So be prepared for that.I measure the shank thickness of this as just under 5/16"" or 8mm. It was a relief when it fit into the metal loop, or staple, of my existing hasp. Some of the other locks I saw had coatings on their shanks that would have prevented this. This shank is thicker than my previous, rusted lock but luckily not much.This is the only lock I've found that meets my needs so I bought it in spite of the bright yellow color of the body which in my neighborhood is like waving a red flag to malicious vandals. (""Oh, lookie, she thinks she's got her barn locked. We'll show her!"") I fixed that, though, with some black electrical tape wound carefully around the yellow body. That won't stay forever in our hot/cold climate but can easily be replaced.Not only is the lock sturdy and water resistant, but the keys are far more substantial than those that come with your average padlock. The lock is large - I measure 1 7/8"" wide and 3 1/2"" long when in locked configuration, and heavy. It must weigh a pound although I haven't put it on a scale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQEJ3AHW1FSGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SQKL#wasThisHelpful","RQEJ3AHW1FSGQ","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I very much enjoyed this picture of contemporary Mormon life, the main thrust of the novel which is written in the first person voice of a feisty, impetuous woman, the wife of a bishop. The writing is straightforward and clear and contains many apt descriptions and observations of human nature. The author throws in a reasonable amount of LDS history for those who may not know it.The author deals with the issue of male dominance in a situation where there is not sufficient sanction for misbehavior, and how this can make monsters - shown in the ability of sociopaths to create false impressions of sainthood while covering their guilt, their grievous crimes. This, of course, is true in many settings, not just LDS. There is another theme of philosophical/religious rigidity, again a universal problem.In addition to all this, there are mysteries and heart-rendingly difficult emotional situations. But overall, this novel is about lives and is written with a great deal of warmth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8T3TZMR884P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954760#wasThisHelpful","R2K8T3TZMR884P","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Couldn't wait to get this quality soundbar with wireless sub hooked up to my TV. What a difference! I've always known Klipsch makes good stuff and this proves it. My previous soundbar was a tremendous improvement over the tinny TV sound but this one blows it out of the water with outstanding sound reproduction throughout the range - I can't detect any weak spots which are normally lower mid-range. And certainly the highs are gorgeous and precise, never too forward either.All I had to do was decide where the components would go. I chose to set the soundbar in front of the TV console which works because it is not too high. Then I put the subwoofer in a corner more or less behind a chair which also seems to work because the corner helps bounce the lows back into the room and those do not seem to require directionality but are more diffuse. The Bluetooth connection seemed to click right into place.When I think of the prices of high quality TV sound components just a few years ago it makes me even more impressed.

"Cecelia Ekb√§ck's writing is spare and evocative, with an unerring instinct for presentation of character flaws and natural human fears. Wolf Winter is filled with beautifully handled symbolism - the church bells whose sounds bedevil a priest with a secret, plus I especially enjoyed ""crayfish"" for carcinoma, a delightful use of metonymy - and the supernatural elements are maybe, maybe not, which is to say that they could be a dead man stalking or they could be the product of fear in the everlasting night. Or mental derangement.The author takes us 'way north to Lapland where a few settlers dare live in the shadow and seemingly malevolent influence of BlackÂsen, the mountain that takes the blame for the actions of men. She weaves into the story Swedish political history as well as social: the juxtaposition of old superstitions and the Christianity that forbids (or replaces) them. She writes, via story narrative, a powerful treatise about the role of guilty secrets and false accusations which in a small, righteous population cause the accused to be painfully, even fatally shunned and punished by church or law, the same thing in days of yore.This novel deserves a prize.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LZ54E113LAZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602862524#wasThisHelpful","R1LZ54E113LAZJ","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel this early, long-lost work gives me more of a psychological portrait of the author as a young man than anything else. Which is not to say that it is not an insightful view of the inhabitants of an urban Portuguese apartment building.But the focus seems on interactions of couples as well as sexuality. The women tend to be strong and domineering while the men acquiesce in order to keep the peace. Not all follow that pattern, mind you, but it is the trend. I kept getting the insight of that pattern in the author's mind. In addition I kept getting the feeling that the writer was an introverted young man struggling with a youthful search for life's meaning, and no doubt one who was intimidated and probably captivated by the opposite sex. I kept thinking his mother must have run things.I did keep in mind that this was written by a not-yet-published writer who hadn't the supposed advantage of being ""taught"" to write. (Don't get me started on that whole business. I believe all the expensive writers' workshops in the world won't fix those who can't write, and those who can will do it quite on their own.) I also kept in mind that it was written more than sixty years ago and that styles have changed. Nonetheless the writing jumps around enough that I finally had to make a chart of the characters. It does give a good feel for that society in that time.This newly published translation is prefaced by a well-written foreword.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXX9CZ0HXB5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544090020#wasThisHelpful","R2IXX9CZ0HXB5C","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smooth as whipped cream tho texture is more dense, very soothing and fully emulsified. Perhaps a very slight odor of one or more ingredients but nothing to trigger allergies. I mean almost no odor.

This is definitely a huge help and not greasy; it absorbs easily. It does contain an ""extremely mild antibacterial"", which frankly a skin cream in a jar needs due to the high probability of contamination when dipping in even with just-washed hands.And to think that I almost didn't try this because the product description was so over-the-top and repetitive, making the customer suspicious.

Come to think of it, the old Waverly house is a character too. Such is the stuff this novel is made of. Some of it never does get explained but is wisely left to the reader. But along the way Sarah Addison Allen treats us to humor and wisdom and warmth and enjoyable characters. And a truckload of analogies. All along we know SOMETHING is going to happen and hope our friends, the Waverly women, survive snubs, barrenness, abandonment and treachery. By the end, though, everything is tied up in neat little bows.First Frost stands on its own despite having a predecessor, Garden Spells.Most who choose to read this genre expect the inclusion of somewhat wacky magical happenings but I found those included here, while sometimes apt and fun, are too often juvenile and a bit tired.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6L6F8U66DQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250019834#wasThisHelpful","R1U6L6F8U66DQF","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really quite good. Realize it is a specific genre - I'd call it historical mystery/romance. The story is captivating although it takes a bit before it warms up, just a warning. The author weaves a love of food into the narrative both by starting most chapters with old recipes and by the story, as the main character is a cook or ""undercook"" - it is her position and her passion - then with another character who is a chef, a food artist, and joins forces near the end.Meanwhile the scene in 18th century England and as the entourage makes its way through France and the Alps into Italy is most likely authentic, with regional speech and old-fashioned terms. The author goes all out to use language as it might have been and at times I found both this and the food aspect a bit cloying. Also there was just a little too much of what we now call TMI - too much information - which is to say some of the gory scenes seem unnecessary.Still, these are minor complaints as the plot is good with twists and turns and plenty of description, good dialog as we get the picture of how it was with servants, marriages driven by money and people who make mistakes and then pay for them.

"Protein sources low in fat are always sought and welcomed here. This one is particularly interesting because the protein sources are vegetable, and there are no questionable chemical additives.The second ingredient is what the manufacturer is calling ""SaviSeed"", better known as Sacha Inchi: Plukenetia volubis, which is a perennial native to much of tropical South America and some Caribbean islands. It is historically cultivated by indigenous peoples. It is a member of the Euphorbia family so should be approached with a bit of caution as many members of that family possess chemical structures poisonous to humans. However Sachi Inchi is not known for that; there could be individuals susceptible to its components. The dried seeds of Sacha Inchi have high protein (27%) and oil (35-60%) content and are rich in Omegas 3&6 as well as iodine and Vitamins A&E. Their amino acid profile makes their protein particularly usable by humans. Sacha Inchi is currently gaining favor as a ""superfood"".Alfalfa, the third ingredient, is in the pea family; a legume whose roots contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria and improve soil, especially in crop rotation. Thus there is a high legume content in this supplement, with the prime ingredient being pea protein. Some people do experience bloating and gas with legume consumption, especially when unaccustomed.So far I have found this supplement to have a strange and vaguely bitter taste when mixed with water per directions. I decided to add it to some low acid Greek-style yogurt and it still gave me the same somewhat bitter result which I improved with the addition of a small amount of dark brown sugar which of course makes it less healthy. It was initially gritty in the yogurt but fully hydrated after six hours.I am continuing to think outside the box re how to fold it into my diet. My boyfriend said he thought I would eat hay if I thought it was good for me.UPDATE: I've tried and tried to like this stuff. I realize that an important factor in what is palatable is being used to a given taste; in addition some specific taste perceptions are inherited. Those qualifiers given, I simply have to say that to me this tastes awful. I've always been a good eater, not picky at all even as a child, and I do like many foods that are bitter. But this just has an off taste that ruins everything I put it in - it's more than bitter, there's something that I not only can't describe but I also don't know what causes it. I've tried to think of it as a ""space food"" that provides my body with nutrition but it's not working. I guess if I were really, really, really hungry...","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IHM231RK392D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MJCJW6#wasThisHelpful","R2IHM231RK392D","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Functional and fun; THE gift this year for the football fan in your life. Or an indulgence for your man cave if they don't get it for you. Mine is in my girl cave, ha, and it's a good thing there are two heat settings because it really puts it out.Infrared quartz is the technology experts are recommending as both effective and more energy efficient than other kinds of space heaters. Indeed, many businesses here in the frigid northeast have gone to heating large offices with this technology. I mean there's oil backup but it's the infrared quartz that keeps the place toasty. So I was delighted to try this.It's a really large yellow ball and I consider the color both safe due to visibility, and fun.

"Because I generally buy jewelry in person, I find shopping for it online difficult. Mainly that is because even with the dimensions carefully given, I find it hard to visualize actual size.This is a substantial piece. The stones are impressive and the setting both surrounds these stones and has two levels so that the faceted gems are held away from the wearer and thus reflect light effectively. The chain, however, is miniscule.The stones are both cut so that there is a flat surface on most of the top but the sides and bottom are where the facets are. This cut reflects light through the top surface. I would say that the facets are fairly large and not particularly complex, but they are very even. I do have some almost amusing observations about the colors of the stones. The smaller stone is a smoky quartz but my example shows no smokiness. Rather it is slightly pinkish, which is odd because the amethyst, which is described as a pink amethyst (most commonly they are in purple hues), is in fact brown. The one I have is quite saturated and although I can see no inclusions in either stone, the amethyst is sufficiently dark that I cannot see through it. Regardless of the descriptions, both stones are very pleasing and attractive and the light plays through them prettily.On jewelry that gets a lot of wear, plating can be a problem. But on a necklace - I mean the ornament - it normally is just fine. Gold plating on sterling silver is industry standard, that is GOOD industry standard. The chain is presumably also plated, and there it can be less satisfactory. However, I will quickly replace this chain with a far heavier one I already have. I am happy to report that the chain hoop at the top of the dangle has a good 1/8"" clearance so getting a better chain through it will not be a problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8CW2914MK2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LB3YXZS#wasThisHelpful","RX8CW2914MK2N","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas Pierce examines our little lives and en route adds tongue-in-cheek zaniness. He gently exposes societal foibles - I mean have you ever wondered about the effect on the victims whose goofs and awkwardness are caught on film, then endlessly ridiculed by TV and online broadcast? If so, read ""Videos of People Falling Down"". Pierce intertwines their lives to the point that you need a chart to follow the connections. ""We of the Present Age"" explores the hoax. Think Cardiff Man redux.And so it goes - what happens when you helplessly let your lover make a graphic video? And when you're the object of scorn from the mouth of the father of a foolish former girlfriend whom you unwittingly impregnated then responsibly parented the resulting child? Pierce doesn't answer these questions, oh no, he just points them out, wraps sometimes surreal scenes around them.I like the themes and the added absurdity but the characters hardly seem to have feelings; rather they just go through the motions of their lives.

"These have the excellent taste of dates and oatmeal plus the pick-me-up of chocolate. Ever since I discovered L√§rabars, I have been sold on energy bars made of dates. These ZonePerfects seem to have a lower proportion of date although that is the leading ingredient. But they do not appear to have a lot of chemicals, just natural ingredients. I find them very tasty although somewhat too sweet. Another thing I REALLY like is that they are formulated to be soft enough that they do not threaten dental work like some brands of bars do.Generally speaking, although I love chocolate, especially unsweetened dark, I find bars with chocolate chips to be 'way too sicky-sweet. That, of course, is due to the inclusion of excessive sugars. These too are a little too sweet for my taste but not as bad as others I've had. Of course these by the manufacturer's admission contain both ""evaporated cane syrup"" (which is a way of saying ""sugar"" when there is a desire to camouflage the fact) and chocolate chips, one of whose ingredients is also the tricky evaporated cane syrup. Since that adds up to more sugar than I want or need, I use these Protein Bars for specific times when I need the instant energy of sugar plus want the lift of the small amount of caffeine in chocolate.One would notice that the fat content is high - 8% - with 10% of that being saturated fat.However they are basically gluten free although the disclaimer mentions that they are made in a facility that does process wheat. For the majority of us who must avoid gluten, tiny trace amounts are not a problem, so for my purposes these are gluten free.

"Before using, I washed the cover and aired out the foam portion. I knew as soon as I opened the box that I would be sensitive to its odor. So far I have not been able to remedy the odor problem enough to actually put my head there for sleeping, but I do have a history of sensitivity to scents. However, I didn't know when I ordered it, that this was made in China which gives me pause due to documented problems with items manufactured there. Thing is, I am not sure it is wise to be breathing whatever it is for the length of time I am sleeping even if I am able to eliminate the odor.I generally use down pillows and grew up with chicken feather ones, and never had a problem with allergy to those.

"And in many of the recipes that have glutinous ingredients, substitutions are offered. If you're gluten free like me you wouldn't order a cookbook if you couldn't use a large percentage of the recipes. No worry here, I'm happy to assure you.As a teenager, I used to simply take the round carton of oatmeal to my room after school and eat the stuff dry. That's how much I like oatmeal. The other kids were off having various sweets and I was chowing down on oatmeal.That enjoyment never changed and cold mornings are still warmed with my gourmet bowl. Yes, gourmet. Some guy on the (amateur) radio once gave me instructions - I thought it was so funny that a disembodied male voice was telling a woman whose cooking skills he didn't know how to make ""gourmet oatmeal"". Seemed like an oxymoron. But I followed his instructions, which were simply to heat the (salted) water nearly to boiling in the microwave before adding the oatmeal, then zap it again til it does that rolling-boiling thing. Allow to cool, add milk. Of course make it with raisins if you like. Still making it that way here. Don't have to use those little supermarket packets that contain all sorts of chemicals and too much sugar.So now an inventive cookbook author puts her imagination to work and comes up with all sorts of new ways to use a grain I already like, and even includes gluten free ways to make things I really want, like Indian roti (flatbread) and fat-free pumpkin raisin granola.In addition to the great ideas, the book is bound in such a way that the pages flatten out in use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REIRTEE9ZH7SB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624140742#wasThisHelpful","REIRTEE9ZH7SB","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One might well be fascinated with anyone, especially female, who begins a remarkable career at sixty. Penelope Fitzgerald is a writer appreciated by the cognoscenti and not a household name. If a completist among us wants to know every detail of her life, this biography will provide - ah - even more than you wanted.Biographer Hermione Lee's writing is fussy but thorough with parentheticals, asides, qualifiers, ponderous details often ad nauseum. The biography is entertaining but confusing: it is not easy to keep details of Ms. Fitzgerald's life straight from the beginning. Luckily a genealogical chart is provided but even that is hard to read (and I am an experienced although amateur genealogist).Lee takes Penelope Fitzgerald's life from her forebears through her early years that involve an edifice described as Old Castle to living with her brood on a not-so-gently-retired barge moored on the Thames, through the years when she turns her life experience into her intelligent, admirable literary works.This dense, considerable work is best suited to readers who are either for some reason fascinated with every possible facet of the writer's life, or doing research.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R180DBW7D6O2XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352344#wasThisHelpful","R180DBW7D6O2XN","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What is this fascination with supposedly famous people, anyway?This piece is not just about the drug-addled (and/or possibly mentally ill) artist and his strange, pliable young girlfriend, but about the 1980s New York City scene; it is existential - you really get the feeling of that life. Actually, this is one part of life in The City, as so many of its denizens still lived as they always had - their small, conservative lives confined by a few blocks of neighborhood while ignoring adjacent craziness and alternative life styles.I had moved young and alone from a small rural village 200 miles north, to NYC a decade or so earlier, so I know what an intense, unsettling, iconoclastic, avant-garde place it can be - a place where anonymity confers sudden freedom and new alliances are magic.To put aspects of it into words?

It is both practical and highly technical. To absorb everything, I will keep going back to it.I had an optional class in adolescent psych back in my teacher training days - college - and think I've always wondered what makes teenagers tick. Well to be honest, I wonder about some memories of my own antics. We never gave full credence to the concept that the stages of development had importance. We knew that in our fairly recent history, by the time a boy was 13 or so he could and would do a man's work, and that often by 15 a girl was married and bearing children. Has something changed? True, there has to be societal influence and that has changed rapidly over the past 200 years, certainly in the Western world. But just maybe the wiring is and always has been, different, more different than we thought.If you have questions, and/or are dealing with adolescents as so many of us are, read Dr. Jensen's thoughtful and scientific take on what's happening inside the teenage cranium.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0MWX5AB2TP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062067842#wasThisHelpful","R1Z0MWX5AB2TP0","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This wonderfully transporting novel reminds us again of the passion of creativity and the plight of females who in bygone times happened to possess it. It is poetically written and in its own way uplifting. Although scenes of difficulty are written, this novel is not filled with horror or violence but rather with light, life and color. Speaking of which, the young woman, Guilia, hears the musical voices of paints in much the same way that many of us see letters and words as having specific colors. It is charming.This is the second book in a series, the first being ""Passion Blue"", which I have not read but intend to. It was obvious throughout that there was a backstory that would have allowed me greater enjoyment, but having read the first book was not essential as it was sufficiently explained.My only criticism, and certainly not enough to detract from a 5-star book, is that I wish writers who are including musical allusions would check with a well-educated musician before stumbling. Frankly, an editor should have caught this - Ms. Strauss refers to one color as having the voice of a silver flute, which was an instrument not in existence until the mid-nineteenth century.

"As I toddled through early childhood, the Nazi scourge was in full flower. Adults did their best to keep me from learning to read when in 1945 the newspapers were filled with accounts of the shocking truth. At the same time my stepfather, an Italian-American Army Major and medical officer, was conducting investigations as Allies entered the conquered concentration camps. He much later told me he had never believed the assertions of German civilians that they didn't know what was going on in their back yards.Be that as it may, it is important to remember that in any society gone awry, many upstanding citizens continue their life work according to their firmly-held righteous convictions. The man whose work is discussed in this book, Josef Hartinger, a Munich prosecutor, is such a man. And in the end his records of his interviews and those of his medical examiner, Dr. Moritz Flamm, were incalculably valuable in bringing Nazi perpetrators to justice via the Nuremberg Trials. I applaud Timothy Ryback for his research and writing that bring us this man's story, and as an important side issue, continue to keep the reality of the Nazi years alive so that we may never forget them and may continue to know that only by vigilance and sacrifice will their repetition be prevented.Think the stories of Nazi horror are made up? There are legions who will tell you that Hitler's tyranny never happened. I only fully learned of it myself when as a small-town sophomore in 1955, I found a book about Hitler's Third Reich in my high school library. I had thought we lived in an age of civilization. Guess again. I was shocked. And learned what the world was trying to forget. It had JUST HAPPENED.Thanks to writers like Rybeck, there is some hope of education. No, this is not fun reading. But it is well researched and well written and one more important book on the table that keeps alive the memories of those millions who died and those who did their best against a seemingly unstoppable world-domination machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XFSMU9804O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352913#wasThisHelpful","R14XFSMU9804O0","A2OL5WLCNZVD9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OL5WLCNZVD9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Overall, I think there are other products I'd use for my heels and eczema before I'd purchase this. The deal breaker for me is how it felt on my hands. I could not wait to wash it off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12V4DVNEVGTGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVWM4A#wasThisHelpful","R12V4DVNEVGTGO","AQY5XBYSENNZQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQY5XBYSENNZQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We get a very high volume of Halloween traffic at our house. We have a shrub by our sidewalk that blocks the view of our front door. I bought these to wrap that shrub and alert people to the fact that yes we are home and participating in Halloween. It worked better than I could have hoped. I heard people using the lights as a rendezvous point. The kids just loved them. I had at least a dozen inquiries about where to buy them. There are really waterproof....it was raining all night and they were unfazed.Just FYI....this one string did a perfect job covering one shrub. If you are covering more real estate you are going to need a whole lot of batteries. For me one of the selling points was not having to run power from the house. I put the powerpack in a ziploc bag and tucked it into the branches. The one string could outline windows or a bannister. Just keep your overall needs in mind. A wonderful product, thanks so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0GM3K3FPP2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010LMMJHI#wasThisHelpful","RE0GM3K3FPP2Z","AQY5XBYSENNZQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQY5XBYSENNZQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used other Xen-Tan products in the last but not this mousse. I have very pale legs and like a bit of color in them for yoga/capris. This mousse goes on very easily with the optional mitt (sold separately). I recommend duty mitt: I've done this with disposable gloves and the mitt gives more even, streak free coverage. The scent is quite pleasant, a warm vanilla fragrance.With this product you need to leave it on for 3 hours before washing off. The good news is that it dries fairly quickly and then you can dress (dark clothes advised). It is a big cold here in WI to sit around undressed waiting 3 hours to take a shower.There is probably enough in the one container to do my legs 3 or 4 times. The results are quite dark on me but very even. The color lasts about a week. My only criticism is the 3 hour wait. I pretty much have to plan my day around it. Otherwise, good stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q1M1LE64R1FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OSADQE#wasThisHelpful","R3Q1M1LE64R1FG","AQY5XBYSENNZQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQY5XBYSENNZQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is an interactive toy that teaches in a logical manner and walks you through interactive tasks that build on the prior knowledge. Of course it is meant for children but I have found it engaging and delightful. I like how it is both instructive and intuitive. This robot and Wonder App program use light sound and fun to propel the user to more challenging levels of thought and function.The Wonder App was easy to install and utilize.

"This pendant is a gorgeous champagne color which I chose to wear with a favorite outfit. I had not interpreted the photos correctly and thought this was a smoother, tumbled piece. While the back surface is smooth ( against your skin) the right side is raw and craggy. However, what that does is to allow the fire of the stone to shine from many more facets. It looks very sparkly on.The pendant is set on the chain and does not slide up and down, which I appreciate. I also like that I could pick a 16"" length which is just right for me. The stone is very nicely wrapped in silver wire and fashioned into a bail. It is secure.  Overall the piece has wonderful color, shine and texture.If you like a natural look in what you wear this could well be for you.

"This game ....which I call bean bag toss but my Midwestern neighbors call 'cornhole'....is almost an addiction where I live. People play it in the office, at tailgates...anywhere. When I set this up in the backyard a neighbor invited himself over to play. We played for a couple hours until it got too dark to see.The angle of the boards is just right to thwart an easy score. The bean bags have a nice enough heft. I can't go 5 stars because the "" locking mechanism"" is a Velcro strip and carrying this game by the handle is awkward at best. This game is made in China and I just do not see the retail or sale price reflected in the materials. I live in a wet climate and people do play this in the snow; this set would not last long in wet weather. Maybe in Arizona but not WI.That said, this is a lot of fun and we'll use it until it falls apart.

"This may look like a classic denim jacket but once you touch the fabric you'll know different. It is a thinnish blend of cotton (62%), polyester, rayon and spandex. It is quite stretchy. The stitching and seam work are excellent. I found this jacket close fitting in the shoulder, long in the sleeves and not even close in the chest. I normally wear a 12 and have a 34G chest. This jacket is not made for me. If you are busty, definitely size up. Unless I get a breast reduction, there is no way I can wear this closed. The shoulder fit is good ( and I am narrow shouldered) so I'd think about wearing this open. It looks really nice on a hanger.I couldn't get beyond the feel of the fabric.

There is no traditional fold out map here but cartoon like street guides to each section. The visual images make the borough seem home-like. I have family there and this book definitely gives you the flavor of Brooklyn.Do not think this is a comprehensive guide to Brooklyn but rather suggested highlights. The one place people want me to take them when I go to Brooklyn is Brooklyn Denim in Williamsburg. It has been around for 5 years so an odd omission.

"I really like Clorox crystals for cleaning so this just seemed like the same in a pod format. I don't use bleach in the laundry so this is strictly for kitchen and bathroom cleaning. The pods are easy to handle. I found it took them quite a while to dissolve. I now drop them into the toilets or bucket water before I plan to clean to give them a head start.I have a hard time opening the containers; there is a squeeze /turn mechanism that isn't oppositional. With arthritic hands I find it challenging to open the lid. It was so annoying I transferred the pods to an empty Tide pod container. There are no children or pets in my home so this is safe and much easier for me.I like these a lot; they prevent accidental spills and ruined clothes.

"I had gone to a jewelry store in search of  Tanzanite 6 mm earrings. I saw a pair I liked but the price (500$) was beyond my budget. When I checked the listings on Amazon I saw these and decided that these were for me.The stones are lovely, filled with light and fire. While they look light and pale in the box, they take on their full character once worn. In my ears they are a rich medium bluish purple. The stones match very well.I was disappointed in the findings/settings. They are a bit light and thin for this price range. The backings are also very light. I like the stones so much I may have them reset in more substantial findings. That's the only thing keeping these from 5 stars.

It is much safer and easier to carry that way and occupies very little space too.  I could not be happier, and ordered a second one for my Sister.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33G72NJUFCMYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012KQ5S4E#wasThisHelpful","R33G72NJUFCMYX","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What really impressed me about the Ultra Bright LED Lantern was how bright the light is!  It takes three AA batteries and the light has no switches or controls on it.  Just pull the top out with the handles and the light comes on.  There is no switch to try to find in the dark, and that is a good thing.  All you have to do to turn the light on is pull the top out of the bottom.The LEDs brighten the room immensely and being LEDs, the battery drain is very low, allowing the light to be used for a long period without depleting the batteries.  It is very simple and does not weigh much or take up much space.It is so easy to set the light on a shelf in the room and when and if the power goes out, just get the light and pull the top out of the bottom and you are set.  I had an instance a week ago in which the power went out.  I was watching TV and all sudden, the room was dark!  Fortunately I knew where I had set the Ultra Bright LED Lantern and was able to find it through feeling in the dark.  I pulled out the top and the light came on instantly.  The light being so simple to use is one thing that makes it so great.  The lights came back on about 3 hours later and the LED lantern was still glowing strongly when that happened.  I just compressed the top to the bottom and the light went out.I put the lantern back on the shelf, where it is ready for the next weather event in which I lose my power and lights.  The lantern is very simple to use, uses a small amount of power and is always there on standby for the next time you lose the lights.  It would be good to have one in every room in the house!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFZMPJGNOYDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129GYC5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3VFZMPJGNOYDQ","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Venstar Wireless Bluetooth Speaker is outstanding!.  What impressed me about it is it was really quick and easy to connect to my smart phone Bluetooth.  Several things surprised me about the speaker.  One was the sound.  The sound was really nice and crisp and the bass really stood out.  I held my hand near the speaker and could feel the powerful sound waves coming out of it.  The bass was just exploding out of the speakers and when I picked the speaker up it really surprised me how strong the bass was.  It felt like it was going to blow up in my hand, the bass was so powerful!  The speakers sound great, even at a high volume level.Most speakers start distorting as the volume level is increased.  Not this Venstar Speaker!  The volume at max on my smart phone sounded crystal clear and the bass was so sharp and clear.  It sounded like someone had a drum set right next to me.I really put the speaker through its paces and played music on it for over 4 hours.  The batteries on the speaker held up magnificently!  Just for fun, I turned the Bluetooth Off on my smart phone and connected the speaker through the headphone jack with the supplied cord.  The sound and volume were just as loud and the sound sharpness was just as good that way as it was through Bluetooth.  The speaker does not distort, even at max volume!I found that connecting the speaker either through the supplied cord or through Bluetooth worked great in listening to the speaker fairly close by at a lower volume level, but also worked great at max volume from across the room.  I listened to the speaker in the room and it sounds great even 15 to 20 feet away.  The sound filled the room nicely","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33D2T5PW5H92H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S8QQ4K#wasThisHelpful","R33D2T5PW5H92H","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing that impressed me with this air vent universal car mount holder is the way it is made.  It is pretty and well built and sturdy, and holds the smart phone either horizontally or vertically.  I have a Moto E, and it works perfectly in the mount.  The mount should work with just about any smart phone made.I just clipped the holders into the air vents of the car and that was it.  The clips are adjustable and easy to position for proper fitting.  The mount has a knob and to change from vertical to horizontal, just loosen the screw and turn the smart phone and tighten it back down.The mount holds the smart phone in firmly and I like the green colors of the holder.  What else is there to say?  It works perfectly, is very strong and easy to adjust, and is easy to get back off.  I really like the mount.  Great job Vansky!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDMM6YPEQ007/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LO1D1S#wasThisHelpful","R3NDMM6YPEQ007","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice tool!  I was sent one for a review on Amazon, and after checking it out, I ordered two more, one for each vehicle.  This  DBPower 9 in 1 has a Digital Pressure Gauge and has many other tools that really rock.  It has a pair of scissors for cutting a safety belt, a flashlight with a clear and a red lens, a pair of pliers, a flat tip and Phillips screwdriver, and a serrated knife.  The knife could easily cut a safety belt as well.One other thing this 9 in 1 tool has that is really cool is the Window Breaker.  Just push the button and the Window Breaker pops out.  It is really heavy duty and has a point on it.  You just smack the window with the pointed end and it breaks right out.  It is the perfect tool for a vehicle to be kept in the glove compartment, or somewhere close in case of an emergency.The pressure gauge is great too, and it comes on with the press of a button near the gauge window.  To turn it off, just press and hold the same button for a second or so.The tool is very sturdy, and is very strong.The 9 in 1 has a switch on top.  Pressing the switch forward turns on a bright clear LED torch in the front of the tool, and the pressing the switch back turns on the bright Red LED.  In the center is off.The DBPower 9 in 1 tool is very well made and well thought out.  The layout is great and the tools are easy to get in and out.  It is an excellent item to have in your vehicle.In the case of your auto landing in water, just press the button on the Window Breaker and break out the side window to get out of the car.  It could mean the difference between drowning in the car or getting out to safety.  For that reason alone it is well worth the small price to have one in every vehicle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4ESQX1ZWA7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H0QV00#wasThisHelpful","R1P4ESQX1ZWA7Z","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Bluetooth QY8 headphones are awesome!  They sound incredibly great and the bass just jumps out at you.  The problem I have with Bluetooth headphones is a lot of times they sound good, but are not loud enough.  That is not the case for the EasyBest QY8 headphones.  They are cranking loud, and the sound is fantastic!The headphone comes with different ear adapters for different sized ear canals, and that is a good thing as my ear canals are somewhat small.I promptly connected the earphones to my computer through the USB port, and they charged fairly quickly.  It was easy to pair (connect) to my smart phone.  I used the earphones while I was walking on a treadmill with a big fan blowing on me and could easily hear the music.  There was plenty of volume to overcome the noise in the background.  They sound really great as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DW96CUZK5SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HZW6DK#wasThisHelpful","R2DW96CUZK5SI","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must say that this is the Foneso is the best Selfie Stick that have ever used, or seen for that matter.  .  It is different from the rest in quite a few ways.  For one thing, the shutter release button is attached to a piece of Velcro and can be mounted on the Selfie Stick, or it can be held in the hand.  More on that later.The Foneso Selfie Stick is plenty strong enough to hold my smart phone and the bracket that holds the smart phone folds up when not needed.  The legs come out easily, and lock in place by twisting them to the left.  Once locked, they hold firmly and will not move in or out.  The screw that holds the bracket from swiveling works really well and the lock is made as a lever, and not a knob, so it is easy to apply firm pressure.  The swivel will fold forward for taking normal pictures and can be swiveled backwards for selfie shots.What makes this Foneso Selfie Stick stand out is it comes with a tripod mount.  The tripod mount has three legs that fold in when not needed.  I have found the tripod is easy to carry with the stick all the time with the legs folded in.  it adds some length to the Selfie Stick, and gives more leverage to hold the stick steady when fully extended.If you need a group shot and want to use the tripod mount, it is a piece of cake.  Just extend the legs on the tripod and aim the camera at the target.  The shutter button can then be removed from the stick and attached to a finger.  Once the subject is properly framed, it is just a matter of pressing the shutter button and the camera will take a shot.  When in the video mode, pressing the shutter button will take a shot while the smart phone is taking the video.If you are taking a group shot and want to be included in the group, it is just as easy.  Just put the smart phone on the tripod and frame the shot.  Then move yourself into the photo and press the shutter button, which you are holding in your hand, and the camera will take the shot.  I tried this feature at about 20 feet, and the camera took a shot every time the shutter button was pressed.  According to the directions in the box, the range is about 30 feet, which is more than enough range to get the shot you need to take.No other Selfie Stick I have seen or checked out has the feature of the shutter button not permanently attached to the stick.  This is the only Selfie Stick where the shutter button can be moved and carried in the hand for remote triggering of the camera.  Also no other Selfie Stick that I have found has a tripod stand that can be attached or left off the Selfie Stick.  That is fantastic and a really smart idea on Foneso's part.  For these reasons I am highly endorsing the Foreso Selfie Stick!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V0DNI2HM3F8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AGH0KO#wasThisHelpful","R1V0DNI2HM3F8G","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  This is that review.My first impressions?  This flash is really solidly built and has tight tolerances.  It clicks when moving the flash up and has clicks in moving the flash side to side.  The flash feels good to the hand in that it has about the right amount of weight too.  Even the battery compartment is cool.  There is a diagram under the battery compartment door and it shows how to insert the batteries.  The door is well made and does not have that flimsy feel.The speedlite has a GN of 60, and that is very powerful.  A GN of 60 means that the flash will provide enough light to take a photo at a ISO setting of 100 at a distance of 60 meters, or 195 feet.  That is a pretty powerful flash!I would like to say that Pixel is the first company that I have bought a speedlite from that has included a plastic diffuser cap with the flash.  Yes!  In all the other flashes I have gotten no plastic diffuser cap was included and I had to buy one for around another $20.  The diffuser cap is easy to get on and off the camera too, and fits perfectly.The plastic diffuser cap is special too. Usually the diffuser caps are a cloudy plastic material.  This one also has the cloudy plastic material, but on the inside is a cut diffuser in the plastic.  This does a ton when it comes to dispersing the light.  Great job Pixel!Also included is a really wide flash stand that sits on a flat surface or attaches to a tripod.  I looked at the flash stand and saw that the tripod hole is plastic.  At first I did not like that and felt it should be metal for more strength.  I then looked at all the flash holders I have and half of them are plastic and half of them are metal.  I looked at the flash holder included with the Pixel Speedlite again, and decided it is fine.  It is made of plastic, but there are 8 plastic supports holding the threaded part in place and that should be plenty to securely hold the flash on a tripod.  The flash stand  is much longer and wider than all the rest of my flash stands, and that is good too, as it gives it more stability on a flat surface.The case is of a soft material with room inside for the flash and flash stand.  With the diffuser cap attached to the flash it will still fit inside the case, but the Velcro fastener will not connect.  Most will carry the speed lite with the diffuser cap stored in a camera bag, but not me.  It fits into the case and I can't fasten the Velcro, but it is fine to me that way.  It is worth it to be able to carry the flash and diffuser together, as most of my flash is for fill flash during the day and I want the diffuser to spread the light better and wider.The best part of the case is that it has both vertical and horizontal belt loops, so the speed lite can be worn on the belt or could be attached to the camera bag straps.The flash covers has from 20mm (wide angle) to 200mm (Max Zoom).  I have a bunch of flash units and none of them go beyond 105mm, so this flash zooming to 200mm is fantastic!  The zoom is easy to control, by pressing the -/+ button (second from the left on top), and rotating the Select Dial to the desired setting.  To go up, turn the wheel to the right and to the left to go down.  Once the setting reaches 20mm, by continuing to turn the wheel to the left causes the flash to jump up to 105mm.Once the on board flash diffuser is pulled out from the front of the flash and dropped down, the flash zoom automatically goes to WP (Wide Panel) mode.  This is as wide as the flash will disperse.  When the flash diffuser is pulled forward and dropped down, it also shows the white Reflector Catch Card.  That card is left up in the bounce position to throw some catch lights to the eyes for the person you are shooting.  It gives the eyes the sparkle we are all looking for.The power of the flash is adjustable from 1/128 to 1/1 power in 1/3 EV steps, with the Dial Selector Wheel.The flash goes down to -7 and up to 90 degrees.  The flash also moves left 180 degrees and right 180 degrees.On the power switch is a Lock position that locks the flash settings so no accidental movement of the buttons occurs.The flash remembers the last settings used and comes back to that when turned on.The locations of all the buttons are very well marked and easy to find.  The flash comes with a manual but it is pretty small.  I found the speedlite very easy to use and operate without the manual.  Everything just kind of fits and it is easy to manipulate.The unit has a battery level icon in the top right of the display.  It works great!The flash display is a High Definition Dot Matrix Screen.The start up time for the flash unit is about 2 to 3 seconds.The florescent tube is Ultra Long Life.The External Interface ‚Äì Hot Shoe, PC Port, USB port (for firmware upgrades), and External Power Port.Sync Modes ‚Äì High Speed Sync, 1st curtain sync, and 2nd curtain sync.Wireless Flash ‚Äì Optical transmission, supports Master/Slave S1 and S2.There are three modes, ETTL, Manual, and Multi, and they are all set by the Mode Button.ETTL -  the camera talks to the flash unit to control the zoom and the power from the flash.  It can be overridden by pressing the -/+ button (top row of buttons, second from left).  After the press, the flash will highlight to the left of the EV and can be adjusted by turning the Select Dial on the back of the flash.The Zoom can also be overridden by pressing the Zoom button on the top row (third on from left).MANUAL MODE ‚Äì The zoom and the power from the flash must be adjusted in the manual mode.The power of the flash can be set by pressing the -/+ button (2nd from left on top).  Rotating the Select Dial to the right the power goes up and to the left the power goes down.  As the wheel is turned, the flash power goes up or goes down in 1/3 EV steps.  The power is from 1/128 to 1/1 power.I took some shots inside my house today and with just 1/16 power the flash put out more than enough light to properly expose a photo in manual.  The camera was set to max aperture and ISO 80.  That tells me this flash has tons of power.The Zoom is controlled by pressing the Zoom button (3rd button from left) and turning the Select Dial to the right or left, depending on the amount of zoom required.MULTI MODE ‚Äì It is easy to set the number of times (0 to 100), and the time of duration (1 to 500 Hz) by pressing  and holding the Mult*FN button (top right button on the flash).  I tried using this mode and it works perfectly.  I set the amount of flashes to 8 and the duration to 1 and every second for 8 seconds the flash went off.  I could not check this on my camera as it does not support this function.Sound is enabled out of the box, and once the flash has charged and is ready the unit will beep.I did some testing of the charge refresh rates, and at 1/1 full power it takes the unit 2.5 seconds to charge on a fresh set of batteries.  At Ω power it takes about 1 second to recharge the flash. At any speed of ¬º power or less, the flash will charge as fast as your camera can take the photos.  If you press the shutter 10 times it will charge and flash 10 times as fast as you can press the shutter.Standby Time ‚Äì Set to 5 minutes.  It can be adjusted from 5 minutes to 2 hours or to a Non Sleep Mode.The Sound, Display Timer, AF/On/Off and the Sleeper Timer are all programmable.  To do this press and hold the Sync*FN button (top right button).  Let the button go and press it again.There are 4 settings set with the Snyc*FN button.  Press the Sync*FN button and hold it.  The top Tone feature will highlight.  Release the button.TONE - On and Off. Rotate the Select Dial to the desired setting.  Press the Sync*FN button to advance to the next setting.DISPLAY LIGHT TIMER -  There are 4 settings.  5 Seconds, 10 Seconds, ON, and OFF.  Set it to the one needed by turning the Select Dial.  Press the Sync*FN button again.AF ‚Äì On and Off.  Again, rotate the Select Dial to the desired setting. Press the Sync*FN button again.SLEEPER TIMER ‚Äì rotate the Select Dial to the desired setting.  The settings available are 5 minute, 10 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour, 2 hour, and No Timer.Press the OK button to exit the module.Wireless Flash Control.  Supports the optical transmission flash control.  The flash transmits an optical pulse to control firing remotely.  The speedlite on the camera should be set as Master and the off camera flash set to Slave.These modes are set up by the continuous pressing of the Set*Rmot button (top left button).  They are set up similar to the ones on the flash sleeper timer modes.The flash is extremely easy to use and easy to set up.  It does come with a small manual but the buttons are well marked and easy to understand.  This flash is one of the easiest I have ever used.  It has tons of power and in ETTL it talks to the camera and takes all the work out of using a flash.  I highly recommend this product!  I really really like the fact that it zooms to 200mm.  That is awesome when you are trying to get the light way out there.I used this flash in my Canon Camera in ETTL, and used the flash on my Panasonic Camera in Manual.  It works great on both cameras. It will work on any camera that has a flash hot shoe, but must be used in Manual on those cameras other than a Canon.  A Canon is the only camera this flash will work for in the ETTL or Automatic Mode.  Great product Pixel!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9SX88LMQNK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZUQGANU#wasThisHelpful","RV9SX88LMQNK5","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this Etronic Security Lock not for locking a bicycle, but for locking my 10 foot gate.  I like it for several reasons.  One is that it is thicker than the normal cable and would be really hard to break.  The second reason is the lock is using numbers.  I made the mistake of buying a cable lock in a department store and it had letters instead of numbers.  It almost drove me crazy trying to set up a code that made any sense that I could remember.  I never liked that one at all.I bought a second cable lock from another department store and it was so hard to turn the numbers that my wife refused to use it.  Back to the store it went.I ordered this one from Amazon, and for one thing it is thicker than almost any other cable, has numbers that turn easily and once the code has been dialed in,  it easily comes apart.  This one is a winner in many ways and I really like this cable for those reasons.  I wish it was shorter, but I guess I can't have everything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WTLGKV7OR4H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8SWB20#wasThisHelpful","R2WTLGKV7OR4H4","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a big antenna pointed towards Atlanta in my attic and it works really well, but there are some stations that are weak and choppy.  I bought this antenna amplifier to put between the antenna cable and the tv and it really helps those weak stations come in better.  The ones that are choppy without the amplifier are not choppy with it in line and turned on.  I tried it both ways to make sure there was a substantial difference and there is.

"I ordered this case for a Moto E and am very happy with it.  It fits the camera really well and adds plenty of drop protection at the same time.  It has a big hole in the bottom for a charging jack.The case adds plenty of protection to the camera lens and I am really happy about that as I kept putting my finger on the lens and when I took some shots with the camera the photos looked terrible.  At first I could not figure it out, then finally saw the lens had a fingerprint on it.  I cleaned the print off with a lens cloth and the photos improved dramatically!  This case will stop that problem as it is not easy to get a fingerprint on the lens now.A lens pen comes with the case, but there is no holder for the pen, so I see no need for it.  The case also comes with a Microfiber Digital Cleaner for the glass, but my camera lens cloth works better.  I neat freeby though.I really like the color as blue rocks!The case really adds a lot of shock protection from drops.  It is easy to hold in the hand and is made of material that is easy to grip.  The top and bottom are rubber or a rubber type material and add a lot of protection.  The push buttons work well, but it seem to take a little more effort to push the buttons now.This case looks very stylish and the color is great.  A great combination and security and peace of mind, knowing if I drop the smartphone it will probably survive intact and functioning.

"I received several bulbs from G7 Sierra for a review.  This is one of those reviews.This particular bulb is a Non-Dimmable 50 watt (670 lumens) bulb.  What blows my mind about this bulb is how bright it is and the nice color of the light it produces.  I am using it in my garage and it lights up the whole garage perfectly.  With this bulb using such a small amount of electricity I just leave it on a timer and it stays on during the night.I have come to be pretty knowledgeable about the G7 Sierra bulbs.  For one thing, they are built like tanks!  The quality is fantastic and you know from the look and feel of these bulbs they are way above the normal bulb quality.  They are really well built and strong.  I dropped one on my garage floor a while back and it still worked when I connected it.  I was amazed!What totally blows me away is the amount of electricity they use, or should I say the lack of electricity they use.  This bulb uses 8 watts of electrical power, with an estimated annual cost of $0.99 or 99 cents for a whole year of use, based on use of 3 hours per day.  That, my friends, is almost nothing!  Even better than that, are you worried the bulb will burn out?  Try 22.8 years of use at 3 hours per day!  These might be the last set of bulbs you will ever have to purchase.Another great benefit of these awesome bulbs is they do not get hot to the touch.

"I received several bulbs from G7 Sierra for a review.  This is one of those reviews.This particular bulb is a Non-Dimmable 40 watt (480 lumens) bulb.  What blows my mind about this bulb is how bright it is and the nice color of the light it produces.  I am using it in my living room for a back light and the lighting is fantastic!  The room is plenty bright for watching a tv and plenty bright in general.I have come to be pretty knowledgeable about the G7 Sierra bulbs.  For one thing, they are built like tanks!  The quality is fantastic and you know from the look and feel of these bulbs they are way above the normal bulb quality.  They are really well built and strong.What totally blows me away is the amount of electricity they use, or should I say the lack of electricity they use.  This bulb uses 6 watts of electrical power, with an estimated annual cost of $0.79 or 79 cents for a whole year of use, based on use of 3 hours per day.  That, my friends, is almost nothing!  Even better than that, are you worried the bulb will burn out?  Try 22.8 years of use at 3 hours per day!  These might be the last set of bulbs you will ever have to purchase.Another great benefit of these awesome bulbs is they do not get hot to the touch.  That fact is important, but not really, as they will never need replacement!G7 Sierra has produced an outstanding product that will last tens of years and burn almost no electricity!  Who could be unhappy with that?  A great product Sierra!  I will be buying many more of your bulbs in the near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0GME4AMQFNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGKMBAG#wasThisHelpful","R2P0GME4AMQFNS","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this FiveJoy Hands Free Desktop Magnifier for a review.  This is that review.I was surprised at how lightweight the magnifier was.  The magnifier comes in two pieces.  One is the base and the other is the light itself.  There is a notch on the light stem and it fits into the base and will only go in one way.  The light is plenty strong and throws a good beam, lighting the whole area of the magnifier.  The magnifier has two different magnifications.  The main magnifier is a 1X and is great for just about everything.  The second magnifier is a 4X.  The only problem I had with the 4X is it is pretty small in diameter and not easy to get positioned so you can easily see through it.I made the mistake of trying to use this magnifier to see the inside of a ring my wife had bought.  At 1X it was not magnified enough to see the writing on the inside of the ring, and with the 4X the light from the magnifier was not positioned to see the lettering well.  In reality that was not a good test for this magnifier.I also used it to look at some fine print on a bottle and it worked great for that.  Even the 4X magnifier was easy to use in those conditions and this is more what the magnifier is made to be used for.  It is great for looking at fine print on papers or threading a needle and things like that.  The light is well  disbursed and spreads throughout the viewing area.All in all, I was happy with the magnifier and it works great!  The quality is great and the two pieces were easy to put together.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NLC54AHM0J4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VL3T8T4#wasThisHelpful","R3NLC54AHM0J4I","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this Leadcin Heavy 9mm Titanium Steel Men's Necklace because I liked the look of the link pattern and like the heavy titanium weight.  It feels good on my neck and I like the way it looks.  My wife stated that she wished it was a little longer, but it works fine for me.The clasps are very strong and sturdy and the necklace is really tough.The only thing I can see that would make the necklace better is if the snap was on a swivel as it tends to twist the necklace at the top where the snap is.  I would also like to see it a little longer, but I am more than happy with it and could see myself buying another one for a gift for a friend as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITJ269EZ43M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZH9LWPG#wasThisHelpful","R2ITJ269EZ43M6","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this 180 Cosmetics Bundle in exchange for an honest review.  This is that review.Right away my wife took the product from me and started using it.What she noticed right away is the fine lines in her face started receding.  She is an older woman and has had many birthdays in which she was 29 years old, but to tell you the truth she is on social security, so that tells something of her age.  At first I did not really notice, but after a few days of using the product her face just looks younger.Her skin tone is better and her face just seems to glow.  The fine lines near her eyes are gone and the heavier lines are fading quickly.  She asked me to feel her face, and it feels very soft, and smooth.  She says it also makes her skin feel a lot tighter and the cremes really do make her look younger by at least 10 years!  My wife is ecstatic about the creme, and let me know that when the supply starts getting low that I had better order her some more, or else!She is as happy as could be and I am happy for her.  This product really works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFE45SAK23YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNIOXAO#wasThisHelpful","ROFE45SAK23YV","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Netgear R6300 decided to take a dump after a close lightning strike lately.  It went off line and I unplugged it and plugged it back in.  The light came on and then went off and the unit died.I have had so much good luck with Netgear Products that I decided to buy this R6250 Manufacture Refurbished model.  It works great and is so easy to set up that it is almost ridiculous.  Just plug it in and the router does the rest.  It asks if you want to install the Netgear Genie and I clicked on Yes.That program is awesome.  It allows you to set up the 2.4 and 5 Ghz modes.  It also allows the setting of the Guest router with your own password as well.  Netgear really has it together in that the setup is a piece of cake.  Where this unit really shines is the speed.  I have a router supplied by the phone company for my internet connection.  This Netgear R6250 runs circles around the one from the phone company.  It is so much faster!My house is pretty 5800 square feet in two levels, and this router works everywhere in the house.  It puts out a really strong signal and did I tell you it is fast!  It is so fast it amazes me!Why did I buy the refurbished model verses the new model?  The main reason is it is half the money and the unit is factory refurbished with a 30 day warranty from Amazon.  I have had great luck with Netgear products in the past and this unit seems to be just as good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PQ4OIJLIA6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRCQRSQ#wasThisHelpful","R22PQ4OIJLIA6X","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received the Sangean Ant-60 Short Wave Antenna today and gave it a quick check out.First of all, I have a Grundig S450 DLX shortwave receiver.  I found stations around the band and compared the signal strength with and without the Sangean Antenna.I have the antenna spread inside the house and I am sure if it was outside it would be better.  The signal strength inside on one station in particular went from a signal strength of 2 on the dial without the antenna to 4 with the antenna.  I found this to be consistent throughout the bands.  It made the receiver much more sensitive to weak signals.The Sangean was easy to use.  It comes with a clip to hook to the radio antenna if no jacks are provided on the radio for an antenna.  In my case, the radio had an antenna input but it was a 75 ohm type instead of the 3.5mm jack that comes with the Sangean Antenna.  The clip goes over the top section of the radio antenna and clips into place.The Sangean Antenna comes rolled up on a spool.  To extend the antenna, just pull it out, and the spool has a spring clip on it to attach the spool to a small tree branch or something solid. Once finished with the antenna the spool has a finger hole in order to roll the antenna back into the spool.The quality of the Sangean ANT-60 is outstanding and built very solid.  It is easy to extend and retract the antenna and if your radio has not 3.5mm antenna jack, just clip it to the radio antenna.  The price was certainly great as well.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10E17SIXSJNC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000023VW2#wasThisHelpful","R10E17SIXSJNC7","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this product for an honest evaluation and review on Amazon.  Here is that review:The Soundpeats Qy7 came in a nice little box and in the box was a nice little hard case.  Inside the case was the Bluetooth Earbud Headphones and all kinds of accessories.  I plugged the headphones into my computer with the supplied USB cable.  In no time at all the unit showed full charge.I was able to turn the unit on by pressing and holding the RDO button on one of the ear pieces and as soon as I pressed and held that button the unit came on and a red light lit up.I turned on the Bluetooth on my tablet and it immediately saw the Soundpeats Qy7 headset, so I connected the pair.  The volume was ok, but not really loud like I normally listen to music.  It turns out the volume control is on the other ear piece and has a + or - on the control. I pressed the + and the volume got louder.  I held it down and the volume got loud.  Really loud!  Great!  I turned the volume down on my tablet and listened to the music.  The sound was nice and sharp and clear.I paid attention to the headset itself, and it is well made with durable components.  The ear pieces were too  big for my ears, but in the accessories were other smaller ear pieces that fit just right.The green head band is really well made and is very strong.  All of the accessories were quality components for the headphones with different ear pieces.  The USB cable for charging the unit was very well made of quality materials.  There are no cheaply made parts on the Soundpeats Qy7 headphone.  It exhibits quality all the way, from the extremely well made hard case to the quality headphones.The best part.  The sound!  It was extremely sharp and clear and sounded awesome!  And it was loud, really loud!  Soundpeats outdid themselves on this unit and should be commended!  I received this unit for testing and giving an honest evaluation.  In my opinion, this unit is the one to beat!  Good stuff Soundpeats!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25FANF5H6I23N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP6CFEC#wasThisHelpful","R25FANF5H6I23N","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this iGearPro 3 in 1 Voice Recorder for an honest evaluation on Amazon.  This is my review.I opened the box and removed the 3 in 1 Voice Recorder and hooked up the USB cable from the unit to the computer.  Immediately a series of blue lights began flashing, first at 25%. Over the period of about 30 minutes the lights went from 25% to 100%, indicating a full charge.To turn on the built in light I pressed the power button two times and the light came on.  Two more times and the light went off....Cool!Next I hooked the 2200 MaH Power Bank to my cell phone and within 30 minutes it had the cell phone at full charge.  Cool!The last step was to check out the voice recorder.  I held down the voice recorder button for a second and a Red Light started flashing, indicating it was recording.  I let the recorder go for 30 seconds or so, while talking into the recorder.  I pressed the recorder button again to stop the recording and twice more to kill the red light.I hooked the recorder to my computer with the supplied USB cord and clicked on Play when that window came up.  The recorder played back the recording and my voice was so distorted that I could barely understand what I was saying.  The tv in the background was nice and sharp and clear, but my voice was way over distorted and loud and not understandable.The tv sound was fine, so that told me the recorder was ok, so I did another recording with the recorder about 18 inches away this time.  I spoke in a normal voice and did not speak loudly like I did the first time.I played the recording back on the computer again, and this time it was perfect.  It was plenty loud enough and my voice was nice and clear and I could hear the tv in the background.  The first time I had spoken in a louder than normal voice and I just over drove the recording circuit.  I learned that you need to speak in a normal fashion at a normal speaking level and if done the correct way, the recorder works perfectly!The recorder starts just as soon as the recorder button is pressed.  The recorder microphone is very sensitive and can hear everything in the room, which is good.  If I was dictating some information to the recorder, I would just speak in a normal voice.The recorder is very rugged and plenty of cables are included to charge various cell phones and tablets.  It is a nice little voice recorder, flash light, and cell phone/tablet charger.  I could not be happier with the unit.  It works great and the voice recorder is very responsive and very sensitive.  The pen light is strong as well.  This is a great little unit and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXYZQ6MAWAXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ19YW6#wasThisHelpful","R3GXYZQ6MAWAXP","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this unit brand new at a yard sale.  It works great!  The radio receives from 1711 to 29999 khz on short wave, plus AM and FM bands.  The readout is digital and has a fast and slow dial.  It works on AC or 6 D batteries.  The shortwave radio has an antenna for SW and FM bands, and appears to have a built in antenna for AM.What I did notice about the radio is it is extremely sensitive and the frequency on the dial is exactly spot on.  The radio will receive all the short wave bands to include ham and cb frequencies.lt has 50 presets for different bands as well.  The dial has a finger hole to make it much easier to spin. The radio works great in FM and the speaker has a good tonal quality, which is adjustable for bass and treble.  It also has a AM RF Gain control on the main face.  The radio also has a built in clock.I would recommend purchasing a Sangean ANT-60 Short Wave Antenna to go with the Grundig Receiver.  It clips to the antenna and is 23 feet long for better reception of the short wave frequencies.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000023VW2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00What makes this short wave radio so outstanding is the frequency readout.  It is extremely accurate and any frequency between 1711 and 29999 Khz can be dialed easily for short wave reception.  The FM dial is also nice with a 10 station presets as well.  I am very happy with this product and it is definitely a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FPJTRWY7HCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FV4ND0#wasThisHelpful","R30FPJTRWY7HCI","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a bottle of this supplement in exchange for an honest review.The Tribulus Terrestris Suppliment is outstanding!  I was a little skeptical at first, but kept taking the capsules, one every day.  After two weeks I can feel an improvement.  I have more energy and just feel good.  I have been happy too.  I don't know for sure if it is the result of the  supplement or not, but I think it is working.  I am 62 years old, and it has helped my libido too.  My sexual desire has come up, much to my wife's displeasure!  HAI will continue to take the capsules, one every day and am sure it will continue to work on my mindset and health.  It is hard to judge on taking supplements, whether you actually feel better or not, as it is subjective, but my sexual desire is up and that in itself is a feat to be happy about!I like the product so much I ordered another bottle for myself.

You can tell it is a quality product once you look at the capsules.

"I received one of these umbrellas for leaving an honest review.The size of the umbrella is fantastic as it is really large!  Just take off the case, and push the button and the automatic umbrella unfolds and snaps right up.  It is very strong in that it has 8 metal/fiberglass ribs for strength.  The ribs are mostly metal with a small length of fiberglass.  I love it that it goes up completely when the button is pressed, and even better yet, the canopy compresses when the button is pressed again.  The main pole does not go down automatically.  You must pull that down manually.The umbrella was easy enough to close down and get into the case.  The key is to compress the arms and wrap the material around them.  The fit is tight,  but if you roll it up snugly, it goes right in.  The umbrella looks so great once put back into the case.  It is very small and compact.I could not be happier with the umbrella.  It is very well made and very strong and durable.  The material is strong and well stitched and I love the push button up and the push button down.  The price is fantastic as well.

"I do a lot of walking at fast speeds on a treadmill and at the speed of 4 miles per hour, my shins begin to hurt.  I can feel the stress in the legs and on the shin.  I was given the opportunity to use these #1 Graduated Compression Calf Sleeves Guard Socks for an evaluation on Amazon and jumped at the chance.  Anything that might relieve the pain I am getting from the shin splints are more than welcome!I wore the Calf Sleeve Guards Socks today while walking on the treadmill and 4 miles per hour was not a problem at all.  I was able to walk at 4.5 miles per hour with no pain what so ever.  These compression socks are excellent!  It feels so good to be able to work out harder and go faster without feeling pain.  I walked for an hour with no problem at all.These compression socks worked great for walking and working out, but there is another reason I wanted them and it is even more important.  I occasionally fly on airlines.  In one case, I fly from Atlanta, Georgia to Tokyo, Japan and that flight lasts 16 or more hours.  The problem with flying that far is what they call ""Economy Class Syndrome"", which is getting blood clots in the legs.  It can be very critical or even deadly.  Compression stockings are frequently used to prevent the blood clotting while flying and If I ever fly on a long trip again, you can bet I am going to be wearing this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AIBSQV4MC0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVP4DZE#wasThisHelpful","R27AIBSQV4MC0W","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife broke her ankle a couple of years ago, and still has pain and stiffness in the joint.  Nothing has helped relieve the pain.  She has tried different pain medications without success.  The pain goes away for a while but soon comes back.  I was offered this product in exchange for an honest review and I jumped at the chance.My wife put the Best Pantar Fascitis Compression Foot Sleeves for the ankle on yesterday.  She wore them for an hour or so, and I asked her how they were working and she said her ankle felt a lot better.  She said the throbbing pain inside the her foot was gone.  The compression foot sleeves fit pretty tight and they help with circulation.  The best part is the sleeves come in pairs and only one is needed in her case, so the other can be used later.  The sleeves are not hot and seem to breathe well with no perspiration or sweating under them.Later on my wife went to work and when she came home she still had the sleeve on and she said she loved it!I have been told by higher headquarters (my wife) that when and if these sleeves ever wear out, she wants a new pair immediately.

"I have to admit that I wanted the lanyard more than I needed the lens cap, but can use the 55mm lens cap on another camera.  The lens cap is great and better than most because it has two ways to get the cap off.  One way is to grab the cap by the outer squeeze grips and squeeze them together and the cap immediately comes off.  The other way is to grab the inside squeeze grips and take the lens cap off.  Why is this special?  Because sometimes the lens hood is connected forward in the proper using position in the camera and the outer squeeze grips are not available because of the lens hood.  In that case, just use the inner squeeze grips and take the lens cap off.The lens cap is great, but it is the lanyard that I needed for another lens cap I have.  It is 62mm and this company does not sell one with this lanyard in that size.  The lanyard is great as the bottom that connects to the cap is thin and very strong and easy to get through the lens cap, and the top is much thicker and very strong and easy to get through the camera strap holes.  It is the best of both worlds.  Most of the time when you order a lens cap, it comes with a string that is not even connected at the ends.  It is just a string.  You have to tie a knot in it and it is subject to coming lose and dropping the lens cap.  This lanyard is connected already, with two loops.  One goes on the lens cap and the other goes on the camera.  The quality is very good and it is very very strong.What a winner!  A great lens cap with two different inner and outer opening grips and a good quality strong lanyard with a small loop for the lens cap and a larger strong loop for the camera!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMBYX4TD978HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG3CY8#wasThisHelpful","RMBYX4TD978HE","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Fotodiox 6 X 9 inch Softbox for an external flash is outstanding.I have several different flash softboxes and this one is the best of all of them.  In most brands once the softbox is unfolded will not stay straight.  They droop down because the seams that hold them straight are too weak.  I keep buying different brands and finally I have found a good one.  This softbox, once unfolded, stays straight ahead towards the subject without drooping.It took me a total of 3 - 6 X 8 inch softboxes and none of them are strong enough to hold the flash material straight on line with the subject.  I made the mistake of ordering a 8 X 12 inch softbox and it was even worse.  It looked like a wilted flower.  It would not stay straight out no matter how I  manipulated the seams.This softbox from Fotodiox is the best one of the bunch.  It is a little bigger at 6 X 9, and it works great too. It takes out the shadows and illuminates the area uniformly without any hot spots.  It works really great as a fill softbox on the external flash. The flash fill does not look like a flash was used and that is the look we strive for.  It sits up on top of the external camera flash all loud and proud.  I finally got the right one and now I am a very happy camper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C0VTFFKQ91GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y30334#wasThisHelpful","R1C0VTFFKQ91GE","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a different brand 6 X 8 softbox, and it works great, but the thing just wants to sloop downward and as much as I have tried, there is no way to make it stay and stand straight.  I bought this 8 inch octagon soft box, hoping it would stay straight when folded out.  To my surprise, it does stay straight!  What a relief!  I took several photos with the flash attached using the Neewer 8 inch octagon soft box and the lighting was very uniform and pleasing at all zoom levels.  I did not try to bounce the flash, but aimed it directly at the subject.  I was a little concerned the lighting would be more in the middle of the shot and less on the outside, but that is not what happened.  The lighting was even and the same at the corners as it was in the middle.  The thing I liked most about this softbox is once unfolded, it shoots straight out and does not sloop down.  What a winner!  I could not be happier with the product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37U7IDWS00DFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6ICAXY#wasThisHelpful","R37U7IDWS00DFW","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On different occasions I have trouble sleeping at night.  When going to bed, I am very sleepy but once I lay down my mind goes into overdrive and it is impossible to shut off.  I have tried several different remedies and nothing has worked.  Finally, out of desperation, I tried the Amazing Nutrition Gaba and within 30 minutes of taking the suppliment, off to dreamland I went.  This problem has occurred three times now and in each case the Gaba has done the trick of letting me sleep.  I keep a bottle at my bedside, ready for use.  The Gaba is a life saver and am I am certainly happy to have found it.  It makes me sleepy and lets the mind calm down.  It allows the mind to relax and a good night's sleep is possible because of this great supplement.  I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UO3NWXIX0B41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVFHX12#wasThisHelpful","R3UO3NWXIX0B41","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this light stand very acceptable and certainly strong enough for a light stand.  I plan on using it for an off camera external flash and a small umbrella.  The stand was nice in that it came with a case.  I also used a Flash Bracket Swivel Bracket Umbrella Holder Studio Tilting Bracket on top.

"The first thing I noticed is the light itself.  The Camo pattern is extremely pretty and as soon as my wife saw it, she took it from me.  I like the color of the light a lot!  It puts out quite a lot of brightness and lights the room up very well.Last night I was watching tv.  Earlier I had thought about checking the Camo Lantern out.  All of the sudden, out of the blue, the lights went out.  There were storms in the area, but not all that close.  I thought to myself, now I can really check the Camo Lantern with a thorough real test.  I went into my wife's room and went to the light.  I knew where she put it, but at that point I had no light on me and it was dark in the room.  I found the lantern by feel and pulled it apart and immediately felt the strong light coming out that lit up the whole room.  The lantern was actually very bright!At the time I read the summary for the light I realized it had no ON or OFF switch and thought that was a downer.  In a real life situation I was happy there was no switch on the lantern as it would not have been easy to find the switch in the dark.  I just pulled on the top of the lantern and the light came on right away.  Wicked Cool!When I read the summary for the lantern I also noticed it had no dimmer.  I would have liked for the light to have a dimmer mode to allow for a longer run on the AA batteries the lantern uses.  I also wish it would take a stronger battery like a D cell, but the light is way too small for a battery like that.The power was off for more than 3 hours and when the power finally came back on the Camo Lantern was still blasting away in full brightness.  I don't know how long the three AA batteries will run on the lantern, but at the end of the 3 hour stretch the light was still in full brightness.  In all actuality most of the time when the power fails three hours is plenty of time.  Normally the power is back on way before that.I am very impressed with the lantern itself.  The camo colors are just too cool and not drab like all the other lights I have.  The lantern puts out a very bright light that lights up the whole room.  I don't know how long three AA batteries will run the light, but it went 3 hours with flying colors.  I highly recommend this light and am going to buy two more for the other rooms in my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TA4WUUNTRAZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V97YCLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TA4WUUNTRAZ6","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a set of the TeiKis 19 Piece Grill Set for an honest review.  I have checked out and have used the set and this is my review.The best part about this set is the case.  It is fantastic and built like a tank.  The outer part is made of a high quality strong plastic with an aluminum frame.  The case handle is made of steel and the case is really really well made.  The case has two snaps to hold the lid shut and they fit snugly and are tight.  The inside of the case is quality too, with elastic holders on one side of each tool, and Velcro on the other side.  With the Velcro on one side, it is easy enough to unhook the Velcro and pull the tool through the elastic loop.The slotted turner/flipper -  I go to yard sales a lot and buy BBQ turner/flippers all the time.  I kind of collect them, especially the good ones!  I am always on the hunt for a good turner that is well built.  The turner that comes in this set is the best turner I have ever seen.  None of the turners that I have found at yard sales have groves on the sides for scooping up hamburgers from the left or right side.  They are always just in the front.  This turner has a blade in the front like a normal turner has, but this one also has grooves in the left and right side of the flipper to pick up hamburgers from the left or right.  The handle is steel and has a ring in the end for hanging it.  It also has a bottle opener built into the flipper.  The turner has a little flex, but just the right amount.Jumbo Tongs - They are very well made and the tension on the tongs is just about right.  The ends of the tongs did not match up perfectly, but they work just fine.8 each Corn Holders - Very well made with steel handles with plastic on the ends.  I tried a couple of them on my wife's cooked corn on the cob and they work great!  They fit into the corn tightly and easily and keep the hot corn off the fingers.  They fit snugly in the case with elastic loops.4 each Steak Knives - The knives are all steel with serrated edges.  These knives are sharp, very sharp.  They cut through steak like butter.Heavy Duty BBQ Fork - Big long steel handle with a loop at the end for hanging.  The fork is very well made and has just the right amount of flex and the tines are very sharp.8 inch All Purpose Knife - Once again, all steel construction with a loop at the end for hanging.  This knife is sharp!  Very sharp!  You need to take careful attention when removing or inserting the knife in the case as this thing is no nonsense sharp!  Just be careful with the serrated edge and not  be in any hurry to get it out.Gourmet Basting Brush - The brush handle is steel with a loop at the end for hanging.  The brush itself is very soft and pliable, which is great for applying BBQ sauce.  The brush is also made of rubber so cleaning it is very easy and quick!Grill Cleaning Brush - Once again, a steel handle with a loop for hanging.  The grill brush has a scrapper on the front end for the tough stuff.  There is a plastic cover that covers the bronze bristles when not in use to keep the case clean.  The handle flexes just a little bit, just the right amount.  The bristles are extremely hard and stiff and clean the grill very effectively.Digital Thermometer - works incredibly fast on testing food for the proper temperature. It reads in Celsius or Fahrenheit, changed with a switch.  For fun I held the thermometer in my hand and amazingly it measured my body temperature of 98.6 from my hand.  Awesome!This grill set is a home run!  The tools are all well made out of steel and the case is fantastic!  All the tools are held in place with elastic on one end and with Velcro on the other for easy and quick removal and installation.  This TeiKis 19 Piece Deluxe Stainless Steel BBQ Grill Set is totally awesome and the last grill set you will ever have to buy.  The tools are well made of quality materials and should last forever.  I highly recommend this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDUGB3ZCIE1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5LE3JK#wasThisHelpful","R1FDUGB3ZCIE1H","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like the diffuser as it has a grid pattern in the end that diffuses the light even more.

"I bought this flash on the recommendation of Graham Houghton, and found the flash to work as advertised.  The features of the flash have been covered by Graham and many others and I agree with all of them.  It is an awesome flash and is very powerful.  The only thing I do not like about the flash is the stepping process in turning up or turning down the power.  If the button above or to the right of the set button is pressed, the flash power goes up, but it is in steps, not in stops.  It goes up 1/3 EV every time the button is pressed and if the button is pressed three times it goes up one stop.  It takes forever to go from 1/64 to 1/2 power for instance by pressing the button.  The button can be held down, but at that point it goes incredibly fast and it is hard to stop it in time.  I wish there was a way to take the 1/3 EV stepping process out of the flash and just give me stops like from 1/64 to 1/32 to 1/16 without going through the stepping EV process along the way.The flash is a manual one in that the power and zoom settings are set by you and not the camera.  This flash will work on any camera that has a hot shoe and will not work in any of the auto modes like TTL.A Nikon 900 flash plastic diffuser will fit on the Aperlite flash.http://www.amazon.com/Xit-XTHD910-Bounce-Diffuser-SB-900/dp/B00BY3LQ8M/ref=cm_rdp_product","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDNJIU2HI78U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFFW4GW#wasThisHelpful","R2GDNJIU2HI78U","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received one of these LED Miner Safety Cap Lamps for an honest review on Amazon.  The quality of the light is outstanding as it has a thick plastic outer shell.  The unit has a red plastic cap over the charging jack for waterproof protection.  It comes with a head strap that is plenty heavy enough for wearing the Lamp on the head.The light has a red switch on top for turning the unit on. The switch has two power settings.  The first push of the switch provides full power and the second push provides a dimmed output.  I thought the beam might be adjustable for wider and narrower beam settings, but I could not adjust the light at all.The bracket that holds the head band swivels for using different angles of the light, and when I first tried to adjust the beam down I was unable to adjust it as the bracket screws were way too tight.  I just loosened the screws on the bracket a little and now it works fine.What really impressed me about this safety lamp is the light itself, as it is really bright!  The batteries really impressed me too.  The batteries are Lithium Ion and last a year between charges.  They are much better than normal NiMH batteries used today.The charger works perfectly too.  I just plugged the charger in while it was connected to the lamp and the light on the charger was red, showing charge.  I came back an hour or so later and the light on the charger had changed from Red to Green, showing full charge.This lamp is really well made of thick plastic material and looks like it could be dropped without damage.  The lamp is waterproof as well.  The batteries are killer with a long life between charges.  I highly recommend the LED Miner Safety Cap Lamp!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ZRHN8C2N2JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7BXQSU#wasThisHelpful","R12ZRHN8C2N2JE","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a set of Dog Electric Grooming Clippers Set for evaluation and review.  The first thing I noticed is the clipper set comes in a nice plastic box that holds all the components.  It has 4 different attachment plastic clipper comb sets.  I did not find these comb sets helpful in cutting my dog's hair as it is too thick and mattes easily.  That is not the fault of the set.  I have other very expensive clipper sets and the combs on them do not work either.I gave it a good test.  I cut the hair of my curly Chinese Crested dog.  His hair is incredibly hard to cut as it is so thick.  With the Dog Electric Clippers cutting the dogs hair was a piece of cake.  The clippers went through the hair like butter and it was easy to cut through the matted part.  The dog is normally really spooky but with these clippers he just sat there and let me go.  The clippers are pretty quiet, and even though it makes a noise when first starting, the dog did not seem bothered by that noise.I have a very expensive pair of clippers, but after a while the cutting head gets pretty hot.  With the Dog Electric Clippers the head never did get hot at all.  It was warm to the touch but not hot.  The dog sat there the whole time and never gave me any trouble.  I was able to take the hair off in several big pieces.  I also noticed that these clippers are easy to hold level for a straight cut.  I am very satisfied with the clippers and highly recommend them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQUZYGJPI7X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYE62YS#wasThisHelpful","R3MQUZYGJPI7X2","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Image set of filters work perfectly.  Not only are there ND (Neutral Density) filters to allow the camera to use a wider f stop (larger opening lens) for taking photos of plants or other objects in which you want a narrow depth of field with a photo taken by the camera during the day in bright sunlight, or for taking pictures of waterfalls in which you want the effect of that glow look with the water flowing.  The graduated filters work great too, in darkening the sky and leaving the bottom of the photo as is.  The sky is always brighter than the ground or the landscape and the graduated filters allow the sky to be darkened.  There are three different levels of the graduated filter and three levels of the ND filter for different occasions.  The kit comes with tons of adapters for just about any camera, and the holder is well made and the filters fit into it tightly.  I am very happy with mine and the price is certainly reasonable.  One thing I would recommend is keeping a lens cleaning cloth with the kit to wipe the fingerprints off the filters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTV3L59BX1E6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHIGM5K#wasThisHelpful","RTV3L59BX1E6K","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this light and several others for an honest review on Amazon.  First I would like to say the bulbs from G7 Power are really well made, with very sturdy bodies and you can tell just by holding and looking at the bulbs that the quality is really there.  I accidentally gave this bulb the ultimate test.  I took the bulb out of the lamp in my garage and opened the box with the G7 LED 10 watt in it.  When I went to pull the bulb out, I lost my grip and dropped the bulb on a concrete floor.  I was appalled and horrified!  Surely this bulb will no longer work as it dropped hard on the concrete.  I put the bulb in the lamp and while holding my breath, hit the switch.  To my surprise, it lit up and works normally.  Believe me, these bulbs are well made and as tough as a tank.  I could not be happier with the G7 Power bulbs and plan on ordering several more of them.  In spite of being LED bulbs the prices of the G7 Power bulbs are very reasonable and did I say they are built like a tank?

"I currently have a Sigma 62mm CPL, but once I discovered the Hoya HD was as cheap as it is, I went for it.  I have the same Hoya HD in 52mm, but this one is 62mm.  I am very happy with this circular polarizer filter!  It is fantastic on the blue sky, and I did a comparison between the Sigma EX DG filter and this one and in my opinion the Hoya came out on top in more than one way.  The colors look deeper and just glow!  The filter does a great job of taking out the reflections of water.The photos with both filters look great, but I found that in a couple of photos, the Sigma filter shots came out a little out of focus, where the Hoya shots all looked sharp.  All shots were taken from a tripod to insure a fair comparison.There are a couple of big differences between the Hoya HD and Sigma EX DG filters.  I took every shot in aperture priority at f/5.6, and the ISO was 80 in all shots.  In every case the shutter speed the camera set with the Hoya CPL was faster then with the Sigma filter, which means it lets in more light.Another big difference is the glass itself.  The Hoya HD is hardened glass and has 8 coatings.  I noticed I had a fingerprint smudge on the Sigma,and tried to clean it off with a lens cloth, and that did not work.  It just smeared the fingerprint, and I had to use lens cleaning solution to get the print off.  I looked at the Hoya filter and there was a fingerprint on it as well.  With the Hoya all I had to do was wipe it with a lens cleaning cloth and it came right off.  You can tell the glass with the Hoya is really tough with a hard finish.  For those two reasons alone I would strongly recommend the Hoya filter over the SIgma.The Hoya CPL filter has 8 coatings and hardened glass.  This filter rocks!In comment 1 I am listing the photos taken with both filters.  Pay attention to the shutter speed.  All the photos are labeled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R285TZWOFDZKK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7PMFE#wasThisHelpful","R285TZWOFDZKK9","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Hoya 77mm Neutral Density ND-400 filter works great!  It has about 9 stops of power, so getting a shot of 3 or 4 seconds during the day is easy accomplished.  The objects shot through this filter have incredible details so the filter does not degrade the photos at all.One thing I did notice though is the filter throws a magenta color cast on the target with the white balance in Auto in my camera.  This can easily be taken out in software or by using a Custom White Balance filter in the camera.  It may be my camera too, but in Auto White Balance the color cast has too much magenta.  To take care of this, I just shoot a 18% gray card or use a White Balance Filter through the camera for a custom white balance.  It may be that my camera metering for white balance may not react well in Auto for this filter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWDML8S19MAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00111UX40#wasThisHelpful","RYWDML8S19MAS","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Promaster System Pro 77mm White Balance Lens Cap is outstanding.  I bought the 77mm size so I can use the cap on any of my cameras.  In fact, I ordered three of them for my 3 cameras.None of the cameras have a 77mm lens, so I used adapter rings to make the caps fit.  What I really like about the white balance lens caps is normally you need both hands on the camera while setting the custom white balance in the camera.  With both hands needed, one to take the shot and one to set the camera custom white balance, there is no extra hand to hold the white balance card in front of the camera, so one has no choice but to lean the card against something to set the white balance.This lens cap sets on the camera, so no extra hand is needed.  It works perfectly.  Just go to the target area and point the camera away from the target towards where the camera is going to be taking the photo.  Take a shot to set the camera custom white balance and you are done.  Then use that custom white balance setting to take the photo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15P9G8XXI7CRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XJH1IY#wasThisHelpful","R15P9G8XXI7CRG","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this scabbard on my Sears 20 inch electric chain saw that I bough at a yard sale.  It had no scabbard with the saw from the yard sale and I ordered this one.  My chain saw is a 20 inch and the scabbard is from an 18 inch to a 22 inch, so I cut two inches from the scabbard for my particular saw. It works perfectly and is very strong.  No weak plastic on this scabbard!  The scabbard is marked for cutting if the 22 inch is not needed.  I am more than satisfied with the quality of the scabbard.  It is very strong and sturdy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210TXSXF7HIS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BOK3PC#wasThisHelpful","R210TXSXF7HIS1","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What do you need a variable ND filter for?  It works great for making water flow during the day when lighting is really bright. It also works great when shooting plants or things up close and you want a small depth of field.  In other words, you want the plant to be in focus, but want the other plants in the photo to be out of focus.  To get this effect, the aperture must be opened, and opening the aperture to the maximum sometimes allows too much light into the camera for the camera to get a properly lit shot.  With this variable ND filter it is easy to open the aperture and slow down the shutter to get that great depth of field we are all looking for.This Fotga Variable ND filter is great!  The best way to use it is to set the camera up in Aperture Priority and watch the camera shutter speed while turning the filter.  Once the shutter speed needed is there, stop turning and take the shot.  The filter does form an X when it is turned too far, and you need to be watching for that in the EVF (viewfinder) or on the LCD.  I have also noticed that zooming in with the filter changes where that X comes into play and it is not nearly as noticeable zoomed in.  The picture quality using the filter is very good as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14OAI1D2LLUT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GFW6EI#wasThisHelpful","R14OAI1D2LLUT9","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this chain saw for cutting trees around the house.  It works perfectly.  I have a 3000 watt generator on a cart,, and pull the cart to areas where I need the chain saw.  I run the saw from the generator and it works perfectly that way.  I am tired of trying to start my gas chain saws with the junk gas that is in use today.  It used to be you could leave the gas in a chain saw for months and all was well when it came time to use it.  That is no longer the case today as the gas will gum up the carburetor and not start.  Then it is an expensive trip to the repair shop to get the saw working again.  That is not the case with this chain saw.  Just pull the generator to the site and you have a working chain saw.  It has as much power as my gas saw, and I like the safety brake the Worx saw has incorporated.  It has 3.5 HP and goes through tree limbs like butter.  I could not be happier with mine.

"I received this bulb and several others from G7 Power in exchange for honest reviews.  The first thing I noticed was how well made these bulbs are.  The quality is fantastic and you can tell from holding and looking at the bulb they are premium bulbs.I have an area in my side yard for my dogs to go and play.  I have a covered area in which I was using a  compact florescent bulb,  It lit the back yard, but just barely and even though it was rated at 100 watts, It was bright, but the light did not reach very far.I replaced that compact florescent bulb with the G7 Power Elko LED 15 (100W) watt bulb.  The first thing I noticed is how much farther and wider the lighting was.  I can see the whole back yard now!  It is also amazing that the G7 only pulls 15 watts!  The area the bulb is being used in is protected from the weather, but the bulb looks like it is sealed and could be used outside without any protection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R101VSXE2IU1IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKE5YAW#wasThisHelpful","R101VSXE2IU1IR","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Neewer 48 Macro LED Ring Flash is outstanding!  It comes with a ton of adapter rings (8 of them) from 49mm to 77mm.  The adapters are plastic, but seem sturdy enough.  I read in several reviews that the 62mm adapter does not work well.  I have a camera that requires a 62mm adapter, so tried the adapter that came with the Neewer  Ring Flash and guess what?  It did not work well.  It was too loose and would not stay in the camera.  I took the adapter off and put my UV filter back on and screwed it into the UV filter and it works fine there.  It was a tight fit and stayed in place.  I have a 62 to 67mm metal adapter so I screwed that adapter into the camera and tried the 67mm adapter that came with the flash and it works great too.  Nice tight fit!There are actually 4 modes with the flash.  Continuous, Flash, Left, and Right.  In the Continuous Mode the light stays on all the time.  In the Flash Mode, the camera will set off the flash.  In the Left or Right Mode the camera also sets off the flash.  I wondered how the camera could set off the flash as I could find no reference to the Flash Mode and how it works in any other review.  The flash foot has a pin, and any camera that has a hot shoe will set off the flash.The flash intensity is adjustable from -1.5 to +1.5.  I found that in taking shots of objects inside, the background behind the object was dark, and that is nice.  It pulls the eyes towards the target and not the background.The flash unit comes with 4 diffusers, but I did not try them yet.  I am more than satisfied with the clear one.  It also comes with a flash shoe for shots with the flash on a tripod or just sitting.To turn it on, just hold the ON/OFF button for a second or so, and it is turned off the same way. The ring flash is not made like a normal flash and will not light an object 10 feet away.  It is made for close up macro work.  It works great outside during the day as a flash fill for taking plant and flower shots.  I would not use the flash for anything more than 3 or 4 feet, especially outside as a fill flash.  It might work well as a portrait flash as the lighting will be well balanced and there will be no shadows.  If shadows are wanted, then I would use the Left or Right bank instead.The Neewer Ring Flash is easy to use.  It does vignette (can see the sides of the flash in the lens) at my camera wide open zoom setting though.  I rarely use the camera at wide open  zoom when taking macro shots, and to get rid of the vignetting I had to zoom to about 1X and it was gone.  I took some shots at wide open and kind of liked the look of the vignetted setting on the lens with the flash. It moves the eyes to the center and I do that in software very often for that same effect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TV1BPBG7GUIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JO64MY6#wasThisHelpful","R1TV1BPBG7GUIC","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This flash diffuser works perfectly on my Metz 54-4 flash.  The color is white and the diffuser works perfectly in softening the harsh flash coming out of the Metz 54-4.

In looking at the photos, it is not obvious at all that a flash was used.

"This white balance filter is great! Just take the lens cap off the camera and in the Custom White Balance Mode on your camera, take a shot for custom white balance for the scene you are shooting. Just take the camera to the target shot area and point it towards the incoming light and take a Custom White Balance shot for a custom white balance. It is easier than using a grey card as two hands are needed to set the custom white balance on some cameras.. One to press the set button and one to hold the camera. With this filter, both hands can be used on the camera and the white balance lens filter is already on the camera. Some people leave the white balance lens filter on the camera all the time, but to me the filter is hard to get off and on, so I just leave it tied to the camera on a string for easy use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MMV1PNDX8FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME9JY52#wasThisHelpful","R39MMV1PNDX8FZ","ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADPKRJ2BSFJ0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This helidroid game is a good sequel to part one, it's more challenging due to very diverse tasks, as different as finding keys in the dark and combat.The levels have very smart and sometimes demanding tasks, and you get a path preview before starting.

" 8:45 Mins In my review video I go into detail about this multicooker, but let me just say that I'm really enjoying it.The multicooker has a variety of built-in cooking options, including rice, boil, bake, brown/sear, slow-cook, and yogurt. You can make rice, yogurt, and oatmeal at the touch of a button, and you can even cook multi-stage recipes, all in one pot. For example, if you were cooking a meat dish, you could set the menu option to brown/saute -- this will allow you to saute your meat -- then you add vegetables and other ingredients and can select another menu setting, such as stew/soup, or bake/roast, or slow cook to finish your recipe, all in one pot.As I mention in the video, the menu beeps are annoying, and you don't have fine-tuned control over the temperature and timer settings, but all in all, this is a quality multicooker. It saves me a lot of time, takes up a lot less room (I've been able to get rid of my crockpot, rice cooker, and yogurt maker), and cleans easily.I'm very happy with this product and I hope this review was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M8V62L75BE4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R2M8V62L75BE4W","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fine cable modem.It supports up to 343Mbps download and 143Mbps upload speeds, though your actual throughput depends on the data plan you have with your Internet provider. The modem also supports DOCSIS 3.0 (high bandwidth data transfer over an existing cable TV network) and has a gigabit ethernet port.In the box you get the modem, an AC adapter, an ethernet cable, and documentation. Note that this product is just a cable modem--you will also need a router/firewall for your home network.Setup was easy--we used Comcast/XFINITY. Here are the steps we followed:1. Plugged in modem between the network access point and the Comcast cable.2. Plugged in modem to power--lights started blinking.3. Waited 2 minutes: opened a browser window on the computer--the browser automatically went to: www.comcast.com/activate.4. Entered Comcast login credentials and followed the wizard steps.5. After 3 minutes, Comcast said, ""Your device is compatible. Activation almost complete"".6. Comcast then said, ""Thanks! Your device is activated.  Please wait as the device is being reset and the latest configuration updates are being applied.  This may take up to 15 minutes.  If you ordered XFINITY High Speed Internet, please open another browser window to start using your service once the device's flashing lights have stabilized. If the XFINITY service is not available in the allotted time, please manually reset the device.""7. Internet started working.One negative: The modem admin page, which is defaulted to 192.168.100.1, allows you to change the password, though you are limited to only 8 characters. Eight characters seems too short in today's security-conscious world.Comparing this modem to other modems I have owned, I noticed a few other limitations:* The modem does not support a ping test, which means you cannot ping from the modem to test network connectivity.* The modem does not support enable/disable of stealth mode.* The modem insists on using DHCP--it does not allow static addressing.So, all in all this cable modem works well, though the manufacturer has taken out a few admin features in order to make the setup ""easy to use"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVK1Z9QDJME49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29YF8#wasThisHelpful","RVK1Z9QDJME49","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:12 Mins Want to know a great way to make an impression the first time you are trying out for a band? Have your guitar strap come off in the middle of a song.Speaking from experience, if you play standing up (guitar or bass) you need strap locks.In my video review I give some details about these Ernie Ball strap locks--how to install them and how to use them. I also detail two features you should be aware of before purchasing:1. They have a ""false lock"" issue -- if you are in a hurry, you might think the strap is locked in place when it actually isn't -- just be sure to give a tug on the strap to make sure,2. They are quite big. While I feel they are very robust, just make sure everything fits into your guitar case. I take my strap off before putting my guitar in my case and everything is fine.So, all in all, I'm quite happy with these strap locks -- they installed easily, they are very easy to use, and when they are locked I don't have to worry about my guitar falling again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EC6QVAOM39H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJQ7W#wasThisHelpful","R2EC6QVAOM39H3","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:12 Mins This is a great LED floodlight system.In my video I go over features of the light, and show it in use at night. Note that because Amazon does not allow embedded royalty-free music, I had to cut out segments showing me setting up the light -- see my full video on my YouTube channel if you'd like to see more detail.Note that this light does not come with a battery/charger -- the company suggests a battery you can purchase that fits perfectly in their included battery pouch that hangs at the base of the inflated pole.Otherwise, this system comes with everything you will need.Setup was very easy and fast -- it took 4-5 pumps to pump up the pole. And everything breaks down and fits into the included rolling case for transportation/storage.Note that this light is directional, as I demonstrate in the video -- it does not provide 360 degrees of illumination. Also note that there is no on/off switch -- connecting the LED terminals to the battery provides light.So I think this is a good solution if you need lots of bright, white light at night (outdoors -- probably not wise to inflate indoors, speaking from experience).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESULS6LB4IS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019QJW2G#wasThisHelpful","R1ESULS6LB4IS9","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I hate checking bags, so it's great that I can carry the guitar onto the plane with me -- it fits in the overhead luggage bin.The feature I like best is being able to plug in headphones and my iPad, so I can jam along with tunes no matter where I am.The guitar has 4 built-in effects -- clean, boost, overdrive, and distortion, powered by 2 AAA batteries.Overall the guitar seems well-built -- it stays in tune and it was playable right out of the box. I will likely change the strings soon though, and may replace the humbucker pickup in the future.I will note that my guitar arrived with abrasion on the metal endcap at the nut of the guitar -- this was the only fit-and-finish issue the guitar had on arrival.I love being able to travel and play guitar at the same time.

"One of the most useful tools you can have in the garage is a good socket set, and this Crescent CSWS12 socket wrench set so far seems to be absolutely great.The fit and finish on the individual pieces are high--everything has a durable chrome finish and there are no rough edges or sharp corners, so the items are ready to use right away. The pieces are also heavy and feel solid in the hand. I haven't found a job around the garage so far that this wrench hasn't been able to handle.The ratchet operates smoothly, and attaching and removing the sockets is easy with the quick-release button. Everything feels solid and well-made.There is one 3"" extender.The sockets are 12 point and so far I've not had even any hints of fastener rounding.One thing to note: This is an SAE only set--if you need Metric, you'll need another set.Also, in the packaging, the sockets are fastened with a heavy piece of plastic. You'll need a cutter to clip off the plastic so you can remove the sockets. But once you do that, the tray all the pieces are affixed to seems like it could be reused, for a bit at least.All in all, I'm very happy with this socket wrench set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV6M5PMI3CPHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXX793G#wasThisHelpful","RV6M5PMI3CPHQ","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this case, but a couple things need to be clarified.First, this product is advertised as a ""soft case"" for all sorts of cameras. However, I wouldn't consider it a soft case--the walls of the case are a semi-rigid plastic covered on the outside and inside by a soft synthetic (non-scratchy) material, with foam lining the inner sides of the case. I say ""semi-rigid"" because there is some give to the case, especially in the middle of the lid, but the case retains its  boxy dimensions (it has rounded corners though!). The case provides a lot more protection and structure than a bag, but is more flexible than a metal or wooden box. Basically this case is just right for protecting your electronic gadgets while on travel.And that brings me to my second point. This product is advertised as being for cameras--but really it's great for any electronic device that can fit into it (outer dimensions are about 8.5 x 3.4 x 6.7 inches). Yes it fits multiple GoPro cameras and accessories, but I've also carried headphones and microphones, and it even perfectly fits two guitar effects pedals! So my main point with this is that you can carry so much more with this case than just cameras.The bottom of the case has a horizontal and vertical web of flexible elastic strips--you can secure your devices by hooking them under the straps. Unlike some other cases with built-in partitions, the webbing gives you a lot of flexibility with the shapes of devices you hook in there. And I'll note that you aren't obligated to use the webbing at all--the entire bottom of the case lifts out via velco.The top of the case has a soft built-in netting/pocket into which you can insert various items. I tend to put heavy gadgets in the bottom and cables in the top.My case is black with orange piping around the zipper. I like this, because the orange helps me easily find the case in a big bag. And I'll also point out that the zipper is a little tight, but seems well-made, so I'm happy with the zipper--I feel confident the case won't accidentally become unzipped while bouncing around on travel.Finally, it comes with a small aluminum carabiner clip, so you can clip your bag onto something if you'd like to--the case comes with a nylon flexible handle that is reinforced with a rubber grip for added strength and comfort.So, if you can't tell by now, I'm very happy with this case-it's especially great for carrying and protecting your electronic gadgets while on travel.I hope this review has been helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N3O3769A0ZEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIDKMOM#wasThisHelpful","R3N3O3769A0ZEJ","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In short, this is a useful vacuum, especially if you confine it to light-duty vacuuming and don't mind a few design annoyances.PRO:* The unit is light in weight, has a very maneuverable head, and is self-standing.* The vacuum is battery-powered, which means you don't have the inconvenience of being tethered to an electric outlet. Just pick it up and use.* The vacuum has a built-in hand vacuum, which comes in handy when vacuuming spot areas above the floor. Note however that you cannot use the floor vacuum part once you have removed the handheld vacuum. Think of this vacuum as a battery-powered handheld vacuum that comes with a floor vacuum shell--you attach the handheld vacuum to the floor vacuum shell when you want to vacuum floors.* The vacuum (I have the Deep Blue one) has a stylish, modern design.* The vacuum does not require vacuum bags.CON:* Emptying the debris cup is a little fiddly. You have to remove the cup from the vacuum, then separate the filter funnel from the debris cup, then empty the debris cup, then scrape off debris from the filter funnel, then put everything back together.* The battery life is shorter than I expected--I usually can only vacuum about three small rooms before the battery dies.* The handle is a little short. If you are taller than about 5' 10"", you'll likely have to stoop to use the vacuum.* Because of the bulbous debris cavity section, you might have difficulty vacuuming under furniture.* The vacuum has a brush roll, but it does not work well with carpet tassels.* The handheld vacuum comes with an attachable extension nozzle, but there is no way to store the nozzle on the vacuum when not in use, which means it is easy to lose and is likely not going to be near you when you actually need to use the handheld vacuum.* The charging brick does not store with the vacuum, which means you must always walk back with the vacuum to wherever you have the charging brick in order to charge the battery.All in all this is a good vacuum, though not perfect. This it is more of a spot vacuum for light duty work rather than a heavy duty vacuum. That said, it is great for wood or non-carpeted floors. It is also very light in weight and very maneuverable. The removable handheld vacuum design is an added bonus. The vacuum works very well for me when I need to quickly do some light-duty vacuuming, saving me the hassle of bringing out and hooking up our main, more powerful vacuum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37OO9OBSUM2N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1P3WNE#wasThisHelpful","R37OO9OBSUM2N9","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this keyboard and case for my iPad Air 2, and it is better than all my previous keyboard cases.1. It has a clamshell design that protects my iPad Air 2 from all sides. Moreover, this design allows me to use my iPad wherever I am and how I am sitting -- previous cases would flop over or collapse if I tried using the case while sitting on the couch or curled up in bed. Since I often use my iPad while not seated at a desk, this design is a winner.I also like the velvet feel of the case--there is a velvetty plastic coating that allows me to grip the case, which is important when carrying the iPad, pulling it out of my bag, etc. Note however that this coating will wear off over time after heavy use, especially along the edges of the case--at least it has on mine.2. The keyboard is very usable. While yes, it is a smaller scale than my MacBook Pro's keyboard, all the keys are in the right position, so I can touch type with ease. Previous keyboards I've used moved certain keys around in order to fit the smaller width of the iPad, which caused much frustration. Since I use my keyboard a lot with my iPad Air 2, having a useful one is a must, and so this keyboard is a winner.3. The case cutouts allow for access to all ports and buttons on the iPad Air, so no problems taking pictures, charging, changing volume, or waking the iPad.4. The lid swivels around, allowing you to convert the case so that the keyboard is hidden completely underneath the iPad. You can also just turn the display to the side, which I've used for example when my wife wants to see what I'm typing. I've liked the swivel feature more than I thought I would. So far the swivel itself has held up well and seems more robust than I thought it would be. The swivel hinge allows me to open the lid to any angle I want, which is so much more convenient than previous cases where you only had up to three angle choices.5. Just as a side note, this case works great with my iPad holder for my music stand, which allows me to use my iPad while playing guitar. I could take the iPad out of the case, of course, but being able to use the case helps protect the case in case the music stand or mic stand gets knocked over while rocking out.So, all in all this is my new favorite keyboard case for my iPad Air 2. I hope you found this review helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHOY25SMTGHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIMXV1U#wasThisHelpful","RZHOY25SMTGHF","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had grown really tired of those shower curtain rings we had that were just metal hooks that sit on top of the shower curtain rod. The hooks did not glide smoothly across the rod, and they kept jumping off the rod now and then, which was annoying. These roller curtain rings solved both of these issues.These rings feel very robust in the hand--I'm pleased with the build quality. Each ring has five metal rollerballs, which ensure that the rings glide smoothly across the shower curtain rod. There are also metal stoppers on the rings that prevent the rollerballs from coming off, so you don't have to worry about that when attaching the rings to the rod.The ring closure stays closed when it is supposed to -- I've had closures in the past would not stay closed after some use. However, these roller rings are easy to open, add to the rod, and then thread through the shower curtain ring holes.I've been using these for a while now and there is no sign of rust or wear.In all, I think these shower curtain rings look stylish, glide along the shower curtain rod very smoothly, and are a simple, quality product that will enhance your shower experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21J1P681DEO4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00017UT6W#wasThisHelpful","R21J1P681DEO4B","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pullups are one of the best exercises you can do, and so having a good pull-up bar is important.There are quite a few things I like about this Ultimate Body Press Ergonomic Joist Mount Bar:* The construction of the pull-up bar is professionally done -- the weld joints are smooth and there are no sharp edges.* I like the thickness of the bar -- it feels good in the hand.* While straight pull-up bars aren't bad, the angled portions of the bar allow for a variety of hand positions for your pull-ups and chin-ups, which allow you to work different muscles in your pull-up chain.* You do have to install this pull-up bar, but the instructions were clear and I had no trouble.* I liked that the bar had long enough risers that I could easily clear my head over the bar when doing a pull-up.* I also have a pair of gymnastics rings, and hanging these from the pull-up bar worked perfectly.* I like how wide the bar is -- you can do wide grip, normal grip, and narrow grip pull-ups.The only thing to be aware of is that the bar is totally smooth -- I've used some pull-up bars with a gritty texture on the angled portions of the bar. I prefer a smooth bar, since the grit feels uncomfortable on my fingers when I am sweaty, but the smooth bar can be slippery then too, so if that bothers you, you could get exercise gloves or lifting chalk.So all in all, this is a quality, heavy-duty pull-up bar and I'm going to get a lot of use out of it.I hope you found this review helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG39MM09IHYKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7QLPJ0#wasThisHelpful","RG39MM09IHYKA","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the Toshiba Satellite S55T-B5150 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop.Before I get into the review, I first wanted to itemize several of the laptop's key technical specifications:* Intel Core i7-4710HQ 3.6 GHz Processor* 12 GB RAM* 256 GB Solid-State Drive* 15.6-Inch Screen, Mobile Intel HD graphics* Windows 8.1* Weight: about 4.75 pounds* Dimensions: 10.2"" x 14.96"" x .93""* 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160) HDMI output* 1 ethernet port* 1 SD card port* 1 headphone jack* 3 USB ports (2 are USB 3.0)* 801.11 AC wirelessThere are several things that I liked about this laptop.The big feature of this laptop is that it has a built-in touchscreen--you get a similar touch performance using this screen as you get from your iPad, though not all touch options on the iPad are available on the Toshiba. But touching the screen now is such an automatic and natural way to interface with a computer that this is a welcome feature for this laptop. This laptop's touch interface is responsive and effective. You can even right-click on the task-bar | Properties | toolbars tab | check ""Touch keyboard"" and use the touch screen and touch keyboard for everything.The large 15.6"" display is clear and works great for watching movies, especially when combined with the built-in Harman Kardon speaker/sound-bar that runs across the width of the laptop, right above the keyboard.The hardware specs are good: i7 3.6GHz CPU, 12GB of RAM, and a 250GB SSD drive.  The laptop boots quickly, and I was able to download and install 108 Windows patches in about 40 minutes--during this time the laptop did not overheat, though the fans did turn on. I could easily touch the back of the laptop (it was sitting on my lap) while the fans were running.The keyboard was pleasant to use and I found the keys very responsive. The keyboard even has a full numeric keypad on the right, which is especially useful for folks balancing their checkbooks.I was able to change the power settings so that it sleeps when the lid is closed, hibernates after a certain sleep period, and powers down when the power button is pressed.  Exactly what I wanted!I like the brushed aluminum finish on some of the surfaces -- the bottom for example is plastic, so don't expect metal everywhere -- but the aluminum additions give stability and robustness to the laptop.There were also some things I found aggravating about the laptop, although I should point out that with some effort I was able to resolve these issues to my satisfaction.The most aggravating issue I had with this laptop was with the touchpad.  I could not figure out how to tweak its settings so that the touchpad worked well, but maybe I am spoiled from using Apple's touchpad. This laptop's touchpad had a rough texture, I found the control over the mouse to be spotty and clunky, and clicking the touchpad required too much pressure. I had also expected the touchpad to be centered in the middle of the laptop, but it is positioned off-center, directly under the spacebar, which is left-shifted because of the added numeric keypad on the right. In the end, I found that the best thing to do was disable the touchpad and attach an external mouse, which was easy to do using the Control Panel.The second aggravating issue was with the backlit keyboard. The laptop defaulted to lighting when touched and then turning off when you remove your hands from the keyboard. But the on/off control was too fast, and so if you work in a low-light situation, you get this weird strobe lighting effect as you work, which is distracting. The only way to keep the backlighting on all the time was by entering BIOS, which is not for the faint-of-heart. Once I fixed the BIOS setting I was pleased with the backlighting.The third aggravation was with the included anti-virus application. Being Windows, having anti-virus software is needed, but the included application has a 30-day trial installed by default, and it pops up asking you to purchase it every time you log in to your computer.  I understand the need for anti-virus protection, considering the amount of downloads and clicky-click that most kids do, but I found the frequent purchase reminders bothersome. I also found it weird that the steps to uninstall McAffee included removing it from the Control Panel | Programs and Features (so far so good) and running a downloaded tool to remove its registry settings (this is an abnormal step).I should also note that Toshiba included applications in addition to the applications that come with Windows. These extra applications include various games, several different online shops, some streaming music apps, a third-party music player, a photo editing tool, and a video editing tool.  The only app they installed which I wanted was Skype.  None of these extra apps were ""bad"" in as much as they were not popping up constant ads or doing anything malicious, but they were definitely targeted at the home market, and I don't really care to have my PC vendor selecting my apps for me.  This is a pet peeve that Toshiba can be forgiven for, since all the PC vendors do it.  I can remove these extra apps using Control Panel | Programs and Features, so it will be fine.The charger brick is not too big and the cable is long, which are nice features. The minor complaint is that you are stuck with having to carry a long cable even if you don't need it -- there is no short cable option for travel. Again, Apple has me spoiled.The laptop comes with Windows 8.1, which can be a mixed bag, depending on what operating systems you are used to using. To me, Windows 8.1 seems like a transitional operating system for Microsoft, as some of the included applications, like the calendar app, are ""in the cloud"" and require you to have a Microsoft account before you can even see a calendar. Other apps, like the alarm, run locally on the machine and can be used right away without any hassle. And there are even two versions of the same app in some cases, which can be confusing. For example, there are two calculator apps--one runs in a window normally, while the other runs full-size--it takes over the entire screen. One version is intended for laptops, and the other for tablets.And of course you can tweak some of the default choices in Windows. For example, if you don't like using the Bing search engine, you can change it by going into Internet Explorer | setting icon | Manage add-ons | Search providers.  I setup Google as my primary search, and also added Yahoo and YouTube as alternatives. As another example, I wanted to be able to find my programs without going through that new bizarre Windows GUI. The steps to adding back the traditional Windows Start Button to Windows 8 can be found online.There is an Office365 link off the Program menu. Office365 is like Google Docs in that it's an online office application suite. When I click the link, I get three options:  try, buy, and activate. My preference is to download and use Libre Office instead.And finally, note that this laptop does not come with a DVD drive.In summary, all things considered, I would say that if you can get this this discounted from the laptop's $999 list price, and if you need a Windows laptop, the laptop's large display with touchscreen support, fast SSD drive and CPU, 12GB RAM, and usable keyboard make this Toshiba Satellite S55T-B5150 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop a solid choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWDK3GMY8ASX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REWQS8U#wasThisHelpful","R2CWDK3GMY8ASX","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:52 Mins These Rabbit Freezable Whiskey Glasses aim to allow you to enjoy a chilled beverage without having to use ice, which would then melt and dilute your drink.In the box you get two eight-ounce glasses.The idea is that you put the glasses in your freezer until the chilling liquid freezes. When you pour in your favorite beverage, the chilling liquid helps keep your drink cool without having to deal with melting ice. The silicone coating on the base of the glass helps keep your fingers from getting cold.In the video I show details about the glasses, demonstrate their use, and point out pluses and minuses.After using these glasses for a bit,On the positive side:1.) Your drink does stay cool and you don't have to worry about ice melt.2.) The silicone base is cool to the touch, but your fingers don't get cold.On the negative side:1.) When you put the glasses into the freezer, you are instructed to place them upside down. The instructions say it only takes an hour for them to freeze, but I found this not to be the case. I'd give the glasses a couple of hours before they are ready.2.) That said, one of my glasses would never freeze! Even after leaving the glass in the freezer for a week, the chilling liquid never froze. So there seems to be some quality control issues going on.3.) The instructions say that the silicone base acts as an insulation and coaster, preventing condensation from running down the sides of the glass onto your table. My glass had lots of condensation running down it and I would definitely still need a separate coaster before I set this on a nice table. The silicone only seems to prevent you from getting frosty fingers.4.) The product ad copy says the glass will instantly chill your beverage to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. While my drink was cool, it was not 22 degrees below freezing. In other words, if you pour water into your glass, it won't instantly become a block of ice.So, all in all this is a great idea for a product, though its execution is slightly less than perfect. That said, I'll continue to use and enjoy these glasses.Cheers, and I hope this review has been helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W21K3CVX4X93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M72R7QY#wasThisHelpful","R2W21K3CVX4X93","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are at least tangentially involved in processing, analyzing, and learning from data, then you are probably familiar with the free statistical programming language and software environment known as R. But R can do a lot more than plot data and perform hypothesis tests--the new book Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R, Second Edition, by Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, and Andrew Robinson, is your guide for using R to tackle problems in computational statistics, simulation, optimization, operations research, and scientific programming.The book is divided into four parts. Part One covers programming--the basics of writing your own functions and algorithms with R. Part Two covers using the programming concepts from Part One to solve problems like root-finding and numerical integration. Part Three covers the basics of probability, distributions, and discrete and continuous random variables. Part Four covers stochastic modeling and simulation.Here are the chapter titles:1: Setting Up2: R as a Calculating Environment3: Basic Programming4: I/O: Input and Output5: Programming with Functions6: Sophisticated Data Structures7: Better Graphics8: Pointers to Further Programming Techniques9: Numerical Accuracy and Program Efficiency10: Root-Finding11: Numerical Integration12: Optimisation13: Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations14: Probability15: Random Variables16: Discrete Random Variables17: Continuous Random Variables18: Parameter Estimation19: Markov Chains20: Simulation21: Monte Carlo Integration22: Variance Reduction23: Case Studies24: Student ProjectsThis book covers a lot of ground, but it does so in enough depth to provide a good grounding in the topics covered. Also, end of chapter exercises provide opportunities for further study and exploration, and an R package is available that contains most of the code and data used in the book.I really like that this book focuses on teaching you not only how to program, but also how to think algorithmically and numerically to solve problems. R is a very powerful language, but some books just show you how to use R's built-in functions--functions that are already created and available for you. This book however goes beyond and teaches you how to use R to create your own tools, which allows you to solve much more complex and interesting problems.This book assumes calculus knowledge, but no prior knowledge of programming or probability is really necessary.So all in all I really like this book and I think it is a great introduction to scientific programming, simulation, and modeling in R--skills that are extremely valuable in our increasingly digital and data-driven world!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33LHBAR8A44M0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466569999#wasThisHelpful","R33LHBAR8A44M0","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:41 MinsFinally, I've found a stylish way to store my shoes.OK, you do have to do a little work first though--the cabinet comes unassembled. If you are familiar with Ikea furniture, then you know what to expect. If you don't know what to expect, then be sure to watch my video--I show what comes in the box and I walk you through the steps in assembling the cabinet. It took me about an hour and 15 minutes to put it together by myself, though it would be easier with two people and would probably be faster as well.In all, this is a solid and modern piece of furniture that will keep my shoes stored out of the way and protected from pets and dust. The only trouble was that my wife now wants one for her shoes.So if you don't mind putting in a little time and effort in putting all the pieces together--everything is well labeled, though the instructions are a little sparse--and if you don't mind possibly having to buy a second one for your spouse, then I think you'll like this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CA6EZ70XLMGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF78HCQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CA6EZ70XLMGC","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:14 MinsA great pair of utility shears is hard to beat.This pair from Scotts has a lot to like.The handles are bright green and are made from 70% recycled content. The blades are serrated and are bonded with titanium, making them stay sharper longer. Moreover, the blades also separate to allow for easy cleaning.In the hand they feel very comfortable and sturdy.In use they work very well, and can easily cut through small garden leaves and branches. I also like to use them inside the house to open up boxes and other packages.Though it makes the shears no less useful, I should point out that while the shears are advertised as coming with a nylon sheath, my shears did not come with a sheath.In the video I show how easy it is to separate the blades, among other things.So all in all, this is a great pair of garden and utility shears.

"With the explosion of the amount of data available, the need for stronger data analysis tools than Excel has grown. Fortunately one of the best data analysis tools, R, is also free. This book, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses using R, Third Edition, by Torsten Hothorn and Brian Everitt, provides a handy primer for using R to perform standard statistical data analysis.As suggested by the title, the book is not meant to teach you data analysis. Rather, it is a *handbook* of methods of data analysis using R. After an introductory chapter for those completely unfamiliar with R, each chapter focuses on applying a specific statistical technique to data using R.Each chapter has a similar structure, and the teaching method uses a data-first approach. The Analysis of Variance chapter, for example, begins with a sample dataset and a short case study to give context. A brief summary of the analysis of variance statistical technique is given, followed by the commands for how to perform analysis of variance in R using the case study data. For each R command, expected outputs are given so that you can verify what you are doing if you are following along on your own computer. A summary of the analysis findings are given (i.e., how to interpret the data), along with final comments.

It's not meant to teach you statistics, so it's best if you are already familiar with statistical data analysis approaches. You don't have to be an expert though--the short theory section for each statistical method covered in the book gives you the main points, and you can learn main concepts by working through the case study and seeing the R commands used in the context of the given case study problem. Note however that there is a lot more to R than is covered in this book, so don't expect this to be a comprehensive book on how to use R.So, students, analysts, professors, and scientists: if you are looking to add R to your toolkit for analyzing data statistically, then this book will get you there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HHOJKMJQOD2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482204584#wasThisHelpful","R3HHOJKMJQOD2W","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:52 Mins These Rabbit Freezable Whiskey Glasses aim to allow you to enjoy a chilled beverage without having to use ice, which would then melt and dilute your drink.In the box you get two eight-ounce glasses.The idea is that you put the glasses in your freezer until the chilling liquid freezes. When you pour in your favorite beverage, the chilling liquid helps keep your drink cool without having to deal with melting ice. The silicone coating on the base of the glass helps keep your fingers from getting cold.In the video I show details about the glasses, demonstrate their use, and point out pluses and minuses.After using these glasses for a bit,On the positive side:1.) Your drink does stay cool and you don't have to worry about ice melt.2.) The silicone base is cool to the touch, but your fingers don't get cold.On the negative side:1.) When you put the glasses into the freezer, you are instructed to place them upside down. The instructions say it only takes an hour for them to freeze, but I found this not to be the case. I'd give the glasses a couple of hours before they are ready.2.) That said, one of my glasses would never freeze! Even after leaving the glass in the freezer for a week, the chilling liquid never froze. So there seems to be some quality control issues going on.3.) The instructions say that the silicone base acts as an insulation and coaster, preventing condensation from running down the sides of the glass onto your table. My glass had lots of condensation running down it and I would definitely still need a separate coaster before I set this on a nice table. The silicone only seems to prevent you from getting frosty fingers.4.) The product ad copy says the glass will instantly chill your beverage to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. While my drink was cool, it was not 22 degrees below freezing. In other words, if you pour water into your glass, it won't instantly become a block of ice.So, all in all this is a great idea for a product, though its execution is slightly less than perfect. That said, I'll continue to use and enjoy these glasses.Cheers, and I hope this review has been helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJII8XUQ29T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KH5VND6#wasThisHelpful","R1XJII8XUQ29T4","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need help deciphering your vehicle's ""Check Engine Light"" or keeping tabs on your vehicle's health and performance, you may want to check out Innova's Quicklink OBD2 vehicle diagnostic tool.Here's the basic idea: The Quicklink hooks up to your vehicle's OBD (on-board diagnostics) port, and the free quicklink app on your mobile device links to the quicklink device via bluetooth and displays performance and diagnostic information from your vehicle's computer.The app shows diagnostic reports if it detects something wrong with your vehicle. It also shows realtime visual feedback of certain performance characteristics, such as engine RPM, Torque, miles per gallon, etc.HOWEVER, you should be aware of a few things before using the device:1.) You have to create an account on the company's website and you must create a profile for your car--including providing your car's VIN before you can check your car's performance--this requires Internet access.2.) You are provided a basic diagnostic report for free, and the company provides a more detailed report for a fee.3.) You do not need Internet access (after creating the account and creating your car's profile as in 1.) to get realtime performance statistics.4.) Compared to mobile app performance and interfaces you might be used to on your iOS or Android devices, the Innova software can feel rather clunky. Moreover, the software crashed multiple times when I was using it. It was frustrating to use.All in all, the Innova Quicklink is an OK way for vehicle owners to monitor for themselves the health and performance of their vehicles. Until car makers make better car interfaces, the Quicklink seems a reasonable way to go, though improving the software would really help the user's experience and satisfaction with the device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131OTNYSKOJKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH1IFRA#wasThisHelpful","R131OTNYSKOJKF","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:55 MinsWhen the stuff hits the fan, whether that's a simple power outage or a full-out zombie apocalypse, having a rechargeable radio is critical for receiving timely and relevant information. The Eton All-Purpose Weather Alert Radio is a rugged emergency radio that provides a lot of features useful in an emergency.In the video I step through the radio's features, which include:* Three radio bands: NOAA Wather Broadcasts, FM, and AM* LED flashlight and emergency beacon* 5V 1A USB port for charging your cell phone* Four ways to charge the 1000 mAh Lithium battery:1.) 3 AAA batteries2.) Solar panel (charges in about 5-6 hours)3.) Micro-USB port (charges in a couple of hours)4.) Hand crank (cranking for 4 minutes gives about 1 minute of talk time or 10-15 minutes of radio time)The radio even has a weatherband alert feature -- if the alert is set, the radio audio will activate when a NOAA alert is issued.Those are a lot of features in one emergency radio! The radio is rugged, lightweight, and will definitely come in handy during an emergency--it's a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OIXASHDMAU84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H02C9TG#wasThisHelpful","R1OIXASHDMAU84","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:26 MinsIf you want to help protect your new tablet, one way is to apply a screen protector--a clear, removable film applied to your tablet's glass display to help protect it from fingerprints, smudges, and light scratches. But not all screen protectors are created equal--some interfere with the touchscreen interface, some leave bubbles of air between the film and the glass, and some are not meant to be reapplied multiple times. So today I want to take a look at the iVisor XT No-Bubble Screen Protector for the Kindle Fire HD.I go into more detail in the video, including how to modify the visor for use with the Kindle Fire HDX in case you accidentally bought the wrong version, but in summary, I found that with this screen protector:* I was able to apply the protector to my Kindle with no air bubbles* The touch interface on my Kindle worked just as smoothly with the screen protector as without* I was able to remove the screen protector and reapply it as often as I needed.I feel like my Kindle is a little safer and healthier while wearing this protector!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNTVM5S1APZJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ9SJLS#wasThisHelpful","RNTVM5S1APZJ8","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overwhelmed with the number of cables, adapters, and chargers that you must haul around to keep all your cell phones, tablets, and other devices happy and healthy? If you have Apple devices, you know you must carry along cables and chargers that only work with Apple products. The latest Apple mobile devices use the Lightning adapter, something proprietary to Apple. So if you want an alternate way to charge and sync your Apple products, or if you want to eliminate having to carry around cables and chargers just for your Apple devices, then you might be interested in the AmazonBasics Lightning Compatible to Micro USB Adapter.As you can see, it's a really tiny adapter, with a male Lightning interface on one end, and a female micro USB interface on the other end.Using it is very simple: plug in your micro USB cable that you use to connect to all your non-Apple devices, and you can now use that same cable also with your Apple products (at least the ones with the Lightning port).I use it with my iPad Air so I don't have to also carry around my Lightning USB cable along with the micro USB cable I need for my other non-Apple devices. Using this adapter and micro USB cable I can sync and charge my iPad Air with no problem. I'm also relieved having an alternate way to interface to my iPad Air--I've got lots of micro USB cables, but only one Lightning USB cable.For what it is, this adapter seems a little pricey, but it does what it's supposed to do--convert a micro USB cable into a Lightning USB cable. Because it helps eliminate cable clutter and makes syncing/charging my Apple devices easier, the adapter now goes everywhere I go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8MG0TR5XQOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNCUX8G#wasThisHelpful","R8MG0TR5XQOT","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a stylish, portable USB mic with great sound quality, you might want to consider the Samson Meteor Mic.The Samson Meteor Mic is a USB condenser microphone with a large diaphragm and a cardioid pickup pattern.It also has a relatively flat frequency response, which is good, but only records CD quality audio, which could be better. However, for the price, the audio quality you get is great.Also, I love the look of the mic's retro design.With its leg's extended, the mic stands about 6 inches tall, and the mic's body is metal with a chrome finish.Especially because the mic can stand by itself, and due to its smart design, this mic is very portable, and it's is now my goto travel usb mic.  When not in use, the mic's legs fold up and fit with its included USB cable into the included carry pouch.On the back of the mic there is a USB port and an 1/8"" headphone jack. To connect the mic to your computer, simply attach the USB cable between your computer and your mic. No install CDs or drivers were needed to connect the mic to my MacBook air.Once your mic is connected, you'll see a blue indicator LED. You can turn the ring to adjust the volume level of your monitor headphones, and pressing the button in the middle of the ring mutes the microphone, turning the LED amber. When the input sound is clipping, the LED light will flash red.Installation on my MacBook Air was trivial -- I plugged in the mic and was able to select the mic in my recording software, GarageBand.In summary, I think the Samson Meteor Mic is a stylish, portable, and durable mic that's great for your audio needs, whether you are recording instruments, voiceovers, or podcasts, or just want to sound crisp and clear on your conference calls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78URTJZJVWHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MF39YS#wasThisHelpful","R78URTJZJVWHJ","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:28 MinsSometimes you need a pot of coffee, and so I wanted to take a look at the BELLA Dots Collection Programmable Coffee Maker.In the box you get the coffee maker itself -- note that they come in happy colors, so you can match your kitchen decor, or maybe even your iPhone. There is also a 12-cup glass carafe, a measuring spoon, and this is a wonderful idea -- a permanent coffee filter, a removable filter basket, and an instruction manual.The controls are fairly intuitive, though note that the Start button acts as power. You can select between three different coffee brewing strengths, and of course you can program the coffee maker to brew coffee at a future time, or right away.The unit also as a deep-clean feature and an autoshutoff of the hotplate after 2 hours.Making coffee is straightforward--fill reservoir with water, put the filter into the basket, put coffee into the filter, select your brewing strength, and push start.If I had to complain about anything, I'd say that because it takes about 10 minutes to brew a full pot of coffee, I'd sure like a beep or something to let me know when it's done.That nitpick is counterbalanced though by the fact that after there about two cups of coffee have been brewed, you can pull the carafe out, pour yourself some coffee, and put the carafe back to finish brewing the rest of the pot.That's a winner in my book.In the video review you can see the coffee maker and how to use it in more detail.Thanks for reading and watching!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AJA4UXZI4B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ9XHSO#wasThisHelpful","R1AJA4UXZI4B2","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always wanted to learn to play the drums, but grew frustrated with my early efforts--toy drums and rockband-type video games just aren't the real thing. But while I don't have the space in my home for an entire analog drum kit, I decided on this Alesis electronic drum set and have been very happy with it.The kit was easy to put together, and contains a rack to hold all the equipment, 3 toms, 1 snare, 1 kick drum, 3 cymbals, a foot control for the high-hat, wire ties to keep your cabling neat, 1 pair of practice drum sticks, and the electronic control center. I was surprised at the high quality of the components. The only thing you need to add is a stool to sit on and either speakers or headphones so you can hear what you are playing.You use the electronic control center to select from the many included drum kit sounds, or you can model your own drum kit and save your settings. You can play along with included rhythms and record your own playing. I also found the metronome very useful while learning.In the first episode of the new show The Tim Ferriss Experiment, Tim tried to conquer learning to play rock and roll drums, and at the end of the episode he actually got to play with the rock group Foreigner on stage for a song. I might not ever get to play on stage with Foreigner, but I know I'm going to have fun playing drums on this electronic drum set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLJHFVRSTBAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3W27GA#wasThisHelpful","R2WLJHFVRSTBAS","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:11 MinsLet's take a look at the tablet that many say gives you the most bang for the buck, the Kindle Fire HDX 7‚Ä≥.Here's what's in the box:* Kindle Fire HDX 7‚Ä≥ tablet computer* Micro USB charging cable* AC adapter* Quick-start guideMy Kindle powered up right away out of the box, and after entering password information for my firewall and a few other simple admin steps, I was online and ready to go.In fact, the Kindle Fire HDX immediately populated the Books, Videos, and Music tabs with items I had previously purchased on Amazon. All I had to do was tap the icon for the James Bond: The Authorised Biography, by John Pearson, or the album cover for the new Black Sabbath album 13 and, after a brief download, I was reading and rocking, respectively.Aside from the ease of getting online and using the device without a lot of hassle, I enjoyed several welcome features:* The Kindle felt good in the hand: the dimensions of the unit are 7.3‚Ä≥ x 5.0‚Ä≥ x .35‚Ä≥, and at 303 grams in weight (lighter than the Apple iPad Mini 2), it was easy for me to hold with one hand.*  The display was absolutely brilliant: at 1920◊1200 pixels, the 7‚Ä≥ screen clocks in at 323 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), which is up there with the best of the tablets. The text was crisp, the images gorgeous, and the videos seamless. As a writer and Computer Scientist, I'm accutely aware of technology getting in the way of what John Gardner calls the ""vivid and continuous dream"" enjoyed when immersed in a compelling story. This display, along with the quad-core CPU and user inteface supplied by the Kindle Fire OS 3.0 ""Mojito"", does not get in the way of what you are reading or seeing.* After a couple days use, I'm still using the device as I got it right from the box. The rated battery life is 11 hours of mixed use, and 17 hours when reading.* The dual Dolby audio stereo speakers crank out adequate volume, though the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack helps me really tune out the world when I'm listening to an audio book or movie or Black Sabbath.* The front-facing camera and built-in microphone are useful especially for Skype calls.* The unit's Bluetooth support and video streaming capabilities are helping me get in shape, since I can watch movies and crank the volume with an external Bluetooth speaker when running on a treadmill.* The unit came with lots of built-in apps that allowed me to be productive and entertained right out of the box, with more available on Amazon.Note that I haven't yet used the Mayday button, which is supposed to connect you, if you need help, to an Amazon expert 24√ó7, but it's a nice feature to have in my back pocket.Also, I was already a Prime member, which gives me free 2-day shipping when shopping on Amazon, the ability to stream or download Prime Instant videos, and a free ebook a month, so the 30 days of free Prime membership with the purchase of the Kindle Fire HDX was lost on me, but I did start downloading some movies so that I can watch them offline for on an upcoming trip--being able to tune out your surroundings by diving into a movie is wonderful when stuck in those cramped airline seats.My video shows the unboxing and the Kindle Fire HDX in action.So to me, this tablet provides a big bang for your buck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLH44T102XLXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRY250U#wasThisHelpful","RLH44T102XLXE","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:45 MinsIf you have the new iPad Air, you know what a great device it is, from a solid and diverse app ecosystem and fast performance to a physical design that gets just about everything right.But there are two things that can make the iPad Air even more useful--a protective case and an external keyboard. The Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio combines a protective case and keyboard into one product, and just might be the best accessory you can buy for your iPad Air.The Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio for iPad Air comes with the Folio itself as well as a USB charging cable.After using this Folio extensively with my iPad Air, here's what I like:* The Folio is lightweight. The iPad Air and the Folio weigh 2 pounds, about a pound less than my MacBook Air laptop.* I appreciate the long battery life of the keyboard--you can use the Folio for about 3 months on just one charge. The Folio is also easy to charge using the included USB cable.* Quality: The Folio feels solid and durable in the hand, and the keyboard is a pleasure to type on. The Folio holds the iPad securely, yet also allows the iPad Air to easily be removed when needed.* Bluetooth pairing: Easily pairs the keyboard with the iPad Air--no extra cables or connectors needed.* Magnets: The magnets in the Folio keep the cover closed when the iPad Air is not in use, and also keeps the tablet in a secure, upright position when using the Folio as a tablet stand.* The Folio folds so that you can use the iPad Air without the Folio keyboard, if you want to.There were two minor annoyances with the Folio however:* The number keys are smaller than the letter keys, which means some of the numbers will not be in familiar positions for touch-typists. The ""1"" key is fully to the right of the ""Q"" key on the Folio, whereas it is to the left of the ""Q"" key on my MacBook Air laptop. This means I consistently munge typing some of the numbers.* The Folio sometimes does not turn off the Ipad Air when the cover is closed--you have to manually put the iPad Air to sleep. Auto-wakeup is also not consistent.In the video I go into more detail about the Folio.Though there are a couple annoyances with this Folio, I think this case is one of the best I've seen for any tablet. In fact, I view it more as a natural extension to my iPad Air rather than a separate accessory. The Folio allows me to be more productive with my iPad Air, and when my tablet is in the Folio, I don't worry about it being damaged.You can't lose by pairing the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio with your iPad Air.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6PU3EHKURQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2KJDXA#wasThisHelpful","RY6PU3EHKURQL","A2L6K9PEUA7BHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6K9PEUA7BHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Edward Young was the wartime commander of HMS Storm - a British S Type Submarine. Speaking as one who has visited one of that vessel's many sister ships (HMS Stubborn - deliberately sunk off Malta in 1946 as an Asdic target), I know a little (albeit very little) of the excitement these ships are able to generate. This book vividly brings to life the work and experiences of those who took part in WW2 in such craft and it is the very combination of that war, that type of submarine and the daily events of routine, danger, deprivation and even fun, which is something at which we who enjoy the freedom for which they fought can only marvel.This is a well written book which tells a story. Though centred on the wartime life of the author, it is not a book which is just about him and his ship. It is about the people and the events which he encountered along the way. Theirs is a story which forms part, perhaps only a small part, of the huge jigsaw which was World War Two. Nevertheless, their contribution still remains a vital part of the overall war effort made all the more interesting by the way in which it is told.At over 300 pages of well written dialogue with the addition of just the right amount of photographic plates and maps, this book represents real value for money and reads better than any novel.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2JDESMP0V98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011820URG#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2JDESMP0V98","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first learned to dive in the mid-1970s and within 4 years had amassed some of the top qualifications any British diver might aspire to achieve. Now, after more than 30 years of active diving at the sharp end, I have had to admit that, in my case, ordinary scuba diving techniques are no longer enough. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those skills are fine for the vast majority of divers and have served me well for over 30 years. For anyone who wishes to progress to even longer and much deeper objectives, however, technical diving is the next logical step forward. And, if you are now at the stage where you are simply thinking about it, you could do a lot worse than reading this book before making up you mind.Kevin Gurr is a diver whose reputation in the field of technical diving precedes him. That, however, meant that, in reviewing this book, I set out to be extremely critical. In other words, it was because of his reputation that I automatically expected far more from any book written by him than I would have accepted from others with a lesser reputation. I found nothing lacking in this work and there is nothing which will disappoint the reader.I would have liked to list the chapter headings in order to give the reader a feel for the different areas of the overall subject covered but I cannot do so because there are far too many such headings and the coverage is complete. Which is great - because it helps me to go to exactly the right part of the book I need to study at any one time. Of course, my own conversion to technical diver is of no interest to anyone else, except that I am a diver of considerable experience who understands the subject - if not all the new techniques (yet!). This product is a valuable addition to my own further training and has helped me through a considerable learning curve. Furthermore, I have yet to raise any question which is not answered by this book.In short, if you are thinking about taking up scuba diving, this is ‚Äúnot‚Äù the book for you. If, however, you are seriously thinking about extending your existing diving skills to technical diving, this book will probably be the best investment you could make. At first sight, it may appear expensive, but when one considers the wealth of information contained within, I think it will come to be regarded - over many years, as probably the best item of technical diving equipment you ever purchased.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22C8AU14YWEUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MCEA2S#wasThisHelpful","R22C8AU14YWEUA","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Battleship ‚ÄúWarspite‚Äù was one of 5 ships of the Queen Elizabeth class and went on to serve with great distinction in World War 1 (including the Battle of Jutland) and World War 2 before finally being scrapped in 1947. Today, almost 60 years after she fired her last shot in anger (10 September 1944 off Le Havre), there are those who will remember serving on this magnificent ship and others who are interested in every facet of her history as well as her construction and technical detail. This is an excellent book for all such enthusiasts.Conway Maritime Press are well known for their ‚ÄúAnatomy of the Ship‚Äù series in which they provide the finest technical documentation for specific ships or ship types ever published. ‚ÄúThe Battleship Warspite‚Äù is hard-back measuring 10º‚Äù (wide) x 9¬æ‚Äù with 120 pages of detailed and factual information. The wide format allows the publishers to produce first class detailed line drawings of every aspect of this ship in a size that is easy to see and follow. All the information is there - right down to the last nut and bolt.Commencing with a potted history of the Queen Elizabeth class, we then have a career summary of the Warspite before coming on to a series of ‚ÄúTables‚Äù which provide us with the technical details of construction, general arrangements, hull structure, protection, machinery, comparisons, armament, fire control, aircraft and so on. Next is 22 pages of historic photographs followed by 80 pages of detailed line drawings and technical information.And detailed it is too; Under just one main heading ‚ÄúGeneral arrangements‚Äù we have drawing after drawing showing every aspect of this ship in cross section - deck by deck and room by room, from aft to bows. Then everything is repeated from above as we work our way down through every level of the ship from the highest part of the superstructure to the keel. These are followed with more specific technical information under such headings as hull construction, machinery, accommodation, superstructure, rig, armament, fire control, fittings, disruptive camouflage, ground tackle, boats and finally aircraft arrangements.The inclusion of even the humble Signal Locker (that box comprising almost 100 small ‚Äúpigeon-holes‚Äù in which the different signal flags were kept) gives an indication of the attention to detail put into this book and, once again, I congratulate both the author and publishers for a job well done.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6VTQ12J6SDMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EV4302#wasThisHelpful","R6VTQ12J6SDMZ","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of any non-fiction work is usually an indication of the content making ‚ÄúTop Dive Sites of the World‚Äù a very big statement indeed. Of course, any personal selection is always subjective - my list will be different from yours and neither of us is either right or wrong - it is simply a matter of personal choice and or own experiences. Nevertheless, the content must always live up to the title.This book is divided into 7 general areas of the World in the following order; Caribbean, Atlantic, Mediterranean, Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Indo-Pacific and Pacific. Just as soon as we enter the Caribbean, however, we find one of the world's most outstanding diving destinations is not included at all. Not only is Belize (home of the world's second largest Barrier Reef ‚Äòand‚Äô the Great Blue Hole) not even mentioned, the country itself does not even appear on the map! The Atlantic Ocean is reduced to Scapa Flow and the Canary Islands which, to all serious divers, is akin to reducing the complete works of Jacques Cousteau to one sheet of A4 in large print! The Mediterranean is confined to Sardinia - with that most excellent diving destination Malta also excluded from the map.Whereas the Red Sea does (very predictably!) includes mention of the Thistlegorm (and whole books have been written about that particular wreck!) details are far too sparse. Sadly, the Rosalie Moller, which many experienced divers regard as a far better wreck, is another which is overlooked ‚Äì although, by now, we have begun to get used to such disappointments.Little purpose is served in continuing to stress what is missing from the remainder of the book except to say too many of the world's acknowledged ‚ÄúTop‚Äù dive sites and destinations are excluded and all divers who study the content will begin to challenge that title. Perhaps ‚ÄúMy favourite dives from around the World‚Äù would have been more honest.In addition the text which is included reduces each subject to such bare bones a qualified anthropologist would be hard-pressed to determine the species. As an example, the section on Scapa Flow reveals nothing whatsoever about any specific shipwreck - and those wrecks are the ONLY reason why divers go there! Instead we find a very brief overview - just as we find a very brief everything else.In summary, therefore, a good book for those who like to look at pretty pictures but a work devoid of serious research and lacking vital information.NM","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PV3RP3TCDJKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SB509K2#wasThisHelpful","R1PV3RP3TCDJKR","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a regrettable fact that almost none of the ships from the early to mid 20th Century have been preserved. Apart from a few notable exceptions, from the mightiest Cruise Liners to the lowliest Tramp Steamers, they are all gone forever. Roger Jordan's work is, therefore, a valuable source of reference into those ships that were operating as part of the world's merchant fleets at the outbreak of WW2 and it is fascinating to see how each vessel fared. A scholarly piece of work, this book will become the definitive work on this subject.This is a hardback book measuring approx. 12‚Äù x 8¬Ω‚Äù containing some 630 pages of detail and information. Beginning with notes explaining the many abbreviations used - including 6¬Ω pages dedicated to the shipbuilders, we then find individual ships listed by country and shipping company in alphabetical order.Over 6,000 ships are described with brief details of; Name, type of machinery, number of screws, passenger-carrying capability, year built, name of builder(s), tonnage and dimensions. Then we come to the section marked ‚ÄúLosses‚Äù - with separate lists for losses through; Marine hazard, war causes, Spanish civil war, vessels scuttled, vessels scuttled post-war with surplus war materials, vessels lost post-war due to mines and those that underwent name-changes. Finally, there is the ever-important index - a straightforward list of all the ships within the book and a reference to the pages where each may be found.With every second or third page containing a small selection of good quality b&w photographs of some of these historic vessels - and in many cases a particularly interesting biography of the ship in question, it is easy to see why this book should be regarded as a comprehensive and definitive work by Roger Jordan and Chatham Publishing. I congratulate them on a job well done.Whilst I did find one small error (picky, picky) - again the Rosalie Moller (my favourite Red Sea dive) is listed as raised and broken up after the war, this I can forgive because this error has already appeared in previous authoritative books. Does make me wonder which ship was actually raised though (Sarah H?).NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Q1D9CGCTPU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKYQTAM#wasThisHelpful","R5Q1D9CGCTPU4","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During WW2, this author completed every single war patrol aboard the German submarine U 505. Towards the end of the war it was the author himself - as a very junior crewman, who had the final task of trying to sink his U Boat after it had been forced to the surface by enemy fire. It was a gallant attempt that was thwarted only by an equally gallant American Navy which finally captured the submarine intact - complete with all its operational codes.In 1954, Han Goebeler read an article which informed him his beloved U Boat was now part of an exhibition in Chicago and promptly moved with his wife to be near the machine that once meant so much to him. It wasn't long before he would be found giving personal talks to visitors. Over the years he also brought former adversaries together in reunions.This book is his story. From those early beginnings in the Kriegsmarine until his death in 1999, he recalls just about everything that ever happened to him. He was not a Nazi, nor was he a demon or monster - just an ordinary man who was called upon to serve his country and did what any of us would do - he served. It is a moving story in which the reader will soon become gripped by the reality of life - and death!, on board a German U Boat at time of war - although there is much more to it than just that.Rest in Peace Hans Goebeler - you earned it.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13W0QDYIPR4MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DB90PU#wasThisHelpful","R13W0QDYIPR4MW","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My work as a shipwreck historian involves research into a wide variety of different craft and is usually based on the existence of a particular shipwreck. As such, there is no detail from any vessel which is beyond my interest - no matter how insignificant. Along the way, I have obtained a number of books from Osprey Publishing which contain some pretty amazing artwork. These include profile and deck views of all manner of ships plus the occasional technically excellent exploded-view. In many ways, this work might be described as the best of that artwork collated into a single book.Measuring only 7Ω in. wide (190 x 130 mm), the work is a quick reference guide to many of the world‚Äôs greatest warships from ancient times to the latest US Aircraft Carriers. That, however, brings into question the book‚Äôs title - which should have been ‚ÄòWarship Spotter‚Äôs Guide!‚ÄôNevertheless, this is one of the most useful additions to my bookshelf for some time. 40 types of warship are included and, without mentioning every ship, are collated in the following date order; Egyptian War Galley and Athenian Trireme, Norse Longship, Warships of the Far East, Tudor Warships, Spanish Galleon, Warships of the Anglo-Dutch War, Pirate Ships, Warships of the War of Independence, Napoleonic Ship-of-the-line, Ironclads, Union Monitors, River Gunboats, Commerce Raiders, British Dreadnoughts, German Dreadnoughts, Super Dreadnoughts, Austro-Hungarian Battleships, Destroyers and Submarines. We then arrive at the time of WW2 and find a useful cross-section of American, British, German, Italian and Japanese battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines. The work then concludes with; Vietnam Riverine Craft, American Cold-War Carriers, Nuclear Submarines and American Modern Super-Carriers.Whereas the content for each vessel - selected as being representative of its ‚Äòtype,‚Äô is brief, the detail is, nevertheless, informative. This comprises a one-page introduction and brief history which explains when and where the ship in question came into being in addition to the political machinations of the day. On the facing page we find the technical specifications alongside the artistic view of the entire ship - with cutaway section or sections showing internal features. And all that for GBP ¬£4:99 (RRP) - now that must be a bargain!Whereas the accomplished expert might gain little from the work, I suspect few people know all there is to know about every type of ship mentioned in this book and most will find something of considerable interest. Alternatively, it will also provide an excellent present for those who are beginning to show an early interest in  the subject of warships throughout history.NM","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MC0PA0LYPA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147280869X#wasThisHelpful","R11MC0PA0LYPA6","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My current studies include all aspects of Malta‚Äôs history as part of a lengthy research project. I am, therefore, studying a great deal of material - especially in connection with both world wars. Malta gained strategic imnportance because of her unique position of being isolated in the central Mediterranean. During WW2 her aircraft were able to inflict great damage on Rommel‚Äôs maritime supply lines - a situation which would have drastically changed had she fell into enemy hands. In simplistic terms, whoever held Malta would ultimately win the war in North Africa. Consequently, the country was under continuous attack for a period of almost 2¬Ω years (11 June 1940 - 20 November 1942). At one point Valletta was subjected to a most concentrated onslaught - known as the Malta Blitz, which lasted for 157 days. By comparison, the London Blitz lasted for 57 days and was directed over a much larger area. The various roles of those who became a vital component of either that defence or resupply have, in some instances, passed in history - occasionally into legend. What is, however, so often overlooked are the many unsung heroes who served at this crucial time plus the role played by Britain‚Äôs US Allies - especially in the form of USS Wasp.Based on the diaries of his uncle - Lord David Douglas-Hamilton, author James Douglas-Hamilton provides the most realistic account of what life was really like for an RAF Squadron Leader at a time when over 14,000 tons of bombs were dropped onto such a relatively small area. Carefully and painstakingly researched, this is the private and not-so-private account of one pilot who flew alongside such famous names as ‚ÄòScrewball‚Äô Beurling and ‚ÄòLaddie‚Äô Lucas who, with others, combined to provide one of the greatest defensive and strategic campaigns of all time. Only through such personal accounts (i.e. those diaries) do we learn the truth of the ups and downs of such grim times when even the most optimistic of heroic figures must have occasionally harboured personal doubts about ultimate success‚Ä¶The book opens with an illuminating introduction by ‚ÄòLaddie‚Äô Lucas CBE, DSO, DFC which commences with; The Battle for Malta in the Second World War‚Ä¶, will rank in history as one of the greatest defensive and strategic operations of all time. Yet, even now, little is known about it.‚Äù How true that is!The main text is then divided into 13 chapters which, as the reader will quickly appreciate, provide a full and detailed background and history to support the diaries in question. In short, this account is much more than just the publication of one man‚Äôs diaries and that makes it more worth reading. Chapter; (1) The Struggle for Survival, (2) Hitler, Operation Hercules and Churchill, (3) The Squadron Commander and his Diary, (4) The first USS Wasp Malta Relief Force, (5) The Fighter Pilot‚Äôs Paradise, (6) The Victory of 10 May, (7) Ferocious Encounters, (8) The June Convoy - Invasion postponed, (9) July Battles, (10) The Convoy Life line, (11) The Breaking of the Luftwaffe - October 1942, (12) The Raising of the Siege and the Call of Duty and (13) The Fighter Pilots and the Victory of Malta. The book then concludes with; Sources, Select Bibliography and Index.In many instances I found this work was able to provide a fresh outlook on established events - something which is not only always welcome but for which the author deserves great credit. On the down side, the book suffers from the way in which the historic b&w images are reproduced. Many of these - including the general setting an example on his bike!, should have been produced on better quality (i.e. glossy) paper and perhaps placed together in the middle of the work instead of appearing in a less-than-ideal manner.Nevertheless, the book is still thoroughly recommended.NM","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HVM10V8EQQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844153312#wasThisHelpful","R37HVM10V8EQQU","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today, it might appear that no sooner had the aircraft been invented, it was used as a weapon of war - especially as all air, sea and land forces employ aircraft of some description. The role of the aircraft in naval warfare is, of course, as interesting as any - especially when one encounters a carefully researched book which provides personal accounts from a war which started 100 years ago.Author Malcolm Smith served for 30 years as an Engineer Officer in the Fleet Air Arm with a variety of home appointments and sea duties on aircraft carriers. Towards the end of that service he was employed at the Ministry of Defence with particular responsibility for engineering standards and practises on board ships with aircraft capabilities. In short, this man knows his subject. His previous book ‚ÄòVoices in Flight - The Fleet Air Arm; Recollections from Formation to the Cold War,‚Äô recounted personal stories from those who were involved throughout that time. Continuing with that same theme, this is a collection of personal accounts and anecdotes from the Great War. Personally, I have enjoyed this book so much I am now looking for a copy of that aforementioned title - it really is that readable.The work includes the personal reminisces of naval aircrew and flight maintenance staff from a period when flight itself was still relatively new - and even more so when undertaken by sailors. Amongst the first-hand testimonies, for example, we learn of F. J. Rutland (who became known as ‚ÄòRutland of Jutland‚Äô) who took off in a Sopwith Pup from a makeshift platform erected above one of the gun turrets on HMS Yarmouth - a feat which caused Rudyard Kipling to commemorate the event in a short story.That, however, is only one of the many worthy anecdotes collected over time from the extensive archives held by the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Somerset. All manner of personal reports, spoken accounts, diaries, transcripts, log books official and hand-written documents are brought to life. Elsewhere we find the day-to-day personal routine of one individual whose own story does much to allow the modern reader to glimpse at the reality of the life these men led.In a book which screams ‚Äòfascinating reading‚Äô from every page, I know and recognise the hand of detailed research and, having thoroughly enjoyed the book, can report how those many lonely hours of searching out these many tales was worth every single minute.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQR5R9IOEVIPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178346383X#wasThisHelpful","RQR5R9IOEVIPG","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is easy to become confused by naval prefixes - e.g.; HMS, HMNZS and HNMS. `HMS' is, of course Her (or His) Majesty's Ship with `NZ' identifying a naval vessel from New Zealand. HNMS, however, is `His Netherlands Majesty's Ship.' I add this snippet of digression because I had not previously encountered RHNS (Royal Hellenic Navy Ship). The Greek Royal Family reigned from 1863-1924 and again from 1935-1973 and that prefix will, therefore, have been in use during both world wars and at other times. Today the prefix for Greece is HNS - none of which had previously crossed my desk.RHNS Averof was built in Livorno and completed in 1910. At 10,200 tons she was the largest vessel in the Greek navy and, therefore, the flagship. Curiously, she remained their largest vessel until 1951 - six years after she had been laid up. Soon after being purchased, she saw action in the Balkan Wars and the Battle of Cape Helles (1912) - where she inflicted heavy casualties on the Turkish fleet. In January 1913, she was instrumental in bringing about victory at the Battle of Limnos. After a major refit and modernisation in 1920, the vessel enjoyed a period of peace. When the Germans overran Greece, she made a remarkable escape to Alexandria whilst under constant aerial attack. After her commander had ignored orders to scuttle the ship, she then escorted convoys into the Indian Ocean and continued in that role for the remainder of the war. In 1945 the Averof was laid up and neglected for almost 40 years. Then, after years of refitting and preservation, she was moored at Phaleron, Athens as a floating naval museum. She is one of only three armoured cruisers still in existence.Author John Carr was also previously unknown to me but, having studied this work carefully, I look forward to more on a similar theme. I note he has previously written `A History of the Royal Hellenic Air Force in WWII' and something similar for their navy would be most welcome.In the meantime, he has produced a most interesting history of a specific ship which, being so rare, has already got me contemplating a trip to Athens just to visit this important vessel. The work is well laid out revealing great attention to detail. Similarly, between pages 76 and 77 we find a collection of 55 glossy b&w images which have been given the same degree of careful thought. In addition to the historic photographs one might expect to find we also have a wide variety of images from the preserved vessel - including one which shows shrapnel damage to one of the guns, original nameplate, capstan, bridge, captain's cabin, admiral's quarters, chapel, powder bucket, uniforms, smokestack, hammocks, engine room and so forth.Altogether, I would describe this as a fabulous account of a little-known ship with a big heart and one which is well worth reading.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WQ8SZJ164SDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783030216#wasThisHelpful","R2WQ8SZJ164SDL","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to one dictionary definition, ‚ÄòPiracy‚Äô is the act of robbery and theft at sea - although it has come into use for similar acts on land.‚Äô The definition of a Privateer (also Corsair), was pretty much the same - except that they conducted their business on behalf of a government at times of war. Only by being a Privateer could Henry Morgan continue to amass great wealth by attacking foreign ships and settlements without having the Royal Navy at his heels. Similarly had he been ‚Äòjust another pirate‚Äô (successful or not) he would not have been Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica on three separate occasions and would not have been knighted in 1674.In this new biography, the first thing to strike me was the incredible depth of research undertaken. In so doing, author and historian Graham Thomas turns a complex character into the most fascinating subject. We learn how Morgan was an exceptional leader of men motivated by sheer greed. It is, therefore right and proper that this author should pose the questions: Was his prime motivation to attack the King‚Äôs enemies at every opportunity and keep whatever spoils of war came to hand? Or did he do so ‚Äòonly‚Äô if the pickings were rich enough?There is no doubt Morgan sacked and plundered ships, towns and even cities all along the Spanish Main as he amassed his great personal fortune. Whether this was from pure greed or overwhelming patriotism - or a combination of both is something for the reader to decide, having read the book.I know I bang on about research - but how else do we learn the truth about any historical event no matter how old or recent. In this instance, first-hand accounts and official documents from the National Archives are compared alongside the controversial history of Morgan written by Alexander Esquemeling (who sailed with Morgan as his barber-surgeon and confidante) for about 5 years to 1674. It really is fascinating‚Ä¶To this end, we find a complete work laid in 26 chapters which chart Morgan firstly, as the Buccaneer and, secondly, as the politician. It is a captivating tale worthy of a whole new film - set more as an moving biography than a swash-buckling heroic adventure movie from yesterday, though no less exhilarating and bloody in places‚Ä¶Altogether, a great job of work.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7AOWNREZ3G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848848404#wasThisHelpful","RW7AOWNREZ3G3","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who are new to this series of books, a considerable amount of detail and relevant information is packed into a relatively small space (48 pages in this instance). Nevertheless, a fully informative text is entirely supported with first-rate artwork alongside a good selection of historic photographs. It is a format which has proved to be an excellent introduction to each subject and this particular work is no exception.The subject of US Heavy Cruisers is tackled by producing two books which compliment each other perfectly. The first of these ""US Heavy Cruisers 1941-45; Pre-war Classes"" (also by Mark Stille) was published in April 2014 and, as the name suggests, covered earlier types. This work completes the subject and a quick glance at the `Contents' page reveals what the reader can expect to find; Introduction, Changing Role of the Heavy Cruiser, US Navy Wartime Heavy Cruiser Design, Heavy Cruiser Weapons (Including main and secondary guns, antiaircraft guns, radar and post-war radars), Heavy Cruiser Classes (Baltimore, Alaska & Boston, Oregon City and Des Moines classes), Analysis and Conclusion, Bibliography and Index.Established author Mark Stille commences by expertly introducing the subject at a time when much was changing in warship design as a result of the many lessons learned from WW2. He then gets down to specifics with weapons and radar systems. In a most readable style of writing even the technical specifications are provided in a manner which is easy to understand.As already mentioned, this series of books is fully supported by either high quality images or outstanding artwork on almost every page with the latter falling into three broad categories. Firstly, on pages 15, 31, 35 and 39 we find port and starboard profiles plus deck details of each of the classes of ship mentioned above. Secondly, on pages 23 and 43 we find artistic impressions of ships under fire. Finally, across pages 18/19 we find an incredibly detailed image of USS Baltimore with cutaway sections revealing the innermost secrets of (a) main battery of triple 8 in. guns, (b) secondary battery of six twin 5 in. guns and (c) the boiler and engine rooms.For those who insist that all new books on the subject of WW2 `MUST' contain previously unknown information, I doubt the work contains any such earth-shattering revelations. For those who either, like me myself, have an abiding interest in ships of the period or who are entirely new to the subject, this is a book you can enjoy at a most reasonable price and is one which provides far more than a basic understanding of the subject.In conclusion, this book will prove to be extremely useful and is, therefore, fully recommended!NM","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18YO80DHN2GQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178200632X#wasThisHelpful","R18YO80DHN2GQD","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another work from acclaimed American naval historian Norman Friedman who is described as being ""as much at home with warship technology as he is with contemporary defence issues."" It is the fourth book from this author to have crossed my desk this year and, as someone who studies ships and shipwrecks for a living (it's what I do!), I have found his name to be one I can trust for accuracy of detail. In this instance, however, I was also delighted to find a complete work about a particular genre of British warships which fills the very large gap which had previously existed in my own private library. That void was only filled because of the wealth of detail Friedman provides in a most interesting and readable style - and all students learn more when they are enjoying the teaching experience.As part of my own ongoing research, I was particularly pleased to find significant entries relating to Australian, Canadian, Dutch, New Zealand and United States variants of some of the ships included here. Quite often, those that were built abroad and then used by the Royal Navy or (vice versa), later transferred to other navies, are completely overlooked beyond their RN service. Here we can follow the complete story.No sooner had I started the work, I found myself cross-referencing specific details with those of other notable experts alongside information already known to me. Nothing written by Friedman was lacking in any way. In short, this is a work of supreme technical excellence presented in a readable style. Alongside that text, we also find a series of b&w images of the highest calibre. It just so happens I am particularly familiar with both Malta and Gibraltar and, therefore, able to compare historic images from this book with some of my own more recent photography. Whereas little appears to have changed on the Malta harbour coastline, it really is remarkable to discover how much of Gibraltar's famous harbour is now land-fill - but I digress.The final element of the work which will be of huge interest to all enthusiasts - including model-makers are the large number of line drawings (side profiles and deck plans) which are, again, of the highest possible quality.The work itself is divided into 15 self-explanatory chapters as follows: (1) Introduction, (2) Beginning the Slide Towards War, (3) What Sort of Destroyer?, (4) Defending Trade, (5) The War Emergency Destroyers, (6) New Destroyer Classes, (7) Wartime Ocean Escorts, (8) The Post-war Destroyer, (9) The Missile Destroyer, (10) The 1945 Frigate and her Successors, (11) The Search for Numbers, (12) The General Purpose Frigate, (13) The Second Post-war Generation, (14) The Post Carrier Generation and (15) The Future. The work then concludes with; Bibliography, Data Tables, List of Ships and an Index.Those who regularly read my reviews will know that I do not tolerate works which are lacking in any way. Similarly, I dislike those who criticise works for all the wrong reasons. This work is an impressive product by any standards and must be recognised as such. The depth of research in terms of technical information is equally matched by the similar attention to detail given to both the selection of historic images and the provision of those line drawings. Altogether, therefore, it is hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with such an outstanding work - unless, of course, they were looking for some aspect which is beyond the scope of the book.Personally, I already regard this book as completely indispensible.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L939KQDZLCQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848320159#wasThisHelpful","R1L939KQDZLCQW","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Norman Friedman is an acclaimed American naval historian of the highest calibre with three of his works having crossed my desk since March of this year. Whereas the first of these (Naval Anti-Aircraft Guns and Gunnery) quickly became indispensible and is in continuous use, I found the second (Naval Firepower; Battleship Guns & Gunnery in the Dreadnought Era) rather turgid and hard-going.In this instance, I am happy to review a book which appears to have everything one might hope to find.

Naturally, I will be delighted if the information is there and ‚Äònot‚Äô if it cannot be found. After having read the book, however, I can honestly say I am deeply impressed. There are 432 pages of tightly packed information with (as already mentioned) a liberal supply of historic images and line drawings. Personally, I never tire of looking at photographs of ships that are long gone - and, with the exception of HMS Belfast now moored on the Thames in London, none of these ships remain in existence.Halfway through the book, I paused to see how many other books about British Cruisers were also available and was surprised to discover how few there are. Those that do exist are, generally, for a specific type or design with none being as comprehensive as this work. A small point perhaps, but any work designed to fill such a large hole in the market would have to be of exceptional quality and that is exactly what you get.

"On 1 September 1939, the British liner Athenia (13,581 grt), under command of Captain James Cook, departed British waters carrying passengers for Montreal. At 1115 hrs 3 September the British declared war on Germany and at 1945 hrs that evening, when the ship was some 250 miles into the Atlantic, she was torpedoed by U30. On board were 1,103 passengers - of which 311 were American citizens, plus a crew of 315. The U Boat then surfaced and commenced shelling the ship which was already in a sinking condition. Many people were already dead and the task of launching the boats made all the more difficult by the ship‚Äôs list. One full boat fell from the davits, another capsized and a third ran into the screw of a Norwegian ship which came alongside to assist. Altogether 128 persons died.Mindful of how the loss of the Lusitania in May 1915 influenced America‚Äôs decision to enter WW1, German propaganda made preposterous claims in which they sought to blame the British resulting in the British government having to formally deny all culpability and make a number of assurances to the US government as follows; (1) That the ship carried no bullion or securities, no guns, munitions of war or explosives, (2) That the ship was NOT sunk either by contact with a British mine, by British submarine, by gunfire of British destroyers or by internal explosion but instead, in accordance with the evidence they were able to produce, was sunk by German submarine, (3) That the ship was neither armed nor stiffened to receive armament of any kind and was not intended to be used as an armed raider, armed merchant cruiser or in any other offensive capacity at the end of the voyage on which she was sunk.So commenced the Battle of the Atlantic - the longest battle of WW2.In this excellent and thought-provoking account, we learn much that might have ordinarily been overlooked by other authors. This is the first major work to take a fresh look at this particular sinking for over 50 years and during that time, certain documents not previously available for public scrutiny, will have been released under whatever 30 or 50 year rule was in force. Those documents have clearly been sourced and carefully studied as part of the preparation for this book.As mentioned elsewhere, I am currently engaged in a huge project concerning the fate of passenger and cruise ships throughout history. ‚ÄòSo many ships - so little time,‚Äô it really is a daunting venture. Several of the books which are available (old and new!), however, suffer from an almost complete lack of credible research - with many of the more recent efforts having clearly looked no further than the internet for their inspiration (and false facts!). Those who understand the difficulties and complexities associated with ‚Äòresearch,‚Äô however, will recognise the detail and quality of information provided by this author. And, for those who simply want to enjoy a good read about an important factual event of WW2, all that data has been turned into a darned good read.In a work about the loss of a single ship - which might easily be described as the most important sinking of the war - if only because it was so politically sensitive, we have a product worthy of the incident, an account worth reading and the answers to an awful lot of previously unanswered questions.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMFVX0HVIY70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591141486#wasThisHelpful","RQMFVX0HVIY70","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 was the signal to publish all manner of books and documentary programmes devoted to that particular war. Whereas many of the resultant products suffer from an embarrassing lack of competent research it is always a pleasure to reveal one which stands apart from the rest - if only because it really is that good. As one who spends almost every waking hour immersed in  researching lost ships (it's what I do!), I am aware of the complexities of uncovering relevant and accurate information. Having carefully studied this particular product, it is quite clear author Stephen Bull has mastered the art of finding those all-important facts. Having done so, he has put them together in an immensely readable, educational and hugely enjoyable work.For those who know little or nothing about `Trench Warfare' - where neither side gained or lost anything appreciable - apart from thousands of lives, this work is a revelation. For those who thought they already knew all there was to know, I suspect it will also prove to be an education. For those who wish to study the subject - look no further.After an illuminating Introduction, the book commences with an equally informative Chronology which the reader will continue to consult as the book is studied. We are then treated to an overview of the armies involved and of the beginning of Trench Warfare. All soldiers have to `dig-in' and no ground gives way easily when you are using an army-issue folding spade at a time of desperately wanting to become instantly hidden from the enemy. Who would have thought that those first defensive positions across the Western Front would have been extended and modified to such extreme limits.There then follows chapters on; `Trenchtown,' New Weapons and Tactics, Gas, Raiding & Sniping, Mining, Concrete Bunkers, the Tank and Over the Top before ending with; Conclusion, Notes, Bibliography and Index.The book is lavishly illustrated throughout with an excellent selection of (mostly b&w) historic photographs which are really impressive for their quality in addition to the breadth of subject covered. Whereas we are often asked to accept poor quality pictures from this period in time, these are particularly outstanding... Of the hundreds of images to consider, I particularly liked the photo of US Lt. Browning firing the machine gun designed by his father and the one showing New Zealand soldiers holding a massive rifle - designed to penetrate the Tank!There are also a number of colour plates including trench maps, documents, artwork and colour photographs. These include a wide variety of subjects such as; equipment, particular scenes, uniforms and significant personalities - such as Captain Albert Ball who had already earned the VC, DSO and MC by the time he died at the age of 20.The most captivating element of those photographs, however, is how much the soldiers from all sides looked and dressed almost exactly the same.Altogether, I would suggest this is as complete an explanation of the subject as we are likely to find and I congratulate both author and publisher for such an excellent product.NMBritish army major (retired)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CQ0QMUR9DFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472801326#wasThisHelpful","R15CQ0QMUR9DFW","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As mentioned previously, I really do like this series of books. It is amazing how much information plus supporting photography and artwork gets packed into such a short space. In this instance, the subject is the US Dreadnought battleship - which were easily amongst the finest in the world and, in just 48 pages (including Index), we have an overview which is hard to equal.The arrival of the first (British) Dreadnought-class battleship in 1906 was so revolutionary it immediately rendered all existing battleships (and most other warships) obsolete at a stroke. This was on a par with what the jet engine did for fighter-aircraft many years later and led to all battleships now being described as either Dreadnought or pre-Dreadnought. It also meant that any nation with the requisite capabilities could build themselves a new naval fleet at the same speed as any other. No country embraced the situation better than the USA.After a perceptive Introduction, the book is divided into the following chapters; South Carolina class, Delaware & Florida classes, Wyoming class, New York class, US Dreadnought Battleship Operations 1914-1918, Inter-war Scrapping, Disarmament & Modernisation and US Dreadnought Battleship Operations 1939-45. These are followed by; Conclusions, Bibliography and Index.In spite of the size of the product, the story is all there and what makes this work so special is a number of different factors. The choice of historic photographs, for example, really is quite excellent. I particularly like the photograph of Lt. Commander Sims taken in 1919 showing Assistant Secretary to the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt with walking stick‚Ä¶ Elsewhere the wide-angle shot of a battleship in a Brooklyn dry-dock almost leaps from the page. Other images include anything from the newspaper cartoons of the day to the widest possible variety of naval subjects.Nevertheless, it is the artwork which makes this series of books so indispensable. These include side profile and deck views of USS‚Äô Michigan, Delaware and Utah and waterline and full profiles of USS Arkansas. There is also an artistic view of the landing of troops from USS Florida at Veracruz in 1914 (plus a fascinating insight into that particular event!).I was also particularly pleased to discover the USS Texas preserved at Houston. That ship is possibly the only Dreadnought battleship still in existence and is, therefore, part of world history and I congratulate those responsible for ensuring a single example of the species remains intact. British attitudes towards ancient and historic ships are very different indeed‚Ä¶All things considered, the book is an excellent overview of the subject, a great place to commence your studies and a work in which some absorbing information comes to light. It is not, however, a definitive work and makes no such claim.NM","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F8Q6FE1EGDN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178200386X#wasThisHelpful","R2F8Q6FE1EGDN5","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A book first published in 2009 recounting the WW2 exploits of a British soldier might beg the question as to why he waited so long. Having studied his story - and frequently marvelled at the events which befell him, I came to understand how that passage of time had allowed former soldier and author Ray Ellis to place a fair and reasonable appreciation on the events in question. In short, this memoir is written with a fuller understanding of what actually happened at the time than ‚Äòmight‚Äô have otherwise been the case. Had the work been written immediately after the war, we may have had a work tainted by the sadness and bitterness of such recent tragic events. Instead, we have a balanced and carefully thought-out account of one man‚Äôs truly remarkable adventure thnrough that war.Like so many of the youth of the day, Ray Ellis longed for the excitement of uniform and war. Fired with national pride he joined the South Notts Hussars. Transferred to the Royal Horse Artillery, he became a gunner and was soon in Palestine. From there it was a relatively short hop to the rigours of North Africa where his first taste of battle came at Mersa Matruh. Following his deployments to Sidi Barani, Gennia and Suez he became part of the famous defence of Tobruk - where he describes life during the siege with a simple honesty which allows the reader to understand the the very real hardships. This is followed by the break-out from Tobruk, the Nile Delta and the Battle of Knightsbridge - so far removed from the London Borough from which it took its name, and where his was the last gun still firing as they were overwhelmed with very few surviving to be taken prisoner.In many ways, however, this man‚Äôs remarkable tale could have started right here as wee learn of his days as a POW, his escape, life ‚Äòon the run‚Äô and his eventual joining the partisans in the Apennine mountains. Eventually, of course, we learn of his repatriation.I shall not spoil the enjoyment of the read (and it is a most satisfying read!), by revealing all - except to say that Ray Ellis has that rare ability to provide the most authentic and graphic accounts of the many different elements to this story - his being a civilian, a soldier, a fighter, under siege, a POW, an escapee, a fellow partisan and a homer-comer. It is a gripping tale, well told without any hint of bitterness towards that former enemy.Somehow he is able to summarise all his own feelings in the book‚Äôs Dedication which simply reads; ‚ÄúTo those of my Comrades who grow not old.‚ÄùGod bless them all!NMBritish army major (retired)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RXF1OPT05OOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628737298#wasThisHelpful","R1RXF1OPT05OOP","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On 29 May 1914, the 14,000 ton passenger ship Empress of Ireland collided with the 6,000 ton collier Storstadt in the St. Lawrence River, Canada. 1,012 of the 1,477 persons on board the ‚ÄòEmpress‚Äô perished in the 15 minutes it took the liner to sink. This tragedy occurred just 25 months after the loss of the Titanic and only a short time before Europe was plunged into a conflict which would become known as the Great War, or the War to end all Wars. Whereas the legend of the Titanic lives on (in both fact and in fiction!), the loss of the Empress of Ireland remains largely overlooked and forgotten.As repeated elsewhere, I am currently engaged in a huge project concerning passenger ships throughout history. My studies have taken me far and wide in addition to having obtained a large number of relevant books and research data. Sadly, many of the more recent works suffer from a malaise which can only be described as wholly reliant on the internet for whatever minimal research was undertaken. Whereas this work first appeared in 1972 - long before such systems became available, the author does seem to have tapped into equally unreliable sources.Throughout the work we find errors in the number of people on board the ship in addition to a death toll which is exaggerated by an additional 66 lives. Nevertheless, even with such blatant errors, I had hoped to find some snippet of valuable information not mentioned in other sources - albeit in serious need of double checking against something more reliable. There were none!In addition I found the layout excruciatingly annoying. The book is large print for no apparent reason (it is not advertised as a large print book!), the spacing between paragraphs and sentences is erratic. The spelling was never checked and just as it begins to get remotely interesting, we find the author providing yet another synopsis of events ‚Äì for the umpteenth time.

"On 29 May 1914, the 14,000 ton passenger ship Empress of Ireland collided with the 6,000 ton collier Storstadt in the St. Lawrence River, Canada. 1,012 of the 1,477 persons on board the ‚ÄòEmpress‚Äô perished in the 15 minutes it took the liner to sink. This tragedy occurred just 25 months after the loss of the Titanic and only a short time before Europe was plunged into a conflict which would become known as the Great War, or the War to end all Wars. Whereas the legend of the Titanic lives on (in both fact and in fiction!), the loss of the Empress of Ireland remains largely overlooked and forgotten.As repeated elsewhere, I am currently engaged in a huge project concerning passenger ships throughout history. My studies have taken me far and wide in addition to having obtained a large number of relevant books and research data. Sadly, many of the more recent works suffer from a malaise which can only be described as wholly reliant on the internet for whatever minimal research was undertaken. Whereas this work first appeared in 1972 - long before such systems became available, the author does seem to have tapped into equally unreliable sources.Throughout the work we find errors in the number of people on board the ship in addition to a death toll which is exaggerated by an additional 66 lives. Nevertheless, even with such blatant errors, I had hoped to find some snippet of valuable information not mentioned in other sources - albeit in serious need of double checking against something more reliable. There were none!In addition I found the layout excruciatingly annoying. The book is large print for no apparent reason (it is not advertised as a large print book!), the spacing between paragraphs and sentences is erratic. The spelling was never checked and just as it begins to get remotely interesting, we find the author providing yet another synopsis of events ‚Äì for the umpteenth time.

"These publishers produce a number of similar-looking books which include different themes. One is devoted to specific warships, vehicles or weapons of war and another provides comparisons between opposing sides such as German soldier vs. Russian soldier or two types of warship and so forth. Another topic within this arrangement is specific battles such as, for example; ‚ÄúThe Naval Battles of Guadalcanal.‚Äù The one outstanding feature from all these works, however, is the excellent artwork provided by different artists. This particular book is written by Benjamin Lai and illustrated by Giuseppe Rava - both of whom are new to me.Having served in Hong Kong with 7th Gurkha Rifles (1979-1981), I found certain elements of the book particularly fascinating - if only because I had been to the site in question. That, however, is no precondition for anyone wishing to similarly enjoy this excellent work.On the day after Pearl Harbour, Imperial Japanese Forces issued instruction for the invasions of the Philippines, Thailand, Malaya and the tiny British Colony of Hong Kong. Because of its relative lack of importance, the occupation of Hong Kong is largely overlooked. This work, however, provides a full appraisal of those dark days and of the brutality which became synonymous with Japanese military behaviour throughout WW2. I deliberately mention this aspect because the author provides a potted account of the sinking of the Lisbon Maru. Of the 1,834 (British and Commonwealth) POWs who were captured in Hong Kong and placed aboard that ship, only 716 eventually survived!In a well-thought-out work, we commence with an Introduction and Chronology of Events which combine perfectly to set the scene for the detailed descriptions which follow. Here we find short biographies of the two opposing commanders, an assessment of the opposing forces, the ‚ÄòOrder of Battle‚Äô and the different plans employed by each side. The ‚ÄòBattle for Hong Kong‚Äô was not a single engagement. Instead we learn of the 2nd MTB Flotilla - which carried out a suicidal attack on Japanese craft which were landing troops, the Battle of North Point Power Station, the Annihilation of East Brigade, the Battle for Wongneichong Gap (Where W02 Osborne (Winnipeg Grenadiers) was killed earning the first Canadian VC of WW2) and much more besides. These are followed by ‚ÄòThe Aftermath‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Battlefield Today.‚ÄôThe well written text is made all the more interesting by the anecdotes and snippets of personal information that might so easily have been overlooked. The Japanese commander, for example, visited his wounded troops in hospital ‚Äì something which was very rare for Japanese generals. On the other side, Major General Francis Festing was twice appointed GOC Hong Kong and later went on to become a Field Marshall.It is, however, the artwork which I most admire. In this instance we have standard maps showing advances made by troops and the movement of boats in addition to those which show the ground in sharp relief. Elsewhere there are artistic interpretations of the land and sea battles. These and the accompanying text are all supported by a first-rate selection of historic and modern images thoughtfully produced in order to convey the intended message. All things considered, I really can‚Äôt think of a better way in which the invasion and occupation of Hong Kong might have been explained.NMBritish army major (retired)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNC1VUQ0QO30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYVYOSU#wasThisHelpful","R2HNC1VUQ0QO30","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a number of books within this excellent series from Osprey where one side of a particular force is compared to its opposite number (E-Boat vs. MTB and German Commerce Raider vs. British Cruiser to name two). They are not designed to reveal which side might have won in straightforward and equal combat (if ever there was such a thing!) but are, instead a comparison of whatever features, equipment, weapons, strengths and weaknesses existed at the time. Having studied the work, readers can then make up their own mind.This particular work reveals every aspect of the German and Soviet infantry soldier at the time of Barbarossa and is particularly well detailed for a work of only 80 pages. After an informative introduction, we find 7 main Chapters as follows; (1) The Opposing Sides (Origins and combat role - Recruitment, morale and logistics - Leadership and communications - Armament, training and tactics), (2) Zhlobin 6 July 1941, (3) Smolensk 15-23 July 1941, (4) Vas'kovo-Voroshilovo 23-27 July 1941, (5) Analysis (Lessons learned by the Germans and by the Soviets), (6) Aftermath and (7) Unit Organisations. The work then concludes with Bibliography and Index.With fully detailed military maps showing the opposing forces, the Introduction explains how the battles developed throughout July 1941. We then find the makeup of each side - right down to their background, morale, leadership, training and weapons. In the first of yet another excellent series of artwork, pages 20-21 show the fully equipped German soldier from front and rear with all his equipment, as carried, fully captioned. Four pages later we find exactly the same for the Soviet soldier which reveals considerable differences. Zhlobin, Smolensk and Vas'kovo-Voroshilovo are explained in an insightful and factual manner with each battle once again accompanied by first class military-style maps. As one reads these accounts, however, what catches the imagination are the small snapshots of peripheral events and information such as a short bio of a particular commander or a German officer being decorated in the field - all improving the overall fascination factor.Personally, I found this particular treatment of Barbarossa wholly captivating and made even more exciting by the artwork for which this series of books is renowned. That, coupled with an immensely readable style of writing and an equally excellent series of historic images, makes this book well worth studying.NMBritish army major (retired)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CUDMWAACPO5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUQAEDW#wasThisHelpful","R2CUDMWAACPO5C","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series of books continues to provide what is, for me at least, the best possible grounding into the specifics of each subject covered. In this instance, the publishers have tackled the subject of French Tanks from WW2 in two editions and this (the second) covers Cavalry Tanks and AFVs. Though never a ‚Äòcavalry man‚Äô myself, I did once command a Scout Car on duty in Northern Ireland and also later served with a Cavalry Regiment and have been ‚Äòlocked down inside‚Äô during simulated NBC attacks. Whereas, therefore, my experience might be described as the bare minimum, I do have a little (very little!) from my past service on which to draw when studying the work. Having said that, I found it absolutely fascinating!The work commences with an appreciation of ‚ÄòEarly Efforts at Cavalry Mechanisation‚Äô which provides a great introduction. This is followed by three major chapters - each with as number of sub-headings as follows; (1) The Weygand Reforms; (Renault AMR 33, Renault AMR 35, Renault AMC, Somua S35, Hotchkiss H35, Hotchkiss H39, Panhard AMD 35 and Cavalry Mechanisation). (2) French Tanks and the 1940 Campaign; (Technical assessment and the turret problem, the Radio Gap, Legends of the Campaign, Tank Strength May 1940, the 1930s Arms Race and Cumulative Tank Production 1931-40 and French Tank Deployment May 1940). (3) French Tanks after the 1940 Armistice; (Cavalry AMDs in Colonies September 1939, Operation Exporter, Operation Torch and Tank Development in Vichy France).  The book then concludes with Further Reading and Index.From the above, the reader will gain a full appreciation of the subject although, (having missed it!) I did think I should have read the aforementioned earlier work first. Nevertheless, this is a full appraisal of the vehicles covered and one which will be most useful to those studying the subject.Once again, no praise is too high for the outstanding artwork which sets this series of books apart from anything else. Eleven of the vehicles are carefully produced in original livery, side profile with numerous regimental motifs shown either on the tank/AFV or separately alongside. Across pages 20-21 there is a complete cutaway sectional diagram of the Somua S35. Elsewhere we find line drawings of these vehicles including some which show the crew on board in their operational positions. In addition there is an excellent selection of historic photographs alongside a small number of more recent (colour) images of vehicles which have been carefully preserved.All things considered, another excellent introduction to the subject.NMBritish army major (retired)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XFKVYI0EEIFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUQATMS#wasThisHelpful","R1XFKVYI0EEIFM","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On 7 October 1985, a small group of Palestinians seized control of the cruise-liner Achille Lauro off Egypt‚Äôs Mediterranean coast. Taking the passengers and crew hostage, they were demanding the release of fifty Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Having ordered the ship to Syria, they were refused entry into the port of Tartus. After two days of negotiations, the hijackers agreed to leave the liner in return for safe passage to Tunisia. The only casualty had been US passenger Leon Klinghoffer who had been killed by one of their number. Their aircraft, however, was forced to land in Sicily where the group were arrested, tried and various jail sentences imposed. Although unrelated, on 2 December 1994, the ship caught fire off the coast of Somalia during a cruise and sank.As mentioned elsewhere, I am currently engaged in a huge project concerning passenger and cruise ships throughout history. It is a daunting venture. To date, my studies have taken me far and wide in addition to having obtained a number of relevant books. Sadly, far too many of these suffer from an increasingly common malaise whereby wannabe authors look no further than the Internet as the all-singing, all-dancing source of information. Apart from an overall lack of accuracy, the only skills displayed are an ability to tell the difference between a right and left ‚Äòclick of the mouse.‚ÄôI mention this in the hope of clearly demonstrating how good this book really is. It is an important account for which the author deserves great credit. It is as exceptional for the detailed research as it is for being a darned good read. The fact that it was Michael Bohn‚Äôs his first-ever book is also worthy of equal praise. By producing such a high-quality page turner, we are finally provided with a complete account of what really happened - including all the political intrigue of the day. Alongside that ‚Äòdepth of understanding‚Äô of the subject itself, we also find an author who fully appreciates the complexities of research - seemingly having accessed just about every conceivable source. And that is no mean feat!Research is hard work. It is a lonely, laborious task requiring the identification of all sources of relevant information in additional to possessing a working knowledge of whatever filing/index systems are employed by the many museums, libraries, archives, records offices and private collections which may exist. Little wonder, therefore, that those without either the skills or the inclination are incapable of matching works such as this for sheer quality and readability.Put simply, if you want to know what happened in 1985, look no further.

"On 26 September 2002, the Senegal-government ferry ‚ÄòLe Joola‚Äô capsized to become the second-worst civilian matitime disaster of all time. The ship was only 12 years old - although she had been undergoing repairs to one of her two engines. Classified as a roll-on roll-off ferry, she displaced 2,087 grt, was 79.5m long and had a carrying capacity of 35 cars plus cargo in addition to 536 passengers and 44 crew. Instead of there being anything up to that limit of 580 persons on board, however, the estimated number of people was actually in excess of 1,900 - perhaps even 2,000!The ship departed Ziguinchor about 1330 hrs for Dakar. By 2200 hrs radio reports suggested all was well but one hour later she encountered an atrocious storm which caused her to list momentarily - perhaps as a result of shifting cargo, and then continue to roll until she was upside down in the water. The entire capsize was over within a matter of moments with no time for anyone to react and no distress signal was sent. Without the prospect of immediate rescue and with no boats launched, many of those who did find themselves in the sea died that night.The following morning, local fishermen arrived ahead of the main rescue effort. One survivor explained how people were trapped alive in air-pockets but unable to get out of the upturned ship. This was confirmed by tapping and even shouting and screaming being heard from inside the hull. Before they could be helped, however, the ferry suddenly sank in very deep water. After much investigation, the official death toll was put at 1,863. Of the more than 600 women on board, there was only one amongst the 64 survivors. Poor maintenance of the ship is now widely regarded as being a major contributory factor in the loss.This work, however, seeks to add additional dimensions bordering on the fictional. In attempting to create such wholly unnecessary examples of invention, mystery and intrigue Wiley draws on that age-old (and very tired!) parallel with the Titanic for which he earns a triple yawn for being both predictable and far too late. Such a comparison (with the only other shipwreck he has ever heard of) is a clear outward sign of a desperate need to find a new angle where none exist. In so doing he displays a complete lack of understanding of the subjects of research, ships, shipwrecks and what is already written on the subject. I have no idea how many lost ships are openly billed as being this country‚Äôs or region‚Äôs Titanic - because they are countless. Describing Le Joola as ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äôs Titanic‚Äù is so amateurish and unoriginal it almost smacks of plagiarism. I can name at least three ships which are already so described plus many more from countries as far apart as Australia and Canada. In one instance, the epithet is even ascribed to a sunken Tugboat! Such claims are used in books in the hope that the very word ‚ÄòTitanic‚Äô will catch the eye of the masses when an improved text coupled with detailed research is always the preferred option.As printed on the back cover, we are asked to consider the following outrageous questions; What caused this disaster which was worse than the Titanic? Why weren‚Äôt the lifeboats or life rafts launched? Why was it late the following day before rescue craft arrived? Curiously the answers are found in Mr Wiley‚Äôs brief biopic which appears towards the end of this lamentable nonsense. It is here that we learn how this so-called author has studied creative writing. Creative writing is a gift - it allows a good writer to describe anything from fact to fiction in an interesting, readable and hard-to-put-down manner. Creative writing is not, however, the same as creative accounting - where facts and figures are falsified! Perhaps he should try fiction - but certainly not book-keeping!NM","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132P9QO2WN9O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615863566#wasThisHelpful","R132P9QO2WN9O6","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On 10 November 1928, the 10,000 ton cargo-liner Vestris departed New York for Barbados and Buenos Aires. Under command of Captain W. J. Carey, she had 128 passengers and 197 crew on board. Within 24 hours, the ship encountered the heaviest possible weather and at about 1930 hrs 11 November was struck by two waves of incredible size in quick succession. Two lifeboats were washed away and part of the cargo and bunker coal shifted causing a severe permanent list. The ship now began to take on water at such a rate the pumps were unable to cope. By daybreak, Captain Carey recognised his ship was in poor shape but refused to send out an SOS message until 0945 hrs. Almost immediately, his work force of firemen (stokers) came on deck and refused to return to their posts. Whereas the engineers attempted to carry out the requisite tasks, the list continued to increase and they too had to stop as well. Without power, Carey had no option but to abandon ship - shortly after which the Vestris rolled over and sank.On arrival, the rescue ships had great difficulty in finding the lifeboats due to the reduced visibility and high sea sate. Eventually, however, a small number of vessels, including the USS Wyoming, rescued 215 persons between them. The remaining 110 were all lost.This particular account of the loss of the Vestris suffers from three main problems. Firstly, in a work first published in 2013 (85 years after the event), there is little or nothing which might be described as ‚Äònew‚Äô information. Secondly, the writing style gets bogged down with trivia - especially when it comes to numbers, and would have benefitted considerably from a professional publisher‚Äôs input. Finally, the text is reproduced on poor quality paper which, although fine for words is wholly unsuitable for images and the B&W pictures, such as they are, appear amongst that text on the same quality paper.Altogether, therefore, the fact that the book is self-published screams from every page and, in so doing, fails to support all the effort which must have been put into the work in the first instance - in much the same way as the most smartly dressed soldier on parade will always be let down by dirty boots. Whenever that happens, he might just as well not have bothered with all the rest!NM","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUYO6KZ8EBHHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1475223129#wasThisHelpful","RUYO6KZ8EBHHQ","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The passenger liner Royal Edward was built in Glasgow in 1906 and employed between Bristol and Canada until the outbreak of WW1. On 13 August 1915, the ship was acting as an auxiliary troop transport during the Gallipoli campaign when she was torpedoed and sunk by U15 under command of Lt. von Heimburg. Of all the records this ship had accumulated and might have gone on to achieve during her lifetime, she became the first troopship lost to enemy action in the 20th Century.Lt. von Heimburg remained on site and viewed the sinking and subsequent rescue via periscope and, unlike some of his fellow commanders made no attempt to interfere. Fewer than 500 of the 1,366 troops and 220 crew who were on board the ship survived.Richard Oliff‚Äôs great uncle was one of those casualties and it is from the book‚Äôs dedication we first learn how it was his grandmother who inspired the research which led to this work.Throughout the 20th Century many of the world‚Äôs greatest ships (and many more which were not so great) were lost in times of war and peace. Tracing the history of each vessel to come under the microscope of serious research is often such a difficult and onerous task it leads to much being published which either true or false. Happily, in this instance, Oliff deserves much credit for the way in which he has tackled the subject matter and I have learned much that I did not previously know about this ship.Most important of all, perhaps, the style of writing turns almost every little ‚Äòaside‚Äô into another interesting element of the entire story. As an example, after the ship has departed on her final journey, he writes; ‚ÄúCoincidentally, the day after the Royal Edward was spotted rounding the most western point of England, my father was born in the village of Great Burstead‚Ä¶.‚ÄùFully supported with an equally fascinating collection of historic images of people, places and, of course, ships, this is as complete a work on a single ship as one might hope to find.NM","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXUV74XHWF8HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857942337#wasThisHelpful","RXUV74XHWF8HB","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The five Battlecruisers built by John Brown‚Äôs are detailed in the order; Inflexible (24 pages), Australia (26), Tiger (28), Repulse (32) and the Mighty Hood (56). These are followed by an overview of the G3 contract which was cancelled in 1922. The book then concludes with 10 Appendices, Sources & Bibliography and Index.Taking the Inflexible as an example of the way in which each subject vessel is tackled, we find the complete story of this ship in between images of the highest possible calibre. Bearing in mind the book‚Äôs full title, these photographs show almost every conceivable angle and feature. Four triple-blade propellers, twin rudders, stem, hull and so much more are shown in a series of pre-launch pictures which even include one of her steam launch. After her launch, we find photographs which include; deck views, amidships, aft section, stem, boat stowage, workmen taking a break on the foc‚Äôsle deck, bridge, turrets, the two starboard 125 cwt Wasteney Smith stockless anchors close up to the hawse pipes, upper control platforms, weapons, aft funnel, boat deck, steam siren, searchlight, ratings asleep below decks, refrigeration plant, Admiral‚Äôs cabin and a number of ship portraits both steaming at full power, stopped in the water. The other vessels mentioned are given the same treatment with even more images per ship.From this selection of previously unpublished images one begins to gain an appreciation of the amount of work which went into the three year building and fitting-out process for such weapons of war.

"It was the First World War - known at that time as ""The Great War"" which changed Britain and Europe forever. As the Generals on both sides sent millions of men to their deaths in the carnage which they regarded as warfare, there came about a change in the psyche of the British male - a change which would herald a complete alteration in the way he thought and acted towards those of the upper, ruling classes. No longer would that British male be so quick to use such words as ""M'Lord"" or even ""Sir."" No longer would he doff his cap as a mark of respect, no longer would the ordinary police Constable be so quick to ""arrest that man"" just because a well dressed person had ordered him so to do.That change in British Society continues to this day and is easily traced back to the feelings of loss and despair which came with the realisation that far too many young men had died ""at the front"" - even though the war itself had been won and mainland Britain had escaped unscathed.In this epic tale, author Robert Massie delves deep into why that war occurred in the first place. Every single aspect of argument and behaviour on both sides (both military and political) is exposed and analysed. As the title of the book would suggest, the theme is the world's first great arms race. When Britain produced the first Dreadnought Battleship it rendered all other battleships obsolete at a stroke (including the remainder of the British Fleet!). From that moment onwards it was always a question of who could produce the most new Dreadnoughts in the quickest possible time. Set against this wish by both Britain and Germany to be seen as the world's supreme masters of the seas was a political intrigue which few have been able to commit to print in such a masterly fashion as is found in this book.In short, this is one of the greatest books of our time. It is also a damn fine read.NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJ4JRZBBB48O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV8JQWK#wasThisHelpful","RPJ4JRZBBB48O","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Throughout my work as a shipwreck historian (it‚Äôs what I do!), I find many gaps in published material. The ferries which ply the English Channel and other short routes around Britain, for example, are often overlooked in favour of more glamorous vessels. This work seeks to redress that balance and is another excellent publication from Seaforth Publishing in which we find some 300 images of the ferries of yesterday. I never tire of looking at photos of historic ships and I now have a whole new selection to study at my leisure. With 2 or 3 B&W images on almost every pages, this is a book which takes the reader on a journey through time to the early 1970s in which it explains the cross-channel steamer and ferry in marvellous detail.Leaving the ‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô until last, the book is thoughtfully divided into 10 chapters which take the reader from the earliest vessels right through to 1971 - where the book completes its journey. The chapter headings are self-explanatory as follows; (1) Early Paddle Steamers and Experimental Vessels, (2) Screw begins to Challenger Paddle, (3)  From Paddle to Triple Expansion Engines, (4) Improved Steamers, (5) The Turbine Revolution, (6) Geared Turbines and WW1, (7) Diesel Debut, (8) The 1930s, (9) WW2 and Fleet Reconstruction and (10) The Final Years. Each of these commences with its own short preamble after which we find vessels listed by year - each with its own image and explanatory text.It is, however, in the ‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô where the entire subject is displayed in excellent fashion. The very concept of a ‚ÄòCross-channel steamer‚Äô is one which was born out of the geographical location of the UK and its close proximity to mainland Europe. Just as Mississippi riverboats are special to that river and Great Lakes steamers were developed for the conditions found there, each style of ship is different for very good reasons. Having explained the origins of the type of ship in question, we are then introduced to the many developments and variants which came about; railways, paddles, screws, turbines, WW1, hospital ships, armed boarding-ships, auxiliary mine-layers, mine-sweepers & net-layers, seaplane carriers, the inter-war period, motor-ships, WW2, troopships, hospital ships (another war!), infantry landing-ships, anti-aircraft ships, Axis-requisitioned ships, post-war reconstructions, final deliveries, last survivors, Wm Denny & Brothers and notes on ship design. And all that from 14 pages of Introduction.The paddles - as mounted onto the sides of a ship, were complex items and the two engines required to turn those wheels required far more space than the single engine required for a propeller. As those original steam engines gave way to turbines and then diesel, we find an explanation of that process of evolution and further development put into the context of how, where and when it all happened. This allows the book to take on a whole new meaning and, therefore, importance, because of the ongoing additional educational element. In other words, there is a lot more here than just British ferries!Whereas I was already aware of the significant changes in nautical propulsion systems - nowhere have I found the subject better explained than in this work and that makes it rather special!NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGZRWIXFHYLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848321708#wasThisHelpful","R1TGZRWIXFHYLB","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some time now, I have been studying the history of passenger-ships as part of a large project with which I am currently involved. Researching ships and shipwrecks is what I do and this was one of a number of books purchased for that reason. Each new acquisition comes to the top of the pile in no particular order and, having just finished a wretchedly appalling so-called history of P&O Cruises (which was nothing more than blatant advertising for Carnival Cruises!), I was still a little angry when I picked up this book which just happened to be next. Almost immediately, my faith was restored.Created in 1878, the Orient Line soon became the preferred shipping company for European travel to Australia and the Far East. With a reputation for comfort and quality, the company operated 31 vessels before merging with P&O in 1960.In this carefully and skilfully produced work, the very history of the Orient Line is told through those ships, including the hardships of two world wars. Appearing in date order, each vessel is described with all the technical data and full career narrative. The Ophir of 1891, for example, spent part of her time as the official `Royal Yacht' - although it might seem almost impossible that such a relatively low-profile ship had sufficient room for that huge and very beautiful first-class dining saloon. Elsewhere, a photograph of the Otranto signed by the entire Australian cricket team of the day adds another dimension to the life-time of a ship which had two serious collisions before settling down to complete over 30 years loyal service. My own favourite, however, will always remain the Orcades - but then I did have a model of that ship when I was a boy.Not only is this an excellent work, it is also a clear demonstration of how the history of any shipping line should be written and reproduced. The author has an engaging style of writing and the entire product is lavishly illustrated with B&W historic images.

"As a shipwreck historian (it‚Äôs what I do) I study ships of all types and sizes. Currently engaged on a huge project involving the history of passenger-ships, my never-ending quest for information in recent years has favoured that particular genre. Although published in 1992, I came to this work because of the sub-title which reads; ‚ÄúFrom the golden era of ocean liners to the luxury cruise ships of today‚Äù in the expectation of finding an historical treatise on the subject. It is no such thing.This is the third work by Maxtone-Graham to cross my desk recently and each of these informs the reader he is the quintessential expert, the fount of all knowledge, the very sage itself - when it comes to the subject of big passenger-ships. Instead of learning anything of real value, however, his writing might easily be described as the perfunctory outpourings of those back-room people who are paid to produce promotional literature. The sort of people who are employed to make a company look good, make defeat look like a victory and annihilation like a temporary setback. In this particular book, we are subjected to a no-holds-barred view through the rosiest of tinted spectacles of how good cruising is and nothing else.Whereas he does occasionally mention yesterday, he does so in a style which does not seek to teach the reader of the historical context or of the technology of the day. Instead it centres on the hardships and privations of the steerage-class passenger which is then used as a platform for returning to his self-appointed theme of how good it is today. Were he selling the product it would amount to subliminal advertising.There is a lot which is right with cruising and cruise-ships and much that is very wrong. From this work, however, we are subjected to an annoyingly sycophantic repetition of preaching from the pulpit of big ship travel in which the author extols the benefits of how good cruising is now when compared to how bad it was then. It is a message which almost demands the reader partake in a modern cruise just so that their ancestors may now rest easy‚Ä¶I am mindful of the publication date of 1992 when providing the following statistics - which I have readily to hand. Similar figures for the 26 years to 1992 would take far too long to produce. Nevertheless, the message is clear.What you will not learn from this book is anything similar to the following: Between 1985 and 2010 (26 years inclusive), 177 cruise-liners are listed as having ‚Äòretired‚Äô from active cruising and you may judge the associated statistics for yourself. 107 of these ships were broken up (i.e. scrapped) at the end of their lives. These were all in poor shape and could not be used at sea any more and yet, had all recently been carrying hundreds of passengers. 18 of the remainder were lost because they sank. Another 19 were lost to fire - with three of those also sinking. Two ran aground, one capsized, one broke in two at anchor, one was abandoned, two are shown as ‚Äòfate unknown‚Äô and 26 are recorded as having changed their role. Of the latter, two became floating hotels but most of the remainder became freighters, passenger-ships or ferries - mostly in third world countries where the requisite safety regulations are not so strict. That‚Äôs OK then! A swift analysis reveals: An average of 7 ships every year ceased operating as cruise-ships. Of these, 23.7% (almost one in four!!!) came to an unfortunate end through sinking, fire or simply falling apart. Although there were four years in which no vessel was lost to accident or misfortune, there were seven when at least three met a very tragic end.These statistics are deliberately included in order to redress the extremely biased, one-sided, pleasant-dreamy-eyed view of cruising in this lengthy piece of promotional blurb.NM","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Z74WXL2EZ9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684191547#wasThisHelpful","R3Z74WXL2EZ9J","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ‚ÄòShips in Focus‚Äô series of books are an excellent resource for any serious researcher and this one is no exception. The foreword describes the content as ‚Äúthe most thorough photographic presentation yet attempted on the Blue Funnel Line‚Äù and I can confirm the images are truly outstanding and a joy to study.

"The Discovery was designed especially for Antarctic waters. She was not a naval vessel and did not, therefore, fly the white ensign even though a serving RN officer was given command.

The work is divided into six parts with each containing subordinate chapters (22 altogether).

"It is because I am currently engaged on a huge project involving passenger-ship travel through the ages that I am currently studying a large number of books which although `new to me' may not be new to others. This particular offering from a seemingly well known writer on the subject of passenger-liners, however, has left me rather bemused. Published in 1985 to great acclaim, I found it difficult to match that praise with the reality of the product. This is a thick book (almost 500 pages) which would easily have benefitted from a larger format and the inclusion of glossy photographs as opposed to reproducing the 250 or so B&W images on the same poor quality paper as the over-laborious text. It really is hard-going.In trying to describe any book, I sometimes repeat the chapter headings in order to demonstrate the content. In this case there are 10 chapters as follows; Cruise Lines, Newbuilding, Class Distinctions, Cruises Past, Tropical Rig, Cabin Fever, Backstage, Dark Nights, Cruises Present and Cruises to Come - none of which do anything to suggest what the reader might find within.In a work which seeks to explain the whole culture of the cruise liner - past, present and future, the passengers of old and the passengers of today, the ships, the personalities and just about everything else you might consider relevant to such a work, I found it outstanding for being so boring. Ships are exciting places, they all have the most remarkable histories, the next port of call is always different from the last and who knows who or what might be encountered around that next corner or over that next wave - but we find none of that here. Instead we dwell upon the trivia of the non-descript - almost as though it were the very cruise ship owners who had commissioned the work to show them in a good light. In short, it is memorable for its complete emptiness!Only this morning I read an unrelated book review in which the reviewer explained from personal experience the difference between the wrought-iron rivet and the steel rivet. In just a few words, I learned something of importance which was also fascinating - about a RIVET! In the almost 500 pages from this work, I made no notes for my own future use  because there was nothing of significance to be learned.I was not previously aware of John Maxtone-Graham whose previous roles in life include Broadway stage manager and film producer. Perhaps he moved on to the subject of cruise liners because he also imbued those former careers with equally forgettable performances. Having just learned he is now writing a ""new book about the Titanic"" (aren't they all `new' books when they first appear?), his predictability becomes complete. So much fact and fiction about the Titanic has already been provided in book form and on screen that, whatever may be written in the future, however factual or farcical, will always have some who firmly believe in what has been written - and that is always a good fall-back position for any author seeking a subject.NM","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSHSECENK75R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J0YUXO#wasThisHelpful","RZSHSECENK75R","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Conway's are a leading British publisher of maritime subjects and internationally recognised for the quality of the works they produce. It says much for this particular series that there are many devotees who can't wait for the next edition and, once again, are not likely to be disappointed. That said, the brief title `Warship 2014' may give the impression of only the latest ships and technology being included. Not so! My own particular area of interest stems from shipwrecks and requires me to study historic vessels of all types and I found a great deal of interest here.Whereas those vessels that never got beyond the drawing board, rarely grab my attention, the splendid account of the Royal Navy aircraft carrier cancelled in 1966 was particularly fascinating. Other features include; Amiral Charner class cruisers, German battleships Braunschweig & Deutschland, the Japanese armoured cruisers which fought at Tsushima, the new Italian aircraft carrier Cavour, Admiral Lazarev & Admiral Spiridov class frigates, the IJN light carrier Ry˚j√¥, Post-WW2 fire control in the Royal Navy and the incredible story of the escape from St. Nazaire during WW2 of the incomplete French battleship Jean Bart. The work then concludes with `Warship Notes' (a selection of short articles), Book reviews and Warship Gallery - with the latter being an amazing series of photographs depicting the building of the French battleship Libert√© (laid down 1903, completed 1908) at St Nazaire.Clearly, therefore, this book has something for everyone but there is also another dimension which sets it apart from anything else. Each of the contributing authors is an acknowledged expert in his own right - with many, if not all, having several publications to their own name. Each of these talents has produced one of the aforementioned chapters - all of which have been skilfully brought together under the equally expert editorship of John Jordan.The entire work is lavishly illustrated with countless B&W images of the highest calibre showing ships and the many features and equipment they carried. These are supported by artwork which includes; general arrangements, line drawing (profiles, sections and inboard configurations) side-view and deck plans of various vessels and weapon systems.If I could suggest a simple improvement (and none more are needed) it would be to provide larger scale plans and profiles in `pull-out' format - although I did not encounter any serious problems with the size of material provided.Altogether, therefore, we have a product from a leading publisher in which the specific detail is provided by a highly qualified and experienced team of writers you know you can trust. For some, the technical information will be invaluable. For others, the quality of the `read' is most important.

"I am currently studying passenger-ships as part of an extensive project with which I am involved and, as with all intensive research, the quest is the acquisition of trustworthy information. Sadly there are not enough quality products available. This one, however, stands mast and funnel above the rest because everyone involved with the book knows their subject - and that subject is the Liner.'Conway Maritime Marine' are a leading British publisher of maritime subjects and it says much for author Philip Dawson that they have published several of his works. With a foreword written by Stephen Payne - the Chief naval architect for the Queen Mary 2, everything about this scholarly work exudes value, class, knowledge and detail in every respect. Of all the books I have on the subject, this one belongs in a class of its own. And if that is not enough, it is also well written and, therefore, a fascinating read.There are so many separate elements to the work it is impossible to mention them all. The design features of various ships are included - with a large section devoted to the Queen Mary 2. The fact that certain features from the design of one ship were then used in another or to overcome problems elsewhere is utterly intriguing. This is not, however, all about modern ships. The beginning of passenger travel across the oceans - especially across the North Atlantic, is also covered in refreshing detail. Here is an author who not only knows his subject and is, therefore, able to put his own gloss onto the topic, he also delves into history and provides a writing style which leaves the reader eager to learn more.Many works devoted to transatlantic passenger travel over the years have been accused of being pro-British or pro-European because of the number of ships from that side of the `pond' being featured. Whereas there is no place for such nationalistic nonsense in any serious study (and certainly none here!), it was the overwhelming numbers of emigrant passengers which dominated the industry for many years. As such, the passenger traffic was very one-sided with people seeking a new life in America and not vice versa. As with any trade which originates on one side of the Atlantic, the response will always come from that same side.Nevertheless, before all that traffic really got underway, it was the American paddle-steamer (side-wheeler) `Savannah' which crossed the Atlantic in 1819 to prove steam-powered vessels were capable of making such a journey. In this rather complete work, therefore, we find many of the greatest ships ever to embark on that particular crossing. With images of the early Cunard paddle-steamer Britannia arriving in Boston in 1840, through the years to the latest vessels, it would be easy to provide the reader with a list of famous names - all of which are mentioned here somewhere. Instead, another reason why this work sits apart from all others is that vessels such as the Orcades (always a personal favourite), Dominion Monarch, L'Atlantique, Europa, Bremen, Orion and Baltic (and many more) - which were never household names, are also included.The most important point of all, however, is that this work is not about any particular shipping company or any number of ships, people or places. It is the complete story of transatlantic travel - all of it, from the very beginning to modern times. It is a lengthy story, involving many people, shipping lines, inventions, modifications, two world wars and millions of passengers. It is a story I would have thought could not be told in a single book. Now it is!NM","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YNTXSZSHOH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393061663#wasThisHelpful","R29YNTXSZSHOH1","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In between the `bookends' of a Preface written by the current MD of P&O Cruises and a Foreword by the chief executive of Carnival UK (both right at the beginning) and a Conclusion at the very end provided by the chairman and chief executive, Carnival Corporation Plc, this is such a sympathetic view of P&O Cruises it amounts to nothing more than over-lengthy promotional literature.

"Prior to 1932, Italian ships lacked some vital quality until the Rex was completed and all that changed. During WW2, however, Italy lost so many ships she needed to do something to capture the world‚Äôs imagination. Building the two sister-ships - Andrea Doria and Cristoforo Colombo, enabled the country to demonstrate the very best of Italian luxury and design. The Andrea Doria was launched on 16 June 1951 and was the first ship ever to have 3 swimming pools - one for each class of passenger. On 26 July 1956, she was in collision with the Stockholm and sank with the loss of 51 lives from both vessels.I mention the foregoing as an example of what is missing from this child‚Äôs scrapbook of photographs. Firstly, the Andrea Doria was an important ship and was on her 101st crossing of the Atlantic when she was lost. She is not, however, included in this book and is only mentioned in passing on page 152 as part of the briefest possible (100 words) description of the Cristoforo Colombo. Furthermore, the abysmal photograph of that latter ship is taken in a busy harbour at an odd angle in a manner which fails to demonstrate the ship‚Äôs lines. That image takes up a full half page. Of the remainder, about one third is taken up with the aforementioned text and, in keeping with almost every other page, the rest is left blank. Yes, huge white spaces on almost every page. In publishing terms it amounts to padding without any padding.With so many blank spaces to catch the eye, it soon becomes apparent how little or no time was expended on the text. The Himalaya is described in just 25 words, the Conte Biancamano in 22 and the Oronsay in only twelve! In short, you could read this book from start to finish in the time it takes to wait your turn to see your doctor (assuming they are not running late).As a shipwreck historian (it‚Äôs what I do) I study ships of all types, sizes and nationalities. In so doing, I never tire of looking at good photographs (especially historic images) of ships. In a work which boasts of being a photographic record, I can honestly say IT IS NO SUCH THING! A single obscure photograph of one ship is nothing more than a single image of a particular subject. That is not a photographic record of anything at all. As for the images themselves, I had already seen most, if not all, elsewhere and the book holds no secrets or surprises in that regard.In reality, all we have is an odd selection of historic photographs thrown together in a manner reminiscent of a child‚Äôs scrapbook with very poor captions covering some (not all) of those ships described by the title. As such, I am hugely disappointed and will probably consign this and the sister-work to the bin.NM","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YUQRWMQ1IVOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486240568#wasThisHelpful","R2YUQRWMQ1IVOO","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When one thinks of ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô cruise ships and ocean liners all those famous names and even more famous tragedies spring easily to mind. When put into the context of 1954 to 1986 (far too specific when fifties to eighties would have been far more comfortable) one has to pause and think of which ships fit that period. One of these was the last-ever four funnelled ship still afloat - the Arundel Castle which, although reduced to two funnels in 1937, is worthy of her rightful place in history.In December 1958, the Arundel Castle was finally taken out of service and scrapped the following year. She is not, however, included here - although her only sister ship is mentioned on page 75. That vessel was the Windsor Castle which was lost to aerial torpedo on 23 March 1943 - a full 11 years prior to the period covered by this book. But that is not the only oddity found here!Whereas my comments might appear very ‚Äòpicky-picky,‚Äô the inclusion of such ships as; the African Endeavour, African Enterprise, Alco Cavalier discharging a cargo of Bauxite at Mobile, Gothic, Exeter, Brasil Star, Santa Monica, State of Madras and so many, many more are worthy of mention for very good reasons. None would have sprung to the minds of anyone who was applying the word ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô to any type of passenger ship and they certainly do not even remotely fit the title of this book.Of those which were amongst the good and great, the Andrea Doria tragedy is told in 230 words - a feat of brevity which will forever become enshrined in the annuls of maritime history, if only because it can‚Äôt be done! That particular entry also comes with two well-worn pictures - one of the sinking ship and another of the damaged Stockholm in New York (yawn!). Nobody bothered to mention that, after several changes of names, the Stockholm is still in service to this day - as we approach the 59th anniversary of that disaster.I am currently studying passenger-ships as part of a huge project which has been ongoing for some time. Part of my research includes the purchase of all manner of books and other documents relating to those ships. Not all great ships were famous and not all famous ships were great. In a work which is full of tired photographs and the briefest possible captions to accompany those images we have a book which proclaims itself to be about the ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô whilst barely managing to include a few from that category. Saddest of all, of those which are included - none afforded true justice!NM","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O7R2HJ1OXWBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486255409#wasThisHelpful","R1O7R2HJ1OXWBA","A2W7WH9V5OKUA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W7WH9V5OKUA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use these for Aikido training (you are on your knees a lot).  Knee pads are a great help.  Open back pads are essential because of time spent in formal Japanese sitting position, where you need flexibility to completely fold your knees.  These pads are lightweight and seem quite durable.  I've used them over the years and they even seem to stand up to being laundered with a little bit of bleach.  (Knee pads are sweat catchers for sure, and need to be washed frequently.)I used the Adams size guide when I first bought a pair, and when I first put them on I thought they were too tight.  However after use I realized if they are too loose they will slide around and you'll constantly be pulling them up.  Even with the size recommended it is occasionally necessary to move them back into place.

I am angry about the deliberate disabling of critical features in TurboTax Deluxe.  No Schedules C, D, or E.  In the past, the product was functional, even though the ""Premier"" version provided more help and guidance.  That was extra functionality and if you needed it you could buy it.  But in Deluxe you got the forms, the basic help info, the IRS docs, the final review checking, printing, and e-filing.  So if you knew what a schedule C or D was (it's not that hard) you could file your taxes.Now in the name of ""consistency"" this has been taken away, and if I want to file my taxes using TurboTax I need to buy something much more expensive.  I have read the words about how Intuit labored over the vital need to be ""consistent"" and yes indeed after their stressful labors they did indeed cripple the product and they will try to force people to buy the much more expensive version.  Please be honest -- just step up and say you decided to charge a lot more money.

Even in this high-priced Premier version, Schedule C is crippled -- limited to $100 of deductions in a couple of expense categories.

"Just got this printer.  Probably going to send it back.  If you use it in a busy office with lots of background noise, it might be a great low cost printer.

I have the printer set to go into sleep mode after 1 minute, but the fan will go on for another 10 minutes.  Called tech support, they confirmed there is nothing you can do it about it, no configuration option to reduce the time.

"This device seems well built.  I've had no trouble with it.  The two pull-up hinged ports are convenient for devices that are added temporarily, as it makes the port easier to get at in the typical jumble of cables.  You do need to be aware that you can't plug in 10 max-power devices, but it seems that an average mix of max- and low-power devices works fine.  Nor can you fully power certain Apple products, which connect via USB but which draw more power than the USB standard specifies (so they like a special non-standard port.)  This is all documented.  Having 10 ports really helps me keep everything neatly connected at my desktop.  I have a number of things that are usually off or unused, but I like to have them ready to go, and my old 7-port hub wasn't enough.I'd give this 5 stars except for two small issues.  (1) I'd prefer a more linear port arrangement (like a single bar with all the ports closely spaced parallel rather than edgewise) for neater more compact cabling. And if the ports were facing up on a bar arrangement, the flip-up feature wouldn't really be needed. (2) There are bright blue lights to tell you it's on (put some tape over them if located in your bedroom...) but no lights to tell you that a port is active.  If I could I'd give this 4-1/2 stars as these aren't a really big deal for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3CBMPLONOP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00483WRZ6#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3CBMPLONOP0","A2DRURXLBMP77K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DRURXLBMP77K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This holster seems very well built, with genuine leather rather than the ""leatherette"" material used in other cheaper products.If you have silicone or rubber protective case on your phone it could be a tight fit.  I have an HTC Evo 4G Design with a rubber protector.  The Design model is slightly narrower than other Evo models, and it just barely fits with a snug fit.Speaking of snug fits, I wish this holster had a cutout or hole to allow you to push the phone up from the bottom.  I had another phone with a cheaply made holster, but one thing I liked was the ease of removal by sticking a finger in the bottom and pushing up.  For this I give 4 stars rather than 5.The other issue is probably an issue with any belt holster and big smartphone:  There really isn't a good place to have it on your belt.  If in front, you bang into it when getting things from your pockets or just when your arms move.  If on the side or rear you worry about crushing the phone when you sit.  Because smartphones are so big, you have a long wide package on your belt.  And this genuine leather product is a bit bulkier than the cheaper fake leather holsters.  The product is good, so this is just something to keep in mind before ordering any holster.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31O16PA2YKIMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UHWGWY#wasThisHelpful","R31O16PA2YKIMC","A2DRURXLBMP77K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DRURXLBMP77K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have an older Dell Inspiron 600M laptop that works well enough except the power connection was intermittent because the power connector jack was worn and loose.  While even the cheapest new laptop would be more powerful than the old one, it does cost something and it's a pain to spend time configuring the new one to match the old one.  So I found some hints online about how to do the repair and bought this jack, which works perfectly for not much money.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Don't attempt this repair unless you are handy with a fine tip soldering iron and you know how to de-solder a connection.  The Dell service manual will NOT tell you how to do this -- follow the service manual to disassemble the unit down to the motherboard, and after that you'll have to find your own way.  Make notes of the steps so you can put it back together.  Look at it and think about it before each step.  Or go to Costco and buy the cheapest laptop you can find (which will be more powerful than this one...)  If you're handy with this stuff you can do the job in about an hour.

"I use this as my power supply when the laptop is on my desk.  One wiring harness with two connectors leads to the laptop (power and USB) and then I get three USB ports out. (That's not enough for all the stuff I've got, so one leads to another USB hub, but his helps increase my available desktop ports by just enough for my purposes.)  It comes with a velcro tie that I used to keep the two wires bound together.The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that one of the ports is a power-only port.  It is nice that it is always powered (and maybe even that's good because I can power something without it establishing a connection to my laptop) but I wish I could get an extra USB port for a total of four.  What you are getting is 3 USB ports and a charger port (always on if plugged in.)  If three is enough, then great.  If you need another hub, then really you're only getting two extra ports.Also it would be nice to have a power LED just to verify it's plugged in and working.Overall I'm pleased and the build quality seems solid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HDYSPYC205/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044KR91U#wasThisHelpful","R28HDYSPYC205","A2DRURXLBMP77K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DRURXLBMP77K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm writing this review after a few days, so I can't comment on long term durability.  That being said, I found this screen protector to be packaged well and a perfect fit. It seems to be a quality product. As others have noted, if you get even a tiny spec of dust under it, you will really notice it.  However, if you are careful to clean the screen first, then use the included cleaning cloth as step two, and tilt the screen while looking almost edgewise for dust, you can get rid of everything. Because it's an exact fit, you have to be very careful in application to start it going straight.  (Take off any other protective sleeve first so you have edge-to-edge access to the full glass.) For me it applied smoothly and cleanly.  I did get one spec of dust, so using tape I lifted one edge carefully, cleaned, and rolled it down again.  It makes me feel a lot better having the phone in my pocket - with a rubber protective sleeve covering the sides and back, and this screen protector on the front, I don't worry about minor scratches.  If the protector gets scratched, well this is a two-pack, so off with the old and on with the new.

"This shoulder wrap works effectively as a cold pack. (Haven't tried the warm option.  Instructions say to warm in microwave in a bowl of water, although I suspect you could get away with warming directly using a lower power setting, but I don't know for sure.)  With the cold option it holds the gel packs in the right position for things like rotator cuff injuries.  It seems well made.As others have noted, it is difficult to put on single-handed.  It's easy with another person to help.  To do it yourself, you'd almost have to pre-set the large band that goes under the opposite arm and put it on over your head on the other side.  This would only work if you could easily raise the opposite arm.  Then there is a final strap that you could probably put in place yourself with some effort.If you have a spouse or friend who can help you get it on, it's a fine product, particularly as a cold pack.Other reviewers complained that the cold pack doesn't last for hours, and indeed it doesn't.  But you're not suppose to have it on for a really long time, and no gel pack product will stay cold for a really long time.  I think it works properly.

"Our dog is on a lifelong limited ingredient diet due to inflammatory bowel disease.  He eats the venison & potato dry food and gets a low maintenance dose of prednisone.  The IVD (now Royal Canin) food worked well, but we've were outraged by the constant price hikes and annoyed by the inconvenience of only be able to buy the food at a vet.  Then we discovered Natural Balance.  On a price per pound basis it's about half the price. Our dog has done very well with this food.  Although there is no way for me to be sure, I also think it's likely that sweet potato is more nutritious than plain potato, so that's another benefit.  If you buy from Amazon there is free shipping and no sales tax, as well.The food is a little more dense, so if you're switching from Royal Canin you might want to weigh your regular feeding of the old food, and determine how much of a scoop of the new food gives the same weight.  Not a big difference, but if you want to feed the exact same amount then go by weight.Very pleased with this food.  It's still expensive, but not like the thuggish price gouging from Royal Canin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAX7N3H0VQ1NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018CJJ9W#wasThisHelpful","RAX7N3H0VQ1NP","A2DRURXLBMP77K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DRURXLBMP77K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided I wanted to be in control of how closely my dog is clipped and I wanted to save money on groomers as well.  (No matter what we say, the groomers always seem to want to shave the dog much too closely.)  This clippers seems to be well built, as least for cleaning up my German Wirehaired Pointer.  I can't tell how well it would work for a heavy thick coat, but for this purpose it worked very well.  It's heavy and there is a fair amount of vibration, but not really a problem to work with.Why not 5 stars?  (1) The comb attachments seem flimsy (they worked fine, but I don't completely trust their durability.)  (2) The included DVD isn't great.  Fuzzy images and I was hoping for more explanation of how to groom various kinds of dogs.  (3) When I someday need to remove the blade for more thorough cleaning, the instructions are not clear.This clipper kit is inexpensive, and for occasional use I think it's excellent value for the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E1NOZN5NL2DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RCTIM6#wasThisHelpful","R2E1NOZN5NL2DG","A2DRURXLBMP77K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DRURXLBMP77K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Don't expect to edit a PDF as if it were a Word document.  It's pretty painful to make major edits to a typical PDF.  But if you need to make a correction, or create fillable form fields in a document, or add/delete an image, or assemble several documents into one PDF, and so on, this tool works well and it's far cheaper than the Adobe product.  The ability to print to PDF means that you can create a PDF from virtually anything you can print.  I also like the feature that lets you pull out all of the text and all of the images from a PDF.It comes with an Office plug-in.  I suggest not installing that.  In Office 2003, the resulting toolbar doesn't behave quite right (repositions itself every time you open Word.)  For the rare occasion you need to convert a PDF into Word format, just use the Nitro program directly (and remember, the resulting Word document won't be that easy to edit.)  To create a PDF, just print to PDF. If you have Office 2007 or 2010 then you already have the Office option to Save As PDF.  The Nitro plug-in is not needed and it just slows the startup time of the Office apps.There are a few glitches and deficiencies, but if you do a lot of document prep where you need to deal with PDFs and you don't want to spend the big bucks for Adobe tools, this is the program to buy.  It's not perfect but it's excellent value for money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYC07BTX7MOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PY3YWU#wasThisHelpful","R3MYC07BTX7MOH","A2DRURXLBMP77K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DRURXLBMP77K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PaintShop has a great feature set, and this version expands on that.  If only they'd pay attention to some details, this could be a 5-star product, but as it is, I will give it 3.  I haven't used it enough to encounter stability issues.  Once installed (on Win XP SP3) it seems to work, but the install had some confusing glitches and took a LONG time.  I have not tried to use the Project Creator.  For PaintShop itself, these things are annoying:(1) the Organizer is a big step backwards.  You no longer have a filmstrip of images along the bottom as you work.  Instead you must switch back and forth between Edit mode and Organizer mode.  If the switch were instantaneous I could live with it, but it's painfully slow.  And as others have pointed out, if you were working on an say image 75 that required you scroll ahead in the Organizer, when you come back from Edit and want to get to image 76, well you have to flip forward again because the Organizer didn't remember where you were. (In thumbnail mode it does seem to remember where you are.) When you have images open and unsaved, there is no visual cue in Organizer mode, so it's easy to forget. when This combined with how slow it is really hurts the workflow.(2) Express Lab is more powerful, and does have the filmstrip on the bottom.  You can now increase sharpness in Express Lab, but only by a fixed amount per click.  WHY don't the Smart Photo Fix suggested settings match the Smart Photo Fix suggested settings in Edit mode?  Why not a slider for sharpening?  And why don't all the standard Express Lab buttons fit in the default display (the Delete and Help buttons require you to click on the ""more buttons"" icon.  Better figure that you if you need Help in Express Lab...)  Express Lab would be a great workflow for quickly processing lots of images if only Corel would pay attention to these interface details.(3) It's very slow to start, and seems a bit sluggish in operation.Overall a useful product with excellent features at a very good price.  If Corel could just get it together to make the details be right, it would be a great product.

"This USB charger is out of the way (other chargers stick way out) so that's really nice.  It appears to supply enough power for more power-hungry devices (smartphones, GPS) although only one at a time.  However, it did not stay seated in my lighter plug.  The internal spring tended to push it slightly out so that it would stop charging.  I fixed it with a little duct tape wrapped around the barrel so now it's a tight fit.  (By the way, this unit fits flush, so if it is in tightly, don't plan on just popping it in and out on a daily basis.)  I also find the USB connector to be a bit loose.  So far it hasn't caused any problem because in my car the cable doesn't get knocked around very much.  But I feel it should fit a little more tightly.

"This is an excellent high-quality paper at a great price.  HOWEVER when they ship it they just toss individual reams of paper into a bigger box.  So during shipping the packages bounce around, and needless to say some of them split open.  The big box was sturdy, but some amount of the paper was damaged (and the blue wrapper ink rubs off on the paper as well.)  I could use 95% of the paper so I didn't bother complaining or asking to ship it back.  But depending on what happens during shipment, the damage could have been more extensive.  What they ought to do is ship a CARTON of paper in its original box as shown in the product illustration, and then place that full carton inside the sturdy outer shipping box.So it's 5 stars for the paper and 1 star for the shipping, giving a 3 star rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDSTWS9GRNZDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001V5J4T6#wasThisHelpful","RDSTWS9GRNZDM","A2DRURXLBMP77K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DRURXLBMP77K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd give this 5 stars because it's small (stays out of the way in my car) and it has a higher charging capacity than some other similar chargers. But I'd give it 2 stars because in my car (Volvo 850) the charger would not stay in the socket -- it did not snap in tightly or did not have enough friction fit. (Another review said it stuck in so tightly that you had to consider it semi-permanent -- my experience is the opposite.)  Similarly, the USB socket seems like it's not a tight fit either.  I resolved both to my satisfaction by judicious application of some carefully placed strips of duct tape, and now it's fine. But really this isn't right.  So I give the product 3 stars overall.

"This leather case for the HTC Ozone phone fits really well and it is quite convenient to use.  It's well designed, there is a small cutout at the bottom that makes it easy to push the phone out from below which I thought was a nice touch.  The magnetic closures work nicely.  I suspect the inner velvet lining may not be extremely durable, so I would plan on buying a new one in a year.  Since the price was only 1/4 of what the Verizon store wanted for a carrier that was much bulkier and less convenient, this is a great value.

"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the Fire HD 8 from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon removed the Fire HD7, the Fire HDX7 and the Fire HDX8.9 and replaced them with the Fire HD (7"" screen), Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.HARDWARE:WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: The HD8 Fire, a short USB cord and a power adapter. Finally, Amazon ships a power adapter with their Fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (Picture attached)SIZE: The HD8 is longer than the older HD7 but the same width as the discontinued HD7. It is also thinner. (8.4""x5.0""x0.3"" versus 7.5""x5.0""x0.4""). I have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, I really need to use both hands. Because it is longer, it seem ""top heavy"" to me. The back is also slick and slippery to hold. Mine has a habit of sliding off the table.Display: The resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the HD 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. In practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. The display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. One nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper! It comes with 9 stock images and if you don't like one of them, you can choose your own image in your Amazon Photos folder.BATTERY: Like the HD6 and the HD7, the battery in the HD8 is rated at approximately 8 hours of mixed use. I wish Amazon had included the 11-hour battery life of the HDX7. The extra 3 rated hours of older HDX7 is a substantial improvement on the new HD8. With this device, I have to travel with a portable battery charger when flying across the country. I also have to constantly stay close to a plug at home when using it heavily while I browse the internet or watch videos. Realistically, I can use it for about 4-5 hours before trying to find power.STORAGE: The HD8 can be ordered with 8 GB or 16GB. However, Amazon has now added a slot where you can insert a microSD card. All Fire tablets support all classes of Ultra High Speed (UHS) MicroSD Cards. Important! For non-UHS MicroSD cards, Amazon recommends Class 10 MicroSD cards for optimal performance. Class 2 MicroSD cards may not perform well enough to support video playback or capturing burst mode photos. Although most apps can be stored on the SD card, I recommend that you order the 16GB version of the HD8 as not all apps can be loaded on the SD card, including downloaded books. You will need more than the 8 GB if you plan on downloading any books, music, videos or take photos. You can probably get by with buying the 16 GB version and using it without an SD card. If you find a need to store more content, you can always add the SD card later.The SD card slot is located on the upper right side of the device (see picture). You just open the flap and pop the SD card in. The slot is spring-loaded so that a push should spring it out again. The spring was rather stiff in my device and I had a heck of a time getting it to seat in the slot without popping out again. But once I got it to stay in, the card has performed flawlessly.WIFI: Amazon has improved the WiFi from the HD7. It comes with a dual-band antenna that operates under the a/b/g/n/ac protocols using both the 2.4 Ghz and the 5 Ghz frequency range. I live where there are about 30 routers that the HD8 can detect and it picks up my router fine without a lot of interference. I would rate the WiFi performance of the HD 8 as above average.SOUND: This is where the HD 8 shines. Amazon has upgraded the sound with Dolby Atmos and dual stereo speakers. While there are not very many movies or videos available yet, when they do become available, you're set.Atmos is a new surround sound technology, developed in 2012, that expands upon the current 5.1 and 7.1 set-ups. With Atmos, each speaker has its own feed, enabling new front, surround and ceiling-mounted height channels. I was watching a movie with cheap headphones and thought I heard helicopters fly by my house. It took me a minute to realize that the sound was from the helicopters in the movie. It really sounded like they were coming from the left and moving to the right OVERHEAD. Wow, I was impressed!!The volume buttons are placed along the top of the HD 8 along with the power button, the headphone jack and the power receptacle. So all the buttons you would touch are on top. No buttons are on the sides or bottom.Amazon improved the placement of the speakers on the HD8 by moving them from the back to the side of the device. Still not as good as having them on the front, but better than the back. I found that just placing my palm behind a speaker reflects the sound to the front for improved listening. Speaker sound is pretty good for normal listening.CAMERA: The back camera is not bad and it is considerably better than the camera on the new basic Fire HD. The front camera might be OK for Skyping but color saturation and focus aren't that great on the front. There is no flash on the back so all pictures have to be taken in adequate lighting.All the pictures uploaded to this review were taken by the back camera of an HD8 so judge for yourself. I have uploaded pictures of1. The new basic HD 7 on top of the HD 8.2. The device, cord and power adapter included with the device.3. The new HD8 (magenta) next to the old HD7 (pink but called magenta). As you can see the shades are different.4. The front screen of the old HD7 and the new HD 8.5. The new basic Fire HD, the HD8 and the HD10, side-by-side.6. Screen showing carousel of apps loaded and running7. New home, back and app buttons on bottom of screen8. Top of HD8 showing power and volume buttons.SOFTWARE:When I turned on the HD8 and started through the initial setup, it immediately had to download updated software and reboot. After that setup was slightly quicker and easier than the older devices but very similar.The HD8 software version is Fire OS 5 which is a redesigned Amazon skin that runs on top of Android Lollipop version 5.1. There are a lot of changes from Fire OS 4. First, the carousel is gone. In its place, Amazon has tabs across the top (under a search line) called RECENT, HOME, BOOKS, VIDEO, GAMES, SHOP, and APPS. You swipe right or left to move back and forth between tabs or touch the tab name. The HOME tab starts with a row called ""New Items"" with icons for the latest books, videos, etc. that you have downloaded or purchased. Under that is the traditional grid of apps. The RECENT tab contains a grid of icons of the most recent used items for the device. In order to read books, watch movies, etc., you must either swipe to or touch the appropriate tab.You are not going to get away from Amazon's marketing on these tabs. For instance, the BOOKS tab has a row call ""FROM YOUR BOOKS LIBRARY"" which displays a couple of icons of your books. At the right is small text link that you can touch titled ""See all your books."" Under that you have ""Recommended for you in Kindle Unlimited."" (I don't subscribe to Kindle Unlimited so don't know why I need that.) Below that are more rows ""Recommended for you."" Best Sellers, Recommended for you in Mystery, Thriller and Suspense, Recommended for you in Science Fiction, Recommended for you in Nonfiction, etc. with a ""See more products"" link and a ""SHOP KINDLE BOOKSTORE"" link at the bottom. The tab contains lots of real estate acreage for selling books with a postage-stamp sized lot for my stuff.The older Fires have three icons on the bottom of some screens that were a back arrow, a house and a search magnifier for back, home and search respectively.  The new Fires have three new icons: a left-facing triangle, a circle and a square (see picture uploaded). These are available on every screen. The left-facing triangle is the back button, the circle is the home button and the square brings up the currently running or loaded apps. This is a new feature that you can access from anywhere, including the home screen. Hit the square and a carousel of loaded apps appears. You can browse up and down the list, close any running apps or hit the one you want to open. (see uploaded photo)I haven't used the device but a day but I am already disappointed. The new FIRE OS 5 operating system has quite a few bugs. I was reading email and a couple of times when I opened up a daily email from bookbub.com which contains quite a pictures of book covers. Paging down to email caused the screen to wig out with color lines and blocks of randomly colored squares. If you ever had an HD television that pixelated on the screen because of a weak signal and it couldn't decode the signal, you know what I mean. I should note that the processors in all three new Fires are slow and can't keep up. Switching screens, browsing, and even reading has some hesitation or delays.The new Fire OS 5 also has problems with collections. Because I have thousands of books, I use collections extensively for my book inventory. I have categories such as ""Books Already Read,"" ""Sci Fi,"" ""Mystery,"" ""Currently Reading,"" etc. Every book I buy, I assign it to a category of its genre, whether it is in my reading queue, currently reading or have already read. This is the way I can find anything quickly, including what I am reading. Anyway, when assigning new books to categories on the new FIRE's, the assignments won't stick. In Fire OS 5, in order to assign a book, you have to go to the ""BOOK"" tab, select ""See all your books"" on the right of the first row, hold-press the book icon to select it, hit the plus button in the upper right bring up the collection list, click the collections to add to, and hit the OK button. You do all and bring up the book collection list only to find that the book you assigned to the collection isn't there. You go through the process again and guess what, it comes up blank. I can't seem to assign books to collections, especially if they are in the cloud. So I have to grab my trusty Paperwhite or older Fire to assign books to categories.IN SUMMARY:The HD8 has several nice features and some aggravating features. The new FIRE OS 5 is a different experience but is too buggy to be used seriously. The hardware is improved with the addition of a microSD card slot. However, the battery still sucks but at least Amazon includes a power adapter which you should keep close when using the HD 8. You'll need it.The HD 8 is certainly a substantial upgrade over the basic $49 Fire HD but it costs quite a bit more. The HD 10 is essentially the same, just a bigger screen. (See uploaded side-by-side pictures for comparison) FYI. The icons, etc. are the same size on the HD 8 and the HD 10. The HD 10 puts more ""space"" between the icons and shows more content.Should you buy the HD 8? If you have an older Fire, NO. I can't see a compelling reason to ""upgrade"" because it is not really an upgrade. There are too many problems with the OS. In fact, I would probably buy an equivalently-priced Android or Apple tablet over this one--especially if you are using the internet for browsing or like to play games. At least you will have access to Google or Apple store for the wealth of apps available that aren't in Amazon's Fire Store.If you primarily read books, get either the Paperwhite or the Voyage. Either of these devices are outstanding for reading books, having high quality screens that you can read in the dark or the bright sunlight as well as a battery that will last weeks instead of hours.If you are set on buying one of Amazon's new Fire's and can't decide which one, I would recommend the FIRE HD 6. I carry that little tablet everywhere. It fits in a purse; it fits in a pocket; it even fits in a nook in my car and I can connect it to the car's Bluetooth to read Audible books and play my music when driving. Although small, the screen resolution is outstanding on the HD 6 and it runs the stable Fire OS 4 operating system. If you just HAVE to get one of the new devices, get either this one or the basic Fire HD. I prefer the HD 8 over the basic Fire because1) the battery is 8 hours versus 7 hours,2) better sound,3) much better WiFi,4) faster processor (even this one is slow),5) higher resolution screen6) better cameras,7) better audio8) you can get this in the 16GB version and9) you can pick your own color.Later as I continue to use these new Fire HDs, I'll update my review.====================","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EVJ6BKH2PX0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIEBNX6#wasThisHelpful","R3EVJ6BKH2PX0X","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She had left him angry after a fight for unknown reasons only to disappear for 7 months and then show up again after being presumed dead.Desmond Bixby or Bix is the fiance of Caitlin's other personality, Katherine Southard. He knows ""Katie"" as a much wilder, seedier woman. Together with Josh, her husband, he helps Katie in her search for the truth.Charlotte Hunnsaker is the detective trying to find the identity of the dead body and who killed him.Mike Bookerman is a bad guy who is also dead but the characters don't know this in the beginning.Chops is another bad guy who uses a persona of a successful building contractor when he is not killing people.Summary:This psychological thriller is not the usual ""what is going to happen next,"" edge-of-your-seat story. Rather, it is based on the personality of Caitlin Sommers seeking to discover what has already happened with the help of both her husband, Josh, and her fiance, Bix. The book is well edited and the author, James Hankins, has an excellent writing style. My main criticism is that he begins the book with some unrealistic premises and actions. Other reviewers comment on this. I was put off by the unrealistic reactions of the characters in the beginning but kept reading to discover that the story does become more interesting.This is a book that you will either really like or really hate. If you enjoy a well-written thriller that doesn't use a detective or lawyer as the main character but is still a crime book, this book is for you. If more realistic personalities and actions are important to you, pass this book on by.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XKWX5IJQJSO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXY7HK0#wasThisHelpful","R2XKWX5IJQJSO3","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pomegranate puzzles quality is comparable to Ravensburger puzzles.Pomegranate uses art such as paintings or in this case, stained glass as images for their puzzles. This puzzle has a nice cardboard backing with a matte-type printing which prevents glare from overhead lighting. The pieces are nearly all interlocking.This might look like an easy, 500-piece puzzle but don't be fooled. It is difficult to tell if a piece belongs to the peacocks head, tail or background. And the cut sometimes lines up with the color changes, so it is challenging to find a neighboring piece. You also can't always tell the orientation of many of the pieces so you have to try them rightside up, sideways or upside down to find the correct fit.It took 2 adults 5 days to get this one done. The finished puzzle was so beautiful that we left it together for a few days and took pictures of it before breaking it down.In summary, a nice puzzle to put together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23KM1KHLCRSDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A1CM9K6#wasThisHelpful","R23KM1KHLCRSDK","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The novel, True Conviction, is both very good and very bad.The good:The author has talent. There is a lot about the story I like. He has great mastery of dialog and point of view. He also can develop engaging and interesting characters. The type of readers who might like this book are young teenage boys who don't care about reality and like super heroes. Mature audiences or those adverse to some swearing should pass this book for something better.The bad:First, a good editor and classes in proper English would help. Verbs are notoriouly misused. The book is riddled with improper tense and selection between singular and plural forms.Second, the author needs to do research about the United States. He has no clue as to geography or U.S. government or customs. He places the story in a town called Heaven's Valley, Nevada that is 150 miles north of Las Vegas. It is described as very hot, by a freeway and the sun doesn't set until after 10:00 pm.For British readers, the United States is about the size of the entire continent of Europe and the state of Nevada alone is almost 40% larger than the island of Great Britain. 150 miles north of Las Vegas is in the middle of nowhere where nobody lives in the large, long valleys ranging fom 5000-6000 feet in altitude bordered by mountains 11000-13000 feet high. Yup, the difference in altitude between the valley floors and the mountain ridges is greater than the highest point in Great Britain.The nearest ""highway"" is highway 50, a 2-lane road nicknamed the loneliest road in America, not a freeway. And it is definitely not hot. Summer daytime temperatures might reach the 90s(F) for a couple of months but nights always cool down to the 40s and 50s. Sometimes this place is noted for being the coldest place in America. (Las Vegas is hot but 150 miles north of LV is not.)What is possible in the story is the concept of a uranium mine. However, it can't be the only uranium mine in the United States. There are hundreds of active low density uranium mines in the United States and over a hundred of low-level uranium deposits in Nevada alone. Also, in Nevada, mineral rights are separate from property ownership. You can own the land but you don't own the mineral rights. The U.S. government does. You can apply for mineral leases and patents. But that is really irrelevant as the U.S. government owns 85% of Nevada including this area which includes, guess what, the Atomic Energy Commission's Nuclear test site where they test nuclear bombs. And the Nevada Test Site sits next to Area 51 of UFO and alien creature fame. The high level nuclear waste site at Yucca mountain is in the area, too.Another geography lesson, unlike the United Kingdom which is near the north pole, Las Vegas is nearer to the equator. It does not have long daylight hours in the summer like London. In August, the sun sets around 7:00-7:30 pm, not at 10:00 pm.If the author takes the time to at least google the area he writes about and hires a good editor to correct his English, he has the potential of becoming a popular writer. The story had potential. But as it is currently written, the book is not worth buying.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJIWE9SA4SZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IC46HYO#wasThisHelpful","R2JJIWE9SA4SZX","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story begins with Matt Jones who is excited about his new job as a homicide detective in Hollywood. The evening before his first day on the job, he is waiting in a restaurant for his friend, Hughes, to celebrate. His friend is late. After ordering a beer, his cell phone vibrates in his pocket. His supervisor, Lieutenant Bob Grace, calls him into his office and says ""You were supposed to start tomorrow, Jones. I know that's how we left it. But I'm in deep s--t, and I need you tonight."" Matt sends a quick text message to Hughes. ""Dinner off. Call me.""Matt wonders why the Lieutenant told him nothing about this assignment except ""You'll see why it's so f----d up when you get there."" Matt arrives at the scene and understands why Grace is so rattled. A murder had been committed in a parking lot directly across the street and within fifty yards of an LAPD community station. The victim had not been identified until Matt picks up the victim's phone and sees a text message ""Dinner off. Call me.""Matthew Trevor Jones, welcome to Hollywood Homicide! To say more will spoil the story with all sorts of spoiler alerts. Suffice it to say that the story is a complex, realistic, twists and turns story that will keep you up all night worried about what will happen next. It is not a strict white hat versus black hat cop story. The bad guys and the good guys all have their virtues and vices.For those who want to know, there is some swearing but not much. There are also some romance scenes that I personally think could have been left out but these nit-picks are minor compared to the overall strength of the story line. Hence, my rating of 4 stars.The ultimate questions are:Did I like the book? Yes, definitely.Would I buy another book from this author? I already have. Near the end, a character is introduced named Lena Gamble. I have discovered that the author, Robert Ellis, has an earlier 3-book series about Lena Gamble. I have bought the first one which cost me an expensive $7.99.Should you buy this book? Only if you like well-written, complex, realistic, keep-you-guessing, chills-down-your-back thrillers starring a cop in Los Angeles!Cautions: There are some foul words and graphic scenes in this novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5GPH48X2KS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3KUZP0#wasThisHelpful","R1N5GPH48X2KS6","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quality of Buffalo Games puzzles are not up to the level of Ravensburger or Eurographics. The cardboard is thin and many pieces can be fit in the same slot so you must really pay attention to the subtlety of color shade variations to find the right piece. However, that doesn't mean they have inferior puzzles. Buffalo Games have attractive pictures and the puzzle pieces are clean with no puzzle dust.Even though this is only a 750-piece puzzle, it is as challenging as a 1000-piece puzzle. You would be surprised to discover that a piece could be part of the bridge or the castle or even a rock! Add to that the similarities of puzzles shapes require you to pay close attention to the slight variations in tit shape, size and color hue. The beauty of the picture encourages you to keep at it to see the finished picture. Included with the puzzle is a glossy piece of paper with the puzzle image printed on it. This is easier to use than the box to examine the picture for guidance in finding the right pieces. Overall, this is an enjoyable, challenging, but not overwhelming puzzle to piece together. I recommend it but docked it a star as it is not the quality of Ravensburger or Eurographics puzzles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH74OCYNNJZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FHP4RK#wasThisHelpful","RSH74OCYNNJZB","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally, I do 1000-piece puzzles but began this 500-piece puzzle for something a little less challenging. Hah! This puzzle is more difficult than it seems. Check out all the whites and grey. The positive is that the puzzle is the usual nice Ravensburg quality. Nice interlocking pieces with no puzzle dust and an interesting ""cats gazing out the window"" picture when you're done. In summary, an enjoyable puzzle to put together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BVBTTTWIMBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002HR8BU#wasThisHelpful","R4BVBTTTWIMBZ","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quality puzzle! Similar in quality to Ravensburger puzzles such as nice cardboard with no puzzle dust and good picture imprinting. The pieces are cut differently as they are not always standard, interlocking pieces of the same size. However, this makes the puzzle sometimes more challenging and sometimes easier. Sounds strange but let me explain: sometimes you have no idea what type of piece will fit, but other times it is obvious such as ""look for a piece that is white with a slightly curved edge on the left and is long and narrow"" and woo-lah! There's only one piece sitting in the box that obviously matches. The picture is challenging to put together as you really have to pay attention to car color, words, and piece shapes. And somewhat educational when done. See how the classic Mustang evolved and when looking at the styles over the years, you can understand why the Mustang was so popular. Also, it's different from the usual landscape or painting puzzles which I have grown tired of. FYI, I am an elderly lady so this puzzle can be fun for the gals as well as the guys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G0MKUHWQ4SMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8ZNY5K#wasThisHelpful","R3G0MKUHWQ4SMQ","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hesitant to buy this case because it had no reviews and an extremely long estimated delivery date. But for a cheap $9.99 including shipping, I thought ""What the heck?"" and clicked buy. Two days later, the case arrived as promised.The case was exactly as described. It is literally generic, no logo is stamped, etched or otherwise shown anywhere to give you any idea of the manufacturer. (Like everything else, it's made in China. No surprise.)How does it compare? I have many different color, brand and style cases for all the Kindles and Fires. I currently own 17 Amazon Kindle and Fire devices which are usually ""on loan"" to various family members and friends. Personally, my favorite case is the FYY Classic Slim Fit Folio Leather Case, but this case is my second favorite. For the various Kindles and Fires, I have tried cases from MoKo, Poetic, rooCASE, Infiland, Supcase, I-Blason, Bear Motion, Ionic, Fintie and of course Amazon. This case compares favorably, especially for the price.CONSTRUCTION AND USE: The quality of the leather is much better than or equal to the others. The stitching is good and unlike the MoKo and a few others, even the back flap is stitched to prevent separating. The front flap is sturdy enough to maintain its shape and not wilt or bend when used as a stand as pictured. It has an elastic loop on the side into which you can slip a capacitive pen to carry with the device. Most importantly, the magnets work to put the Fire to sleep when closed and wake it when opened. Except for the Moko and Supcases, there have been hit-or-misses with this function. Often, other brand cases will turn the device off 9 times out of ten, but that 10th time the case wasn't closed just perfectly and unbeknownst to me, the device wasn't put to sleep. I have used this case for a month and the magnets have performed flawlessly. I have even held the case parallel to the ground and shook the Fire. The case stayed closed. ONE CAVEAT. If you put the case in a bag or purse, the jousling of other items can cause the case to open and wake the Fire. Some cases such as the MoKo and some Poetics have an elastic band that you can strap around the front flap to prevent this but those cases cost at least twice as much.This case has all the opening in the right places so that you can access the USB port, the volume buttons and the power button. The holes for the speakers are large enough to allow the entire speaker to broadcast sound. Some cases use a design where they cut multiple slits where the speakers are. This leaves tiny strips of case which cover the speakers and mute the sound somewhat.This case has no fancy pockets on the inside cover nor does it have any hand straps. The inside cloth covering is a nice felt and feels soft, not like the sandpaper feel that some other brands have. Although I wish it had a strap, it also does not leave any impressions on the device screen from a strap.VERDICT: Overall, this case is a good value for the price. It performs its function reliably with no frills. Can you get better? Yes, but you will pay more. If you are happy buying a Chevy, instead of a Cadillac, then buy this case. If you want a Cadillac and are willing to pay the premium price, try the FYY Classic Slim Fit Folio Leather Case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14JRHM3N0QH12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4UUGP0#wasThisHelpful","R14JRHM3N0QH12","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sometimes get UTIs or urinary tract infections, especially when travelling. These, and especially, the Azo brand, were recommended by my doctor. I began buying the product at Walmart as in our rural community, that was the only store that carried these tablets. Once Walmart was out of stock, so I logged onto Amazon. I ordered the tablets to try out. Surprisingly, Amazon was cheaper than Walmart, charged no sales tax and rhe product was delivered in about a week to the door.They are easy to tear off a days supply, stick in a purse or suitcase and go. These tablets have the exact same ingredient as the prescription medication, Pyridium, which is phenazopyridine, but at a lower strength. It does not cure the infection but relieves the pain, urgency and other discomforts until antibiotics can kill the infection. It also helps us old ladies who have irritations to the urinary tract due to old age.I highly recommend as they do help control UTI infection symptoms. Take with water and continue to drink water to flush the drug through your bladder. They are cheaper than getting the prescription and are just as effective. WARNING: they will turn your urine to a bright red-orange color so don't be alarmed when that happens. Just be prepared on your next trip to the bathroom. The effect goes away about 24 hours of stopping the drug.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R379F7QGLBPM2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018SGX6I#wasThisHelpful","R379F7QGLBPM2T","A2D5K8IDZGFFWY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D5K8IDZGFFWY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased these earrings at a lightning deal of $29.99. The ""regular"" price was stated as $55.00.First, these earrings are beautiful. They hang nicely from the ear lobe and have brilliance and sparkle that will receive compliments and are perfect for formal evening wear. Nice size... not too big, but not too small either. However, I only rate them 4 stars because of the post are thin and bent a little. By bent, I mean the posts themselves are crooked along the alignment down the length of the post, not how they are attached to the earring base.

"This is the second book in the Divergent series. The factions are at war and there is a secret that is at the center of the battle. Alliances are formed but not all in a faction align together.

Can Tris and Tobias stop the Erudites? Tobias' father Marcus knows the secret and keeps it secret. Tris helps Marcus but she cannot forget the cruelty Marcus inflicted on his son Tobias.The one problem I have with this book is the contradictions of Tris's character. She appears too timid and self doubting to have been the same character in Divergent. This Tris would never have become a Dauntless.

Looking deep into my coat closet this year, I realized that I really did not have a coat appropriate for all work situations but instead have several coats for work ... a beautiful princess-seamed walker that's too tight to wear with suits, a sized-up walker that's fine with suits but not in regular clothing, no coat for when I wear long sweaters or dusters, and so on. Why can't I have just one coat for work & professional dress ?I live in a winter climate but frankly I don't need a heavy coat to go from my car into buildings, or between buildings, even if the walk is 2-4 blocks. I also don't want to lug around a big coat in airports or in the city either. Sure, if I was a commuter and stood outside waiting for a bus, or if the average winter temperature was less then 20 degrees, then of course I would be looking for something else than an all-around lighter coat. But as it is, I dress in layers in every season and frankly don't want a heavy winter that I only use 2 months of the year.I had my heart set on getting a light wool coat with a water-fall or fly-away color. After searching high and low and coming up short at the price point I wanted, I decided to give this shawl wrap a try. For me, the coat is pretty darn close to perfect, and here's why: The wrap style and dolman type sleeves will accommodate all kinds & styles of clothing, from short dresses to suits to bulky sweaters to chiffon tops. It's light enough that it can be worn in buildings, airports, malls, etc without breaking a sweat but warm enough to give me just the boost needed to ward off the chill. Short of the coldest days of winter, I can make this coat work, and it will carry me from October to March. :)The shawl color is well-designed, and it comes high around my neck, making a scarf almost unnecessary. The sleeves come to my wrist joint yet still seems generous enough for my frame.A couple words of warning -** Sizing from Nordies: XS=0, S=2-4, M=6-8, L=10-12, XL=14, and they say order down if between sizes. I concur. I'm an 8/10 and ordered both medium & large. Both sizes were a bit restrictive in the shoulders so it's the design of the coat itself, not the size. The large did seem ""bathrobe"" like and was definitely not the coat for me. I preferred the excess material for wrapping in the large, but the top half of the coat ended being too large for my scale. So, order down.** The coat's waist is almost empire like. It ties high, toward the lower end of my ribs and I'm short waisted!  You can see this on the model ... note where her elbow crease is and where the belt is tied. When I realized that this was where the coat should be tied and stopped fighting it & trying to fit it lower, the coat suddenly looked elegant and high end.** The coat is long on me. I'm 5'5"" and the coat is about 3"" below my knee, which makes sense if you figure the model is probably 5'9"" or 5'10"". I might get it taken up ... we'll see.** The red does not read as red-blue in person as it does on my screen. I'd call it a true red,and one which tends toward pink & orange (think pink & orange in sunsets). The color is far too warm for me, so the coat is not a keeper. However, I ordered the gray instead, in spite of not wanting to be one of ""those people"" who wear gray & black in winter. I want color!** It is not shipped well and will come as a huge, wrinkled mess. Amazon really needs to take a cue from other stores like Lands End, JCP or Pendleton when shipping coats & jackets: Ship them in a flat box meant for coats, not one better suited to books & coffee makers. Basically, you will need to steam out the wrinkles, unless you are brave with an iron.Would love to see this coat sold here in other colors, like a dark muted teal, a mid-to-dark greige (taupe-gray), and indigo or ink (purple-black or blue-black). I'd probably buy one of each in a more contemporary take on classic colors. But for now, I'm content to have one winter coat that will work for me all season long ... in gray.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMVVN67DTDEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FR8TVY#wasThisHelpful","RCMVVN67DTDEU","A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The fabric weight and jacket styling were exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, there were too many negatives to outweigh the positives.- Does not come with a belt.- The edges are not hemmed but instead have an overlock stitch. Looks cheap and unfinished. Will not wear well in long run.- There is no lining, which is OK. But the seams are unfinished, which is not OK.- Sizing is problematic. I ordered a large and shoulders were too narrow. Pockets were high -- at my rib cage! I am 5'5"" an 140 pounds, and wear 8/10 which is a medium yet the large was too small!Overall, there's a lot of potential here, but it is mis-sized for the American market and over-priced for the quality of construction. It's so simply constructed that I know I can make this on my own for about 30 bucks or pay someone to do it for 50-60 bucks ... which is exactly what I intend to do.Finally, I've since looked closely at the other reviews. Many of them have a consistent pattern ... positive, uncritical reviews; a few sentences; misuse of words (e.g., vest and peacoat); inconsistency among reviewers (""it's warm"" and ""it's light for summer""); un-truths (has a lining, quality construction); and ... here's the kicker ... it's the sole review for the author. I mistakenly trusted these reviews ... and I should not have and I really do know better. Barnum Bailey was right. Don't be one.

"The ""Sun Up"" color is a lovely coral that reads more orange than pink. The jacket also is beautifully constructed, with super nice details. Overall I quite like it.Unfortunately, the jacket ran small for me. I typically wear a 10 in better brands, and I'm a solid 10 in Jones, Lands End, Kasper, etc. If anything, AK tends to be too generous with sizing in my experience.

"I ordered the Sovana 2.5"" Mary Jane heel in 8 and was shipped the Keyo 1.5"" Mary Jane heel in 8.5 instead. Prolly a good thing, since I've struggled to find a pair of these woven textile shoes in a 2.5"" to 3"" height that actually worked. For me anyway, what I find is that my foot slides too far forward at that height, and there is no support at the heel. If I had not received these accidentally, I likely would have never tried them.They are not the most supportive shoe, nor will they be the most durable. There is not enough padding or support at the ball of the foot, so they are not made for walking or standing either. However, this Keyo style is comfortable and light. I like the way they hug my foot but don't strangle it. The bronze is a nice, glitzy neutral that casts some rose gold too. The bronze color would be an awesome ""nude"" color for someone with darker skin than my own.I'm a true size 8 and the 8.5 size is perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QN7NDVUTJ6ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZB1G886#wasThisHelpful","R2QN7NDVUTJ6ON","A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Black pair is just a bit snug but going up to a 9M wouldn't work. The Asphalt pair is far too snug and going up to 9M is what's needed.I'm dying to wear the black pair with tights in the fall, but I still have not decided whether to keep. They are comfortable on, largely due to the material used for the heel & sole. However, arch support is lacking ... and that is not something I require a lot of.

However, watch for flaws.First I ordered 2 (green, pink) and both had stains, so I returned them and reordered 1 in a darker color (purple).

"The amaryllis color is bright & sunny -- a nice change from typical jacket colors. The jacket is nice but size-wise is a slim fit. If you are between sizes, definitely order up. I'm a 10-12 on top: The medium is too snug and going back.I did purchase the white in large from another seller. I would say that the large fits like a 12-14. The white is nice and versatile for me, but it has a wee bit of a yellow cast to it. If I was to do it over again, I would get the amaryllis. The jacket is a bit too big for me in the large -- I have narrow shoulders and a smallish bust -- but I can make this work with layers, and that's probably best for my climate anyway. Not a great fit for me, but the versatility & price of this jacket could not be matched, so I kept it.Basically, a great rain-proof and wind-proof jacket if you like a slim fit and are big busted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXTOQRTWOZFAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D41X7N4#wasThisHelpful","RXTOQRTWOZFAJ","A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Belkin sleeve is super ... for the 1st generation Surface. Wayback when, there were no sleeves specifically made for the dimensions of the Surface, and one just had to make do with sleeves which were a bit too wide or too long. This sleeve is neither, and it fits the Surface with a type cover just perfectly. Unfortunately, this sleeve does not fit the Surface with a padfolio. If the neoprene was just a wee bit more forgiving, it just might fit a Surface with padfolio. In that case, it would be a 5* product.

"This is a very nice, fitted hoodie from Columbia. The princess details and slim fit are feminine, and it's definitely not a boxy fit that's sometime more typical. I find the sizing to be consistent with other items from this brand, which for me means that a medium fits well on top but tight on bottom (I'm a pear-shaped 10 top, 12 bottom). I'd swim in a large but free returns meant this item was worth taking a chance in a medium. I returned it.There are two things which I do not like about this hoodie & are the reasons for the 3* rating. (1) The fleece is not a traditional polartec fleece but instead a more plush, loungewear-like fleece. For me personally, this would be fine as activewear or loungewear but not something I'd go to the store in or run errands in because it feels like pajamas to the touch. (2) The seams on the inside of the garment are not taped or finished off. I found this irritating and I would not have kept the hoodie even if it did fit.Overall, worth a try ... especially at this price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBFRS3EMI4MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEOONK4#wasThisHelpful","R1XBFRS3EMI4MQ","A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RRMZKOMZ2M7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes, it's pricey, even on sale, BUT this is a gorgeous necklace with a lot of natural turquoise! The colors are slightly brighter in person than shown. It's a comfortable necklace that will be stunning in winter with a black, wine or chocolate turtleneck, in spring or summer with a crisp, white shirt, would compliment a leather or leather look jacket and is a casual piece with all season potential. I like the length. The plus (for me) is it's made in the U.S. using recycled sterling silver plus all U.S. mined gemstones and offers a lifetime guarantee.

"My clothing style is ""classic"", because well made garments can (with care) last me several years. I also like to be able to have clothes that can be casual or dressed up with accessories as needed. That said, this is an excellent choice for my wardrobe. I bought it in navy, plum, gray and tan. Depending on the style/cut or manufacturer, I can wear anything from a size XL to 2X. This sweater is 100% cotton; in the past I've found all cotton sweaters often shrink a bit when machine washed and dried... even using a cold wash cycle and low heat setting on the dryer. Therefore, I bought 2X and am glad I did. Out of the bag, they fit a little loose, which is perfect for layering. No measurements are given on the product page. The bust of the 2X measures 50"", the hip 52"", shoulder to hem is 28"", and sleeve length is 24"". Cable knit means the sweater drapes nicely (not boxy), but also doesn't cling. They're very well made. On me--and I'm short--the neckline doesn't come as low as pictured. No cleavage shows. Against my skin, the sweater is super soft and comfortable. I can wear them with jeans and sterling silver jewelry, or slacks and pearls. Please note it isn't a heavy weight sweater, but in my coastal CA area, it will be ideal for 3 season wear.UPDATE: After machine washing in cold water and drying on delicate/low heat, the measurements for the size 2X are: bust 45"", hip 42"", shoulder to hem 25"", and sleeve length 22"". I'm very glad to have ordered the 2X, as the shrinkage was what I'd expected and a smaller size would then have been too tight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WNKM78RNPGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDY5006#wasThisHelpful","R6WNKM78RNPGC","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the holidays fast approaching, I absolutely LOVE these non-stick baking pans! Yes, I could go to Dollar Tree for cheaper aluminum pans (and have in the past), but they aren't anywhere near as hefty as these pans, and the non-stick feature is fantastic for many sweet treats. You won't need to grease or line them with parchment paper to make gift-able fudge. Using one prepackaged cake mix and one tub of frosting, you can split the batter up for two single layer cakes to give to neighbors, co-workers, delivery drivers or friends who are single. Us them to bring stuffing or sweet potatoes to holiday potluck gatherings. Substitute these in place of loaf pans to gift banana, cranberry, pumpkin or zucchini bread. What about Rice Krispy treats?

"If you want an inexpensive little splurge, this rhodium plated sterling silver black & white CZ ring could be a good choice, especially if you're thinking of pairing it with another ring (or more) on the same finger. Be aware, it's tiny; the height and depth is just a hair over 2mm and each stone is not much bigger than pencil point size, but it's solidly made. Rhodium plating means the ring shouldn't tarnish. I paired it with a platinum plated CZ ring I own, and the look is nice. Understated. You could buy 2 and wear them as guard rings for a single stone or 3 stone ring. Bottom line? This ring is a good quality, nicer looking fashion jewelry piece.

"My oldest son (28) is starting a new job that requires a suit every day, so when I saw this as a lightening deal in the size he normally wears, I ordered it. The suit arrived quickly and in good shape on a suit hangar under plastic. Fit varies, of course, from one man to another. He's short with an average build, and this suit had an odd fit. The jacket shoulders extended well beyond his natural shoulders, the sleeves were 1/2 inch too long, but the waist fit fine. The pants, however, were tight in his waist and pant legs were baggy. The pants arrive unfinished, so hemming is required. A good six inches would have had to have been cut from these for my son, who usually buys 32/28. The QUALITY of the suit, overall, seems to be good, but I'm returning this to Amazon as a tailor told us today the jacket can't be altered to fit him better due to its construction.

"Having loved ""Plum Tree"" by Ellen Marie Wiseman, I was happy to receive a (free) advanced uncorrected proof of her new novel, ""Coal River"" to review. This book does have heavy subject matter, being about life at Coal Mines in the early 1900s; Wiseman did an excellent job with it, although serious history buffs might balk at some creative changes in the actual time line to better fit the story line.Emma Malloy is 19 when she arrives back in Coal River, Pennsylvania as the lesser of two bad options available to her. The townspeople consider her cursed and view her as an omen of bad luck. Years earlier, when she was staying at her aunt and uncle's home with her younger brother, a tragic accident happened. Her brother fell through the ice and drowned. Now she's been orphaned following her parents' demise in a fire. On the day she arrives, the train she's been travelling on also brings a number of immigrants looking for work at the coal mine. This upsets families who have been working the mines for generations.Emma's Uncle Otis is a supervisor at the mine; he and her Aunt Ida make it clear that while they're willing to take her in, they intend for her to work both at home and in the mine company's general store with her cousin, Percy, to earn her keep. All of her earnings will go to them. Emma doesn't have any means to escape her circumstances. She's horrified by the conditions the miners and their families must endure. The mine owner, Mr. Flint, is clearly written as the villain in this story, but many of the townspeople are also cast in a dark light. The miners live in a small, run down community partially up the mountain... away from town. When she recognizes their struggles, particularly the fact that so many young boys are also working at the mine under dangerous conditions, Emma does her best to help them in ways which aren't strictly legal. In doing so, she befriends Clayton Nash, a leader in the mining community who hopes to establish a union of the mine workers.I don't want to give away too much of the story. It's steadily paced and I was able to read the novel in one day. Most of the characters are well developed and the plot is interesting. My only disappointment--no spoilers--is how the story ends. In this reader's opinion, the twist is almost along the lines of a fairy tale. For that reason, I'm rating the book 4 stars. Your impression might vary. I do look forward to other novels by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX6EMMBWII82E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617734470#wasThisHelpful","RX6EMMBWII82E","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My sons (who are both in their 20s) love all things Star Wars and enjoy games, so when I had the opportunity to receive Star Wars:The Force Awakens X-Wing Miniatures game from Amazon and Fantasy Flight Publishing for review, I knew they'd be able to provide information for other fans. Here's what they had to say:""Having played the tutorial game it seems to be a solid, relatively easy to learn game. I had trouble following the order that the tutorial  in the Learn to Play booklet was laid out in, especially as we were playing the first two rounds while looking at the Learn to Play booklet. Beyond that, it is a much easier game to pick up than Armada: Whereas it took me several games of Armada to get a full grasp on the rules, it only took two turns for my brother and I to get to the same level of understanding with X-Wing.The materials in the game are top-quality. The tokens are perfectly aligned and well punched. The tokens and cards are well laminated and feature great, unique artwork. The ships are high quality miniatures with excellent paint jobs; it's hard not to swoosh them around before and after a game.The game itself is well balanced in a game-design perspective. You can make complex maneuvers, but are then disabled from using any special actions like Focusing and Evading, and have to do simple maneuvers to be able to take those actions again. The X-Wing is bulkier and has heavy firepower while the TIE Fighters are light, nimble, and evasive. The game is definitely skill-based: it requires you to know what your ships can and can't do and to plan ahead.Overall, it is a fun game that is easy to pick up and play. I wish the tutorial was laid out a little better in the Learn to Play booklet, but going through the booklet before playing will help with this.""--A well-balanced, fun game--Helps you feel like a fighter pilot in the Star Wars Universe--Rules are easy to understand once you learn them--Variety of play styles--Challenging, as it makes you and your opponent secretly decide on your moves simultaneously and execute them simultaneously. This forces you to predict your opponent's move as you plan your own.--Game pieces are well-made and durable, but there are LOTS of pieces, including many small pieces that might be choking hazards for small children or might be lost or forgotten when putting the game away--Two rule books: a ""How To Play"" (that is confusing and hard to follow) and a ""Rules Reference"" (that contains more advanced and detailed rules for experienced players). This, combined with the number of pieces, is very intimidating for new players--Base set only comes with three miniatures, which is great for just learning the game but also means that you have to buy extra miniatures and expansion sets to play more advanced matches.

"Since my early 40s, I've had mild rosacea and increasingly sensitive skin. Anti-aging products often burn or I get a rash. Anything too moisturizing (anything with added oils) causes break outs, and nothing looks worse than wrinkles and pimples on the same face. I switched to Clinique brand a few years ago, trying their CC cream, BB cream and foundations (several varieties), but they felt like a mask on my face and at the end of a day, I couldn't wait to wash them off. Also, they did nothing for the mild rosacea. Based on reviews, I tried the Lumene Time Freeze CC Cream... first in light as I'm pale, then in medium (a better match for me)... and I can honestly say no product or brand has been better for my skin's appearance. This CC cream acts as a light foundation for me, with just enough moisturizing on its own that I can skip that step in the morning. My skin doesn't look or feel ""made up"", has a subtle glow, and fine lines are less noticeable. Women of a certain age will understand most foundations and concealers collect in the fine lines around eyes to actually draw attention to them. Not so this CC cream, which also allows me to skip concealer. I can also skip an eye shadow primer, as this is gentle enough to use on my lids and makes a nice base. Plus, my dark circles have faded a shade or two. What's been even more of a benefit is over time my mild rosacea has cleared up enough that my skin looks evenly toned and healthy when I'm NOT wearing makeup! At 53, I know nothing will erase my wrinkles completely, but Lumene Time Freeze CC Cream has helped bring a few compliments of my ""lovely skin"", which is something I never expected to hear at this stage of life. It's a product I really don't want to be without.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34I9B6GZ2Q58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4OQ63I#wasThisHelpful","R34I9B6GZ2Q58","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We don't drink a lot of soda in our house anymore, preferring water, coffee or tea, but sometimes we'll buy diet soft drinks. My experience with Stevia sweeteners is that they're sweeter tasting than sugar, so I was surprised that this Black Cherry soda tastes more like unsweetened, natural cherry juice with carbonation. It's not a bad taste at all. Cherry lovers will like it. My husband (a diabetic) thought it was okay, and our sons also thought it was alright. I like that it's not got any food coloring (the soda is clear) or saccharine in it. The reason I'm giving three stars instead of four is the cost; Zevia is more expensive than other, comparable brands of ""natural"" sodas like Hansen's (which is sweetened with Splenda). I'm also waiting for longer term studies of Stevia as a sweetener. Many think of it as a natural, less ""processed"" sugar substitute, but it starts out green leaves and becomes white granules, so... ?? As for the soda itself, I might buy it if on sale.

"We love the Brookside Dark Chocolate fruit candies, so I was happy to give these fruit & nut bars a try. They taste much like the candy, but (of course) with nuts, seeds, more substantial dried fruits and grains added. They're chewy like a soft granola bar, but crunchy, too, because of the plentiful fiber. My husband is diabetic, so I always read labels to keep check on total carbohydrates *and* how many of the carbs are sugar. These bars are just on the edge for him to have a snack while hiking; protein in the nuts and seeds helps to slow sugar metabolizing/blood sugar spikes.

"I'm a BIG fan of Maggie Smith, will watch any move she's in and (especially) love her as the Dowager Countess in Downton Abbey, so I was thrilled to be able to get a pre-publication copy of this biography by Michael Coveney to review. In fact, I was anxious to start reading as soon as it arrived. I'd expected it to be a biography about her life. Meaning a book that might shine a light on the woman, Maggie Smith. I'd hoped to read more about her. This isn't that kind of biography. Think of it instead as an encyclopedia of her acting career or a textbook about the history of theater and acting with Maggie Smith as the focus. There's precious little information here of any personal nature.Coveney begins by discussing her acting style, what might make it so, and comparisons to other female actors from England in her general age group... as well as how they differ. The first chapters deal with her childhood and specifically what he feels laid the foundation for her unique style of acting. The focus quickly becomes about where she went to school, what influences in theater were the initial building blocks, and details about every performance she's ever given... including who was there, where it was, what it was and anything ever said or written about the performance. The author goes on, then, into her professional career and its details border the minutia. From plays, to theaters, to other actors in the plays (and how they did or related to her role), written reviews about her performances and on and on. There are very occasional paragraphs about her relationship with her first husband both before and after they were married, as well as the births of her sons, but those are shared mainly in how they connected to her career. As in, what she was doing onstage at the time, or what projects were in the works, how she and her first husband did performing together in the same venue (and how others described/reviewed those performances), where they were, who the other actors were, etc.The remainder of the ""biography"" continues in the same vein. I wound up skimming a few chapters to get to her later roles, and again, learned next to nothing about Maggie Smith's personal life off-stage. If you're a serious theater lover who enjoys in-depth, comprehensive studies--or you're an actor looking into the career history of an icon--this might be an enjoyable book. However if you're a mainstream reader who's a fan of Maggie Smith, hoping to find an entertaining biography that includes her actual personal life, Michael Coveney's book may be disappointing. Hopefully, there'll be another biography one day aimed at average fans.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6Y2CTIFUYD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250081483#wasThisHelpful","RP6Y2CTIFUYD0","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every year our area holds an Annual Bird Festival in January; we're listed as a national estuary. For the past 5 years, my husband has led groups of bird enthusiasts on bird walks for the local Audubon chapter throughout the year and during the festival. He carefully looked over ""Birding for the Curious"" and feels that if you've already decided to take up birding, it's a great book. There's a lot of information in this book and much good advice about how to get started. Each chapter offers an activity to get you started, and the chapters include:Why Birds? (a little over a page plus activity)Your Field Guide to Field Guides (with short blurbs about 5 recommended field guides)Binocularia (finding a good pair of binoculars or other lenses)How to ID What You SeeBirding Is Better With FriendsBringing the Birds Home (attracting birds to your yard)Birding as Giving: Citizen Science (how to provide valuable data to Audubon, for example)Field Craft: Tips for Finding Birds in the FieldThe Birder's YearWhy Birds? A ReduxGoing Beyond Your Back YardThe book is easy to read. Chapters are short, informational, and nicely illustrated in watercolors. I'm not going to go into the information here, because the chapters are short enough I feel I'd be giving too much away. Suggested activities will help the reader get started birding and become more confident.

He was able to move video files quickly and without any problems. Video quality seemed preserved well from one device to another. The adapter worked just fine.

"At super low prices on Amazon's End of Season sale, I purchased this pendant in blue topaz, amethyst, citrine and peridot, with the garnet coming. I'd already ordered each of the colors in the matching earrings to put away in my gift stash for friends and family (see my other reviews); the pendants make very pretty sets with the earrings. Each pendant measures 3/4 inch long from the top of the bale by just over 1/2 inch wide, and they're nice. I will say the chain is far too thin and delicate to be useful for most gals. It should be replaced with a better chain, a thin leather or satin cord, or even a ribbon cord if you plan to get a lot of wear. The bale opening is about 4mm, so be sure a clasp isn't larger than that when replacing the chain. Being rhodium plated means the bright, white silver shouldn't tarnish. Each pendant appears to be well made. Here's a breakdown of each, color by color:Blue Topaz -- a clear, crisp, icy blue as shown on the product page, it matches the earrings for colorAmethyst -- fully saturated, it isn't pale, but is also not dark; it's more of a grape jelly tone and also matches the earringsPeridot -- the center stone is light and clear, not cloudy as the earrings were, but it's very paleCitrine -- a bit darker than the earrings, it's still a pale yellow stone that's more of a cool tone than one normally sees in citrineGarnet -- will edit to add the information when the pendant arrives, but if it's at all like the earrings, will be the most striking of the colorsEach pendant comes in a gift box, but in a plastic bag tucked into the gift box, so you'll want to remove it from the plastic bag and arrange it before giving as a gift. Again, I recommend replacing the chain. At the deeply discounted sale price, they're worth picking up. It's a nice, inexpensive piece for everyday wear... simple and understated... appropriate for nurses, school teachers, chefs, office workers, teens, moms, grandmas, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BX17E6ZA7ZOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQTXW42#wasThisHelpful","R1BX17E6ZA7ZOI","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost--all due respect to other reviewers--these gemstone earrings don't look like cheap, costume jewelry. Rhodium plating means the bright, white metal won't tarnish. To many women that's a plus. A lot of gals also like lever back earrings, because you're not going to loose the backings as with studs or post styles. That said, I shop year round for holiday and birthday gifts in order to get the best prices. When I saw these at a very low price, I first ordered the blue topaz for myself, and then placed an order for each of the other colors to use as gifts. Here's a breakdown color by color:Blue topaz - the topaz stones are a very light, ice blue and are clear with no visible inclusionsAmethyst - the pair I received are clear, clean, and a much darker purple than pictured on Amazon's product page, more like the product page picture of the matching necklaceGarnet - a deep, rich, clear, almost Zinfandel red, these are probably the most impressive of all the gemstone options and will be perfect for holiday outfitsPeridot - these stones were a little disappointing in that they were pale and cloudyCitrine - although so pale they're almost clear, there are no inclusions in the earrings I receivedThe created white sapphire stones are bright and clear; they're small enough to give a diamond look without the diamond price. Each pair of earrings appears to be well made. Durable. Amazon's packaging makes them ideal for gift giving, whether as stocking stuffers or a small gift with a lot of bang for the buck. I'd recommend the blue topaz, amethyst and garnet versions. You might receive a better peridot pair than I did, and your citrine pair might have more depth of color without losing any clarity, but I can't personally recommend those. It's a matter of taste. The earrings aren't large, but they *are* noticeable. They measure just over 1/2 inch in length (not including wires) by just under 1/2 inch in width. She could wear these to work. I can report they're not heavy weight. They're comfortable. I'm hoping this helps shoppers make an informed choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VO45ARJZVHL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQTXTCC#wasThisHelpful","R2VO45ARJZVHL2","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I had the opportunity to read and review a pre-publication copy of Beatriz Williams' ""Along the Infinite Sea"", I knew it would be best to read the first two books in the Schuyler Sisters trilogy beforehand, so I did. For readers not aware, the series begins with ""The Secret Life of Violet Grant"" (involving Vivian Schuyler), which is followed by ""Tiny Little Thing"" (Christina Schuyler Hardcastle). We get to know more about Pepper Schuyler in ""Along the Infinite Sea"", which I feel is the best book of the three. More on that in a minute.It's the autumn of 1966, and Pepper Schuyler is in Florida to sell a completely restored, rare 1936 Special Roadster Mercedes to a mystery buyer willing to pay $300,000 for it. Pepper needs the money to carve a new life for herself and the baby she's carrying... the unwanted baby of a married Senator she had an affair with. In fact, Pepper is on the run from him and his powerful family. What she doesn't yet know is the buyer, Annabelle Dommerick, is intimately acquainted with the gleaming black car. And she has secrets of her own. Deep, powerful secrets. Uncovering them will change each woman's life.I was unaware that this series is written--at least in part--with a first person narrative and regular shifts in time from the 1930s in Europe to the 1960s in America. This style of writing has become a bit tedious for me, as far too many books are currently written in that style. However, Beatriz Williams is among the handful or so of authors with the ability to pull it off well. Each of the characters in ""Along the Infinite Sea"" is exceptionally well developed, and the shifts from one time period to another are very neatly done. In other words, it isn't a chore for the reader to get through this novel. Only Annabelle's portions are told in first person narrative, which is also refreshing; her story in particular kept me turning pages. While I felt no well-bred, old family money, upper class woman in the 1960s would have been as flippant or (at times) outrageous as Pepper, I did like her character. I liked the way the two women interacted. I was also intrigued by the mystery involved in the novel. Readers will also laugh out loud in some sections. Especially those involving Pepper and Annabelle's son, Florian.There are far fewer explicit sex scenes or sexual references in ""Along the Infinite Sea"" than in the first book of the series, which was a relief to this reader. There were also far fewer f-bombs or other coarse dialog. That's an important note to some readers. The story line is far more intriguing and interesting than in the second book of the series, with far less politics... also an important note to some readers. Overall, Williams' final installment is my hands down favorite, and I think it could be enjoyed as a stand alone novel for those who have not yet read the first two books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DG3Z1C5J3NXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171312#wasThisHelpful","R3DG3Z1C5J3NXV","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is based on a pre-publication copy of ""The Last Summer at Chelsea Beach"" by Pam Jenoff. Your impressions may well be different than mine. That said, ""The Last Summer at Chelsea Beach"" follows a current fad of novels written in first person narrative with regular time shifts. Of the nearly dozen books I've read in the past 3-4 months, nearly all have been written in this style, and as a reader, I've come to the conclusion it takes a great deal of skill both in writing and editing to make it work. I won't fault the author for problems with those shifts in time throughout this novel. Several editors go over the final manuscript before the book is released and problems should be caught there.We're introduced to Adelia Monteforte in the prologue as she's driving to a beach house on the shore with a great deal of trepidation. It's a place from her past, and she's nervous about returning to it. Chapter one shifts to eleven months earlier in Washington D.C. when Adelia runs into a former love interest, Charlie Connally. She's working for The Washington Post. It's an awkward and uncomfortable surprise to see Charlie. There's a troubled history between them which is yet to be revealed. But Chapter two shifts to two years earlier, when Adelia arrives on a boat from Italy shortly before her 17th birthday. An only child, her mother unexpectedly put her on the ship to get her out of facist Italy and into the safety of her Aunt Bess and Uncle Meyer's home in America. Almost immediately after she arrives, Aunt Bess takes Adelia to an apartment on the shore for a quiet summer.There she meets the Connally family, a boisterous group with four sons. Charlie is the oldest. Adelia is immediately attracted to him. There are also the twins, Jack, a gentle, bookish adolescent, and Liam, who is prickly. Finally, there's young Robbie. The next several chapters generally relate to this time period, but there are awkward shifts within chapters (or even pages) when Adelia is reminiscing about earlier events. The big questions I had (as a reader) were why her aunt and uncle--among other characters--weren't more fully developed, and why Adelia didn't think about home (Italy) very much... not just her parents and grandmother, but school friends, teachers, neighbors? Normal childhood memories. It's as if none of it ever existed. Instead she's absorbed into the Connally family,and much of the focus is on her infatuation with Charlie, who seems not to notice her. At least initially.No spoilers here, but by Chapter ten, the novel has backtracked a bit before placing Adelia in England during World War II. She's working as an assistant to a high level journalist in war torn London. There are shifts back in time to her brief romance with Charlie, the tragedy that strikes the Connally family, her impulsive move to Washington D.C., and the circumstances leading to her abrupt job change. In London, she befriends Claire Churchill, the PM's niece. At this point the novel is steadily paced, but as a reader I just don't like Adelia. When Charlie comes back on the scene a key element is that they were childhood friends and grew up together in the U.S., but Adelia was nearly 17 when she arrived, met Charlie and became involved with the Connallys. She grew up in Italy. Any good editor should have caught that.If it all sounds confusing, it's because I found it a very confusing read. This will not be a popular rating, I'm sure, but I've got to give the novel 2.5 stars. I'm rounding up instead of down, because the concept was good, and the author clearly did her research. There were just too many problems for me. Of course, top selling authors highly rated ""The Last Summer at Chelsea Beach"", so you might find it brilliant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTTWCBI9T9QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317544#wasThisHelpful","RKTTWCBI9T9QF","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's often difficult to shop for clothing online if you haven't purchased the brand before. Since I've never tried on anything from Knits by Hampshire, I wasn't sure what size to order when taking advantage of the sale price with additional percent off on Amazon. I can range anywhere from a size XL to a 2X, depending on the brand. Therefore, I purchased this sweater in both colors in 1X and 2X... the 1X is a good fit without being too snug in the bust, back, waist or hips. It's a relaxed fit. The stripes aren't unflattering as many of us plus sized gals fear. I like the nautical look of them. Using the zoom feature on the product page, you can see there are two ""stripes"" of open knit; one across the upper chest, and one near the hem. I will say the yarn used isn't top quality, but for the price I didn't expect it to be. The sweater is casual for weekend wear, around the house or running errands, and will be ideal with jeans or white pants.

"These rings will vary from one to another, yet my new sparkler doesn't look cheap at all. No, it isn't ""little blue box"" boutique caliber--although it does come in a lovely blue box--and it's done in .925 sterling silver of substantial weight vs. 14k white gold or platinum, but the design is lovely. While the tiny round white diamonds appear cloudy under a loupe, they still twinkle. The baquette diamonds are surprisingly clear. The workmanship also surprised me in its quality. The face of the ring measures 3/4 inch from top to bottom, and 5/8 inch from side to side. The shoulders (which also have prong set rounds and channel set baguettes) taper from 3/8 inch wide to about 3 millimeters at the shank. Its under gallery is fully finished to be sturdy, smooth and comfortable to wear against your skin. Fit is true to size.My size 7 order was priced at 90% off list. Very honestly, there's enough silver to make the metal alone a great deal, not to mention the diamonds, careful workmanship and bold, vintage, elegant design. A few department stores have similarly styled diamond rings in 10K white gold selling for $800-900 or more ""on sale""; the grade of diamonds in those rings compares to the diamonds in this ring. I'll probably get it rhodium plated to help prevent tarnishing.I think this would make a fantastic gift for a BFF to show off during girls' night out, but think also grandmothers, sisters, or simply as a treat for yourself!

"When this AA Quality Akoya Pearl Necklace was offered on a Gold Box flash sale, I decided to take a chance and (impulsively) order it. My experience with ordering Akoya Pearls online has been mixed. I wasn't expecting much and even thought it might wind up returned. It's important to state I'm something of a pearl snob, having taken the GIA pearl course as well as studying about pearls for more than a decade. This necklace doesn't come with a certificate of authenticity or an appraisal, so if you're new to pearls or pearl buying, you might not understand its value. I'm thrilled with my purchase!Each smooth, very round, lustrous pearl measures at or near 8 mm; they are well matched for color showing pink and blue overtones with a subtle orient that's considered highest quality or ""Hanadama"". Nacre thickness is substantial. That's rare among almost perfectly round and smooth Akoyas, which increases the value. For those who aren't aware, and Akoya mollusk can only produce one pearl at a time, laying nacre down slowly and evenly in cold salt water environments. Freshwater mollusks can produce 40 or more pearls at a time, and in warm fresh water, the layers of nacre are formed much faster. The structure of the nacre in Akoyas makes them more lustrous (overall) than freshwater pearls. Top quality Akoya pearl necklaces in sizes over 6.5-7mm per pearl can run $1000 easily for princess length (16-18 inch). They are the gold standard for pearls. This is such a necklace. We're going to have it formally appraised by a jeweler who specializes in pearls, but I'd estimate its value in the $1800-$2000 range.Under a loupe, there are very minimal, tiny imperfection on less than a handful of the pearls which aren't noticeable to the naked eye. At the drill holes, there's NO evidence of bleaching or dying--techniques acceptable in the pearl industry. Again, nacre thickness is substantial. The pearls are evenly drilled and the make of the necklace is exquisite. I ordered earrings at the same time which are a near perfect match: http://www.amazon.com/Akoya-Cultured-Quality-Earrings-8-8-5mm/dp/B00SH2H8CG/ref=cm_cr-mr-title (see my other reviews).This is the finest Akoya necklace I (now) own! It's absolutely heirloom quality and will be my 54th Birthday gift. I highly recommend buying it for a wedding, anniversary or special event to be enjoyed and handed down throughout generations. Buying fine jewelry online can be risky and/or disappointing. This buy was amazing! I'd rate it 10 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PN1B4JY5DOJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH2HBYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2PN1B4JY5DOJ5","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For readers who loved ""The Language of Flowers"" by Vanessa Diffenbaugh... readers who have been anxiously awaiting another novel from the author... you might want to skip my review of ""We Never Asked For Wings"". I received an advanced reader's (paperback) edition, and really wanted to love this book. While I won't say I hate it, there are a few too many problems (for me) with this novel about a struggling, single mom and daughter of illegal immigrants from Mexico. If I had to nutshell, I'd say it's both believable and completely unbelievable. There are clear stereotypes with a twist. The story is, at times, all over the map. Pun intended.Readers meet Letty Espinosa as she's racing in her car to catch up with her mother before she crosses the Mexican border to bring her back to take care of teenage Alex and six year old Luna. Children left alone in a run down apartment in a partially abandoned building. Children who don't yet know they've been left to fend for themselves by their half-drunk, panicked mother who's unable to be the kind of mother they need. Letty was a teenager when Alex was born and his father never knew about him; Letty's mom has been raising him since he was an infant. Luna has a different father (of course) and Letty doesn't even seem to be sure who he is. Now Letty's parents believe it's time for her to learn to be a mother to her own children. Maria Elena and Enrique are homesick for their family home in Mexico: they were in the US illegally since before Letty was born. The characters are developed, but seem almost two dimensional... with the exception of Alex. I loved his character.This is where the author started to lose me as too many things didn't add up. Or were simply impossible. I don't want to give too much away, but why weren't there steep medical bills after Letty's accident? The car is totaled and abandoned. No insurance? She's introduced as working three jobs, vanishes for a few weeks, comes back and then seems to be working one job on a night shift. Suddenly she's bringing her daughter to work on the day shift? Cutting her pay/tips, but there's never mention of rent, utilities, etc. (she has little money for food), and yet she can send money to her parents in Mexico? How? Simultaneously, she's saving her tips to move into a better apartment in a better school district. It just doesn't add up. And I'm sorry, but you can't rent a pet carrier in San Francisco's Mission district for ""a couple hundred"" a month.Throughout all of this, a wealthy doctor (father of one child) comes onto the scene, Alex gets involved with a girl, goes to a new school, then gets excited about a science project, plus the reader learns gobs of information about migrating birds/bird feathers, various mixed drinks and immigration law. Do you see what I mean? The story spins all over the place. Then there are the miraculous resolutions to money problems. I was glad, at least, that other problems weren't so neatly resolved, because life doesn't work that way. However, I really did like some of the characters, including Alex's crush, Yesenia and Letty's love interest, Rick. The writing itself is generally good.I'd rate ""We Never Asked For Wings"" a solid 3 to 3-1/2 stars overall. It's not a bad read. Parts are very enjoyable. You may absolutely love it.

"This is a very basic tablecloth in a year-round neutral color. The fabric is somewhat thin, but washes up well, needs no ironing (if removed promptly from the dryer) and coordinates with just about any dinnerware or serve ware. We use a tablecloth every day. Our table is on its 3rd generation of use and it shows. Some recent purchases from department and discount stores have netted poor quality fabrics that have started to fall apart after a few washings, so I'm happy this seems to be better quality at a similar price point. It's good, not great, but I like it and will use it. I have quilted placemats to co-ordinate with more colorful patterns.I received a free tablecloth in exchange for an honest review.

"Not sure this razor is worth the (steep) price. There are three men in our household--my husband and two adult sons--and each has either a mustache or chin only beard and mustache, so I asked them to test this Norelco system. Each uses an electric razor; two also use an electric beard trimmer. My oldest son set up the S7720/90 7700 shaver and had this to say:--Opening the box wasn't that hard, but the packaging wasn't intuitive and I had to hunt for some things.--The cleaner-charger dock (called the SmartClean system) is fairly intuitive to use, but it is sometimes hard to get the razor plugged into the thing.The razor itself, once charged, is easy to use and feels comfortable on my skin.--However, the razor does not dry-shave well. I had to go over the same spots over and over again. It got all the thick hairs but left behind all the thin ones; it just would not cut some areas on my face, such as the sides of my chin or low on my neck. Eventually, I gave up and switched to my normal razor.--When cleaning, the SmartClean system is a bit on the noisy side. The SmartClean actually got the razor really clean, I'm impressed. However, it did leave the blades wet and soapy, so I had to take them out, rinse them and dry them.My husband was next up, and he felt the S7720/90 7700 razor did no better job than his older (and cheaper) Norelco. My youngest son conferred, and said he prefers the Norelco Go Styler FS9185/42 G as a trimmer/shaper. No one in my household likes the idea of a cumbersome cleaning cup and charger combo sitting on the bathroom counter, which seems to be necessary with this shaving set since the cleaning fluid is an added expense to replace every day (if dumped out after each use).","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DVSKR4D6I09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDAA#wasThisHelpful","R27DVSKR4D6I09","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having a less than ideal experience with a different pair of Akoya pearl stud earrings, I was happy to see the quality of this pair, which was more expensive and worth it. The pearls are top grade--sometimes referred to as Hanadama quality--and nearly perfect when viewed with a loupe. Each pearl is smooth, luminous, and displays prized orient. This is indicative of very thick nacre. Also, the mountings are secure. Earring backs are quite snug, so you might need to wear these earrings several times before you can get them on and off with ease; this also means the backs aren't likely to slip off while you're wearing them. Each pearl is white with strong pink and blue overtones, which is considered the most valuable color in Japanese Akoyas.I'd considered removing one star for rating because the box mine came in was actually a ring box instead of an earring box, and the pair doesn't come with any certificate of authenticity. I'm rating them five stars, though, because I've studied pearls (GIA) and know they're at least AA if not AAA in quality. Very happy with this purchase, and would highly recommend these earrings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278R9U4HC0RB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH2H8CG#wasThisHelpful","R278R9U4HC0RB0","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The necklace I ordered and received was 24 inches long with a white gold, ball clasp. Whether or not this Akoya strand is worth owning depends on the current Amazon price, if it's a gift vs. for your own enjoyment, and with an understanding that it will probably not be an heirloom piece to pass down over generations. I paid just under $80 for what was apparently the last one in that size in white gold. Having studied pearls in depth, I louped it right away under good light. Every pearl is off round (rather than round) has surface flaws and very thin nacre... so thin that on a handful of the pearls in the strand, the nacre has peeled away from the drill hole. Looking at the drill holes, the pearls have been dyed with a very pale pink tint. That's an acceptable practice, as is bleaching the pearls, but it lowers the grade. The thin nacre means with regular wear, over time, the pearls will flake and chip off of the bead nucleus. They are, however, well matched for color, and the ""make"" of the necklace is good. The pearls are firmly knotted on double silk thread with french wire at the clasp to protect the string from wearing and breaking.Why am I rating it 3 stars instead of 1? Because while I can't recommend it as a gift--and only if you can buy it at a low price--it should hold up to occasional wear for up to a decade. These are NOT AA quality Akoyas, but that grade for this size of pearls would run quite a chunk of change. Think $800 or more retail pricing. Particularly if they're Japanese Akoyas. This necklace almost certainly has Akoyas from China, where the pearls are harvested in as little as 6 months vs. up to 2 years; thus the very thin nacre. I have a few very fine Japanese Akoya pearl necklaces that I intend to hand down. This is one I'd wear out to dinner with my husband and not have to worry about getting a spot of salad dressing on it (which can ruin pearls).Edited to add: I ultimately decided to return this necklace, even though it was purchased at a very low price, because too many of the pearls had nacre peeling at the drill holes. My husband didn't feel it was a good buy at any price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UO05WDPTB1DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GUTN1C#wasThisHelpful","R2UO05WDPTB1DD","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful set of towels, but I think more appropriate as hand towels in the bathroom than as kitchen towels. The design is lovely. The colors are rich and classic neutrals. The towels appear to be well constructed. They are, however, quite thin and not terribly absorbent. For some reason, they seem masculine to me, and so I'd think the set is suitable to tuck into a gift bag or basket with a bar of sandalwood soap as a housewarming gift for a guy... but you might come up with other ideas.

"Yes, you can buy French soaps for less at discount stores, but I've got to say this very large bar of shea enriched, wonderfully scented soap is a luxurious splurge for yourself or as a gift. When I opened the box, the fragrance perfumed the entire room! And what a lovely box it is! I'm thinking with such a powerful aroma it wouldn't be appropriate for those with sensitive skin, but you could tuck it into a linen closet or sweater drawer as a super long lasting sachet. When using it as intended, the lather is thick and wonderful... it feels a treat. Which is why I think this would be nice tucked into a gift bag or basket with a few pretty washcloths or hand towels as a birthday, hostess or ""just because"" gift.

"I agree with the 1st reviewer that this lightweight luggage set isn't worth the stated value of $400+. My in-laws asked me to shop for a college graduation gift for our son, and I was happy to see the set as a gold box deal for $145 on Amazon. The larger of the cases is 21 inches long by 17-1/4 inches wide and 11-1/4 inches deep; it's big enough to hold a week's worth of clothing and toiletries. The smaller case is ideal for carry on limits of most airlines. Construction of both is very good. They seem solid, well made, and offer the options of carrying from a top handle, a side handle, or with the pull-out, telescoping pull handle. It's a set that should last my son for years.

"I'm an experienced seamstress, and have owned (in the past) high end, computerized machines that did everything from embroidery and smocking to quilting and beyond. Those machines can rack up significant costs in maintenance and repair. What I need now is something small (for easy storage in a closet) and basic that can handle simple jobs like hemming and clothing alterations. We're all tough to fit sizes in my family; namely, we're short. A local dry cleaner does alterations, but those costs add up, too. We recently spent more than $60 to have two pairs of suit slacks hemmed and the jacket sleeves shortened for our oldest son. This Singer 1304 Start Basic Everyday Free Arm machine is a small, sturdy, no frills model that's ideal for my needs. It's easy to set up on a kitchen table, and it's very easy to use.

"My family put this cleaner to the test. It's a very effective, easy, safe product for all wood and plastic outdoor furniture, for painted surfaces and metal. It quickly cleans BBQ grills, too. It isn't limited, though, to outdoor cleaning projects. My sons' bathroom is a challenge to keep clean, in part because the tub and shower are old. We've tried everything from bleach cleaners to Lime Away, from ""scrubbing bubbles"" to Soft Scrub cleanser... using sponges and even brushes. I've spent plenty of money on mold & mildew cleaners, as well as mixing up my own non-chemical cleaners using citrus peels soaked in vinegar. We tried Scotts Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiClean on the bathtub and shower in their bathroom, and I can state unequivocally that it is far superior to anything else we've ever used. Spray, let sit a few minutes and wipe off with a cleaning rag. It's that simple. Mildew, rust, lime and soap scum came right off.

"Who would have thought a novel based on the subject of cancer would have you smiling at page six and laughing periodically throughout its chapters? As other reviewers have stated, I laughed, I cried, and I wanted a doughnut. This is Fausto Brizzi's first novel. I hope he writes many more! '100 Days of Happiness' was a completely unexpected delight for me, and a novel that left me thinking for weeks before feeling ready to write a review. I'm going to hang onto my pre-publication copy and buy copies for friends and family, because while I don't agree with one part of the storyline (sorry, no spoilers), I think it's beneficial for each of us to consider what really matters most in this life. '100 Days of Happiness' gently forces the reader to do so... with humor.Lucio Battistini is somewhat disappointed in the way his life has turned out as we're introduced to him in the first chapters. Raised by his grandparents, once an Olympic hopeful, now married with two children and working at mediocre gym as a personal trainer and coach of a less-than-stellar water polo team, his life takes a downturn when his wife catches him in an affair. She throws him out. His father-in-law invites him to stay in a back room of his bakery, and it's while he's there that Lucio finds out he has liver cancer. That has metastasized. The doctors are very clear it's terminal. Lucio calculates he has roughly 100 days before the disease reaches its final stages, where pain medication will dull his ability to participate any further in what's left of his life. And so, he considers what he wants to accomplish in those 100 days. What's most important to him? What does he hope to leave behind? The author softens such sharp edged questions and issues from the very first page. Readers find themselves cheering Lucio on.The only reason I'm not rating this 5 stars is that although the book is exceptionally well written--again, Brizzi is an author to watch--the novel is written in the hottest publishing trend of first person narrative with periodic shifts in time. Thankfully, he does a good job of it. But so very many novels now are written that way it feels a bit tedious. Also, as stated, I didn't agree with the ending. Which is personal and subjective. Your mileage may vary. I would absolutely recommend the book either way. Love it or not, it'll get you to think.

"There have been many good reviews written about this Chill Bag chair, but I haven't seen anyone mention safety and care tips, so thought I'd add those. It's definitely an improvement over the 1970s/1980s bean bag chairs in that it's not filled with Styrofoam pellets. That said, it's both HUGE (which can be a plus) and filled with shredded foam. Meaning children under the age of 3  and young pets shouldn't be allowed to play on it unsupervised, because there's a risk of suffocation. It's a good idea to spray the chair lightly with Scotch Guard and let it air dry in an open, ventilated area. Microfiber cloth stains easily. The cloth is also slippery on hard surfaces--and even some carpets--so placing a trimmed square or circle of non slip carpet liner beneath it will help prevent accidents when someone plops down or dives onto it. A hand held vacuum or attachment can be used to remove pet hair or crumbs. Note that if you use a steam cleaner for spots, mildew can happen, because the foam bits will hold the moisture. A better idea would be to spot clean with a damp (not wet) cloth. Fluff it periodically. As with originally setting it up, fluffing will be a two person job. Did I mention it's HUGE? It measures in at about 5 ft. diameter. With care, though, it should last for years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6RH1QLOQXGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P21TAIK#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6RH1QLOQXGB","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This white gold, blue and white diamond Halo ring is a lovely, well made addition to any woman's jewelry collection who appreciates a sturdy, feminine style. It is NOT a bold ring; if you're into serious bling, there are other (more expensive) higher carat weight options on Amazon. Measuring approximately 8 mm across the circle design, the blue and white diamonds combined have enough presence to be noticeable for everyday wear. Under a loupe, they're the clarity listed (I2-I3) for the white diamonds, which means they're somewhat cloudy, but still sparkle. The blue diamonds appear to be clearer viewed with a loupe (I1); they're well matched in color. There's a substantial amount of white gold in the shank, making the ring very sturdy. Being crafted of 10k gold means it's durable. I always take my rings off when I'm cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, etc., but if you don't, the stones are exceptionally well set and secure. Overall I think it's a great value and would recommend it provided you're fine with less than VS or S clarity. It's a pretty ring for the price.

"While these sheets are very attractive--as well as properly sized for a deep mattress--they are microfiber. This means they're super soft, wrinkle resistant and won't require ironing, but it also means you shouldn't expect the durability of cotton. In my experience, microfiber sheets have an expected life span of about 2-3 years of regular use before they begin to thin and tear. That said, if you're looking for affordable guest bedroom sheets, this set is an affordable choice. If you're buying for a bed that's slept in every night, and you wash your sheets frequently, they won't last as long. Remember to NEVER use chlorine bleach on microfiber cloth, as it will seriously discolor them (turning either yellow or pink toned), and will speed the breaking down of fibers.

"If you have fine hair that's straight or just a little wavy, and you don't wash and blow dry it every day, Revlon's Curl Collection Heated Styling Brush might be a very good option to achieve a smooth, face flattering look. Medium textured hair might do well, too. Please keep in mind there's a reason a heat protecting glove is included, especially if you're trying for more curl to your style! Unlike a traditional curling iron, the brush grips individual hairs, so if you turn it under (or over) and wrap it to curl, it might NOT want to let go, and you'll need that glove to untangle your hair from the very hot brush. OUCH! I'd think those with thick or curly hair would have even more issue with this. My hair is fine, and while the heated styling brush works well to simply brush through it slowly for smoothing with a slight turn under at the ends, I ripped out a few hairs trying to untangle it when I tried to make more of a wave or curl. My hair is currently shoulder length and blunt cut, so perhaps shorter or layered styles would be easier? It's also possible I'm just a klutz when it comes to hair styling. My usual routine is wash and air dry, or at the most a low heat blow dry with a round brush to smooth any frizz. I'll probably use this styling tool only occasionally on seriously bad hair days when I have limited time to get out-the-door... but I'll always have the glove on in case my hair gets tangled in it again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JH4L0K7A7NDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3JDCH2#wasThisHelpful","R1JH4L0K7A7NDH","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upfront, I need to say I've loved some of Delinsky's earlier novels (especially Three Wishes and Coast Road), so am a fan-of-sorts and was happy to receive a pre-publication copy of 'Blueprints' for review. My Dad was a general contractor; Delinsky obviously did research for her new novel. As a 50ish woman, I'm also happy to see a main character in my age bracket that isn't stereo-typed, and it's rare to find such a book. Particularly as a heroine in a romance. Those points are made, because I may be a bit biased.Caroline MacAfee and her daughter, Jamie, are part of a large, well established family construction company and have each been stars on a local television station's home remodel show, ""Gut It"". Jamie has great aspirations as an architect. She's engaged to a member of their company's legal team. Caroline... Caro to her friends... has found her job as host of the show a comfortable easing towards less physically demanding work in her chosen profession of construction. The novel opens with things seemingly going well for both women. Then Caroline's ex (Jamie's dad) presses his daughter for a private meeting. With his approval, the producer of ""Gut It"" has decided Caroline is too old to be the host of the show and plans to replace her with Jamie. The news is to be delivered the day before Caro's 56th birthday. Jamie doesn't want to replace her mother as host, and doesn't want anyone spoiling her birthday, so volunteers to be the bearer of the bad news while silently scrambling to find a way out. Predictably, the news is broken by someone other than Jamie. Her mom feels betrayed. Their relationship is strained.The next curve ball catapults both women into unknown territory and each must adjust to the changes more independently of each other than ever before. It's a true turning point in each of their lives. Both women will discover surprising strengths as well as new paths and new loves. They're also able to see each other beyond mother/daughter roles. 'Blueprints' is a book that kept me engaged as a reader, and overall I think it's a good book. I'd expect nothing less of the author.A few twists in the story knocked this down from 5 to 3.5 stars for me, but I'm rounding up. No spoilers here. Let's just say I'd have preferred the romances played out differently in the final 3rd or so of the book. Jamie's choices seemed too impulsive and not in character at all. Caroline's left me feeling a wee bit cheated. 'Blueprints' is still a good book but in my opinion, it's just not Delinsky's best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14V1EX3887XMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250007046#wasThisHelpful","R14V1EX3887XMC","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Labradorite is a popular stone on our strip of coastline, as it's of the same stone family as moonstone and the blue flash it gives off when light hits is reminiscent of the ocean. Like all stones of this kind, no two are alike. Labradorite has a greenish-gray base color and some stones look more brownish-gray with varying tones from deep to light, but all good quality stones flash blue. I say all of this because the Relios Enhancer I received holds a very high quality stone with good color play that's perfectly suited to its mixed metal design. The brass really makes the stone pop in a substantial sterling silver setting. I'm most pleased that this enhancer is a size that's very noticeable without being gaudy, and like all Carolyn Pollack pieces is manufactured in the US using recycled materials. It's very well made and versatile. You can wear it on a leather cord or chain, clip it onto a beaded necklace or pearls, slide it onto an omega, and the stone goes with just about any wardrobe color. The nice thing about its mixed metal design is you can also wear it with yellow gold... you aren't limited to sterling silver. In fact, it even looks nice on a long stainless steel chain I own. If you're on the fence about it (and it's still at a sale price), I suggest you get it home and see. Relios jewelry comes with a limited lifetime warranty. Amazon has a great return policy, too, but I doubt you'll return it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9CEAAOM5Q8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7DAON8#wasThisHelpful","RL9CEAAOM5Q8L","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you like coconut, this trail mix might be a good choice. Although it contains dried fruits, nuts and dark chocolate chips, it's mostly big flakes of coconut. My guys thought it was alright... sweet... as a snack at home, but wouldn't be likely to take it along hiking or birding or for outdoor activities, because the chocolate could melt. To be fair, we make our own trail mix assortments using M&Ms, which don't melt. Also, we don't overwhelm a mix with any one ingredient. At the price point, if you're creative in the kitchen, you'll ultimately save money by using dried fruits and berries, salted nuts, mini pretzels, coconut flakes and/or covered candies for your own mixes that keep in airtight storage in the pantry for several weeks.

"My husband is the computer expert in our household... quite literally, as it's what he's done for a living more than three decades. I asked him to install the TP-LINK Archer C5 AC1200 unit and to note what he feels relevant. Here's what he has to say:Setup: Quick and easy, though the actual setup and the guide had some very slight differences.Speed: Definitely appears good; faster than our previous modem (a lower end Netgear model).Management Console: One very good thing is that there‚Äôs a side panel on every screen that explains what each control does, and what all the techy terms mean. This is a definite plus for the those that want to understand a little more about what‚Äôs going on. I DEFINITELY recommend changing the default administrator password. This took a little bit of poking around to find, but once found, it was easy to change.Features: Full featured modem, with 2.4 and 5 GHz bands that can be managed separately.supports a ‚Äúguest‚Äù access interface ‚Äì this is nice for when you have guests, but don‚Äôt want to give away your password.Includes parental controls, and time controls so you can limit children‚Äôs computers, tablets and phones to only have wifi access when you‚Äôd like.Includes bandwidth control in case you have a limited or expensive ISP, you can keep your bill down.Supports attaching a USB disk drive for shared network storage. This can be good for backing up your computers.Also supports several advanced features such as interfacing with a dynamic DNS server (allows you to host websites, without an expensive static address from your ISP), and working with a Radius server for WPA/ WPA2 security.Coverage: Unit has 3 external and 3 internal antennas that provide good signal strength and coverage throughout our home.I hope that helps anyone shopping for a new modem and considering this option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP121S4AKZD6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFG6QS#wasThisHelpful","RP121S4AKZD6C","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you enjoy novels that are dark or disturbing--and a reader who appreciates what's often termed ""new"" or ""fresh"" approaches to literature--you'll probably want to skip this review. I in no way wish to offend the author, publisher, or the folks who've enjoyed ""My Sunshine Away"" by M.O. Walsh. In exchange for a free, pre-publication copy of the novel, I'm required to give an honest review based on my own opinions. Your mileage may vary.We're introduced to the narrator/main character as he's looking back upon his adolescence and, especially, the girl across the street and two doors down that he's had a crush on since elementary school. More accurately, it seems like a typical school boy crush. As his story unfolds, however, it becomes painfully clear that it's much more obsession... a creepy obsession at best, and a dangerous, disturbing one that can't have escaped the adults in his life. Lindy, his paramour, was brutally raped the summer he was 14, and although Walsh writes the narrator's thoughts and feelings as naive and mostly innocent, his near-total focus on both the girl and all things sexual didn't quite add up to me. I have two now-adult sons. I was well aware of their awkward, awakening sexuality in their early teens. It wasn't, however, a 24/7 focus. Had it been--had they not had other interests, hobbies, etc.--I would have been very concerned.Granted, there were other deep, painful issues going on in the narrator's life in his youth, as the story slowly exposes. Oddly, there are also a number of rabbit trails and seemingly disconnected thoughts or events that had me feeling lost while reading... as if I'd somehow turned the wrong page. Hurricane Katrina is mentioned, which happened long after the 1989-1991 time frame of most of the novel. Why was that there? I wasn't sure, and am still not. There's also a mystery throughout the chapters. Namely, who raped Lindy that summer? After hanging in there until the last chapters, I was truly let down by how that question is answered, and especially the way in which it was delivered. Pages and chapters of lead up for something that felt rushed and almost brushed off like crumbs on a tablecloth.I don't know. Other readers find ""My Sunshine Away"" to be a brilliant work of fiction. The novel is written in a currently popular style combining first person with shifts in time and/or focus, lots of sex or sexual subject matter thrown in for good measure, and a dismissal of old fashioned high school English grammar. Therefore, I might just be an old fuddy duddy. You might really like the novel. I hope you do! It's not one I'd personally recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24G0F6NUNK5RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399169520#wasThisHelpful","R24G0F6NUNK5RN","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone shopping and unsure... I'm a curvy gal (40DD bra, size 1X pants on average with a bit of a tummy), and I ordered this in Ocean Blue, Mulberry and Ivory. Because I loved the Cashmerlon cardigan sweaters from Sag Harbor, I ordered the same size (2X), and was worried they'd be too large in this tunic. If anything, they run a bit small in the waist and upper arm. I could not layer, say, a polo shirt or blouse underneath as I could easily do with the cardigan. Oddly, the bust and hip aren't tight at all; those are generally my problem areas. That said, I still do adore the fabric. It's exceedingly soft! And they don't look ""bad"" on me by themselves. I just couldn't layer sleeved tops with them.As mentioned in my review for the cardigan of the same brand, the Cashmerlon fabric can generate static. When this happens I wipe them down lightly with a dryer sheet; I've also hung them in the bathroom when taking a shower (steam can reduce static). The fabric can also pill, but a simple lint roller keeps the sweater looking nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21AJYW6PEHFQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L364UM4#wasThisHelpful","R21AJYW6PEHFQ2","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**this review is based upon an uncorrected, pre-publication proof of the novel**As a few other reviewers have written, this would be a great movie. As a novel, it gets off to a slow start--at least in my opinion--but just like a commuter train, it picks up pace as the story continues. The main character, Rachel, is initially a woman difficult for most of us to relate to, in that she has more than her fair share of demons. In the first chapters, I didn't like her at all. Yet, haven't we all at some time peered into the windows of a strangers home and wondered about who lived there? Rachel does more than that. She makes up an entirely fictional story about a couple she sees on her daily commute. Then reality creeps in. I'll just say that once you get into ""The Girl on the Train"", you'll be taken on a thrilling ride. To say too much more would be to spoil the surprises along the way.I'm rating this four stars instead of five, because I wanted the main characters to be a bit less exaggerated. The novel, itself, is good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFK06K8JZ6ES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633665#wasThisHelpful","R1FFK06K8JZ6ES","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small can of spray antiperspirant has a light, fresh scent and goes on if not totally dry, definitely drier than ""old time"" antiperspirant sprays. Marketed to men, it offers 48 hour protection against wetness and odor. I'm thinking it could also be sprayed lightly onto the soles of his feet before putting on socks and shoes/boots during winter months to prevent foot odor, as well as using it under his arms.

"Thinking of other dried fruit and nut salad toppers, I was surprised to find Mrs. Mays brand Cranberry Almond version is actually small, crunchy, chewy squares of what has the consistency of cut up chewy granola bars. Good alone as a quick snack by the palm full, they'd be hard to spear with a salad fork. It would be terrific, however, stirred into cooked, hot cereal, added to a long grain & wild rice blend during the last minutes of cooking, or (as I plan to use it) in a holiday stuffing side dish. You might even sprinkle some over the top of a sweet potato casserole. They are tasty. It's a personal preference, of course, but I like more traditional dried fruit and nut blends--or simply granola--over ice cream, yogurt or fruit, which is what is shown on the package and appears to be the intent for this topper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGWSMJPBNAV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SL2OV0#wasThisHelpful","R1EGWSMJPBNAV8","A2UK25KI4T6GCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UK25KI4T6GCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, be aware this beast is more than 14 feet long and about 9 feet wide when unfolded and assembled. It does move in the wind. It doesn't weigh that much, but with so many elements forming such a large device it becomes a sail.I mounted it on a 10' length of 1-1/4"" electrical conduit held to a tall garage wall using Channel Master CM-9025 3-Inch Heavy-Duty Wall Mount for TV Antenna Masts. The antenna is about 23 feet in the air.The HD8200U has a very high-gain, directional Yagi UHF antenna on the front and a full VHF antenna on the rear. I really don't think I need the VHF section and may retire this antenna and opt for a more compact UHF Yagi if the high winds we occasionally experience cause trouble. After assembly, the two sections feed into an electronics box using 1/8"" aluminum rods from each section. You then mechanically attach a top plate to the box that connects to all four aluminum leads. The coax connector is in this top plate. A weather boot is supplied to seal the connection.The HD8200U does bring in the signal like a champ. My stations are at least 19 miles and 68 miles away. It's very directional. If I aimed 30 degrees off, I got zero channels.

"I received the Amcrest ProHD 1080p IP PT ""WiFi"" camera yesterday, 10/30/15.I downloaded the Amcrest Lite iPhone app. Followed instructions. It would not connect via Wi-Fi using my router's password. Tried again and again. I have a TP-Link C9 dual band wireless router with both 5gHz and 2.4gHz transmission. The Amcrest website says in an obscure forum post that the camera operates only in the 2.4gHz band. I changed my iPhone6 (iOS 9.0.2) from 5G to 2.4G. Still could connect via Wi-Fi.So I plugged the camera directly into the router via ethernet, completely defeating the purpose for the initial purchase. It finally connected. I saw the picture for about 30 seconds, trying to get the camera to full screen, I clicked around on the mysterious icons. Nothing seemed to work. I clicked on the ""X"" box. The camera disappeared. I tried to reconnect. It came back with ""USER LOCKED."" I went to their website to search for an answer. They said (at least for their DVR line -- virtually nothing was about this camera) ""users are locked out after two failed logon attempts and that I must wait 30 minutes for the reset."" I waited. Still USER LOCKED. No camera. I don't even recall trying to log in. I was in the app, trying to reconnect the camera.I created my Amcrest user account and received their confirming email. I created a user and password for Amcrest.com. The account is actually for something called amcrest.Zendesk and Accumed.zendesk and Foscamhelp.zendesk. I then tried to log in at Amcrest.com. It won't take my log-on credentials. ""Invalid Logon or Password."" How many user names and passwords does it take to plug in a camera?Trying to start over, I deleted the app and rebooted the camera. Still USER LOCKED.Finally, I found that if you push and hold in the little LED network-activity-indicator button on the back of the camera for 10 seconds, the camera will reset to factory. Deleted the app again, set my phone to operate in the 2.4gHz band. Still won't connect via WiFi. Plugged in via ethernet, then used my router's password and it connected.  Per the prompt, I then created a new secure password, replacing the default ""admin/admin"". Finally, I can see and control the camera. So, I have a WiFi camera that won't WiFi. The camera needs to connect to the router at 2.4gHz band (and in my case, via an ethernet cable) but after getting it set, the phone can go back to the 5G if desired.They claim their products are ""Simple, Reliable, Secure."" Not quite. They fail to hook to Wi-Fi and then lock me out. Their website won't let me log on even with a user and password.I downloaded the camera's big PDF user manual to find what the icons mean. The document looks nothing like the camera's icons. They went into great detail...about a previous firmware version, then changed the firmware to look very differently.The camera works, eventually, and only via ethernet in some cases, but getting there is a real test of patience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217GX80DB7BOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145OQTPG#wasThisHelpful","R217GX80DB7BOU","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a terrific double stick, industrial-duty tape. It's about 1/16"" thick. It's designed to hold automotive trim on permanently for years, in all kinds of weather. Good stuff.I bought to add some rubber non-slip pads to some polyethylene cases I had bought that were so slippery that I couldn't stack them on top of each other on a cart without them sliding off each other. This tape will stick to polyethylene. Not much else does.I also wanted to affix some 6"" grills over my open-speaker JBL studio monitor to protect the very exposed speaker. At first I was going to screw the grills onto the speakers, then realized that even little slivers of this tape would hold the lightweight grills on forever. Worked like a charm with zero damage to the speakers.This roll comes raw -- it's not even in a package -- and is 1.5"" wide.

It filed easily -- not the best sign for knife steel.The handle is comfortable and it does cut a nice twist, but takes more effort than I expected and should be sharper from the get-go.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKQNFZHX1ISE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MF46H6#wasThisHelpful","R2CKQNFZHX1ISE","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Lutron DVWCL-153PH-WH Diva Dimmable CFL/LED Dimmer with Wallplate, White works well with the Great Eagle (6-pack) LED BR30 3000K Dimmable Bulb. 13 Watt (65W 75W 90W) UL Listed Bright White Light for Recessed and Track Lighting Fixtures - USA Seller.I have the dimmer controlling four of the Great Eagle LEDs in a 3-way (two switches) configuration.Be aware that that is a secondary dimmer ""trimmer"" slider accessible from the front of the dimmer before you install the switch plate.This secondary trimmer adjusts the minimum voltage delivered to the lamps. You turn the lights on, run the main dimmer slider to minimum, then slide the tiny trimmer slider to get minimum light output that still can turn the lamps on. With the trimmer set to minimum, only three of the four Great Eagles lit when I turned them off and back on while at minimum dim. I simply slid the trimmer up a tad until all four turned on. That's now my new minimum dim position. Very easy.The Great Eagles do not flicker or emit an audible buzz (although they are 10 feet in the air outdoors in a patio cover, so they may be buzzing ever so slightly, but if they are I can't hear them.The spec says the dimmer can handle up to 150 watts of LEDs. The four 13-watt bulbs I'm controlling are obviously only 46 watts total, so I'm well within limits.One note: verify the color of your existing switches and plates. I thought my plates were white, so I ordered the white dimmer. Turn out my switchplate color is ""light almond."" Almost white, but not. And you can select from four colors.Easy to install. Came with four large yellow wirenuts and a smaller black wirenut. Also two 6-32 x 1"" installation screws to attach to the box. Be aware there are no wire attachment post/screws for you to wrap existing wire around. Four stranded, pre-stripped wires come out of the back of the unit. Black, Red (the traveler), White/Red stripe and Green (ground). It's up to you to figure the wiring of your existing system. I had to reverse the Black and White/Red stripe to get the system to function. But it works fine. Just know that you will have to wirenut this device to the existing wiring. Make sure the wirenuts secure the stranded device wires tightly to the solid 12 or 14 ga existing wires.I used my old switchplate so it would match the others and did not need the modern, clean 2-part hidden-fastener plate that came with the dimmer. Full instructions also included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GVUIRQB4SSZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C2WTLU#wasThisHelpful","R2GVUIRQB4SSZU","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For reaching 10' ceilings, this is perfect. The platform is 45"" from the floor. That puts the top of my head (6' tall) at 117"", three inches below the 120"" ceiling height. For lower ceilings, stand on a lower step. My wife can easily carry and deploy the ladder. What's nice is how easily it can be carried through the house without hitting things.The ladder weighs only 12.5 lbs, folds and unfolds in a flash, stores compactly. It has a built-in carrying handle perfectly positioned for easy, comfortable carrying. The handle is in the platform so when you reach to fold up the ladder, you grab the handle and pull up. The ladder folds and you have your hand on the carry handle. You carry the ladder vertically, not horizontally. That's why it's more controllable when you carry it.

"These Dreat Eagle BR30 65watt equiv lamps are excellent. The bulbs they replaced were 130v 65watt models that were dimmer than designed as they ran on 120v. The 3000 K color temp is just right. Not too warm, not too blue.The are really bright and fill the space with quality light. The bulb design is actually more attractive than the old incandescent both when on and off.I am concerned that the plastic face of the lamp will yellow with age but when new are beautiful.They come packed extremely well. The six lamps are in a single box inserted into a blow molded clear plastic separator that holds the lamps securely for shipping and provides an efficient storage option for the old bulbs which in my case are new and can be used elsewhere should I ever want to go back to old incandescent technology.Six old lamps at 65w were using 390 watts. Now I'm burning 90 watts and the light is still warm but brighter.The problem I see with LED technology is the antiquated dependency on 120v line power. LEDs naturally run on low voltage. So each lamp has to have a power supply that transforms 120v to something like 12v. This adds to complexity, RF noise and unnecessary expense. Building codes need to allow 12v lighting circuits. The lamps could then dispense with the individual power supplies. The cost would drop dramatically. Lamps could also be much smaller and shallower. So, sadly, we are stuck with expensive unnecessarily complicated lamps as long as we insist on 120v circuits.More light, more useful and pleasing light, longer life, dimmable, less power consumption and less heat generated that the AC needs to pull out of the house. What's not to like?UPDATE: I wanted to dim four of these on the outdoor patio and selected the Lutron DVWCL-153PH-WH Diva Dimmable CFL/LED Dimmer with Wallplate, White. It works well, even in a 3-way configuration. It has a trimmer slider on it that adjusts the minimum voltage so the Great Eagles will turn on and not flicker at minimum dim.

"These blow molded polyethylene cases are terrific. I have several in different sizes to hold photo gear. They come with nothing inside -- no formfitting premolded shapes -- just an open area.I line them with white 1/2"" polyethylene foam walls and form compartments by attaching the foam to itself and the case using hot melt glue, which is about the only stuff that sticks to polyethylene.The only downside is that if you stack them on top of each other in transport on a cart, they are so slippery that they simply cannot stay stacked. I solved this problem by purchasing a sheet of 24""x36""x1/8"" thick very ""grippy"" neoprene rubber by Shop Fox on Amazon designed to absorb vibration. I also bought a small roll of 3M VHB (Very High Bond) double sticky tape (1-1/2"" wide x 9' long). I stuck the tape to one edge of the neoprene sheet and cut off the rubber following the 1-1/2"" tape. This gave me a strip of rubber 24"" x 1-1/2"" with tape on it. I cut that into 1-1/2"" squares and attached four of them to the bottom the each case. Now hey really grip the surface it sits upon and each other if stacked.They do not have shoulder straps or provisions for them -- a single, folding handle only. Lid locks are flexible polyethylene that hold securely. Hinge is a hidden pin of some sort, not a thinned molded part anything that can wear out and fail. Lid folds almost all the way back.

"This is an excellent, heavy duty angle bracket/umbrella holder.It is very similar -- and superior -- to the Manfrotto 026 Swivel Lite-Tite Umbrella Adapter, for one third the cost.It comes with two threaded 5/8"" spuds that can be attached to almost anything. One spud has female threads -- 1/4-20 on one end and 3/8-16 on the other. The other spud has male threads on both ends -- 1/4-20 and 3/8-16. Very handy.The very best feature is the ratcheted spline employed to hold the bracket at a given angle. When you set the angle and tighten the large handle, the bracket will stay at that angle. The 026 with its friction system simply cannot hold the angle if the load is too heavy.The main locking handle is spring loaded and adjustable. If the handle gets in the way, you pull it out and readjust it.Heavy items are placed in the 5/8"" receiver on top but a smaller hole is cast into the upper section that holds a 5/16"" umbrella shaft.

"These handy fittings used to be sold locally at Mr. BigBox but, alas, no more. Good to see them at Amazon.I have used them to add a 1/2"" branch line to an existing 3/4"" sprinkler system. I used the 3/4"" x 1/2"" model.Once the PVC main line is buried, and you want to add a line, it's very difficult to cut the main line and insert a tee. As I recall, I dug the new trench and exposed enough of the existing line to allow me access around it. I cleaned and primed both the main line and the saddle part of this fitting. I then coated both pipe and fitting with a generous amount of PVC cement and snapped the saddle over the main line, wiggling it a bit to make sure the plastics welded and positioning it where I wanted it within the few seconds you have before the cement starts to set.After being sure it was firmly set, I then drilled the hole through the side fitting into the main line. Drilling the hole before attaching the saddle is tricky and you may miss. Drilling it afterwards guarantees a good aim. If you want, start with a small pilot drill, then open the hole with a 1/2"" drill. Most of the chips will be pulled upwards out of the hole, so you don't need to worry about clogging the main line, but it's a good idea to flush the line after this kind of work regardless.I would not use this saddle on a continuously pressurized line, but that's just me. Why ask for trouble? For that, the Sharkbite tees are terrific. For sprinkler systems that are under minimal pressure or off altogether, they work great and make a hard job much easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21EU74GMYNSBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I4G5UE#wasThisHelpful","R21EU74GMYNSBD","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These durable blow-molded polyethylene cases are terrific. Pretty much indestructible. Only cons are that they aren't strictly waterproof as there's no real seal between the two halves. They aren't hermetically sealed. But they cost one third or better of the premium cases and are way less bulky and way less weight.The hinge is a true plastic pin hinge that will last a long time, not a molded thin film that can fail with use. The locks are secure but could be better. Totally adequate however. Holes for a padlock if desired. Folding carry handle.They arrive completely empty. I'd give them five stars if they came with a pick 'n pluck foam insert, lid foam and a base foam.

"This softbox comes with two diffusers, a fabric grid, a speedring and a case. The four rods are 1/8"" spring steel with ends that make them larger to fit into 8mm holes in the speedring.The fabric is stiff, with an aluminumized interior and black exterior. Two small heat vents are cut into the long sides (most likely the upper and lower sides) with little velcro doors so you can open or close them as required depending on how hot your modelling lights are.The speedring comes with a removable Alien Bees steel insert. The insert has an outer diameter of 5.967"" (151.5mm). The inner hole is 3.44"" (87.5mm). (You'd think there would be some sort of standard diameter for speedrings so a variety of inner adapters could be interchanged with various speedrings. No such luck. Apparently their diameters and adapters are all over the place.)Softboxes can be floppy things when broken down. Rods can separate and get lost. I have found it's good to sew the rod ends into their pockets at the diffuser end of the box. That way the rods don't fall out in transport and handling. Nothing slows you down like having to re-seat the rod in its little pocket.When collapsed, the lightweight nylon carrying case is roughly 8""x23""x3"". The case has a velcro flap to keep everything inside and a convenient carrying handle.The main reason I purchased this light is for its grid that controls the light spill. The grid really helps to keep the back light off the background and out of the lens to control flare.The only problem is that my strobes do not fit the Alien Bees flange adapter. It would be nice if they offered different speedring options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14PWK6V2WUNQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COTPLN6#wasThisHelpful","R14PWK6V2WUNQK","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well-designed and well-made ring. It's different from the picture in that it does not come with the actual adapter that attaches to the strobe head and it's not black -- it's nicely finished sandblasted cast aluminum with no sharp edges anywhere.Each part is high quality: the four brass thumbscrews that secure the adapter into the ring are spring-loaded and have rubber washers to help lock the rotation of the adapter when the thumbscrews are tightened. Over-engineered compared to other rings I've purchased.There are six 9.9mm (.390"") rod holes around the perimeter, not eight. (These holes are a bit larger than most rings as my rods are about 7mm, so they fit very loosely in the holes.) Four are at 90 degrees to each other and the other two holes allow an ""X"" shape for a 4-rod narrow rectangle softbox. As is, the ring cannot be used with an octagon softbox unless you drill out the other two positions. The two positions where the 7th and 8th rod holes would be are threaded 1/4-20 and 3/8-16 mounting holes. This allows flexibility in mounting to a stand directly if desired. Very cool. They even etched the thread markings into the casting. Details.The ""C"" half-ring that hinges loose to release one or two rods locks in place via a spring-loaded brass bolt that looks like a miniature door latch. Another unnecessary but nice detail: the thumb trigger you pull back to release the bolt is rubber covered for comfort.The recess that holds the desired adapter (that you have to buy separately to fit your particular strobe head) is 5-1/2"" in diameter.This ring is impressive and a terrific value. And it makes assembling and breakdown of softboxes -- especially smaller ones that put a lot of stress on the rods -- MUCH easier and faster. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REC8MDDOC8MNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00093GGMY#wasThisHelpful","REC8MDDOC8MNP","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Has 1/8"" spring steel rods with 8mm ends that fit normal speedrings well. The other end of the rods have smaller ends if your ring has smaller holes.My unit came with heat vents on the horizontal sides but not on the vertical sides. In other words, it will vent heat better when positioned horizontally. I think this is for higher-wattage modeling lights, but I've seen some boxes made of a very similar fabric that are suitable for hot lights if mounted very carefully and vented properly. This box is so large, I think I can get away with a hot quartz video light.The Bowens speedring is well made and has 12 holes in it for various shaped softboxes. At first, as the box is 31""x47"" rectangular, I attached the rods in its ring at the less-than-90-degree (X) position, but found the rods did not lay in the seams properly. Refitting the rods in the holes that are 90-degrees apart (so the rods are in a perfect + shape) caused the rods to lay in the seams of the box perfectly.Interior is bright silver. I find if I sew the rod ends into their pockets it's a lot easier to assemble and the rods can't come out and get lost.Grids and speedrings alone usually cost twice as much or more than the whole price of this box, which has two diffusers, a grid, rods, vents and a Bowens-type speedring. Fabulous value.The only thing that would improve any of these softboxes -- expensive or not -- is a speedring that would help you assemble and especially disassemble the box. The nature of softboxes is that you can get the rods into the holes on the speedring fairly easily but getting the rods out to break the box down is a real pain. The Calumet Quickring Speedring folds in half and locks. I believe the Calumet ring will do the trick. Undo the lock and all the tension will relax. Chimera makes a quick-release ring too, but it's $87 for the ring alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSMWL2840ZJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G31A4FG#wasThisHelpful","R3PSMWL2840ZJS","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable is just what I was looking for. I had purchased another coiled cable earlier, but it was more like a CB or police radio mic cable (stiff, heavy and thick). This cable is just 3mm (.119"") and when retracted is about the length of my hand. Just right for supplying 5V USB power from an Anker external battery pack to my TASCAM DR-70D recorder that positively eats its internal batteries when phantom powering microphones.It's ideal in my application because it stays out of the way while allowing flexibility. If I were to snag it, the cable won't pull out during recording and it doesn't hang down flopping all over the place. Also, because it's so light, it's not putting side pressure on the tiny micro end of the cable. It's only USB 2.0, but that's fine for my purposes.It stretches to much greater length if needed, but that's asking for problems. I want it to be its compact self, store easily without kinking and splaying everywhere.The connectors seem well made and attach firmly both at the large and micro ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R328CPP2DIN2BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098I8RIC#wasThisHelpful","R328CPP2DIN2BZ","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"High quality Step Down ring that allows me to screw this into a lens that takes a 77mm filter and reduce the threads to 62mm so I can mount a specialty lens adapter that's only 62mm onto the larger lens. This is not often a desirable direction to go as the smaller filter will probably cause vignetting, but in this case I wanted to mount an Anamorphot 1.33:1 anamorphic adapter onto a Veydra Mini-Prime lens on a Panasonic GH4.So to be clear, the outside of this ring has 77mm male threads and screws into a lens like a filter. The inner hole has 62mm female threads.Did exactly what I wanted it to do.

"This S-Type Bracket is simply brilliant. It has no arms or parts to lose and packs flat. It's all plastic but is very sturdy. It has an umbrella port if you want it to shoot into an umbrella as is or it can be attached to a softbox as long as your speedring has a Bowen three-lug adapter on it. This is the part I didn't understand before I bought it. I thought I'd have to bolt the large round black flange into a speed ring. But it's easier than that.That large 6"" black ring/flange that surrounds the flash port is actually a socket that receives the Bowen ring. The ring pushes into the flange and twists to lock in place. The tolerances are loose and the speedring moves about a bit after it's locked in place, but it's not a big deal. It's just holding a softbox. You spin and aim it and then never touch it again. Besides, the loose tolerances allow the ring to mount and unmount easily and quickly. There is a sliding lock button on the back of the flange that securely holds the Bowen ring in.The reason the flange is so big (6"" diameter) and doesn't seem to be needed is because it's designed to hold the Neewer 24""x24"" softbox and replace the L-shaped strobe holder that comes with that unit. Neewer¬Æ 24""x24""/60cmx60cm Professional Protable Foldable Off-Camera Flash Photography Studio, Portrait Soft Box with L-shaped bracket & flash Ring, Outer Diffuser and Carrying Case for Nikon SB900 SB800 SB600, Canon 580EXII 580EX 430EXII 430EX, Neewer T... That very popular box does not need the Bowen adapter to attach to this S-Type bracket.Fits on standard 5/8"" baby spud light stands. The large plastic tightening handle is spring-loaded so you can pull outward and reposition the handle as needed if it hits anything.A shoe-mount flash like a Nikon SB-800 or similar on-camera flash is gently but securely held in place in vise-like padded jaws. This means you're not trusting a tiny cold-shoe to hold your $400 strobe up in the air. It's elegant in its simplicity and function. Treat this right and it'll do the job for years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EDNSZC8NIYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAAXH1A#wasThisHelpful","R24EDNSZC8NIYQ","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sturdy, all-metal construction. My unit has 8, 8.7mm holes to accept the softbox rod ends. One of the holes is designed to assist getting smaller, more-difficult softboxes like the hair light softbox to assemble and disassemble easier.The cast aluminum Bowens inner adapter has an inner diameter of 3-3/4"" (3.743"" actually) and it tapers just slightly -- the edge with the lugs is slightly smaller in diameter than the ""front"" part of the ring. The outside diameter of the adapter is 144mm (5.678""). The three cast metal lugs are 9.6mm x 10.4mm.While the outer ring appears to be round, my unit actually has 16 flats on the outer edge. The ring's outer diameter is 7-3/8"" measured across the flats.I give these specs because I'm trying to fit a ring to an ancient Photogenic Medalight Model PG-4001-ML Studio Strobe monolight. They don't really have a secure way to mount speedrings or other accessories and I was hoping I could adapt this Bowens. This ring will not fit if I attempt to put it on correctly (that is, with the lug-side facing the strobe) because of the slight tapering of both the ring and the molded plastic of the Medalight. But if I reverse the ring (lugs out) it friction fits to the strobe perfectly. See the pictures. Almost like it was made for it.Speedrings used to be very, very expensive and still are from certain manufacturers. How this quality of ring can be custom cast, nuts and bolts and thumbscrews added, packaged, shipped and delivered for such a low cost is simply amazing.

"The unit I received was not like the picture at all, though it was marked as an N7301.First, it it much larger than expected. The description says it can take a maximum diameter light of 4-3/4"". This unit can take 5-1/2"". It closes down to about 2-3/4"".Second, the four holes to receive the softbox rods are only 1/8"" in diameter. All my softbox rods are much larger and will not fit. I could drill the holes out, but it's just too big and heavy for what I want to do.The unit is very sturdy -- made of cast metal. The screws are about 5/16"" in diameter (possibly metric) and are not tiny flimsy things. The rubber tips are strong and secure. The two rings can rotate against each other for turning the softbox after mounting and there's a locking thumbscrew to secure them from moving after positioning.This ring would be fine if: 1) your rods are 1/8"" in diameter and 2) your light is in the 5"" diameter range.My old Medalight monolights are 3-3/4"" in diameter. Technically, this ring could fit, but would be screwed almost all the way to min diameter. The biggest problem is that the holes don't fit my flexrods.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R302OADZXZFYJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TL40HK#wasThisHelpful","R302OADZXZFYJP","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a couple of these right angle Micro-to-Normal HDMI adapters to fit my Panasonic GH4.

The large-diameter knurled thumbwheel allows secure tightening.I've bought a lot from SmallRig and will probably buy more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2D6Z6K5NELL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TAO7CM#wasThisHelpful","R1W2D6Z6K5NELL","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This auxiliary lens support is superb and works extraordinarily well.If you want to put a long lens on your DSLR or Panasonic GH4, and you have a 15mm rod system, this is indispensable if you want to achieve a solid rig, especially during focusing or zooming.Pros:- Solid machined aluminum with hard black anodizing- No parts can escape; it's cleverly assembled as a unit- Thin profile (about 5/16"" thin); it fits under the lens, supports and doesn't take too much room- Quick disconnect from the 60mm-spaced 15mm rods, but attaches firmly- Adjustable height- Locking knobs are easily accessible, not under the lens; no tools or pesky allen wrench required- One knob locks the device to the rods, the other locks height- The height locking knob bites into a machined groove so as the aluminum becomes nicked by the lock, it still allows for smooth movement up and down. This is good engineering.- The brilliantly-designed rubber hold-down strap is about 3/8"" wide and adjusts to any size up to my 4-3/8"" diameter Rokinon 800M-B-AI 800mm F8.0 Mirror Lens for Nikon (Black)...which really needs this support at that focal length.- Mounts faster under the lens than fiddling with a bridge and 1/4-20 bolt, should the lens have an aux tripod shoe, which many lenses do not. Much faster to mount my 70-200mm Nikon lens that if I bolt it down via its tripod foot.- Works with any lens as long as there is a part of the lens that doesn't rotate that you can wrap the rubber strap over; you obviously cannot strap this to the focus or zoom rings- Is amazingly stable; the rubber strap really holds, even though it's flexible- Goes on and off in a flash- Stores compactly- Light weight and simpleCons:- The rubber strap, I fear, will only last so long, and will eventually rot or harden and crack. It is a molded strap that is attached to the device at one end via a hinge pin that doesn't appear to be removable. Even then, I'm sure a small bungee or something else could be pressed into duty. And if I keep it sealed in a ziplock poly bag away from UV and ozone, it should last years and years. Also, don't keep it under tension; let the rubber relax between jobs.- A bit pricy in absolute terms, but in relative terms compared to other supports I shopped for out there, this is a bargain. Some are hundreds of dollars. And Amazon got it here in two days.Bottom line, this firms up the lens, especially when equipped with a follow focus unit, eases downward pressure on the camera flange and allows steady tracking when using a good tripod and head.Couldn't be happier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JPV5HXGK1Z1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWV426Q#wasThisHelpful","R2JPV5HXGK1Z1F","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you simply want a digital tuner that can receive off-air (OTA) digital antenna TV transmission and deliver free HD television from local stations to virtually any TV new or old, this is it.If you want to record programming off the air via antenna, this is a possible candidate, if you add a small portable hard drive.Pros:1. HDMI output for modern TVs2. Component (YRB) and composite RCA connectors output for older analog TVs obsoleted by the new transmission standards3. Left/right (white/red) RCA connectors analog audio4. Coax RCA Dolby Digital audio output to send surround audio to your Dolby amp5. Really inexpensive6. USB output for recording to a hard drive7. Antenna can loop through the unit so the TV's tuner (if it has one) still works8. Lightweight and small size: 8-5/8"" wide, 1-5/8"" tall, 6"" deep (not counting connectors sticking out)Cons:1. There really isn't a channel guide2. You can set the timer to record, but you have to do it one at a time and it doesn't remember. IOW, you can't set it so it records a show at the same time every week.3. Recording is essentially, ""Record channel X from this time to that time"" not ""Record 'Dancing With The Stars' whenever it's on""4. When you want to play back, all you see is, ""Recording 1."" No information as to title, channel or anything. If you have multiple shows recorded, you can't tell which is which.5. No partial playback. If you stop the playback and come back later to finish, you start over again and fast forward to resume.6. Remote is lame and not very responsive. No jump forward or jump back capability7. It's nothing like the cable-company DVR you have grown to like but are tired of paying through the nose forYes, it records, but it's really not worth it. They need to spend more time on the interface to add capabilities we all want.You also need to keep the tuner tuned to that channel during recording.

"These batteries charge either with the included charger or the Panasonic factory charger. They seem to last the same amount of time in the camera. Fit and finish are fine. Excellent backup power for the Panasonic GH4.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SRFK4O2URENC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYZ0DYC#wasThisHelpful","R3SRFK4O2URENC","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially, this was a terrific accessory for the Panasonic GH4's light weight and electronic viewfinder.The promise to be able to remotely trigger the autofocus and then with a full press of the trigger either take the picture or begin video recording was attractive.In practice, however, the system causes the camera to take pictures or go into record (based on what mode you're in) virtually uncommanded. Not sure why. It's very annoying to carry the camera, look into the viewfinder to frame the shot, only to discover it's already been in Record for who knows how long.Secondly, the adapter cable has only one right angle connector.  Both ends are micro-phono plugs -- smaller than 1/8"" headphone size. The right angled end has a tip/ring/ring/sleeve plug. The straight end has a normal tip/ring/sleeve ""stereo audio"" configuration. The instructions are very unclear as to which end goes where. I tried both and it seems that the right angled end goes into the camera. That leaves the straight end sticking out the side of the pistol grip.I like the coiled cord: it doesn't get in the way but reaches fine. It just puts a lot of pressure on the straight end connector. It would be way better if both ends were right angle.It has a 1/4-20 mounting socket on the bottom so you can add a wrist strap for security. Would have been nice if one were included. It's a lot of value on this grip and a strap would add a little peace of mind.In operation, it's like holding an old 8mm film camera, especially looking through the GH4's electronic eyepiece viewfinder. It adds comfort and stability. As the GH4 with 12-35mm lens weighs only 1.91 lbs (865 grams) you really don't need a monster shoulder rig.I was able to walk down a hallway at the 12mm position and Optical Image Stabilization engaged and the video came was pretty smooth -- easily as smooth as a shoulder mount.I just wish the trigger worked properly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R3AOYE9O6HBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWTHO5W#wasThisHelpful","R3R3AOYE9O6HBZ","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The table insert exactly like that that came with my Powermatic Model 66 original fit just fine. Over the years, it became increasingly tight, as if either the potmetal plate was getting bigger (somehow expanding) or the hole in the cast iron top was shrinking.It got so I had to tap it to get the plate to go into the hole and removing it was quite difficult. I often needed to pry it out to change blades.Eventually, I built a zero-clearance wood insert and put the original potmetal version away.I recently pulled out the old plate with an intention of sanding its edges down on my disc sander until it fit. I started removing material a bit at a time where it looked like it was rubbing.I inserted the plate into the hole, tapped it home and then tried to remove it. It was as if it had been swaged in place. Try as I might, I could not remove the plate. I attempted to pry it out with a block and long screwdriver though one of the finger holes, and, SNAP!, it broke in half.Like I said, strange indeed. Something changed size. Either the table hole or the insert.I'd like to use the insert, but I seriously don't believe it's worth $56, especially if it doesn't fit my table's hole anymore and I'll have to machine it down to get it to fit.Pretty disappointed....","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F25B556AXPX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DHHRY#wasThisHelpful","R1F25B556AXPX6","A1U5IJHJK84S54","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U5IJHJK84S54?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The scooter is high quality and durable, so you aren't going to have to worry about it breaking as you ride, It actually is meant for riders 14 and up. I really like that it has the slip resistant guards where your feet are placed, which is perfect when you are riding. This is wonderful for beginner or novice riders. This was actually my first attempt at riding, and I caught on after just a few minutes. It is an amazing scooter that you will have a ton of fun on!

"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:Meh, this is an ok MP3 player, sound is fine but I didn't really like the controls.  Not at all intuitive. You would think the center button is the select button, it's not.  The built in games are fun, but hard to play due to the odd way the button layout works.  I down-sampled a video and it played it fine, this would be useful for the kiddos.  If you down sample vid to 400x240 you can fit a lot of movies on the device and keep the kids entertained on road trips, although the battery isn't the best so you'll need an auto adapter handy.I guess for the price it's an ok value, but I think you can get much better performance out of a cheap Android phone (can pick a used one up for about the same cost as this).","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XH3UO5F3H5FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z92CRUK#wasThisHelpful","R2XH3UO5F3H5FM","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:Overall: Comfortable, light weight, good sound and a great battery.The headset is easily light enough to wear without the ear-clip (easily removed).  If you're running or being very active you will want the clip though, while the headset stays in place without the clip it will fall off if you're moving your head a lot.The call sound is great and it has a good range.  I've been able to get about two days of use with moderate call time (few hours each day).The one button design is easy to get used to.  Long press to pair, short press to answer/end calls and to activate Google voice/Siri.  Sound quality is ok for music but this headset is tuned for voice calls so music sound a little light on the bass.Overall I would recommend.

"I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:The are some of the best sounding hard-wired in-ear buds I've tried.  I would say they're even on par with the Bose IE headphones.  The Bose have a better dynamic range, but only an audiophile would notice the difference.  These produce deep bass without distortion, clear highs and smooth mids.  They do a great job of sealing outside noise as well.They're very comfortable to wear and I like the removable cord design.  This is going to do a great job of preventing shorts and if a short does happen, you can replace just the cable. The only con I can find is the end of the cables that plug into the earbuds have a stiff wire in them and it needs to be adjusted for total comfort.  I suppose this is there to prevent shorts from occurring though and is only a slight inconvenience.All-in-all great earbuds, great sound, very comfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34DQCIWSBDI1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMZ746#wasThisHelpful","R34DQCIWSBDI1I","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:I have a few BT headsets like this, simple design with parts that go in your ear, and a wire around your neck.  This one is by FAR the best in this genre I've tried.  Sound is VERY good, call functions work as they should and it's VERY, VERY comfortable to wear.Like I said, it has really good sound for it's design and price point (MUCH better than a pair of LG Tone headphones I have that cost twice as much).  The fit is also very comfortable and they do a great job of blocking ambient noise, they really seal out outside sound.  Great bass, clear highs, smooth mids.  No distortion even at full volume.The only con I can see is the battery isn't the best I've seen.  I've been able to get about 2 hours of talk time AND about 2 hours of vid/music out of a charge.  NOT bad, but the LG's do last a little longer.  Personally, I think the MUCH better sound is worth the loss in power life.When they're paired to your phone and clipped together via the magnet, all you have to do is separate them to answer an incoming call - clip them back together to end the call, this is convenient.If you have any questions please feel free to ask.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JDIOYKEDI35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017BAA8VC#wasThisHelpful","R25JDIOYKEDI35","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:I've actually received a few items from Eceen for review, and like the others, this is a great piece of tech.  The thing I notice most about Eceen products is the build quality, it's always great.  This speaker is no different.  I do have to admit I'm a bit of an Eceen fanboy, but it's with due cause, their products are are very well made.This speaker is great, not so much for the sound quality (it sounds good, but it's no Bose), but for the fit and finish, it's design and price point.  It has a beast of a battery, last forever.  Has a handy storage compartment to stash you phone (small iPhone will fit) or headphones, extra cables, batteries, etc.  Built in carabine/clip is very handy, I have mine attached to a shoulder sling on my chest and it works very well in this configuration.It's waterproof to IPX5 (can take a splash, but not submersion), the sound is slightly better than other $30 BT speakers (but unlike most inexpensive BT speakers, this one is actually stereo with two speakers), and I really like the design.  Eceen sent me a bike speaker just like this but with a mount attached to the bottom, at the time I wished it was a clip on design as I didn't need the mount, this fits the bill perfectly for a pack mounted speaker.It's plenty loud, no distortion, not much bass though.  If you want better sound you're going to have to spend more.  For the price this is a good speaker and with the added waterproofness, storage and build quality, it a great buy.  This speaker will be attached to my pack for the foreseeable future.If you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comment below.

"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:I've tested and reviewed many solar chargers. Ranging from 7W-28W and have to say this is without a doubt the best bang for your buck.  It puts out the most power of all I've tried (including the 28W model when charging a 5V USB device).There are two USB out ports. a 2.1A and a 1A (see pic attached).  Using a Drok USB volt meter running from the charger (2.1A port) to a high capacity/high draw external battery pack, the charger was able to produce 10.2W (5.14V @ 1.99A).  I went to snap a picture and the power dropped slightly as I moved the charger to get a better angle for the shot (the picture attached is of 9.82W, 4.96V @ 1.98A).  This was done at 3PM, a couple hours past the optimum time to test a solar charger.  This is fantastic performance.  I'm quite sure it could do better too, but the battery attached was simply at max draw.The solar panels are of the monocrystalline variety.  They are flexible and you don't need to worry about dropping the charger and having a panel crack.The build quality is nice and robust with solid stitching and material around (it's all nylon).  It has two fold out legs to position it toward the sun (see picture attached) and four loops to hang it from whatever.  It also includes two small caribiners.  The mesh storage compartment is large enough to easily fit a 20,000mAh battery, the biners, and a USB cable (interestingly enough one was not included).All-in-all its a fantastic value for the money.  Less than two years ago this charger would of been a couple hundred bucks.There are plenty of pictures attached for reference, and please feel free to ask any questions you may have in the comment below.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIAK56JVQHZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011UH0ZCY#wasThisHelpful","R3EIAK56JVQHZQ","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:1st off you need to realize these microfiber towels are much different than a regular terrycloth towel.  It's a thin, yet very absorbent material that also dries way faster than a regular towel. And unlike a regular towel will dry you even when wet.  Just ring it out and it's good to go.I have a few microfiber towels and this one is by far the largest and is the only one that arrived colorfast (it didn't bleed at all, the others I've tried bled terribly at first).The stitching on the edges seems good and the included case is well built too.  You will want to wash it before first use as it does leave some fuzzies on you if you don't.  Cold wash, hang to dry.If you're looking for a towel for the gym, traveling, camping, etc this is the one you'll want. Packs small and light while being plenty large enough to cover your body.  I love microfiber towels and this is the best I've seen so far.  The included hand towel was a nice addition too.If you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments below.

" 5:41 Mins I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:The folks that are leaving bad reviews really need to lower their expectations. This is after all, only a $100 projector. If you're expecting a full 1080 resolution with a lot of bells-and-whistles, then you're going to need to pony up the dough for a high-end projector. If you're looking for an inexpensive projector for the kids or backyard movie night then this is a great solution.I paired it with a inexpensive screen (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M6JXPHS) and built the frame for less than $30 out of PVC. Complete setup (projector, screen and frame) costs under $160The resolution on this projector is the same (but in a wide-screen format) as old school TV's. Imagine what an 80"" tube TV would look like, that's exactly what this projector produces - and I love it. Setting it up in the backyard really reminds me of going to the drive-in as a kiddo. Pair it with a nice speaker and its a great experience.1000 lumens is plenty bright in a dark environment (it isn't too bad in a very dimly lit area either). It would be nice if it was a bit brighter, but for the money its totally acceptable.I paired it with a Chromecast and it works perfectly. Streams all the content on my laptop great and streaming Netflix from the Chrome browser works seamlessly too.Check the video review to see it in action and for more details.If you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments below.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9J8MZ6E769MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWKPTUC#wasThisHelpful","R9J8MZ6E769MM","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They'll easily hold several pounds each.All-in-all its a great value.

" 3:42 Mins I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:This is a handy little endoscope.  Comes with three attachments: 1 magnet, 1 hook, and 1 mirror (the mirror one is useless).  The magnet is powerful and is very useful for finding and retrieving lost screw/nut/bolts and other light-med weight ferrous objects.  The hook is ok, haven't really had a use for it yet.  All three are kind of hard to attach to the scope - this is the only downside to the setup.I received the 1 meter version and it works really well.  This picture is bright (and the screen has auto exposure, if it's too bright it will dim to the right level), the LED's on the end of the scope are bright and very adjustable, and the image quality is very clear.  You can flip the image by holding down the + key.There's already a very detailed video review posted, just thought I'd throw my $.02 in.All-in-all it's a handy little device I'm sure I'll get plenty of use out of.

"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:This is a fantastic little charger.  Build quality is great, fits the outlet as it should, and the USB ports are spot on - not too tight, not too loose, and it charges VERY fast (as fast as you device will support).  If you have fast charging on devices like the Note 4 this charger fits the bill perfectly.I do wish the had it in t a three port version though.

" 3:19 Mins I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:First off, this is a great little table. It's light, sturdy, unpacks & folds up easily and seems to be well made. Bare in mind its a light weight portable camping table and won't support a ton of weight (i.e. don't sit on it). There's no wiggle and everything fits together perfectly.I found two small drawbacks: 1) there are two ""ribs"" running across the table for support and they make the surface a little uneven. 2) the nylon surface is a little soft and anything with a small footprint might not be super stable. These are only very slight issues though and I don't see anyway around them without adding weight or making it harder to attach the tabletop to the frame.See the video to see what I'm talking about.  NOTE: I call the product by the wrong name by mistake in the video.The measurement are:16.5"" wide x 22"" long x 15"" tallWeighs 34.6ozAll in all its an awesome table and I'm sure I'll get a lot of use out of it (I actually edited this video review while outside using the table!).Please feel free to ask any questions you may have in the comments below.

" 4:22 Mins I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:First off I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality.  Compared to the Beat solo BT headphones these sound just as good, tuned a little less bass heavy though.  Crisp highs, full mids and mild bass, nothing sounds muddy.  Volume goes high enough you'll damage your hearing if you blast them for an extended period.  Padding is very comfortable, both on the ears and at the top of the head.The build quality is very nice and I think they look really sharp.  Fit and finish is great, the glossy black and matte red look great together.  The simi-hard case they come with a decent, but nothing to write home about.  Does the trick to protect the headphones while in your backpack or so on.Pairing was a snap and they can pair with two devices simultaneously.  Listen to a movie on your tablet and take calls on your phone at the same time (movie pauses when a call comes in and resumes once the call is ended).I've gotten about 6-8 hours of play time out of them (3-4 a day for a couple days) and have yet to have to recharge them.  Good battery life.All-in-all I think these are a great value for the price ($49.99 as of this review).  If you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comment below.

" 4:18 Mins I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:I've actually received several Eceen products to review and have become a bit of a fan.  All their products so far have been outstanding.  They really pay attention to quality, both in terms of build quality and quality control.  This speaker is no exception.One thing that isn't mentioned in the listing (and I forgot to mention it in the vid) is that this is rated as IPx5 waterproof (can be subjected to direct low pressure sprays of water).  It's not meant to be submersed but it can withstand a shower or hard rain.  After I shot the video I wanted to test the waterproof-ness of it and put it in the shower, let it play for like 10 minutes and it came out fine.  It wasn't directly under the jets, but was getting a good bit of residual splash and it held up and continued to play and sound fine.  The interior stayed dry too (although the outside was fairly drenched, the material does soak up the watter a bit).  Unless you're in an insane typhoon or submerse it in water, I'm sure it'll work fine and keep the contents dry too.The overall build quality, like all Eceen products I've tested, is great.  Everything is put together nicely, no loose stitches, and it really feels substantial in the hand.The sound quality is good, nothing an audiophile would write home about.  But for the price, and the fact it's waterproof, and it's also a 4000mAh power bank, I was pretty impressed.  It's plenty loud, great mids and highs, a little weak with the base, but you really can't expect much more from something in this form factor.  It definitely loud enough you could use it on a moped or other small motorized device and still hear fine.Pairing is easy as expected.  Turn it on the first time, look for it with your phone and then connect.  It just works.  One note about the BT: In your device list it will show up as ""K-95"".  Woulda been nice if they actually named it Eceen Bike Speaker or something like that.  Oh well, just change the name as soon as you pair it to find it easily again later (although, you probably don't have like 100 devices attached to your phone like I do - lol)Regarding the power bank; it will charge my note 4 from 0% to 80% in about 60 minutes.  That's pretty impressive.All-in-all I love this speaker. Great build, good sound, looks sharp and is super versatile.

" 4:38 Mins I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:The video shows it in action if you want to get a feel for the sound.  It has a nice range although could use a little more base (can't really expect it to boom in such a small form factor though).  I love the look and the build quality is great too.Pairing is a snap using the NFC (not in the video but I did try it and it works quite smoothly). I REALLY like it's clear in your bluetooth list what it is, clearly labeled ""VENSTAR taco"".  Many of these Chinese speakers are simply labeled something like ""C27"" or ""ABC1"" or something like that, makes it hard to identify the speaker you're trying to pair.  Nice touch clearly labeling this in the device list.Getting to the charging and aux port is a little challenging but once you figure it out, it's easy.  See the video to see what I mean.All-in-all it's a nice little speaker.  Has decent sound, a great battery, very good build quality, useful case (includes carabiner)  and looks really sharp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQRUMS9BXC50J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012SA051I#wasThisHelpful","RQRUMS9BXC50J","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:23 Mins I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:This is a nice little rechargeable lantern.  The fit and finish is great, adjustments from ""warm"" to ""cool"" light works very well, and the capacitive ""buttons"" are awesome (they're not physical ""buttons"", you just touch your finger to them and they work - like your cell phone screen). It really reminds me of something from the movie Wall-E.I've been testing this light for the last few days and so far, I'm a big fan.  It goes from nice and dim (medium night-light) to pretty bright (light up a medium sized room well or a tent blindingly).As of now I've only had to charge it once initially. I've used it for about 5-6 hours and it's still kicking.  I've been using it to navigate around the house at night and as a bedside light to read by, and I love it.  The only caveat I have is that is uses a mini USB port and not a micro.  Not a huge deal, but limits the cables (I already have tons of) that can be used with it. It does come with a nice long mini UBS cable though.Check out the video review to see it in action.  Super versatile light that looks very cool, works even better, and is actually fun to play with.Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions in the comments below and I'll do my best to help.

"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:If you're looking for a THIN case with a kickstand this is probably the one you'll want.  There really aren't very many options for skin type cases that also have the kickstand functionality, in fact, this is the first I've seen.The case isn't going to protect well against drops but will do a great job protecting the back and sides from scratches. It is a thin but very well formed plastic case and fits the phone like a glove.The icing on the cake is the kickstand is also a clever micro USB cable.  Micro is standard type but the full size end is kind of like 1/2 a regular USB plug. You just plug it into the side of the port that has the larger opening, with the contact face down and it works great.  I was a little skeptical, but found it makes a great connection.  Can wiggle and move it and it stays put great.The case is a little gimmicky, but it is the only really thin type case I've seen that has the kickstand and the USB cable is very functional.  It's not going to provide much protection, but if you just want a thin type case with a kickstand this will serve your needs perfectly.  The USB cable is a great little bonus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13XCTA2T58XS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105PIL8C#wasThisHelpful","R13XCTA2T58XS8","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:This is by far the smallest headset I've ever tried and it works quite well.  Range is decent, sound is good on both ends of calls, and the ability to plug in the other ear is great.It came with a plethora of ear pieces of different sizes and styles and several ear hooks if you don't like using just the ear piece (I found it works best with the swivel hook).The call quality is good (almost on par with my Bose in-ear headset), but the stereo is a little lackluster.  It isn't bad per se, just a little tinny and lacks punch.  I wasn't really expecting more though from such small headphones.I think the ability to convert them to stereo is what really sets them apart.  If you're looking for a single ear BT headset you can quickly convert to stereo for music and videos this is a great solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JYIPZBRYTPWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2BB2UU#wasThisHelpful","R1JYIPZBRYTPWI","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm using these in a fan that normally takes 4 x 1.2V NmHi rechargeable batteries and the added 1.6v really upped the power.  The fan is also rated to take standard 1.5V alkaline batteries so it's just .4V over it's rated load, the fan's motor handles the extra power just fine. I wanted a way to have the higher power without having to constantly replace alkaline batteries and these do the trick well.I haven't had the chance to test their claimed capacity but it seems a little shy of 2500mAh for sure.  The run about half as long as the NmHi, but put out like 50% more airflow, still, if there were 2500mAh they should last about as long as similarly rated NmHi batteries.Other than that they seem to be quality cells and do put out considerably more power than standard HmHi rechargeable batteries.They do take a while to charge and can ONLY be charged with a charged meant for NiZn chemistry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9NMBSUOP7WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTRSTAU#wasThisHelpful","R2K9NMBSUOP7WA","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 6:46 Mins I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:First off, the design of this chair is ingenious.  It's basically a clone of the Big Agnes Helinox chair so we have to give them credit for that.  It's essentially built out of tent poles configured in a way that the chair supports your weight like a hammock stand.  The weight of your body is directed directly down into the poles, there's no lateral forces trying to bend them.  it's really a smart design.The chair is also light, very light.  It weighs 35.5OZ with the case. When you see the size of the chair the lightness is even more impressive.One feature this chair has that the Big Agnes Helinox doesn't, is the adjustable legs.  This allows you to raise or lower the chair and to also make adjustments for uneven or sloped ground.  Nice improvement over the Big A chair.All the materials have a nice fit and finish and the corners where the poles attached are robustly reinforced.  The poles aren't poking through this material anytime soon.  The poles are quite ridged, very little flex, and everything fits together very well.  The main material of the chair surface is the only thing I would worry about, just thin nylon and if there's a failure, this is where it's going to be.I do think you'll want to be gentle with it to keep the material from tearing or the poles from buckling though.  Shouldn't be a problem as long as you don't just slam yourself into it, treat it like an ultralight piece of gear.I've clocked several hours in it and so far I love it. I'm 180lbs and it holds me just fine with no flex.  The chair is also VERY comfortable.  You can recline or sit up straight.The best way to really get a feel for how the chair works, is put together and the material, is to check the video.I love chair and its definitely going to be my new go-to event and camping chair (and I have a LOT of camping chairs).  Just so light, comfy, clever and portable.  I dig it.If you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comment below.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TUFS3UPMUEOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2A7UNO#wasThisHelpful","R1TUFS3UPMUEOR","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:34 Mins This is a sweet little sports camera.  While it only shoots in 720HD it produces great video at a fraction of the cost of a GoPro.The audio could be a little better (although in the video review I say it's worse than it actually is, I noticed it was better than I first thought when I was editing the review together).  Not great audio, but close to what you'd get on a cell phone video.The waterproof case it comes with is rock solid.  I tested it in a couple feet of water, squeezing/twisting/pushing all the buttons and it didn't leak a drop.  It feels very robust in the hand and the closing mechanism is solid.The camera has several modes of operation and options:Videos: 720P 480PPictures: 1MP, 2MP, 3MP and 5MPBurst photos (takes rapid fire pics as long as you're holding down the shutter button)Photo timer (2 or 10 second delay - they call this ""time lapse"" for some reason)Time Lapse in 1, 2, 5 10 and 30 second delays between shots (they call this ""continuous lapse"", but it is time lapse).  You'll need to stitch the images together in a program like PowerDirector to make the time lapse but the end result is really cool (and actually really easy to do).Looping video - this is great if you plan on using this as a dash-cam. Deletes the old as it records newExposure adjustment (+/- 2EV)Auto screen off (even while recording) in 30 second, 1 min, 3 min or offAuto power off in 1 min, 3 min or 5 minDate and time stamp on or offCan format the SD card from the camera but from what I can tell you can't delete individual vids or pics.Check the video to see the camera in action and hear the audio it produces.All-in-all for $35 you can't beat the deal on this camera.  Like all Chinese products the quality control can be hit or miss.  If you get a bad unit just exchange it for a new one.  It's worth the money savings in my opinion.I was provided as sample for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJJ6ZITZQTRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010LUU3Y6#wasThisHelpful","R2JJJ6ZITZQTRN","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little mount.  The suction cup part is not only a suction cup, but also has a adhesive back that makes it insanely sticky.  It's the type of adhesive that you can wash if it loses it's stick to rejuvenate it.  It's pretty impressive.The magnet part works well, but I found I had to use the large metal sticker piece that is meant to go between your phone and a case on the outside of the case.  It worked ok in between the case and the phone, but I'm using it on a Note 4 with a large case and it just didn't provide enough oomph.  I tried sticking it to the outside of the case and it worked great.  Phone sticks to the magnet great.  I've attached a picture to see what the metal sticker looks like on the phone case.The mount does take a little getting used to.  While the phone does stick well, you have to remember you can't just hit the home key hard or the phone will come off.  Just takes a day or so and it become second nature to be a little more gentle with it.I love the convenience of it.  Just set the phone on it and go.  Don't need to open a clamp, just set it where you want it and boom, good to go.All-in-all I like the mount, the convenience and the super sticky suction cup are awesome.I was provided a sample for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RYME6U9ICQIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJSBBG8#wasThisHelpful","R2RYME6U9ICQIC","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:I'm a big fan of this fan, it puts out a nice volume of air and is also very versatile.  It can be used free standing and is nice a stable but the best part is the clip on the bottom.  I use it on our 4 month old daughter's car seat, stroller and high chair. I've also used it clipped on a beach/camping chair for myself and I love it.  It can be positioned at any angle you need, it rotates 360 degrees on two axises meaning you can position it to face any direction (front/back/up/down - it will face any direction while clipped to something).  The clip has rubber pads and is sticky and opens to around 3"".It has an infinitely variable power dial, meaning 0-100% power and every step in between. Charges via micro USB (includes a cable) and uses 18650 battery (2200mAh battery included).If you're going to be using it with an unattended child I would highly recommend getting a better battery.  The included battery is what's called ""unprotected"", meaning there's no overcharge or short-circuit protection and these cheap Li-Ion battery have been know to leak or catch fire.  There's a VERY small chance this is going to happen but better safe than sorry.  A protected cell is a little harder to fit in the fan as they're a tad longer (the microchip built into the battery makes it longer).  You can pick up better batteries on Amazon for like $10 for a pair and they'll come with an external charger that will charge way faster too.  You'll want an extra battery anyway, if you're like us you'll use it a lot and it's nice to have a spare or three around.I tried to test charging time using the built in micro USB port and it took a long time, I fell asleep before it was done so I didn't get the time.  My best guess is 6-8 hours to fully charge it.  This is a non-issue for me though as I wouldn't expect an item like this to even charge the battery in the first place (icing on the cake I guess).  When using USB to power the fan it's not as powerful for some reason, even with a fully charged battery.Other than the cheap battery I love this fan.  The amount of air it moves and the versatility of it is great.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a rechargeable, portable, clippable, small, freestanding, powerful fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YBV3QDFF4AIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VM47NWG#wasThisHelpful","R2YBV3QDFF4AIM","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great charger, much better in my experience than the Samsung brand version.

The cord that came with the Samsung charger was a dud too (although this doesn't come with a cable).This charger so far (three weeks) has worked perfectly.  The battery fits slightly better in this one too (nice snug fit, the Samsung was a tad loose).This is a great external charger, and as the description states it works well with an external battery pack to charge too.  I would highly recommend this charger - MUCH better value than the Samsung original.I was provided a sample for review (I asked for one as I was having issues with the Samsung brand charger) and am pleased LEMFO provided one to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UWZGG5IVX303/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFCRO0W#wasThisHelpful","R1UWZGG5IVX303","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:46 Mins I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:First off, the design of this chair is ingenious.  It's basically a clone of the Big Agnes Helinox chair so we have to give them credit for that.  It's essentially built out of tent poles configured in a way that the chair supports your weight like a hammock stand.  The weight of your body is directed directly down into the poles, there's no lateral forces trying to bend them.  it's really a smart design.The chair is also light, very light.  It weighs 35.5OZ with the case. When you see the size of the chair the lightness is even more impressive.One feature this chair has that the Big Agnes Helinox doesn't, is the adjustable legs.  This allows you to raise or lower the chair and to also make adjustments for uneven or sloped ground.  Nice improvement over the Big A chair.All the materials have a nice fit and finish and the corners where the poles attached are robustly reinforced.  The poles aren't poking through this material anytime soon.  The poles are quite ridged, very little flex, and everything fits together very well.  The main material of the chair surface is the only thing I would worry about, just thin nylon and if there's a failure, this is where it's going to be.I do think you'll want to be gentle with it to keep the material from tearing or the poles from buckling though.  Shouldn't be a problem as long as you don't just slam yourself into it, treat it like an ultralight piece of gear.I've clocked several hours in it and so far I love it. I'm 180lbs and it holds me just fine with no flex.  The chair is also VERY comfortable.  You can recline or sit up straight.The best way to really get a feel for how the chair works, is put together and the material, is to check the video.I love chair and its definitely going to be my new go-to event and camping chair (and I have a LOT of camping chairs).  Just so light, comfy, clever and portable.  I dig it.If you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comment below.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZNLST5QXQD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO9T2EI#wasThisHelpful","R31ZNLST5QXQD9","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:34 Mins This is a sweet little sports camera.  While it only shoots in 720HD it produces great video at a fraction of the cost of a GoPro.The audio could be a little better (although in the video review I say it's worse than it actually is, I noticed it was better than I first thought when I was editing the review together).  Not great audio, but close to what you'd get on a cell phone video.The waterproof case it comes with is rock solid.  I tested it in a couple feet of water, squeezing/twisting/pushing all the buttons and it didn't leak a drop.  It feels very robust in the hand and the closing mechanism is solid.The camera has several modes of operation and options:Videos: 720P 480PPictures: 1MP, 2MP, 3MP and 5MPBurst photos (takes rapid fire pics as long as you're holding down the shutter button)Photo timer (2 or 10 second delay - they call this ""time lapse"" for some reason)Time Lapse in 1, 2, 5 10 and 30 second delays between shots (they call this ""continuous lapse"", but it is time lapse).  You'll need to stitch the images together in a program like PowerDirector to make the time lapse but the end result is really cool (and actually really easy to do).Looping video - this is great if you plan on using this as a dash-cam. Deletes the old as it records newExposure adjustment (+/- 2EV)Auto screen off (even while recording) in 30 second, 1 min, 3 min or offAuto power off in 1 min, 3 min or 5 minDate and time stamp on or offCan format the SD card from the camera but from what I can tell you can't delete individual vids or pics.Check the video to see the camera in action and hear the audio it produces.All-in-all for $35 you can't beat the deal on this camera.  Like all Chinese products the quality control can be hit or miss.  If you get a bad unit just exchange it for a new one.  It's worth the money savings in my opinion.I was provided as sample for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PALSE9GME5HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDTV4AC#wasThisHelpful","R3PALSE9GME5HJ","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:21 Mins I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:This is a very nice little dash cam for the price.  Look around Amazon and you'll see plenty of them that get well above $100 and for $37 (at the time of this review) this will do the job just fine.The video I recorded was good, but I only tested it in 720 mode and not 1080 (I only had a 2gb micro SD card and was worried about storage space on the card).  I imagine using it in full HD mode would produce better results (and you can see the video it captured in this video review).The menu isn't hard to figure out once you play with it a bit and the instructions are helpful (but typical of instructions that are translated from Chinese to English).  It has plenty of recording options (always record if the vehicle is on, start once it detects motion, capture still shots) and you can set it to record in low-def (240P) all the way up to 1080P.The only real gripe I had was with the audio quality - it's horrendous.  You can make out words and sounds but it's not clear at all.  For the purpose this camera serves I don't think it's a deal breaker though, this thing is made to capture video.  This is the reason I only gave it four stars.Check the video review to see it in action and for more details.Overall I'm pleased with the device and it has found a new home on my dashboard (there's been a million times I've wished I had a dash-cam and now I do).If you have any quesitons please feel free to ask in the comment below.

" 3:17 Mins I was provided a sample for review and here are my thoughts:When I first opened the packaging I was a little disappointed as the fan was smaller than I had thought it was going to be (although I don't know why I thought it was going to be larger).  The disappointment soon subsided once I charged the battery, popped it in and turned the fan on - it really kicks air for it's size.The battery it comes with is a very simple 18650 battery at 2200mAh (came almost fully charged). I charged it fully using an external battery charger I already had and then proceeded to test the longevity - it lasted right around two hours on high.  Not too shabby.  The fan must use a digital controller because it just stopped working when the battery died, didn't start slowing down/get weaker/etc.  Just up and stopped.  At first I thought there was a problem with the fan, but nope, popped in another battery and it was up and running again.There are three settings - high, medium and low.  Pretty standard really.  One thing the listing or other reviews don't mention is that there's also a small built in flashlight.  not terribly bright but perfect for finding your way around a tent or similar application.See the video to get an idea of size, see how it works and for complete details.All-in-all I'm very pleased with the little fan and know I'll get a ton of use out of it!  It really blew me away... (had to get that pun in here somewhere lol).

"I was provided a sample for review and these are my findings:First off, I found this to be a tough cable.  The nylon braiding makes for a cable that can be yanked, pulled on, so on and should resist shorts very well.  It's longer than your standard cable (twice the length), and the glowing feature is kind of cool.Like all glowing things (other than tritium), this needs exposure to light for it to glow.  It does glow brightly when exposed to light and it glows for a fair amount of time.  I've attached a picture of it in a dark room right after shining a flashlight on it and then in a well lit room about ten minutes later - it was still visibly glowing.Outside of the gimmicky glowing feature (that could be useful in a large dark gear bag), the cable performs very well.  Makes a great connection, has gold plated plugs, and is VERY durable.  Definitely replacing a similarly sized cable I keep in my gear bag, much better than your standard plastic cables no doubt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UD16YTGZB6XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4BLXT6#wasThisHelpful","R1UD16YTGZB6XS","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time of this review this item cost $7, so totally worth the price.  I'm using it to mount a monitor to a rig I have set up.  I've attached a couple photos of it.It holds the monitor no problem, it would likely hold twice the weight easily.  The spring is robust and holds the clamp quite well, the rubber on it provides a nice grip too.The listing says it has a 1/4"" and 3/8"" mount, this is incorrect, its only a 3/8"".

"I was offered a sample for review and wasn't sure what I would think about this battery, I'm usually a fan of larger capacity batteries.I read a review that said something to the effect of not enough power, well, it's only a 2600 mAh battery - it's not meant to charge an ipad, or even a smart phones fully.  What it is made for is an emergency top off and it does this very well.I tested it using a USB voltmeter (see the picture attached) and it PUMPED out power.  It put out 1.15Ah at 5.0V producing an impressive 5.75Watts.  This is 15% more than the rated output.  It charged my Samsung Note 4 from 50% to 90% in roughly 70 minutes.  Not bad for such a small form factor.  You have to bare in mind there is going to be loss and inefficiencies charging one battery with another, the smaller the battery, the more noticeable.  Charging my Note 4 40% would equal 1288mAh of usable power at 5V.  You'll also have to keep in mind when a battery is rated at a given mAh it's usually at 3.7V (the cells native voltage), more volts (i.e. 5V) equals less mAh.  This battery seemed to perform as rated for capacity and it over performed in terms of current.  Watts are always the best way to rate power (watts = volts x amps).There are no instructions.  Comes with a small USB cable.  LED blinks 1 time for low, 2 for med, 3 high.  This is true for both charging it, and while it's charging something else.Beside charging phones, this would be an ideal battery to charge things like Bluetooth headsets/speakers and other low capacity devices as it charges very fast.All-in-all I would recommend it for anyone looking for a super portable emergency battery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZXXIMKAC6AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGT2TOE#wasThisHelpful","R3RZXXIMKAC6AB","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Well built, excellent stitching, lots or room, the large molle pack at the bottom can be removed and used as a waist pack.

"I was provided a sample for evaluation and here are my thoughts:I've tested a couple selfie sticks and at fist I didn't think I would find any use for one, I was wrong.  Turns out they can be pretty handy and add some creative freedom to your selfies.Of the three I've tested I like this one the best for a couple reasons.  First being it folds up compactly (the camera mount folds nicely back over the stick itself).  The second is it's fairly rigid.  One of the selfies I tried had a tendency to want to turn left or right from the weight of the phone.  Kinda a pain to use.  The other, while it had a better locking extension system (worked like a shower curtain rod, twist to lock, wouldn't rotate from the weight of the phone, but also got stuck and was hard to unlock sometimes), was very bulky, wasn't wireless and just didn't pack down well - no point in having a selfie stick if it's a pain in the arse to take with you.  This model also opens the widest to 3.5"", fits my note 4 in a bulky case no prob.This selfie stick is does have some rotation from the weight of the phone, but it's not much and very manageable (like a 1/16 of a rotation, the other would turn 1/4 of the way around, very annoying).  It folds up very nicely and is by far the most portable of the three I've tried.It's a snap to pair to your phone, just hold down the power button for 3 seconds, it turns on and goes into pairing mode, find it with your phone and connect.  Takes 30 seconds (if that).  Charges via micro USB port at the bottom of the stick.The only down side is that it doesn't have a zoom function, this would be handy, but none in this price point I've tried do.  You also need to be sure to turn it off after each use or the battery will die - it doesn't have an auto off feature, bummer.All-in-all I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive selfie stick that it truly portable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6VAIREDBYO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE9KHW2#wasThisHelpful","R3G6VAIREDBYO7","A35AV29S3D1XWU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35AV29S3D1XWU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Bare in mind it's a 1/8"" thick steel safe, this is sturdy but won't stop someone who really wants in - a sledgehammer would do the trick but would take several blows to do it.  I wouldn't keep the Hope diamond in it, but it will do a great job of keeping kids, house guests, so on away from your hand guns.There's plenty of room inside for several hand guns too.  You could easily keep two per level (two levels = 4 guns) in small cases.

"Let the Earth Hear His Voice asks two questions of vital interest to preachers: (1) What is preaching? (2) How can we preach more effectively? The book provides answers to both questions that are biblically grounded, theologically sound, and proven by experience.Greg Scharf is a scholar-practitioner. He pastored three congregations in three countries, and now serves as chair of the practical theology department and professor of homiletics at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He authored or contributed to several books on preaching, including the revision and abridgment of John Stott‚Äôs classic book, Between Two Worlds: The Challenge of Preaching Today, which was published as The Challenge of Preaching.In the Introduction, Scharf cites J. I. Packer‚Äôs definition of preaching as his point of departure: ‚ÄúChristian preaching is the event of God himself bringing to an audience a Bible-based, Christ-related, life-impacting message of instruction and direction through the words of a spokesperson‚Äù (emphasis in original). Elsewhere, he describes preaching this way: ‚ÄúGod speaks to people through people.‚Äù Chapter 1 provides a biblical and theological rationale for this lofty understanding of preaching.The remainder of the book ‚Äî Chapters 2 through 10 ‚Äî identifies eight bottlenecks that ‚Äúkeep God‚Äôs voice from being heard‚Äù in the sermon and then identifies strategies for overcoming them. The bottlenecks are:1. Unbelief (Chapter 3)2. Unqualified or disqualified preachers (Chapter 4)3. Faulty text selection (Chapter 5)4. Inadequate understanding of the preaching passage (Chapter 6)5. Inadequate contextualization to the preaching situation (Chapter 7)6. Faulty organization (Chapter 8)7. Inadequate or overused illustration (Chapter 9)8. Flawed delivery (Chapter 10)The first two bottlenecks remind us that ineffective preaching does not always occur because of deficiencies in what might be called the mechanics of preaching, e.g., sermon organization and delivery. Sometimes, preaching is ineffective because of the spiritual, theological, and moral deficiencies of the preacher. In other words, sometimes we ‚Äî because of little faith, no spiritual gift, or moral failure ‚Äî are the bottlenecks hindering God speaking to others through us. That is a sobering thought, and preachers would be well advised to think it.Still, for those called and empowered to preach, it is imperative that we hone our craft and become the best preachers we can be. Effective preaching cannot be reduced to considerations of text selection, organization, illustration, application, and the like, but it cannot be separated from them either. Scharf provides valuable advice about how to write and deliver sermons that deliver God‚Äôs Word to our congregations.I should note, in closing, that Scharf is writing out of the Reformed or Calvinistic tradition. (P&R Publishing is also Reformed.) I recognize that the Calvinist doctrine of salvation is a controversial topic in Pentecostal and charismatic circles, whose doctrine has been shaped by Arminian and Wesleyan understandings of salvation. That said, Let the Earth Hear His Voice is nonetheless a worthwhile read because it articulates a definition of preaching that is the common inheritance of all evangelicals, not just our Reformed friends. No Christian fellowship has a corner on all truth, so it behooves us to read and listen to those outside our own theological tradition. As Scripture says, ‚ÄúIron sharpens iron‚Äù (Proverbs 27:17).

"The LUMINTOP TD16 is an excellent flashlight. Constructed of an anodized aluminum, it feels sturdy without being heavy. A button on the bottom turns it on and off, and a button on the side switches between its six modes: high-, medium-, and low-beam; strobe; flash and low flash. What's really amazing about this flashlight is how bright and far it shines. The price point puts it out of range for ordinary, household uses. I received a discount on mine and plan to use it for camping. The product details say it is designed for tactical use with firearms, but I can't speak to how well it does that.

"To be honest, I‚Äôm not the kind of guy who reads books like The Key to Everything. For one thing, I prefer reading ‚Äútheory‚Äù books to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù books. For another thing, I am wary of authors who promise simple answers to complex questions, let alone the key to everything.Simplicity comes in at least two kinds, however. The first kind is synonymous with foolishness. In this sense, a simple person‚Äîa simpleton‚Äîlacks knowledge or expertise. The second kind pertains to science. In this sense, a simple formula can explain complex phenomena. Think of E=mc2 as an example.Matt Keller‚Äôs book is simple in the second sense. He believes that teachability is the key to everything. ‚ÄúWithout teachability,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúyou and I will never reach our full potential or leave a mark on the world as we all desire to do.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt discount the roles intelligence, hard work, or native genius play in achieving success, by the way. He writes: ‚Äúall the right stuff minus teachability equals the loss of tremendous potential.‚ÄùWhat is teachability? Keller borrows Roger Seip‚Äôs formula from Train Your Brain for Success: ‚ÄúDesire to learn times willingness to change equals our level of teachability.‚Äù If you desire to learn but are not willing to change, or if you are willing to change but don‚Äôt desire to learn, you have a low ‚Äúteachability index.‚Äù The goal is to have a high one.After defining teachability, Keller outlines common roadblocks to teachability: pride, fear, insecurity, pain, and pace. Keller uses the negative example of King Saul from the Old Testament to illustrate these roadblocks. He then goes on to use the apostle Paul from the New Testament to illustrate characteristics of teachability:‚Ä¢ insatiable desire to learn and grow‚Ä¢ appropriate view of success‚Ä¢ openness to feedback‚Ä¢ flexible approach to life‚Ä¢ ability to handle failure wellKeller concludes his book with guidance about how to develop a lifestyle of teachability. ‚ÄúTeachability is not something we can develop from a single session or a simple intention. It doesn‚Äôt develop in spurts and starts.‚Äù Rather, he writes: ‚ÄúTrue teachability is a lifestyle‚Äîand it takes practice.‚ÄùMatt Keller is a Christian pastor and leadership coach, so most of his readers will be fellow pastors or leaders of parachurch ministries. Though his book refers to the Bible, Christian business professionals can safely use it as a coaching tool in a secular business environment too.The Key to Everything is a short, easy read. Don‚Äôt let those characteristics fool you, however. Keller is on to something. Whether teachability is the key to everything, I still can‚Äôt say. But it is the key to quite a lot. As Proverbs 4:7 puts it: ‚ÄúThe beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost you all, get understanding.‚Äù","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R177FTWZOOBCS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400204984#wasThisHelpful","R177FTWZOOBCS4","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the majority of Americans continues to self-identify as Christian, American culture is increasingly post-Christian. Evangelical Christians could once assume the broader culture agreed with them about the existence of God, the shape of moral living, and the usefulness of religious organizations. They can no longer do so. The urgent question evangelicals need to ask and answer is how to minister the gospel in this new cultural environment.Timothy Keller outlines an answer to that question in Center Church. Keller is founder and pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, and a New York Times bestselling author. Through Redeemer City to City, he mentors young urban church planters and pastors. Keller is also cofounder of The Gospel Coalition, a movement associated with the New Calvinism and the resurgence of a complementarian understanding of gender roles. As a Pentecostal, I disagree with both his Calvinism and complementarianism, though I hasten to add he doesn‚Äôt make them points of contentions in his book. Regardless, I believe that Center Church offers a theological vision of gospel ministry that repays careful consideration by ministers across the evangelical spectrum.Books about church tend to fall into two categories: what to believe (doctrine) and what to do (ministry). Center Church brings the two together in fruitful dialogue, resulting in ‚Äútheological vision.‚Äù Keller writes: ‚Äúa theological vision is a vision for what you are going to do with your doctrine in a particular time and place.‚Äù It develops ‚Äúfrom deep reflection on the Bible itself, but it also depends a great deal on what you think of the culture around you.‚ÄùKeller organizes his theological vision for ministry around three commitments: gospel, city, and movement. ‚ÄúBoth the Bible and church history show us that it is possible to hold all the correct individual biblical doctrines and yet functionally lose our grasp on the gospel,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúIt is critical, therefore, in every new generation and setting to find ways to communicate the gospel clearly and strikingly, distinguishing it from its opposites and counterfeits‚Äù (emphasis in original). Keller takes up this task in Parts 1 and 2, which focus on ‚ÄúGospel Theology‚Äù and ‚ÄúGospel Renewal‚Äù (or ‚ÄúRevival‚Äù), respectively.Parts 3, 4, and 5 focus on ‚ÄúGospel Contextualization,‚Äù ‚ÄúCity Vision,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCultural Engagement,‚Äù respectively. Keller writes: ‚ÄúAll churches must understand, love, and identify with their local community and social setting, and yet at the same time be able and willing to critique and challenge it.‚Äù These chapters are, in my opinion, the best in a very good book. We often think of missiology as the study of missions internationally‚Äîacross national, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. What Keller demonstrates is that missiological thinking is relevant intranationally‚Äîwithin our own culture. Evangelicals should not assume, as we have done for so long, that America is a Christian nation. We should rather approach it as a mission field and think of ourselves as missionaries to it.Finally, Parts 6, 7, and 8 focus on ‚ÄúMissional Community,‚Äù ‚ÄúIntegrative Ministry,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMovement Dynamics,‚Äù respectively. This last topic ‚Äúhas to do with your church‚Äôs relationships‚Äù (emphasis in original). ‚ÄúSome churches are highly institutional,‚Äù Keller writes, ‚Äúwith a strong emphasis on their own past, while others are anti-institutional, fluid, and marked by constant innovation and change.‚Äù Keller advocates a balanced position between tradition and innovation, drawing on the best of both.Indeed, balanced is a useful way to describe Keller‚Äôs theological vision throughout the book. Keller speaks of ‚Äúthe balance of three axes.‚Äù On the gospel axis, the Church must balance between legalism and antinomianism. ‚ÄúWe are saved by faith and grace alone, but not by a faith that remains alone,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúTrue grace always results in changed lives of holiness and justice.‚Äù On the city axis, the Church must balance between only challenging the culture and only appreciating it. ‚ÄúThis is based on the biblical teaching that all cultures have God‚Äôs grace and natural revelation in them, yet they are also in rebellious idolatry.‚Äù On the movement axis, the Church must balance between being an organization (focused on tradition and authority) and an organism (focused on cooperation and unity). ‚Äú[A] church at either extreme will stifle the development of leadership and strangle the health of the church as a corporate body, as a community,‚Äù Keller writes. ‚ÄúThe more that ministry comes ‚Äòfrom the center‚Äô of all the axes, the more dynamism and fruitfulness it will have.‚ÄùCenter Church is not a quick read. It is a 400-page, two-columned textbook. If you‚Äôre looking for easy answers or quick fixes, this is not the book to read. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre willing to put in the time and effort, reading this book will change the way you think about gospel ministry in a post-Christian era.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I4B6ZI19MJ74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310494184#wasThisHelpful","R2I4B6ZI19MJ74","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Preaching is not the only thing pastors do, but it is one of the most important things‚Äîif not the most important thing. Pastors thus need to work at perfecting their craft through constant attention to proper exegesis and hermeneutics, effective introductions and conclusions, and helpful outlines and illustrations. Because it is so useful in all these regards, John Stott‚Äôs The Challenge of Preaching should find a prominent place in every pastor‚Äôs library.First published in 1982 as Between Two Worlds, The Challenge of Preaching now appears in a third edition, abridged and updated by Greg Scharf, and published by Eerdmans. In many ways, it is a primer on preaching, an introduction to the craft. But like the best primers, it is a touchstone that helps experienced preachers test the quality of their preaching.Chapter 1 identifies three challenges to preaching: ‚ÄúDistrust of authority makes people unwilling to listen,‚Äù Stott writes. ‚ÄúElectronic advances have changed the expectations of both listeners and preachers. The atmosphere of doubt makes many preachers too tentative.‚Äù Despite these challenges, Stott believes preaching is a theologically necessary task, and in Chapter 2, he outlines its theological foundations focusing on God‚Äôs revelation, Scripture‚Äôs authority, the Church‚Äôs need of biblical renewal, the pastoral role of teaching and preaching, and preaching‚Äôs expository character.Chapter 3 identifies the essential task of preaching as building a bridge between ‚Äúthe biblical world and the modern world.‚Äù Theological conservatives typically focus on the former, while theological liberals on the latter, but Stott insists we must keep eyes on both. ‚ÄúWe must struggle to relate God‚Äôs unchanging word to our ever-changing world without sacrificing truth or despising relevance.‚ÄùStott next turns to how preachers prepare themselves through personal study (Chapter 4) and their sermons through careful organization (Chapter 5). Chapter 4 struck me with particular force. It is easy for many activities to fill pastors‚Äô calendars. Time for study becomes a luxury. If preaching is as important as Stott says it is, however‚Äîand I believe he‚Äôs on track biblically‚Äîfailing to schedule regular time for reading and reflection is failing to do one‚Äôs job with adequate preparation. In the short term, this can be managed, but in the long term, one‚Äôs ministry becomes spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually weak.Chapter 5 talks about writing one‚Äôs sermon. This is a nuts-and-bolts chapter that focuses on selecting the text, isolating the main thought, arranging your material, adding your conclusion, and then‚Äîwhen everything is in place‚Äîplanning an introduction that draws the congregation in and prepares them to hear the Word of God.Preaching cannot be reduced to the mechanics of sermon-writing, however. Who preaches is as important as what is preached. In short, the pastor‚Äôs life itself preaches the gospel and gives credibility to the sermon. Chapter 6 focuses on sincerity and earnestness. Stott writes: ‚ÄúTo be sincere is to mean what we say and to do what we say; to be earnest is also to feel what we say.‚ÄùChapter 7 focuses on courage and humility. ‚ÄúPreachers, like prophets, believe they bring a word from God, and are not free to change it,‚Äù Stott notes. ‚ÄúTherefore all preachers have at various times to choose between truth with unpopularity and falsehood with popularity.‚Äù This requires courage. But speaking unpopular truths can render us ‚Äústubborn or arrogant.‚Äù Like Elijah, we can complain, ‚ÄúI alone am left.‚Äù The antidote to this arrogance is ‚Äúa humble mind, humble motives, and humble dependence.‚ÄùThe Challenge of Preaching is a short book: 102 pages in the main body and another 23 pages in the appendices. It can be read in a single sitting. I highly recommend it to new pastors because it covers the whole range of preaching topics quickly and memorably. However, I also recommend it to veteran pastors. It has a diagnostic simplicity that will help them identify and correct bad habits they have developed.I conclude with one final quote that warmed my Pentecostal heart: ‚ÄúAt the same time [that we are studying] we should be praying, crying humbly to God for light from the Spirit of truth. Like Moses, we must beg him to show us his glory (Ex. 33:18). Study is no substitute for prayer; prayer is no substitute for study. We must do both. It may help to study on our knees, because this attitude reminds us that we worship the God who reveals himself in the Bible, and we are humble before him.‚ÄùAmen to that!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZZ22DRLJ145/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802873359#wasThisHelpful","R35ZZ22DRLJ145","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Last Coyote is the third installment in Michael Connelly‚Äôs series of crime novels featuring LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch. It begins with Bosch in a psychologist‚Äôs office, placed on involuntary stress leave for throwing his lieutenant, Harvey ‚ÄúNinety Eight‚Äù Pounds, through an interior office window. Until Bosch deals with his issues, his ‚Äúshrink‚Äù won‚Äôt recommend he be reassigned to the homicide table.Bosch‚Äôs issues begin with and center on the murder of his mother in November 1961, a crime never solved. In his spare time, he digs into the case and discovers that powerful forces in the City of Angels wanted the case to go unsolved. The more he digs, the more he uncovers, and the more he endangers himself and those around him.The pacing of The Last Coyote is a bit slower than the previous two books, which can be dangerous in a crime novel. However, in a long-running series (as the Harry Bosch novels have turned out to be), it is important to get into the lead character‚Äôs head in order to understand his personality and motivation. The Last Coyote succeeds brilliantly in this regard, giving us insight into Bosch‚Äôs cynicism, loneliness, and commitment to justice. The fact that the solution to the mystery follows a twisting path‚Äîwith an especially hard turn at the end‚Äîonly makes the introspection that much more interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21O79FK2LOWB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455550647#wasThisHelpful","R21O79FK2LOWB6","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The LORD by wisdom founded the earth,by understanding he established the heavens;by his knowledge the deeps broke open,and the clouds drop down the dew.Proverbs 3:19‚Äì20 express the who, what, and how of creation. Who? The Creator is ‚ÄúThe LORD,‚Äù that is, Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. What? He created ‚Äúthe earth,‚Äù ‚Äúthe heavens,‚Äù ‚Äúthe deeps,‚Äù and the ‚Äúclouds.‚Äù And he did so expertly, with ‚Äúwisdom,‚Äù ‚Äúunderstanding,‚Äù and ‚Äúknowledge.‚ÄùThese verses also express an ancient Near Eastern cosmology. Israel shared with its Egyptian, Syrian, and Mesopotamian neighbors a three-storied universe consisting of heaven, earth, and seas. Though there were variations in the details of these culture‚Äôs cosmologies, the basic three-tiered structure was the same.Modern people hold a very different cosmology than the ancients. We know, for example, that the earth revolves around the sun, not vice versa as the ancients believed. We know that the sun and the moon are not planets, as the ancients believed, and that there are more planets and planetary moons than the ancients could observe with the naked eye. Moreover, we know that our solar system is one among many in the Milky Way galaxy, which itself is one among many galaxies in an expanding universe.The differences between ancient Near Eastern and modern cosmologies raise questions in the minds of Christians about ‚Äúreading the Bible faithfully.‚Äù Kyle Greenwood outlines both questions and answers in Scripture and Cosmology: Reading the Bible Between the Ancient World and Modern Science. Greenwood is associate professor of Old Testament and Hebrew language at Colorado Christian University, whose Statement of Faith makes this declaration regarding the Bible: ‚ÄúWe Believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God.‚Äù Though readers of all perspectives will find Greenwood‚Äôs presentation informative, Christian readers with a high view of Scripture will find it most helpful.Scripture and Cosmology opens with a chapter about the importance of reading Scripture in context. In it, he states his book‚Äôs thesis: ‚Äúa high view of Scripture employs a hermeneutic that accommodates the biblical writers‚Äô immersion in their ancient, pre-Enlightenment cultural context. Therefore, as with other cultural matters, such as social customs and language, the biblical texts reflect that worldview in their written communications.‚ÄùPart One consists of three chapters that outline the similarities (and differences) between the cosmologies of the ancient Near East (specifically Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia) and of Israel. Greenwood argues that both ANE and biblical texts assume a three-tiered universe consisting of the earth, the heavens, and the sea. He also contends that this three-tiered understanding of the cosmos serves as a better ‚Äúguiding principle‚Äù for the Old Testament various creation accounts than does Genesis 1‚Äôs seven-day formula.Part Two consists of two chapters that describe how the Christian church dealt with the challenges to this three-tiered biblical cosmology posed by first Aristotelian cosmology and then Copernican cosmology. Whereas ancient Near East cosmology depicted the earth as ‚Äúsmall, flat and round‚Äù‚Äîa disk, in other words, Aristotelian cosmology pictured it as a sphere. And whereas Ptolemaic cosmology put Earth at the center of the universe, with the sun, moon, and heavenly bodies revolving around it; Copernican cosmology put the sun at the center, with the heavenly bodies, including Earth, revolving around it. (Contemporary cosmologies understand that the cosmos is acentric; neither the sun nor the earth is the center.) What Greenwood writes about the Aristotelian challenge might be equally applied to Copernican challenge: ‚ÄúThe most notable trait we see among the Aristotelian-era interpreters is the willingness to adapt their interpretation of Scripture in light of new understandings of the physical universe.‚ÄùPart Three offers a theological rationale for this adaptation. Terming it ‚Äúthe doctrine of divine accommodation,‚Äù Greenwood explains the rationale this way: ‚ÄúGod condescends his language to the language of humanity. This is not to say that God is condescending but that he speaks down to the cognitive ability of his human audience.‚Äù He offers this example: ‚ÄúJust as a father uses simple vocabulary and analogical language to communicate complex ideas to his children, so the heavenly Father accommodates his language to his children by speaking to his audience‚Äôs mother tongue and also employing analogical language.‚Äù Applied to biblical cosmology, accommodation entails that God speaks to Israel and its surrounding culture in terms of a three-tiered universe because that is what it believed. Were God revealing himself to our culture, he would accommodate himself to our cosmological speculations.Over the centuries, accommodation has proved to be a fruitful line of thinking for Christians wrestling with the issues raised by a better scientific understanding of the physical universe. That doesn‚Äôt mean it is problem free. One wag has defined accommodation as ‚Äúthe theory which states that God goes along with the commonly accepted story even though he really doesn‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù Accommodation presupposes that we can neatly distinguish between what culture assumes about a given topic and what Scripture teaches about it. Christians largely agree that accommodation is a good strategy when the Copernican Revolution is on the table, but Christians vehemently disagree when evolution is. Perhaps this indicates that while accommodation is a good interpretive strategy, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily decide all scientific cases.Regardless, I commend Scripture and Cosmology for its in-depth look at the specific issue of biblical cosmology. It is well versed in the Bible and the texts of the ancient Near East, as well as cognizant of Scripture-science discussions throughout church history. And it is a thoughtful, irenic presentation of how to navigate the tensions between ancient cosmology and modern science.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH38FZN6F30JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830840788#wasThisHelpful","RH38FZN6F30JM","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Freedom of speech is a bedrock American principle. It is enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but it cannot be reduced to that amendment. Instead, as Greg Lukianoff points out in this Encounter Broadside, it reflects ‚Äúcultural values‚Äù and ‚Äúintellectual habits,‚Äù such as""giving the other side a fair hearing, reserving judgment, tolerating opinions that offend or anger us, believing that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and recognizing that even people whose points of view we find repugnant might be (at least partially) right. At the heart of these values is epistemic humility‚Äîa fancy way of saying that we must always keep in mind that we could be wrong or, at least, that we can always learn something from listening to the other side.""Lukianoff contends that these values and habits are under assault in America today, and he points to numerous examples to establish the point.The assault on freedom of speech cannot be dismissed simply as ‚Äúacademia‚Äôs fault,‚Äù the result of ‚Äúliberal groupthink‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical correctness.‚Äù (Academia does play a crucial role, however, as Lukianoff‚Äôs Unlearning Liberty details at length. So does the political Left.) Instead, the assault reflects a social trend that can be seen worldwide:""people all over the globe are coming to expect emotional and intellectual comfort as though it were a right. This is precisely what you would expect when you train a generation to believe that they have a right not to be offended. Eventually, they stop demanding freedom of speech and start demanding freedom from speech.""The problem with expecting comfort as a right is that‚Ä¶well, the real world doesn‚Äôt work that way. Even assuming that everyone is acting on their best behavior, diversity ensures that there will be disagreement in society about what is true, good, and beautiful. Far from helping resolve those disagreements, social rules and cultural norms that promote ‚Äúfreedom from speech‚Äù hinder reasonable resolutions of those conflicts‚Äîand even the agreement to disagree. Instead, freedom from speech requires power‚Äîuniversity administrators, government regulators, etc.‚Äîto impose a version of truth, goodness, and beauty on a diverse society that literally does not have a say about it.Far from promoting a tolerant, comfortable society, then, the right to comfort ironically creates victims and transmogrifies conflicts about fundamental principles into zero-sum conflicts about who wields power. In such a situation, reason loses and force wins. That‚Äôs not a good situation for democratic societies to find themselves in. Far better to allow Socratic gadflies to ask uncomfortable, even embarrassing, questions and to dialogue the way to reasonable answers. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the path contemporary American society is taking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3DMRRZ1WB0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594038074#wasThisHelpful","R2D3DMRRZ1WB0P","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‚ÄúWithout careful attention, faith-based organizations will inevitably drift from their founding mission.‚Äù So write Peter Greer and Chris Horst in Mission Drift. The most obvious form of such drift is the outright secularization of the organization. But secularization doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. It is preceded by small compromises that, when put together, lead to fundamental changes in the organization.The purpose of Mission Drift is to help faith-based organizations avoid drift by paying careful attention to the practices of ‚ÄúMission True‚Äù organizations. Those practices include the following:‚Ä¢ Mission True organizations believe the gospel is their most precious asset.‚Ä¢ They make hard decisions to protect and propel their mission.‚Ä¢ Mission True leaders assume they will face drift and build safeguards against it.‚Ä¢ Mission True organizations have clarity about their mission.‚Ä¢ Mission True board members understand their top priority.‚Ä¢ Mission True leaders set the cultural tone for the organization.‚Ä¢ Mission True organizations hire first and foremost for heart and character.‚Ä¢ They partner with donors who believe in their full mission.‚Ä¢ They track metrics reflective of their full mission.‚Ä¢ They understand the gospel demands excellence in their work.‚Ä¢ They are fanatics about rituals and practices.‚Ä¢ They boldly proclaim their core tenets to protect themselves from drift.‚Ä¢ And they recognize that the local church is the anchor to a thriving mission.Greer and Horst devote a chapter each to these principles, illustrating them with both positive examples of Mission True organizations and negative examples of organizations that have drifted from their founding mission.‚ÄúNot all change is drift,‚Äù the authors acknowledge. Indeed, they argue, ‚Äúremaining Mission True will demand you change to continue to fulfill your mission.‚Äù Thus, faith-based organizations need to ‚Äú[d]ifferentiate means from mission.‚Äù The former change; the latter stays the same in a Mission True organization.I recommend this well-written, clearly argued book to the leaders of churches, denominations, and faith-based charities, both paid staff and volunteer board members. It will help them keep the gospel central to their organization‚Äôs reason for being, sharpen its missional focus, and help them keep it Mission True.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KN0KK8CJDGTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764211641#wasThisHelpful","R1KN0KK8CJDGTK","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Runcie, Sidney Chambers and the Forgiveness of Sins (London: Bloomsbury, 2015). Hardcover | Paperback | KindleI am an ordained minister with a penchant for reading mystery novels. It is not entirely surprising, then, that I so thoroughly enjoy The Grantchester Mysteries, which narrate the exploits of Sidney Chambers, a priest in the Church of England and an amateur sleuth. Sidney Chambers and the Forgiveness of Sins is the fourth installment in James Runcie‚Äôs series, and in my opinion, the best. (All of them are good, however.)Set in Grantchester, a village near Cambridge, The Grantchester Mysteries begin in the early 1950s, with Chambers as an unmarried priest. Forgiveness of Sins is set in the mid-1960s, and Chambers has married and fathered a young daughter. In addition to telling Chambers‚Äô story, the novels chart the tremendous social changes taking place in England in the Cold War period.As for the mysteries themselves, Forgiveness of Sins includes a man who thinks he has murdered his wife (but hasn‚Äôt), a physically abusive aristocrat who comes to a bad end, a Cambridge professor killed (accidentally?) by a falling piano, an engaged friend receiving death threats unless she calls off the wedding, an explosion at a public school‚Äôs chemistry lab that reveals the school‚Äôs dirty secrets, and an art theft in which Chambers finds himself the accused.The Grantchester Mysteries are gracefully written, character studies, not police procedurals. They are, as the series‚Äô website puts it, ‚Äúmoral fables in the tradition of G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown mixing crime, comedy and social history.‚Äù Although a crime is solved in each story, the emphasis is less on the how than the who. In other words, there is a focus on the moral character of the antagonists rather than on the methodology of their crimes. If you like hard-boiled detective stories, in other words, The Grantchester Mysteries are not for you. (They also deviate significantly from Grantchester, the Masterpiece Mystery series on PBS that was inspired by them.)Personally, I am ecumenical in my taste for mystery. I like character studies and police procedurals‚ÄîSidney Chambers and Harry Bosch. Each of those detectives, and the series written about them, are worth reading, even though they are entirely different ways of writing about crime.As I said, I think each installment in The Grantchester Mysteries is good, but Sidney Chambers and the Forgiveness of Sins is the best one yet. If you want to read it for yourself, however, don‚Äôt start with it. Start with the first book of the series, Sidney Chambers and the Shadow of Death. Then you can trace the arc of character development and understand why the characters relate to one another as they do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTBSAWB8ELVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632861038#wasThisHelpful","R1DTBSAWB8ELVP","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to a May 2015 report from Pew Research Center, ‚ÄúThe Christian share of the U.S. population is declining, while the number of U.S. adults who do not identify with any organized religion is growing.‚Äù Sociologists refer to this latter group as nones. When asked to state their religious affiliation‚Äîe.g., Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, etc.‚Äîthey choose ‚ÄúNone of the above.‚ÄùNones constitute a rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population. According to data from the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, nones nearly doubled between 1990 and 2008, from 8.1 to 15 percent. Pew‚Äôs own data indicate that the share of nones grew by nearly 42 percent between 2007 and 2014, from 16.1 percent of the U.S. population to 22.8 percent.For Christians committed to obeying the Great Commission (Matt. 28:16‚Äì20), nones are a new people group to be reached with the gospel. The question is how. In The Rise of the Nones, James Emery White provides an ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù of this demographic (Part 1) that explains ‚Äúa revolution of mindset and strategy‚Äù which the church needs to effectively evangelize them (Part 2).White has a good handle on both the intellectual and practical aspects of Christian ministry in an increasingly secular culture. He is founding senior pastor of Mecklenburg Community Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, 70 percent of whose total growth has come from nones. And he has a Ph.D. from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky.According to White, ‚ÄúThe real mark of a none is not the rejection of God but the rejection of any specific religion‚Äù (p. 23). In that sense, they are ‚Äúspiritual but not religious.‚Äù This spirituality does not turn them into ‚Äúseekers,‚Äù however. Rather, it is consistent with what Jonathan Rauch describes as ‚Äúa disinclination to care all that much about one‚Äôs own religion, and even stronger disinclination to care about other people‚Äôs‚Äù (p. 27).White analyzes the causes of this rejection of religion, and the worldview that results from it, in Part 1‚Äîan analysis that need not detain us here. Rather, I‚Äôd like to focus on the advice for reaching nones that he outlines in Part 2. White notes that most churches‚Äô outreach strategies ‚Äúrest on a single, deeply flawed premise that people want what you have to offer‚Äù (emphasis in original). In the very next sentence, however, he writes: ‚ÄúMore often than not, they don‚Äôt‚Äù (p. 89).Like Jonathan Rauch, many‚Äîif not most‚Äînones simply don‚Äôt care about religion. When churches send out slick mailers promising a church experience with a casual atmosphere, contemporary music, relevant messages, and good coffee, nones chuck them in the trash because they already have those things‚Ä¶without organized religion.What is needed is a new mindset, a mindset that is willing to change the way we do things in order to effectively reach a post-religious generation. Unfortunately, too many churches cater to the spiritual consumerism of existing Christians, even as they vocalize a desire to reach the lost. White doesn‚Äôt mince words: ‚Äúwe say we want them [i.e., the nones] in heaven‚Äîbut we act like they can go to hell‚Äù (p. 84).To reach nones, we need to think of evangelism as both a process and an event. ‚ÄúThe goal is not simply knowing how to articulate the means of coming to Christ,‚Äù White writes in reference to the conversion event. Rather, he continues with reference to the process of conversion, ‚Äúit is learning how to facilitate and enable the person to progress‚Ä¶[to] where he or she is able to even consider accepting Christ‚Äù (p. 93).The process of evangelism looks very different in a nominally Christian culture than in a post-religious society. In the mid-twentieth century, when Christian influence was at its peak and churches could assume most Americans identified with and had a basic understanding of Christianity, the process looked like this:Unchurched ‚áí Christ ‚áí Community ‚áí CauseIn other words, first unchurched people accepted the gospel, then joined the church, then starting supporting the church‚Äôs mission.To reach Baby Boomers, who had been raised in church but left it out of disillusionment in young adulthood, churches tried a different evangelistic process, which looked like this:Unchurched ‚áí Community ‚áí Christ ‚áí CauseIn other words, unchurched Baby Boomers needed to trust the church again before they could express commitment to Christ and support the church‚Äôs mission.White argues that the nones require yet another change in the evangelistic process, which looks like this:Nones ‚áí Cause ‚áí Community ‚áí Christ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù White writes, ‚Äúit is cause that arrests the attention of the world‚Äù (p. 101). Nones are interested in the common good, not personal conversion. Some Christians seem to be interested in conversion rather than the common good. Jesus was interested in both. ‚ÄúJesus wed mission and message together seamlessly,‚Äù White says, ‚Äúproclaiming the kingdom that had come while healing the leper and feeding the hungry. He mandated concern for the widow and orphan, the homeless and naked, the imprisoned and hungry while speaking of the bread of life and a home in heaven‚Äù (p. 102). If Jesus, so the church; we should be interested in both conversion and the common good too.Notice that White has not discarded the event of evangelism, namely, a call to repentance and faith. The strategy he outlines pertains to the process whereby nones see that conversion to Christ makes sense. ‚ÄúEven if it takes a while to get to talking about Christ,‚Äù he argues, based on ministry experience, ‚Äú[nones] get there‚Äù (p. 108).White‚Äôs discussion of mindset and strategy includes far more than I‚Äôve outlined in this review. To get that, you‚Äôll need to read the book. And I worry that a focus on cause may become as unattractive to nones as slick mailers advertising a ‚Äúcasual atmosphere‚Äù and ‚Äúgood coffee.‚Äù Nones don‚Äôt need to go to church to get coffee; do they need to go to church to get a cause? A church not committed to the common good is not representing Jesus well, but nones won‚Äôt necessarily come to Christ just because the church pursues it.Regardless, I recommend The Rise of the Nones for its thought-provoking analysis and guidance regarding mindset and strategy. I haven‚Äôt touched on all the points White makes, but I hope this review has given you a better understanding of the challenge of and a strategy for reaching nones. They‚Äôre not interested in religion‚Äîyours or their own. To get them to Christ, you must start with what interests them and draw them‚Äîslowly, patiently‚Äîto Jesus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVZRGEFAWJ88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801016231#wasThisHelpful","R2FVZRGEFAWJ88","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many people, I became aware of Craig Johnson‚Äôs Walt Longmire mysteries through Longmire on A&E. (Netflix has acquired the show and will air its fourth season). The TV show is a different beast than the books. While I enjoy both, I still prefer the latter.The mystery at the heart of Dead Bones is the death of Danny Lone Elk. Lone Elk owns a ranch on which a large, complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton has just been unearthed. The find is worth millions to whoever owns it. But Lone Elk‚Äôs ownership is contested among the federal government, the Cheyenne reservation, and the Lone Elk family. And then, of course, there‚Äôs the question of whether Lone Elk died naturally or was murdered.Longmire works through these questions in his characteristic Absaroka County way. There‚Äôs the patient questioning of witnesses, the mystical experiences, the encounters with a nature indifferent to human wellbeing, and the sly sense of humor.One of my favorite gags in this book is the stoically raised fist and incantation of the words, ‚ÄúSave Jen.‚Äù (Jen is the name of the T-rex whom the Absaroka residents want to keep at the local dinosaur museum.) Trust me, it gets funnier as the book goes along.I‚Äôm a huge Longmire fan. As much as I enjoyed this book‚Äîand I enjoyed it a lot and read it in one evening‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt think this was the best installment in the series. It‚Äôs not bad, mind you. (I can‚Äôt imagine a bad story by Craig Johnson.) It‚Äôs just not the best.Even so, if you like the other Longmire books, I know you‚Äôll like this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGWMXURNL6R53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426930#wasThisHelpful","RGWMXURNL6R53","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The American men‚Äôs relay team is an Olympics powerhouse. Since 1920, it has won gold medals at 15 of 21 Olympics. It did not do so in the 4x100 relay at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, however. Rather, it disqualified when Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay dropped the baton as they headed into the fourth leg of the race.When it comes to transitions between pastors and their successors, a lot of churches drop the baton. The reasons for this are various: lack of planning, poor choice of successor, the inability of a predecessor to let go of the ministry, unforeseen crises, etc. Whatever the reasons, Tom Mullins thinks churches can a better job of passing the leadership baton. In this book, he coaches pastors how to lead their churches through their own transitions.Mullins‚Äô advice can be summarized in eight action steps:‚Ä¢ Lead through transition.‚Ä¢ Keep the right perspective.‚Ä¢ Prepare for the win.‚Ä¢ Select and prepare your successor.‚Ä¢ Position yourself for success.‚Ä¢ Position others for success.‚Ä¢ Lead through crisis-driven transitions.‚Ä¢ Create a legacy.Mullins devotes a chapter to each action item. His advice is practical, experience-derived, and simply and winsomely written. Throughout the book, he reflects on how he transitioned leadership of Christ Fellowship, a multisite church in Florida, to his son Todd. He also cites the experiences‚Äîboth positive and negative‚Äîof other churches and Christian ministries.Near the end of the book, he captures the proper spirit in which church leadership transitions should take place: ‚ÄúTransition really comes down to being an issue of humility and surrender, if you think about it. All the practical things we‚Äôve discussed in this book have hopefully been helpful to you as you plan with intentionality and troubleshoot inevitable issues along the way to your own transition in leadership. But the most important thing to consider is the fact God‚Äôs work is for God‚Äôs sake‚Äînot your own‚Ä¶ When that is your realization, it forces you to a place of humility and surrender in the transition process because He alone is the priority, and His plans for His church are what matters above anything else.‚ÄùI highly recommend this book to pastors and their boards. It will be of immediate help to older ministers who are preparing to transition into retirement or other ministries in a few years. But younger ministers can benefit from reading it too. ‚ÄúTransition is not the only greatest test of your leadership,‚Äù Mullins writes; ‚Äúit is your legacy. Transition well.‚Äù","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FS7C8B6HJBV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718031199#wasThisHelpful","R1FS7C8B6HJBV0","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre leading, you‚Äôre bleeding,‚Äù writes Samuel R. Chand in his new book, Leadership Pain.That five-word sentence captures a crucial truth about leadership in general, and pastoral leadership in particular. Leadership is hard work. Rather than avoiding that hard work, Chand urges ministry leaders to embrace it.Pain comes in many forms. Chand writes: ‚Äúsome of our pain is self-inflicted, the accumulation of unrelieved stress. Some is the result of external challenges, and we suffer heartaches and headaches because we‚Äôre trying to grow and fulfill God‚Äôs purposes for our churches.‚ÄùConsequently, he goes on to say, ‚ÄúThe goal, then, is sometimes to avoid pain, sometimes to relieve pain, sometimes to create the pain of growth, but always to learn the lessons God has for us in the midst of our pain.‚ÄùLeadership Pain shifts back and forth between these two emphases, between identifying the form of pain and naming the goal in responding to it.Two lessons in the book stood out in particular to me, or rather, two quotations: The first comes at the beginning of the book, in which Chand offers this hypothetical syllogism:Growth = ChangeChange = LossLoss = PainThus, Growth = PainThe second comes at the end, when Chand writes: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run from your pain. Don‚Äôt deny that it exists. It‚Äôs the most effective leadership development tool the world has ever known. You‚Äôll only grow to the threshold of your pain, so raise it!‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a lot of wisdom in those two observations, as well as in the intervening pages of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOU7BBTN4NAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718031598#wasThisHelpful","R3FOU7BBTN4NAX","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On February 25, 1956, Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech to a closed session of the 20th Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The speech, which was formally titled ‚ÄúOn the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences,‚Äù criticized Josef Stalin, his prosecution of the Great Patriotic War (World War II), his multiple purges of the armed forces and party leadership, and other politically driven crimes against the Soviet people.Tom Rob Smith uses Khrushchev‚Äôs speech as his point of departure in The Secret Speech, the second volume in his Child 44 trilogy. The question it ponders is this: When the State becomes criminal, can criminals exact justice? As always, Leo Demidov is at the center of the action, traveling from Moscow to Kolyma to Budapest to uncover the truth and protect himself and his family in the process.

"A serial killer haunts the western Soviet Union in 1953. According to Communist Party doctrine, such a crime cannot exist in a socialist country, where the State has eliminated inequality and poverty and hence the crimes that arise from them. To assert that a serial killer exists‚Äîlet alone to track him down and seek his punishment‚Äîis thus a counterrevolutionary act, a crime that the State takes seriously and punishes severely.Leo Stepanovich Demidov is a decorated hero of the Great Patriotic War and a loyal soldier of the MGB (predecessor of the KGB). Married, and with a promising career before him, he must confront a colleague and friend whose child is the forty-fourth victim of a serial killer whose very existence the State denies. Caught between his loyalty to the State and the evidence plain to anyone with eyes to see, Demidov dares to follow the truth and pursue a killer who must be stopped, In the process, he reveals a horrifying truth about Soviet history that explains the killer‚Äôs actions.In Child 44, Tom Rob Smith captures the contradictions, paranoia, and massive evil of the Soviet Union during Stalin‚Äôs final year. It is a riveting page-turner of a mystery, not to mention a complex meditation on what it mean to pursue justice in a fundamentally unjust society.

"When his sister Ruthie died, Rod Dreher found himself drawn back to his hometown of Starhill, Lousiana. He appreciated Ruthie‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle way‚Äù‚Äîher life of close-knit family, down-home neighbors, and ordinary kindness that, though not garnering headlines, was nevertheless rich in love. While happily married with children, Dreher felt that Ruthie‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle way‚Äù supplied was lacking in his and his family‚Äôs urban existence; so, they moved to Starhill.The problem was that Dreher had left Starhill for a reason: The inability of his family‚Äîespecially his father, but even Ruthie herself‚Äîto understand any way that wasn‚Äôt their way. The family had stayed put; Dreher had traveled abroad. They were Methodist; he was Methodist-turned-agnostic-turned-Catholic-turned-Orthodox. They did stuff; he read books and wrote articles.Ruthie‚Äôs death didn‚Äôt resolve the conflicts that arose from their mutual incomprehension; it only exacerbated them. Soon after returning home, Dreher was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus, one of the leading symptoms of which is stress-induced fatigue. In Starhill, Dreher was constantly stressed and chronically fatigued. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù his rheumatologist told him, ‚Äúyou have a choice. Leave Lousiana, or resign yourself to destroying your health.‚ÄùDreher felt that wasn‚Äôt a choice. There must be a way to stay put and find inner peace. While browsing a book store not long after the conversation with his doctor, Dreher chanced upon Dante‚Äôs Inferno, the first of three volumes in The Divine Comedy. How Dante Can Save Your Life is the story of how Dante saved his.The Divine Comedy‚Äîif you remember‚Äîis the story of how Dante makes a pilgrimage through Hell and Purgatory until he reaches Heaven. But as Dreher points out, ‚ÄúTo read Dante literally is to misunderstand him.‚Äù Dante is not writing a travelogue of the afterlife; he is drawing a map of the inner life. ‚ÄúThe Commedia is written as an allegory of the soul‚Äôs journey through life,‚Äù Dreher points out; it is ‚Äúabout avoiding hell and gaining heaven.‚Äù He continues: ‚ÄúTo be saved is not to be saved from the consequences of sin but to be freed from the desire to sin‚Äîthat is, from the desire for our own will over God‚Äôs.‚ÄùThis desire for self-will over God‚Äôs loving will, Dreher realized, was the cause of his family‚Äôs estrangement and the source of his own sickness. Dreher the Orthodox Christian did not agree with all the details of Dante the Catholic poet‚Äôs theology‚Äînor do I the Pentecostal reader, but that disagreement doesn‚Äôt mean discounting Dante‚Äôs brilliant spiritual insights into ‚Äúthe Love that moves the sun and all the other stars.‚Äù And in finding that godly love, Dreher found himself whole.Those looking for an introduction or running commentary on The Divine Comedy should look elsewhere than this book. It‚Äôs not for them. Those looking for a self-help book that doesn‚Äôt rely on the structure and reasoning of a 700-year-old poem also should look elsewhere. But those who believe that great books have therapeutic value if read insightfully and personally will be delighted by Dreher‚Äôs testimony and the gentle nudge he presses on readers to follow in Dante‚Äôs path.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBPSUFJTO1HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941393322#wasThisHelpful","RDBPSUFJTO1HQ","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‚ÄúWhat we want is not more little books about Christianity,‚Äù C. S. Lewis once said in an address on Christian apologetics, ‚Äúbut more little books by Christians on other subjects‚Äîwith their Christianity latent.‚ÄùI thought of Lewis‚Äôs remarks as I read Joel C. Rosenberg‚Äôs new thriller, The Third Target. The plot centers on New York Times reporter J. B. Collins, whose sources have informed him that ISIS has captured a cache of chemical weapons from the Syrian government. As Collins pursues this story across three continents, he and his friends are drawn deeper into the violent clash between Islamic terrorists and the civilized world.What makes Collins‚Äô investigation even more pressing is that King Abdullah II of Jordan‚ÄîCollins uses the real monarch as a heroic character in his plot‚Äîhas somehow managed to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. There is a real chance that ISIS might use its captured Syrian WMDs to scuttle the peace deal and prosecute war inside the moderate Hashemite kingdom.It‚Äôs difficult to summarize the plot of The Third Target in a way that both reveals how gripping a read it is while leaving the cover on its plot twists and turns. Perhaps it is enough to say that I enjoy thrillers that involve a desperate race against time, found the book‚Äôs plot believable and pace exciting, and was stunned by the book‚Äôs ending.But here‚Äôs where Lewis‚Äôs quote comes into play. Rosenberg is an evangelical Christian, and Tyndale is an evangelical Christian publishing house. Rather than making his Christian faith latent, Rosenberg has chosen to make it patent, and this patency detracts from the value of the story he tells.J. B. Collins, we learn, is nonreligious. His mother and brother aren‚Äôt, however. They are evangelical Christians. Indeed, his brother Matthew is a professor of theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Hamilton, Massachusetts‚Äîa school I myself briefly attended. Rosenberg uses Matthew to give voice to two evangelical interests: biblical evangelism and personal prophecy. In a long conversation with his brother, Matthew explains the contemporary relevance of biblical prophecies concerning the territories that constitute modern-day Jordan. Additionally, Matthew repeatedly presses J. B. to come to Jesus before it‚Äôs too late.Of these two interests, the latter‚Äîthe concern for religious conversion‚Äîcould‚Äôve been presented in a way that felt more integral to the plot. Faced with the death of people on every side, J. B. begins to ponder his own fate. Is he ready to die? Is there life after death? Psychologically, these are natural questions for people to ask themselves when death comes calling. My complaint is not that Rosenberg included the matter of religious conversion in the plot, but that he did so in such a ham-fisted way.His treatment of biblical prophecy is what annoyed me most, however. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan encompasses territory that in Bible times belonged to Moab, Ammon, and Edom (moving from north to south). These kingdoms are mentioned throughout the Old Testament in the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. Rosenberg believes prophetic references to these kingdoms have contemporary relevance. By placing such prophetic interpretations in the mouth of a Gordon-Conwell professor, he gives them a patina of academic respectability. To be honest, however, I‚Äôm not sure any scholar at that institution would treat the prophecies as he has done. In other words, his use of biblical prophecy does not seem credible and‚Äîmore importantly in a work of literature‚Äîdoes not move the plot forward. In a race-against-time thriller, such slowing down is a cardinal sin.Now, I recognize that my fellow evangelicals will shake their heads and tut-tut at my review for expressing online my reservations about the prophetic and evangelistic elements of the book.

"William J. Bennett and Robert A. White, Going to Pot: Why the Rush to Legalize Marijuana Is Harming America (New York: Center Street, 2015). Hardcover | Kindle‚ÄúWe are at a curious, as well as critical, moment in our country,‚Äù write William J. Bennett and Robert A. White in their new book, Going to Pot. ‚ÄúWe are spending money and political capital on strengthening the health, education, and productivity of our populace, yet society believes it appropriate to push for greater availability of a drug that hinders, and negatively affects (perhaps dramatically), those very efforts.‚Äù That drug is marijuana.Americans‚Äô sea change of opinion on marijuana legalization has been slow but dramatic. In 1969, when Gallup began polling the issue, 84 percent of Americans opposed legalization, 12 percent supported it. By 2013, however, 58 percent supported it, 39 percent opposed. Support fell back to 51 percent in 2014, but the overall trendline is clear: Americans support marijuana legalization. Given that younger adults (ages 18 to 29) overwhelmingly support legalization‚Äîat 67 percent‚Äîproponents of continued marijuana prohibition face an uphill battle both in public opinion and at the polls.Bennett and White‚Äôs main goal in writing Going to Pot is ‚Äúto stop the juggernaut of legalization.‚Äù Their argument against it focuses on raising public awareness of two issues: ‚Äúthe higher potency of today‚Äôs marijuana‚Äù and ‚Äúthe ever-increasing body of scientific evidence documenting the many adverse consequences of smoking marijuana.‚ÄùRegarding potency, Bennett and White write: ‚ÄúThe average amount of THC in marijuana today, the primary psychoactive ingredient in the drug, is about 9.6 to 13 percent, more than double the potency of marijuana in 1983, which was more than double what it was the decade before.‚Äù Researchers at the University of Mississippi have identified strains with THC levels of 37 percent.Increased potency levels entail that ‚Äúthere really are two different conversations taking place,‚Äù the authors write. ‚ÄúOne is based on a frame of reference of marijuana that was experienced in the past, was weaker, and does not exist today.‚Äù This is the pro-legalization argument used by Baby Boomers who smoked joints back in the 1960s. ‚ÄúThe other is based on the reality of marijuana that is grown, processed, and sold today.‚ÄùRegarding the use of higher potency marijuana, Bennett and White cite a number of medical and scientific studies to document its adverse health effects. They include a 2014 study from The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) at the end of the book because its results typify what the other studies show.Titled, ‚ÄúAdverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use,‚Äù the study concludes, ‚ÄúMarijuana use has been associated with substantial adverse effects, some of which can be determined with a high level of confidence.‚Äù It goes on to say, ‚ÄúMarijuana, like other drugs of abuse, can result in addiction. During intoxication, marijuana can interfere with cognitive function (e.g., memory and perception of time) and motor function (e.g., coordination), and these effectives can have detrimental consequences (e.g., motor-vehicle accidents). Repeated marijuana use during adolescence may result in long-lasting changes in brain function that can jeopardize educational, professional, and social achievements.‚Äù (The mention of adolescent marijuana use should remind us that while legalization is intended for adult use, the unintended consequence is increased use by minors. They are legalization‚Äôs primary victims.)The authors acknowledge that THC has legitimate medical uses, such as ‚Äúcachexia, multiple sclerosis spasticity, and vomiting [associated with chemotherapy],‚Äù among others. Unfortunately, the primary users of marijuana in states with medical marijuana laws do not indicate these conditions.For example, according to a December 2012 report by the Arizona Republic, ‚Äú3.76 percent [of the states 34,000 medical marijuana cardholders] use marijuana to ease the symptoms of cancer. Another 1.53 percent suffer from glaucoma while 1.06 percent have AIDS.‚Äù These seem to be legitimate uses. ‚ÄúMeanwhile 89.8 percent‚Äî30,203 people‚Äîare seeking relief for ‚Äòsevere and chronic pain.‚Äô‚Äù The demographics of these users skew overwhelmingly to young men: ‚Äúnearly 73 percent of patients are men and the people most likely to seek relief from pain are 18 to 30 years old.‚Äù This demographic skew is statistically suspect. One would expect a more even distribution between men and women, for one thing. For another, one would expect older patients to experience more pain than younger ones. That neither of these expectations are realized probably indicates that young men are using medical justifications to obtain legal access to a drug they use recreationally. In other words, they‚Äôre gaming the system.In light of both legitimate medical use and widespread abuse, Bennett and White suggest a medical protocol by which government agencies could monitor the use of medical marijuana to make sure that it is going to the people who need it. Absent such a protocol, medical marijuana is a farce, a foot in the door for legalization‚Äôs traveling salesmen.At the end of the day, the question of marijuana legalization comes down to costs vs. benefits. Opponents such as Bennett and White argue that the costs of legalization‚Äîthe social costs of marijuana‚Äôs adverse health effects‚Äîoutweigh any benefits; so American public policy should continue to prohibit marijuana use (with allowances for genuine medical need). Proponents argue the opposite: Like alcohol and tobacco‚Äîsubstances that also have adverse health effects‚Äîmarijuana should be legally available.The NEJM study notes the danger in the proponents‚Äô comparison: ‚Äúlegal drugs (alcohol and tobacco) offer a sobering perspective, accounting for the greatest burden of disease associated with drugs not because they are more dangerous than illegal drugs but because their legal status allows for more widespread exposure. As policy shifts toward legalization of marijuana, it is reasonable and probably prudent to hypothesize that its use will increase and that, by extension, so will the number of persons for whom there will be negative health consequences.‚Äù Or, as Bennett and White put it, legalizing marijuana ‚Äúwill simply add one more product to the marketplace of damage done to individuals and society.‚ÄùDo we really need that? The question seems to answer itself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSMHY52FQTUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455560731#wasThisHelpful","ROSMHY52FQTUK","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I drive a 2003 Honda Element. It has an auxiliary jack for a 3.5 mm plug. Back in the day, this made it possible for me to run a cable from my iPod to my car stereo system. Unfortunately, that's all the jack could do.While shopping Amazon for a cable (I lost the one I originally bought), I came across this Belkin product and thought I'd give it a try. It solves several problems at once: (1) I can play songs from my iPhone 6 Plus through my car stereo system using Bluetooth. (2) I can simultaneously recharge my phone using Belkin's USB lighter jack. (3) I can make hands-free phone calls using the device's mic, which I have mounted just under my stereo's left knob.Setting up the device was simple and quick. Once my iPhone paired with the device, my songs played well, and the quality of my phone calls was also good. To me, the price of this device seemed reasonable, and I am very happy with my purchase.P.S. My wife is not as happy with this product as I am. She says that the mic makes it sound like I'm in a ""black hole"" when I call her.

"This year, my church is promoting a Bible reading and prayer initiative called ‚Äú20‚Ä¢15 in 2015.‚Äù Every day, we read the Bible for 20 minutes then engage in prayer and solitude for 15 minutes. (These are minimums.) The congregation is using the One Year Bible reading plan on Bible.com, which includes a daily reading from the Old Testament, New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs. Rather than using this plan, I decided to read the Bible straight through instead.As a Christian minister, I have read the Bible cover to cover several times. It is the tool of my trade, so to speak, and I am familiar with its contents. So, as I prepared to read it again, I determined to find a translation and format that was not familiar to me. The old proverb says that familiarity breeds contempt. In reality, familiarity breeds complacency. We become so accustomed to seeing things a certain way that we fail to notice how much we‚Äôve overlooked or misinterpreted.The choice of a different translation was easy enough. My go-to translation is the New International Version. It is a functionally equivalent and gender inclusive translation. In its place, I decided to use the English Standard Version, which is a formally equivalent translation.The choice of a different format was more difficult. The vast majority of Bibles are printed in a two-column format. Most of them include chapter and verse numbers, as well as subtitles, cross-references, and footnotes. Study Bibles include even more information, such as extensive comments, maps, and diagrams. For example, compare how Acts 2 appears in my ESV Bible, Classic Thinline Edition and my ESV Study Bible.At some point in 2014, I had heard about Adam Lewis Greene‚Äôs Bibliotheca project, which was printing the Bible in a single-column format without chapter and verse numbers, subtitles, cross-references, or footnotes. In other words, it was printing a Bible that looked like a normal book. Unfortunately, Greene was using a modified version of the American Standard Version, whose English translations, while literal, can be archaic. As much as I admired what Greene was trying to do, I wasn‚Äôt interested in reading the ASV.Imagine my delight, then, when I came across the ESV Reader‚Äôs Bible. It presents that translation in a single-column format, 9-point font, which is very readable. It has no verse numbers, subtitles, cross-references, or footnotes. (The textual notes prior to John 7:53‚Äì8:11 and Mark 16:9‚Äì20, which state that the earliest New Testament manuscripts do not contain these passages, are exceptions.) Chapter numbers are printed unobtrusively in the margin in a different color, except for the Psalms, where the psalm number appears directly above each psalm. The page header includes the title, chapter, and verses appearing on the page below it, but these also are unobtrusive. Consider how the ESV Reader‚Äôs Bible presents Acts 2.With the ESV Reader‚Äôs Bible in hand, I began my 20-minutes-a-day Bible reading plan. What I have discovered surprised me. How the Bible is presented on the page radically changes the way a reader experiences its message. At least, it radically changed my experience. It did so in two ways.First, this format increased my focus on what the Bible was saying. While I will continue to use a two-column study Bible in my research for sermons, devotionals, and articles, I will never again use one for personal devotions. Its presentation of God‚Äôs Word is simply too cluttered. When I used that format for devotional purposes, I found my eyes skipping to another column, scanning the page for footnotes, and looking ahead to when the section or chapter ended. With the ESV Reader‚Äôs Bible format, I found myself reading without distraction. This allowed me to notice nuances in the text that, for whatever reason, had escaped my attention previously.Second, this format increased my enjoyment of reading the Bible. In my previous attempts to read the Bible through entirely, I often found myself wondering how long it was going to take me to finish the daily reading. Sometimes, reading the Bible felt like a chore that had to be endured. It dragged on and on until I reached the end of that day‚Äôs prescribed reading. (And this wasn‚Äôt just in books like Leviticus and Numbers!) This year, I decided simply to read for 20 minutes without a set chapter to start or finish with. That decision, combined with the new format, has made reading a delight again. Why is it that we can read novels for hours at a time but find minutes spent in the Bible so difficult? If my experience is any guide, it‚Äôs partially because of the format of the Bible we‚Äôre reading. When the Bible is printed as a normal book, it‚Äôs easier to read as a normal book‚Äîand easier to enjoy.Proverbs 25:11 says, ‚ÄúA word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.‚Äù When it is printed, the Word of God is the golden apple that deserves a silver setting. Bible publishers would do well to keep this in mind as they print their translations. Yes, translation philosophy matters most. And yes, the monetary cost of the book must be factored in, lest reader avoid buying a Bible because of its prohibitive cost. But how the Bible looks‚Äîits aesthetic appeal‚Äîmatters too. If the Bible is beautifully presented, the beauty of its message can be better understood and applied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37SQ98TCJ6GM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433544148#wasThisHelpful","R37SQ98TCJ6GM9","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Should America walk the beat as the world‚Äôs policeman?Many Americans on both sides of the political aisle think not. For example, President Barack Obama, a Democrat, flatly states, ‚ÄúWe should not be the world‚Äôs policeman.‚Äù Similarly, Senator Rand Paul, a Republican, avers: ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs mission should always be to keep the peace, not police the world.‚Äù After more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the sentiment is understandable.Understandable, Bret Stephens argues in his new book, America in Retreat‚Äîbut still dangerous. ‚ÄúNo great power can treat foreign policy as a spectator sport and hope to remain a great power,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúA world in which the leading liberal-democratic nation does not assume its role as world policeman will become a world in which dictatorships contend, or unite, to fill the breach. Americans seeking a return to an isolationist garden of Eden‚Äîalone and undisturbed in the world, knowing neither good nor evil‚Äîwill soon find themselves living within shooting range of global pandemonium.‚ÄùTo be the world‚Äôs policeman, Stephens quickly qualifies, ‚Äúis not to say we need to be its priest; preaching the gospel of the American way.‚Äù Nor does America need to be ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs martyr.‚Äù ‚ÄúPolice work isn‚Äôt altruism,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIt is done from necessity and self-interest. It is done because it has be done and there‚Äôs no one else to do it, and because the benefits of doing it accrue not only to those we protect but also, indeed mainly, to ourselves.‚ÄùStephens draws on a famous 1982 essay in The Atlantic Monthly to explain what it would mean for America to police the world. That essay, ‚ÄúBroken Windows,‚Äù attempted to understand ‚Äúthe nature of communal order, the way it is maintained, and the ways in which order turns into disorder.‚Äù Penned by George Kelling, a Rutgers criminologist, and James Q. Wilson, a political scientist then at Harvard, the essay became the intellectual foundation of the New York Police Department‚Äôs much heralded and much criticized, yet very successful strategy to combat crime in Gotham.Citing a 1969 study by Philip Zimbardo, Kelling and Wilson argued: ‚ÄúDisorder and crime are usually inextricably linked, in a kind of developmental sequence. Social psychologists and police officers tend to agree that if a window in a building is broken and is left unrepaired, all the rest of the windows will soon be broken.‚Äù Why? Not because ‚Äúsome areas are inhabited by determined window-breakers,‚Äù but rather because ‚Äúone unrepaired broken window is a signal that no one cares, and so breaking more windows costs nothing.‚Äù Rather than deal with crime‚Äôs ‚Äúroot causes,‚Äù then, Kelling and Wilson urged police to enforce sanctions on ‚Äúpetty crimes‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial incivilities.‚Äù An orderly city‚Äîone where ‚Äúbroken windows‚Äù are fixed‚Äîreduces crime rates.Applied to foreign policy, Stephens suggests that the current international order, the one from which America is in retreat, is ‚Äúa broken-windows world‚Äù: ‚ÄúRules are invoked but not enforced. Principles are idealized but not defended. International law is treated not as a complement to traditional geopolitical leadership but as the superior alternative to it.‚Äù This broken-windows world is one in which Russia invades Ukraine, China threatens its neighbors, Syria uses chemical weapons against its citizens, Iran develops its atomic weapons program, and Palestinians ignore the strictures of the Oslo Accords and seek United Nations‚Äô recognition of Palestinian statehood‚Äîall without serious repercussions, if any repercussions at all. The consequences of these broken windows‚Äîthe ‚Äúcoming global disorder,‚Äù as Stephens calls it‚Äîwill be even worse.So what should be the ‚Äúbroken-windows formula for U.S. foreign policy‚Äù?‚ÄúIt would require the United States to sharply increase military spending to upwards of 5 percent of GDP. But unlike in the past, it would lay greater emphasis on raw numbers‚Äîof ships, planes, and troops‚Äîthan on high-cost technological wizardry. It would deploy more military assets for the protection of our allies. But unlike in the past, it would do so on condition that those allies invest strategically in their own defenses. It would sharply punish violations of geopolitical norms, such as the use of chemical weapons, by swiftly and precisely targeting the perpetrators of the attacks. But the emphasis would be on short, mission-specific, punitive police actions, not open-ended occupations for idealistic ends. It would be global in its approach: no more ‚Äúpivots‚Äù from this region to that. But it would also know how to discriminate between core interests and allies and peripheral ones. It would seek to prevent local conflicts, such as the one in Syria, from spilling over their borders and becoming regional catastrophes. But it would do so by working vigorously through local proxies. It would place an emphasis on stability and predictability in international affairs. But it would put greater stock in behavioral norms than in international law.‚ÄùIn other words, a broken-windows foreign policy would be neither the nation building of George W. Bush nor the leading-from-behind of Barack Obama. It would be both internationalist and realist, as opposed to both isolationist and idealist. It would not attempt to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the world (a priestly role), but merely to make it incrementally safer.Are there alternatives? ‚ÄúBroadly speaking,‚Äù Stephens writes, ‚Äúthere are three alternatives: a liberal peace, the balance of power, or collective security.‚Äù But China‚Äôs bullying in Asia Pacific calls into question Immanuel Kant‚Äôs insistence that ‚Äúthe spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later that spirit dominates every people.‚Äù Given America‚Äôs global dominance economically‚Äîboth now and for the foreseeable future‚Äîit‚Äôs difficult to see ‚Äúhow a balance-of-power can be practiced in the absence of a genuine balance of power.‚Äù And, anyway, who would be on the balancing end opposite the U.S. China? Russia? Finally, there‚Äôs collective security, specifically, the United Nations. Here, the danger is the same one as during the Cold War, when ‚Äúthe Soviet Union would happily use the UN as an instrument of its propaganda but would not submit to it as a check on its power.‚Äù That conceptual flaw in the UN‚Äôs very design renders it an unlikely restraint on political bad actors, an outcome proven by the UN‚Äôs dismal track record.And so, Stephens concludes, Pax Americana‚Äîthe U.S. as the world‚Äôs policeman‚Äîis the best way to restore global order. It is a credible option, though it depends on a bipartisan consensus‚Äîfor internationalism, against idealism‚Äîthat‚Äôs unlikely to materialize any time soon. Plus, after more than a decade of nation building in the Middle East, Americans seem unwilling to put on the badge and walk the beat. Finally, many view America‚Äîrightly or not‚Äîas an incorrigibly corrupt cop rather than an honest law enforcer. (America is not perfect, I agree, but comparing the U.S. to bad actors like China or Russia is, in my opinion, a false moral equivalence.)However you slice things, then, it seems that we are in for a lot of broken windows and all the global disorder they portend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20E0TZGU7TA3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846625#wasThisHelpful","R20E0TZGU7TA3Z","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Christianity, every biblical truth has a corresponding distortion. For example, the apostle Paul writes, ‚Äúwhere sin increased, grace increased all the more‚Äù (Romans 5:20). He immediately went on to deny, however, that believers should ‚Äúgo on sinning so that grace may increase‚Äù (6:1) in light of this truth. Antinomianism, in other words, is a distortion of grace, not its logical consequence.Sorting out distortions of doctrine from their logical consequences is a matter of vital importance for the contemporary Pentecostal and charismatic movements. Those movements teach the biblical truth that the gifts of the Holy Spirit outlined in Acts 2, 1 Corinthians 12‚Äì14, and Ephesians 4, among other New Testament passages, did not cease to operate in the first century but continue to operate in the lives of believers today. That truth is capable of being distorted in many ways, for example new revelations that contradict Scripture, an overemphasis on the miraculous to the exclusion of the ordinary, and a use of gifts that inflates the pride of the gifted rather than enriching the lives of those to whom the gifts should be given. Just as Paul corrected the Corinthians‚Äô distorted practice of spiritual gifts then, so Pentecostals and charismatics need to correct distortions of biblical truth that have traction in their movements now.In two recent books, R. Douglas Geivett and Holly Pivec provide a balanced biblical critique of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), which is influential among some Pentecostals and charismatics. God‚Äôs Super-Apostles is a ‚Äúbasic introduction‚Äù to and critique of NAR, while A New Apostolic Reformation? goes into ‚Äúmuch greater depth in evaluating NAR teachings and describing the global influence of the movement.‚Äù Both books are well written, fairly argued, and amply documented. I would recommend God‚Äôs Super-Apostles to interested laypeople for private reading or use in small groups. Parishioners and pastors who want to explore the topic in greater depth should read A New Apostolic Reformation? (Unless otherwise noted, quotations in this review are from God‚Äôs Super-Apostles.)What is the New Apostolic Reformation, then, and why should it be critiqued?What NAR IsRegarding the first question, Geivett and Pivec identify five doctrines common to advocates of NAR: (1) apostles, (2) prophets, (3) strategic-level spiritual warfare, (4) apostolic unity, and (5) ordinary Christians as a miracle-working army. Both books outline the common NAR position on these doctrines, then compare and contrast the NAR position with a biblical understanding of the same topic. (A New Apostolic Reformation covers these doctrines at greater length and in greater depth. It also has additional material on the size, influence, and mainstreaming of NAR teaching among Pentecostal, charismatic, and evangelical Christians.)Regarding (1) and (2), NAR teaches that a biblically ordered church will be governed by apostles and prophets. ‚ÄúNAR apostles claim they hold a formal office in church government like the office of pastor or elder. Except the apostle‚Äôs office wields much more authority than those other offices because an apostle has jurisdiction over multiple churches, and not merely oversight of a single church. And an apostle‚Äôs authority can extend beyond churches to cities and workplaces, and among institutions that have no connection with the church.‚Äù They are like ‚Äúgenerals‚Äù in an army. Prophets, on the other hand, are like ‚Äúsecret intelligence agents.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey know God‚Äôs secret thoughts and plans and can guide churches based on their inside information.‚ÄùOne way of countering NAR doctrine, on these and other points, is cessationism, which denies that the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit continue to operate today. This is the approach taken, for example, by John MacArthur in his book, Stranger Fire. This approach will not work for Pentecostals and charismatics who refuse to discard the kernel of the contemporary work of the Holy Spirit along with the chaff of NAR teaching.Cessationism is also not the approach Geivett and Pivec take. Rather, they argue that ‚Äúapostles‚Äù and ‚Äúprophets‚Äù are spiritual gifts in the New Testament, not church offices such as ‚Äúoverseers,‚Äù ‚Äúelders,‚Äù and ‚Äúdeacons.‚Äù They further distinguish ‚Äúapostles of Christ‚Äù (e.g., the Twelve and Paul) and ‚Äúapostles of the churches‚Äù (e.g., Barnabas, James, Andronicus and Junia, Jesus‚Äô half-brothers, and Silas). While the latter are the modern-day equivalent of missionaries and church planters, the former are unique to the first century, having been commissioned personally by Jesus Christ to authoritatively proclaim and (in some cases) inscripturate the gospel. Regarding prophecy, Geivett and Pivec further argue that the authority NAR doctrine gives to prophets over the lives of individuals and churches is unbiblical and potentially dangerous.Regarding (3): ‚ÄúStrategic-level spiritual warfare,‚Äù as NAR doctrine defines it, ‚Äúis the act of confronting powerful evil spirits that are believed to rule specific regions of the world. These spirits are called territorial spirits because they control different territories, like cities and nations.‚Äù NAR leaders cite Daniel 10 and Ephesians 3:10, among other passages, in support of their understanding of spiritual warfare. Specific practices associated with strategic-level spiritual warfare are ‚Äúspiritual mapping,‚Äù ‚Äúprayerwalking,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Seven Mountain Mandate,‚Äù whereby ‚Äúthe church must take control of the seven most influential societal institutions.‚ÄùGeivett and Pivec do not necessarily deny the existence of territorial spirits; nor do they deny the contemporary relevance of the ministry of exorcism. What they point out, however, is that Scripture nowhere teaches believers (by precedent or by commandment) to confront territorial spirits. In Daniel 10, that job is left to Michael the Archangel. Consequently, ‚Äúthe Bible does not support the NAR teaching that territorial spirits must be cast out of cities and nations before God‚Äôs kingdom can be advanced.‚ÄùRegarding (4), NAR teaches that ‚Äúapostolic unity occurs when the Christians in a given city unite under the leadership of apostles to transform their city.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Call‚Äù is a popular NAR event that attempts to do precisely that. The problem here, as Geivett and Pivec point out, is that NAR teachers slight doctrinal unity in favor of personal unity, where the uniting personality is an NAR apostle, even if some of that person‚Äôs doctrines are heretical. (According to C. Peter Wagner, an NAR pioneer, some NAR leaders deny the doctrine of the Trinity). NAR‚Äôs form of unity, then, ‚Äúrequires allowance of teachings that are completely absent from the Bible‚Äîteachings unique to NAR. It is troubling to witness attempts at unity that minimize core Christian beliefs while demanding acceptance of doctrines with no Christian pedigree.‚ÄùFinally, regarding (5), ‚ÄúMany in NAR believe they will work miracles, like prophesying and healing the sick. They also believe they will be part of an army that will work greater miracles than the original apostles and prophets and even Jesus. This army is called by various names, including the Manifest Sons of God and Joel‚Äôs Army.‚Äù Again, the biblical problem with such a position is straightforward. The Bible does not teach that every Christian is given every spiritual gift. As a classical Pentecostal, I‚Äôd nitpick this a bit by noting that Acts seems to teach that tongues is the initial physical sign of Spirit baptism, but otherwise, I‚Äôd agree with Geivett and Pivec‚Äôs point based on 1 Corinthians 12:27‚Äì31.Why NAR Should Be CritiquedObviously, if someone claims that the Bible teaches X, but the Bible does not, in fact, teach X, that claim should be critiqued and declared false. I think that is the case with NAR‚Äôs distinctive doctrines.But it needs to be remembered that the vast majority of NAR leaders and followers are fellow Christians. Indeed, as Geivett and Pivec write in A New Apostolic Reformation?, ‚ÄúWe assume that the leading NAR figures are believers and genuine disciples of Jesus, and that their intention is to do the will of God in their lives and in the world.‚Äù They believe in the inspiration and authority of Scripture, the Trinity (with a few Oneness exceptions), the Incarnation, and the Atonement. Like classical Pentecostals and charismatics, they believe that the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit continue to operate today. NAR distinctive doctrines are not traditional evangelical doctrines, let alone classical Pentecostal doctrines. It is in error, from those viewpoints, but not all errors rise to the level of heresy. So why bother critiquing them?Geivett and Pivec answer this question by making four points:(1) ‚Äú[P]eople will become overly dependent on apostles and prophets who exert unhealthy and unbiblical control over their lives.‚Äù(2)  ‚Äú[P]eople will embrace NAR teachings and practices that are not supported by Scripture. At the very least, these teachings and practices are a distraction from true biblical teachings and practices and will stunt the spiritual maturity of those who embrace them.‚Äù(3) ‚ÄúWhen promises made by NAR leaders don‚Äôt pan out‚Ä¶many people grow disillusioned.‚Äù(4) ‚ÄúNAR beliefs also divide, as church-goers and family members are forced to make painful choices between maintaining peace and adhering to Scripture as their solid base of common ground and authoritative source of knowledge.‚ÄùIn other words, NAR doctrine should be critiqued because it breeds dependency, results in distraction and diminished spiritual growth, invites disillusionment, and fosters division.ConclusionEvery biblical truth has a corresponding distortion. As a classical Pentecostal, I see brothers and sisters among leaders and followers of the New Apostolic Reformation. Chances are, you, your family, or your church has heard of NAR‚Äôs doctrines or have been influenced by them. With R. Douglas Geivett and Holly Pivec, I believe that NAR doctrines are not true because unbiblical and unhelpful because not true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9HIT3AUE9XPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941337082#wasThisHelpful","R9HIT3AUE9XPC","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Psalter is the prayerbook of Israel and the Church. Unfortunately, many American evangelicals do not make regular use of it in their personal and corporate worship. Some years ago, I began using it for morning and evening prayer, and I have found my faith in God enriched through the practice.A few months ago, I discovered that Crossway had published The Psalms, using its English Standard Version. The ESV is a good translation, though it is not the translation I use most regularly. Nonetheless, I was impressed with the beauty and utility of The Psalms and decided to use it for personal worship.What makes The Psalms helpful?First, it presents the psalms in a single column, removes explanatory subheads and notes, and moves the chapter and verse numbers to the side so that they do not intrude on the reader's vision. This has the effect of emphasizing the poetic structure of the individual psalms and concentrating the reader's attention on their words. The Psalms is a beautiful presentation of the Psalter's beautiful prayers.Second, The Psalms is well constructed, with a leather-like cover over hard board. (A top-grain leather edition is also available, as well as a standard hardcover edition.) Its pages are thick-unlike the onion paper of most Bibles-and hence durable for daily use. Finally, it fits easily into the hand, large enough to accommodate pages with a good-size font (11 point, in fact), but not so large that it is unwieldy. This is a prayer book-sized Psalter, easy to hold and small enough to fit into a suit pocket or purse.Finally, though the ESV is not my preferred translation, as noted above, I find its translation of the psalms very helpful. The word-for-word (or formally equivalent translation) retains much of the language of the King James Version (and its English successor translations) without being antiquarian.Obviously, if you don't use the Psalter daily, there is no special need to purchase The Psalms in any translation-let alone the ESV-when you can simply read them in your Bible. On the other hand, if you do use the Psalter as a daily prayer book, The Psalms is an option that you should look into.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JK8WBCF3793F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433544202#wasThisHelpful","R3JK8WBCF3793F","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"George Whitefield is not well known by Americans today, including American evangelical Christians, his spiritual heirs. In the eighteenth century, however, Whitefield was well known not only in America, but also in his native England‚Äîwell known, well loved, and widely criticized. Thomas S. Kidd outlines the life of this influential evangelist in George Whitefield: America‚Äôs Spiritual Founding Father.Whitefield was born in a Gloucester inn on December 16, 1714, to hardworking though not particularly religious parents. He secured a work-scholarship to Oxford University, where he fell under the spiritual influence of John and Charles Wesley and entered ministry in the Church of England. Together with the Wesley brothers, Whitefield led the trans-Atlantic evangelical revival that came to be known as the Great Awakening through ceaseless itinerant evangelism, innovative use of print media, and development of personal and institutional relationships across denominations.‚Äú[Whitefield‚Äôs] colleague and frequent rival John Wesley left a greater organizational legacy,‚Äù Kidd writes, ‚Äúand his ally Jonathan Edwards made a more significant theological contribution. But Whitefield was the key figure in the first generation of evangelical Christianity.‚Äù Kidd concludes: ‚ÄúWhitefield was the first great preacher in a modern evangelical movement that has seen many. Perhaps he was the greatest evangelical preacher the world has ever seen.‚ÄùReading Kidd‚Äôs biography of Whitefield‚Äîwhich will be the standard work for years to come‚ÄîI was struck by several similarities with contemporary American evangelicalism that are worth noting, both positive and negative.The first is Whitefield‚Äôs blend of principle and pragmatism. Whitefield was an ordained priest in the Church of England and a convinced Calvinist. This did not prevent him from working with English Dissenters and Arminians (at least of the Wesleyan variety), Scottish Presbyterians, or American Congregationalists, however. Rather, with them, he emphasized the experience of the ‚Äúnew birth‚Äù‚Äîthat is, being born again‚Äîand the doctrine of justification by faith. These expressed the essence of the gospel.To proclaim that gospel, Whitefield pragmatically utilized a variety of innovative techniques. These included itinerant evangelism, field preaching, personal discipleship (the hallmark of Methodism), and the use of newspapers to promote the ministry. The result was a trans-Atlantic revival united by a powerful spiritual encounter and a theology that explained it, far more than by ecclesiology or denominational distinctives.The second is Whitefield‚Äôs emphasis on the ministry of the Holy Spirit, both as the One who brings about regeneration (the technical term for the new birth) and the One who empowers ministers to proclaim the gospel. Wesley‚Äôs journals are filled with descriptions of people experiencing the throes of spiritual conviction, not to mention the experience of breaking through to the peace of conversion. He also routinely speaks of the Spirit prompting his actions and words. Kidd even notes a handful of occasions where Whitefield, his colleagues, or his followers may have spoken in tongues. Ironically, in light of the cessationist theology that characterized evangelical Calvinism in the early twentieth century, Kidd points out that the revivalists believed in the contemporary work of the Holy Spirit‚Äîthough not as Pentecostals do today‚Äîwhile their non-evangelical critics were the ones who were cessationists, believing that the gifts of the Holy Spirit had ceased in the Apostolic Era.This emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit was often a help to the emerging evangelical movement, rooting God‚Äôs work in the heart and not merely the head, but it was also occasionally a hindrance. Critics routinely accused Whitefield and his followers of ‚Äúenthusiasm,‚Äù a mindless religious ecstasy detached from good theology, good taste, and good sense. Sometimes, they were right. In turn, under what Whitefield assumed to be the prompting of the Spirit, he often criticized non-evangelical ministers for being ‚Äúunconverted,‚Äù that is, not even Christian. This won him few friends among that group. As Whitefield and his followers matured, they learned to distinguish the fire of genuine revival from ‚Äúwild-fire.‚ÄùThe third is the paradoxical combination of unity and division. As noted above, the Anglican Whitefield partnered with ministers of other Protestant denominations to promote revival. This is true of evangelicalism to the present day. But just as there are sharp theological disputes today between Calvinist and Arminian evangelicals, there were sharp theological disputes between the same two groups in the eighteenth century. Whitefield was a staunch Calvinist, as was the Welsh evangelist Howell Harris. The Wesley brothers, on the other hand, were equally staunch Arminians. The theological debates between those four individuals, and their respective followers, were intense and often nasty. Nevertheless, throughout his ministry, Whitefield found his way toward cooperation with the Wesley‚Äôs in gospel ministry.The fourth is the confusion of the gospel and patriotism. Whitefield came to prominence during Protestant England‚Äôs seemingly endless wars with Catholic powers. Like other Protestants in his age, he viewed the Reformation dispute with Rome as both theological (How are we saved?) and political (Who will rule us?) in nature. During the War of Jenkins‚Äô Ear with Spain and the Seven Years War with France, Whitefield preached pro-English, anti-Spanish, anti-French, and anti-Catholic sermons that are embarrassing to read today. My guess is that in two hundred years, the patriotic sermons of today‚Äôs evangelicals will cause readers to blush too.It has been said that the past is a foreign country. Reading Whitefield‚Äôs biography reminds us that his age was vastly different from our own. Like many in America in the eighteenth century, Whitefield owned slaves, a fact for which he can (and should) be criticized. (His marriage was also nothing to write home about.)On the other hand, the past is not so foreign that it is unable to teach us lessons about our own time. This is especially true of contemporary American evangelicalism. The trans-Atlantic evangelical revival of the eighteenth century initiated patterns of spiritual experience, theological doctrine, and ministry methodology that are still recognizable among American and British evangelicals today, for better and for worse.As evangelicals move forward in the twenty-first century, it is thus reasonable to ask: Who will be our Edwards, to teach us in this postmodern intellectual milieu? Who will be our Wesley, to organize, network, and disciple us? And who will be our Whitefield‚Äîthe evangelist whose preaching of the gospel will draw men and women, boys and girls to Christ? Kidd notes that Whitefield was perhaps ‚Äúthe greatest evangelical preacher the world has ever seen.‚Äù I would add only five words: though hopefully not the last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XVTKN5KCUDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300181620#wasThisHelpful","R34XVTKN5KCUDV","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First published in 1933, The Pilgrim‚Äôs Regress by C. S. Lewis is ‚Äúan allegorical apology for Christianity, reason, and romanticism‚Äù (in the words of the subtitle). It was Lewis‚Äôs first Christian book, written over the course of two weeks (August 15‚Äì29, 1932) while Lewis stayed in Belfast with his lifelong friend, Arthur Greeves. Lewis had converted‚Äîor perhaps, reconverted‚Äîto Christianity in either 1929 or 1930 (the date is disputed by Lewis scholars) after a long intellectual sojourn through various intellectual points of view. Elements of that sojourn find their way into the book, though readers should not assume that the book is strictly autobiographical.The Pilgrim‚Äôs Regress is an allegory, self-consciously modeled after The Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress by John Bunyan. In broad outline, it traces the journey of John from Puritania to the Grand Canyon, along the canyon to the North and the South, and then across the canyon with the help of Mother Kirk so that, after he retraces his earlier steps, he comes to the Landlord‚Äôs Castle at long last. Puritania is a legalistic and judgmental form of Christianity. The Grand Canyon is Peccatum Adae, the ‚Äúsin of Adam,‚Äù which separates humans from God. The North symbolized arid rationalism, while the South symbolized undisciplined emotionalism. Mother Kirk is what Lewis would later call ‚Äúmere Christianity‚Äù‚Äîas opposed to the doctrine of a specific denomination, the Landlord is God, and the castle is union with God.As in Bunyan‚Äôs work, much of the action in The Pilgrim‚Äôs Regress revolves around John‚Äôs conversations with the proponents of various worldviews. In an Afterword to book‚Äôs third edition, Lewis wrote, ‚Äúmy own progress had been from ‚Äòpopular realism‚Äô [i.e., naturalistic materialism] to Philosophical Idealism; from Idealism to Pantheism; from Pantheism to Theism; and from Theism to Christianity.‚Äù Broadly speaking, these isms mark John‚Äôs conversation partners throughout the book.In that same Afterword, Lewis owned that the book‚Äôs ‚Äúchief faults‚Äù were ‚Äúneedless obscurity‚Äù and ‚Äúan uncharitable temper.‚Äù (Lewis wrote less of this latter fault than the former, so I‚Äôll pass over his remarks about it here.) The obscurity arises, in part, from the intellectual currents of the early twentieth century that Lewis interacted with, many of which‚Äîsuch as Idealism‚Äîhad already ebbed within a few years of the book‚Äôs publication. (By contrast, Lewis‚Äôs critiques of Nazism and Marxism were timely and prophetic.) It also arises in part from the way Lewis defined the word romanticism. For Lewis, the word referred to the experience of ‚Äúintense longing,‚Äù where the ‚Äúthe sense of want is acute and even painful, yet the mere wanting is felt to be somehow a delight.‚Äù Further, he adds, ‚Äúthere is a peculiar mystery about the object of this Desire.‚ÄùIn later works, Lewis would use the German term Sehnsucht and the English word joy to describe this longing. (Hence, he titled his memoir, Surprised by Joy). He spelled out the logic of this longing in a famous sentence from Mere Christianity: ‚ÄúIf we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.‚Äù It is this desire that propels John along the journey and which sustains him as the various worldviews attempt to explain away or subvert it. For Lewis, we should not oppose ‚Äúdesire‚Äù (romanticism) and ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù (reason) to one another, for they work together to bring the pilgrim to God. That is the whole point of his ‚Äúallegorical apology‚Äù for them both.Despite the clarity of Lewis‚Äôs basic insight regarding desire and reason, the obscurity of his references makes The Pilgrim‚Äôs Regress one of his most difficult books to read. That is why the Wade Annotated Edition of the book is such a boon to Lewis scholars and fans alike. Lewis himself annotated a 1935 printing of the book for a student named Richard Thornton Hewitt. That copy is one of the holdings of the Marion E. Wade Center of Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois, and the basis for this edition of the book. In addition to Lewis‚Äôs own annotations, David C. Downing has added ‚Äúnearly five hundred page notes, including definition of unusual terms, translations from a half-dozen foreign languages, identifications of key characters, and cross-references to other works by C. S. Lewis,‚Äù as well as selected bibliographies of works by and about Lewis. I would not recommend reading any other edition of The Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress than this one, so helpful is it. Indeed, as I read the Wade Annotated Edition, I was astonished to see the many ways in which Lewis‚Äôs Christian rational romanticism was already formed at such an early stage. Downing consistently points out how Lewis expanded on themes first mentioned here.Who, then, should read this book? As noted above, certainly Lewis scholars and fans. If you have read widely in Lewis but have not read this book, it repays careful study. It is Lewis in seed-form. Ideas present here will come to flower in his later books, whether apologetic, fictional, or biographical. The one group I would not recommend to read The Pilgrim‚Äôs Regress to is people who have not read, or have not read widely in Lewis already. For them, it is better to start with the flower than the seed. Only after they see the full bloom will they have appreciation for the potential of the early germ.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MV1ZRVKTAYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802872085#wasThisHelpful","R39MV1ZRVKTAYJ","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How We Got the New Testament by Stanley E. Porter deals with three important issues: (1) the text of the New Testament, specifically, whether it can be reconstructed reliably from the thousands of later manuscripts which are our only record of it; (2) the transmission of the New Testament in its early years; and (3) the translation of the New Testament into languages other than Greek in its early years, as well as into English in the last five centuries.Porter concludes that the New Testament text can be reconstructed reliably, with 80 to 90 percent being ‚Äúestablished‚Ä¶regardless of the textual variants present in the manuscript. Moreover, the variants tend‚Äîwith a handful of notable exceptions‚Äîto be minor, neither changing the meaning nor the orthodoxy of the text. With this in mind, Porter takes Bart Ehrman of Misquoting Jesus fame to task for the ‚Äúunwarranted sensationalism‚Äù of that books‚Äô argument.Regarding the transmission of the New Testament, Porter argues that it is possible ‚Äúto trace the development of the four Gospel and Pauline letter corpora back to the second century.‚Äù He argues that there is some evidence that ‚Äúthe remaining parts of the New Testament [e.g., the catholic epistles] were also being gathered during this time.‚Äù This has implications for discussions about the canonicity of the New Testament, though Porter doesn‚Äôt explicitly discuss issues of canon. The fact that post-Apostolic Age Christians routinely collected the four Gospels and Paul‚Äôs letters (and perhaps the other New Testament writings) indicates, in my opinion, that they held these works in particular regard.The final chapter, after briefly surveying the early history of translating the New Testament from Greek into other languages and the more recent history of English translations, surveys various issues in the debate over translation theory. Porter demonstrates that the debate is more complex than formal equivalence vs. functional (or dynamic) equivalence. Evangelicals who are accustomed to the polemics between ESV and NIV proponents will discover how difficult translation really is.In the Introduction, Porter writes, ‚ÄúI conceive of my audience for this book as‚Ä¶an inquisitive and generally well-educated and thinking Christian audience, ideally though not necessarily with some formal theological education.‚Äù As an ordained minister with a graduate degree in theology, I think Porter has misestimated his readership. This book will profit theological students and seminarians primarily, though it also makes several proposals scholars might find helpful. Students especially will benefit from the studies Porter so helpfully documents in the footnotes. However, a general Christian audience will likely find themselves unfamiliar with the background knowledge Porter assumes his readers know and some of the terminology he uses, as well as confused by the ins and outs of the academic debates Porter occasionally weighs in on. (Though, as an American, I must concede that general Christian readers in Canada may be better informed than counterparts in the States.)Even with that qualification about readership, however, How We Got the New Testament is a fascinating, erudite study that I enjoyed and recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKWVJV2XR6G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9B2RNC#wasThisHelpful","R1XKWVJV2XR6G6","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What does it mean to be a member of a church? To answer that question, you must know what the church is. And to know that, you must understand who Jesus is.The New Testament speaks of Jesus in political terms: He is ‚ÄúLord‚Äù and ‚ÄúChrist,‚Äù the one who announces and enacts the ‚Äúkingdom of God.‚Äù  On this understanding, the church is an embassy of the kingdom in the midst of a hostile world. Members of that church, then, are ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù of the kingdom of heaven, ‚Äúresident aliens‚Äù in the earthly communities where they live.Of course, the New Testament uses other metaphors to describe the church as well, e.g., body, bride, temple, family, vine, etc. But the kingdom metaphor is the one that Jonathan Leeman emphasizes in Church Membership. He defines the local church as ‚Äúa group of Christians who regularly gather in Christ‚Äôs name to officially affirm and oversee one another‚Äôs membership in Jesus Christ and his kingdom through gospel preaching and gospel ordinances‚Äù (p. 52). Church membership, then, is ‚Äúa formal relationship between a church and a Christian characterized by the church‚Äôs affirmation and oversight of a Christian‚Äôs discipleship and the Christian‚Äôs submission to living out his or her discipleship in the care of the church‚Äù (p. 64).There is much to recommend in Leeman‚Äôs brief treatment of church membership. For one thing, he helps us see both the essentially communal nature of Christian commitment as well its political implications. There is a reason why totalitarian governments target the Christian church for persecution: Its worship of Christ as Lord relativizes the government‚Äôs authority and draws limits to its exercise of power.Although Leeman didn‚Äôt touch on this point, his understanding of church as an embassy of heaven also undercuts efforts in our own country to turn America into a Christian nation. If Leeman is right, this effort is clearly fallacious, for Christian nationalism moves the representation of God‚Äôs kingdom from the church to the nation. Nationalism becomes the communal expression of Christian faith, which explains why so many American Christians can see the church itself as optional, but get very upset if you question the benevolence of the American experiment.The essentially communal nature of Christian commitment, as Leeman presents it, also explains a feature of the New Testament church that is absent from most American churches today: church discipline, up to and including excommunication. If Christ is Lord, if the church is his embassy on earth, and if citizenship in heaven requires both doctrinal and ethical commitments, then it stands to reason that affirmation of citizenship by the church can be revoked for both heterodoxy and immorality. See Matthew 18 and 1 Corinthians 5 for relevant biblical treatments of this neglected aspect of American Christianity.The great danger of the church‚Äôs essentially communal nature is authoritarianism, where the church itself exceeds the limits of its authority. Overbearing pastors, nosy elders, members who want to major on doctrinal minors and promote church conflicts to get their way‚Äîall these are the temptations and downsides of the understanding of church Leeman proposes, as he himself acknowledges.The question, then, is how Christians steer a middle (and biblical) course between individualism on the one hand (where church membership is undervalued) and authoritarianism on the other (where church leadership abuses followers in a pursuit of power). The key, if I understand Leeman correctly, is to keep the gospel central to our practice of church, through biblically grounded preaching and the practice of Christian ordinances (baptism and communion).Leeman‚Äôs church tradition is baptistic, and this informs his understanding of church and membership at points. As a Pentecostal whose fellowship (the Assemblies of God) has been influenced by Baptist theology and ecclesiology on a number of points, I can appreciation this while also realizing that non-baptistic Christians might parse things a bit differently.Nevertheless, on the whole, I think Leeman is right to emphasize the essentially communal nature of Christianity, especially when American Christianity is so voluntaristic and individualistic. I do wish that he would‚Äôve spent more time exploring how other metaphors might expand, modify, and even soften the understanding of church that arises from giving the kingdom metaphor pride of place. And I do worry that some pastors and church leaders will abuse their positions of authority and cite Leeman‚Äôs dictum that the church is ‚Äúthe highest kingdom authority on earth‚Äù as their justification.Still, American Christians have swung so far in the direction of individualism‚Äîwith all the doctrinal and ethical chaos which it entails‚Äîthat a move toward an essentially communal understanding of Christian faith, especially one that strives to be gospel-centered and biblically well founded, should be applauded.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ZEPDF0RD14N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RPROLO#wasThisHelpful","R11ZEPDF0RD14N","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The life of D. L. Moody is a quintessentially American and evangelical one.Born in 1837 in Northfield, Massachusetts, Moody worked hard, moved west to Chicago, Illinois, and rose from poverty to prosperity in his early 20s. That‚Äôs the American part of his story. Had he stuck with business, he would today be remembered as a millionaire alongside Marshall Field, with whom he in fact lived at a boardinghouse on Michigan Ave.But God had other plans for his life. Moody had converted to Christianity in Boston through the personal ministry of a Sunday school teacher named Edward Kimball. In Chicago, his landlord, Mrs. Peterson‚Äîknown to boarders as Mother Peterson‚Äîencouraged him to get involved in Sunday school work. In the nineteenth century, Sunday school was part spiritual instruction and part social work. Moody didn‚Äôt feel qualified to teach, but he would round up young boys and bring them to the Wells Street Mission.In due time, he and J. B. Stillson went to a slum known as Little Hell and started a Sunday school in an abandoned freight car on North State Street. The ministry grew, lives were changed, and Moody, though a layman, increasingly threw himself into the work of ministry. Moody declined armed service in the Civil War, due to his ‚ÄúQuaker‚Äù or pacifist beliefs, but he became a de facto chaplain to Union soldiers in Illinois and elsewhere, caring for the spiritual and physical needs.By the end of the war, Moody, now married, realized that God wanted him to pursue gospel ministry full time. Giving up the 19th-century equivalent of a six-figure salary, Moody drew upon his abundant reserves of salesmanship and entrepreneurialism to evangelize Chicago for Christ. This led, in due time, to the formation of what is now Moody Bible Church, Moody Bible institute, and scores of other evangelistic and humanitarian missions. After the 1871 Chicago Fire, Moody moved his base of operations to his hometown of Northfield and there, without ever losing interest in Chicago or its ministries, started the Northfield Seminary and Mount Hermon School to provide, respectively, young women and young men without means the opportunity to have a decent education.During this period, his effectiveness as an evangelist brought him grown renown, and he traveled throughout the United States and the United Kingdom, preaching Christ. His evangelistic work was innovative, interdenominational, and made effective use of music through his close cooperation with Ira Sankey. Their hymnals sold over a million copies in their lifetimes, the entire proceeds from which went to fund evangelistic and charitable enterprises.Moody‚Äôs theology was of the ‚Äúmere Christianity‚Äù variety. He worked across denominational lines and was respected, among evangelicals, by both Methodists (Arminians) and Presbyterians (Calvinists). Unlike some evangelicals of that day, he even had kind things to say about Catholics, many of whom held him in high regard. His sermons were simple, common-sense affairs, focused on the love of God and practical Christianity and illustrated with vignettes drawn from everyday life. He preached to society‚Äôs high and low alike, calling for conversion and reminding all to help the poor.That‚Äôs the evangelical part of Moody‚Äôs story.Kevin Belmonte‚Äôs new biography of D. L. Moody is a fast-moving character study of America‚Äôs most famous late-19th-century evangelist. In a bibliography, Belmonte points to several academic treatments of Moody‚Äôs life. His own work, however, is popular in character and inspiring to read. What a wonder Moody was, in his own day, and what an inspiration to our own!Another publisher‚ÄîInterVarsity Press‚Äîhas a multivolume series entitled A History of Evangelicalism. Successive volumes focus on representative figures of evangelicalism across the agesVolume 3 focuses on Charles Spurgeon in the United Kingdom and Moody here in the States. At the start of the 21st century, and after reading Belmonte‚Äôs book, I wonder who will be American evangelicalism‚Äôs Moody today‚Äîthe embodiment of its evangelistic zeal, entrepreneurial innovation, and social-reform tendencies?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JLCS4YRYMVBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802412041#wasThisHelpful","R1JLCS4YRYMVBS","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many ways to defraud a nonprofit organization, such as a church or a charity. Rollie Dimos provides case studies of at least nine ways in his new book, Integrity at Stake. Thankfully, he also demonstrates how simple internal controls can reduce the incidence of fraud and insure that donations make their way to their intended beneficiaries.Dimos is director of Internal Audit for the Assemblies of God (USA) and a certified fraud examiner and certified internal auditor. This book arises out of his years of experience in the nonprofit world. If you are a pastor, board officer or member, or staff accountant at a local church, reading this book will help you safeguard your church‚Äôs finances.The fallout of fraud in a church‚Äôs finances has both short- and long-term consequences. In the short term, fraud embarrasses the congregation, tightens a church‚Äôs finances, harms ministries, and entangles the church in legal controversy. In the long term, fraud destroys the church‚Äôs honor, making donors doubt whether their money is going to ministry purposes and blackening the church‚Äôs reputation in the eyes of the community.The answer to fraud can be summarized in three terms: accountability, transparency, and internal controls. As Dimos writes:‚ÄúI encourage churches to embrace accountability and transparency, two essential keys that will minimize risk and help your church fulfill its mission.

"On September 21, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) into law, which Congress had passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities (85‚Äì14 in the Senate, 342‚Äì67 in the House). Section 3 of that law provided a legal definition of the words marriage and spouse for federal laws and regulations: ‚Äúthe word ‚Äòmarriage‚Äô means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‚Äòspouse‚Äô refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.‚Äù On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled Section 3 unconstitutional by a 5‚Äì4 vote. And although DOMA was enacted with significant Democratic congressional support and signed into law by a Democratic president, the current Democratic party platform explicitly endorses ‚Äúmarriage equality.‚ÄùThe enactment and demise of Section 3 of DOMA illustrate the tectonic shift in U.S. public opinion regarding same-sex marriage particularly and homosexuality generally. Over the past two decades, public opinion has become increasingly favorable to both. The Pew Research Center has tracked public opinion on these matters since 2001. Its polling data show a reversal of fortunes for the anti- and pro-same-sex marriage positions. In 2001, the public opposed same-sex marriage, 57‚Äì35 percent. Now it favors same-sex marriage 52‚Äì40 percent. Furthermore, the trend line of opinion regarding same-sex marriage is increasingly favorable in every demographic category: generation, religious affiliation, political party, political ideology, race, and gender.This tectonic shift in U.S. public opinion and law is dispiriting to those of us Christians who affirm the biblical and traditional understanding of marriage as the lifelong union of one man and one woman. Given the way this understanding has shaped marriage law in America, the rapid shift of opinion represents more than political or legal defeat. It represents a cultural defeat as well.‚ÄúIn light of this reality,‚Äù Sean McDowell and John Stonestreet write in their new book, ‚ÄúChristians should shift their mindset from preserving or conserving to proposing and building. Christians should no longer wish for a massive judicial or political victory to save marriage. When an institution has been culturally compromised the way marriage has been, it cannot be saved. It has to be redefined and reestablished‚Äù (pp. 86‚Äì87, emphasis in original).McDowell and Stonestreet divide their book into two parts. Part 1, ‚ÄúWhat Marriage Is and Why It Matters,‚Äù offers biblical and prudential arguments for understanding marriage as the lifelong union of a man and a woman. Their biblical case focuses on the Genesis creation accounts (Genesis 1‚Äì2), which Jesus affirmed as normative for believers in Matthew 19. They identify three ‚Äúessential characteristics‚Äù of marriage: (1) union, (2) procreation, and (3) permanence. Interestingly, they don‚Äôt discuss the biblical passages that proscribe homosexual behavior. This is the right move, in my opinion, because marriage can be positively defined without reference to proscribed sexual behaviors.McDowell and Stonestreet‚Äôs prudential case builds on an argument made by Maggie Gallagher: ‚ÄúSex makes babies. Society needs babies. Babies deserve mothers and fathers‚Äù (p. 44). As they explain it, ‚Äúsocieties have a vested interest in the process that most often produces children. That‚Äôs why every society cares about sex. Societies also have a vested interest in supporting an environment that best rears children. That‚Äôs why every society cares about marriage‚Äù (p. 45).If the traditional view of marriage acknowledges the essential connection between sex, procreation, and marriage, the revisionist view of marriage denies it. As same-sex marriage proponent E. J. Graff puts it, ‚ÄúAllowing two people of the same-sex to marry shifts the institution‚Äôs message‚Ä¶ If same-sex marriage becomes legal, that venerable institution will ever stand for sexual choice, for cutting the link between sex and diapers.‚Äù Similarly, Andrew Sullivan writes, ‚ÄúFrom being a means to bring up children, [marriage] has become primarily a way in which two adults affirm their emotional commitment to one another‚Äù (p. 60).Stated this way, readers should be able to see that the revisionist view predates advocacy of same-sex marriage by many decades. Long before gay activists began to champion same-sex marriage, advocates of the so-called ‚Äúsexual revolution‚Äù were advocating changes to opposite-sex marriage, emphasizing sexual choice and emotional commitment, while simultaneously untying the knot of marriage, sex, and procreation. The results of that emphasis are all around us: sex outside of marriage, widespread use of contraceptives and abortifacients, the prevalence of nonmarital childbirth, no-fault divorce, etc. Same-sex marriage is the fruit of the sexual revolution, then, but not the root of it.Part 2, ‚ÄúWhat We Can Do for Marriage,‚Äù offers practical suggestions for how the Christian church can go about rebuilding a culture of marriage in America. To me, the most interesting suggestion is the authors‚Äô call to repentance in chapter 9. ‚ÄúIf, in response, we spend the next 20 years point out discrimination and lost religious freedoms to the world without addressing concerns in our own community, we will become our own worst enemies. It‚Äôs time to take a long, hard look inward, admit our shortcomings and ask forgiveness from God, from each other and, where appropriate, from the gay community. There is no path forward to building a strong marriage culture that does not begin with a revival of God‚Äôs people to His design for marriage‚Äù (p. 100, emphasis in original).That revival means we must address the practices of nonmarital sex, cohabitation, and nonmarital childbirth within the Christian community, not to mention of divorce. It also means that we need to address unbiblical attitudes and actions toward homosexual people. What might those be? McDowell and Stonestreet provide a list of questions:‚Ä¢ Have we told inappropriate jokes that dehumanize gays and lesbians?‚Ä¢ Have we treated some persons differently because of what we knew or suspected about their sexual orientation?‚Ä¢ Have we listened as someone entrusted us with his or her deep struggles and sexual identity or behaviors, only to break off the relationship in disgust and fear?‚Ä¢ Have we slandered others, whether or not they‚Äôve slandered us first?‚Ä¢ Have we spread gossip?‚Ä¢ Have we condemned another, using their homosexual sin to justify and coddle our own heterosexual sin?‚Ä¢ Have we re-tweeted or re-posted harsh and uncharitable words about the gay community on Facebook?‚Ä¢ Have we physically or emotionally abused someone because they identify as gay? (p. 106)McDowell and Stonestreet offer many other suggestions for building a culture of marriage in the United States, but their emphasis on repentance is both welcome and the best place to start. Didn‚Äôt Jesus himself say, ‚ÄúWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother‚Äôs eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‚ÄòLet me take the speck out of your eye,‚Äô when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother‚Äôs eye‚Äù (Matthew 7:3‚Äì5)?Same-Sex Marriage is a short book, written to persuade the average Christian and thus ideal for use in Sunday school classes, small groups, and book clubs. Its tone is consistently gracious. It touches on the main points of the argument about the nature of marriage without getting bogged down in details. A short list of books for further reading would‚Äôve been helpful, though readers who want to study the topic at greater length can mine the endnotes for that information.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ONKUA5T190S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080101834X#wasThisHelpful","R28ONKUA5T190S","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of religious freedom in America is, as Kevin Seamus Hasson tells it, the story of the conflict of conscience against Puritans and Park Rangers. Puritans--named after the Plymouth settlers--""want to use the state to coerce the religious consciences of those with whom they disagree."" Park Rangers--hilariously named after a group of hapless San Francisco bureaucrats (read their story on pages 3-4)--""insist...that only a society that owns no truth at all can be safe for freedom."" Puritans represent aggressive religion, Park Rangers aggressive secularism. While they appear contradictory at first, they make the same underlying assumption: In the public square, one does not have the right to be wrong.Hasson narrates the 400-year battle of conscience against its foes briskly and humorously. Part One, ""Learning the Hard Way,"" shows how colonial Americans--with few notable exceptions--persecuted minority faiths, whether Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. In New England, the Puritan establishment persecuted--through exile, torture, and execution--radicals within their own dissenting, Congregationalist tradition (e.g., Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson), as well as Quakers. In the South, the Anglican establishment discriminated against, among others, Baptists. Other colonies--such as Rhode Island, Maryland, and Pennsylvania--were tolerant with a degree of Protestant diversity, but also drafted laws that legally privileged Protestants over Catholics and Jews.Part Two, ""Groping for a Right,"" narrates the evolution of religious freedom from ""toleration"" to ""right."" The former conceives of religious freedom as a grant of government policy. What government gives, however, it also can take away. The latter conceives of religious freedom as something that inheres in the human person, which can be claimed against government policy. In American history, the clearest expression of the latter view--the one that prevails today--is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which begins: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."" But, as Hasson notes, in its original context, the First Amendment, while admirable, applied only to the federal government. It left the state's various established churches intact. Indeed, it was designed to do precisely that.Part Three, ""Authentic Freedom,"" traces developments in religious freedom after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. That amendment, passed in 1865 in the aftermath of the Civil War, extended both citizenship and ""the privileges or immunities of citizens"" to ""[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States."" In ensuing years, the Supreme Court ruled that the privileges and immunities clause incorporated, to varying degrees, the Bill of Rights against the states. The application of the First Amendment's free exercise clause was straightforward: No government agency (state, federal, county, municipal) could prohibit a citizen's free exercise of religion. But what does the incorporation of the establishment clause against the states mean when one of the express intentions of that clause was to leave state establishments of religion intact? If you understand that conundrum, you understand much of the confusion surrounding the Supreme Court's religious freedom jurisprudence.Part Three also reflects on why it is important for government to recognize religious freedom. There are, of course, theological arguments in favor of religious freedom, those of Roger Williams, for example. But as Hasson points out, theological arguments in favor of religious freedom are persuasive only to persons who share the arguer's theological assumptions. In the public square, a broader argument for religious freedom, based on widely shared assumptions, is needed. Here is Hasson's summary of that argument:""The best reason...for recognizing the full scope of religious freedom is that it's the quintessentially human thing to do. Conscience, as we've seen through the book...is our humanity at its best. It's what drives us to pursue our mind's quest for the true, and our heart's search for the good--our quest for God, ultimately--and then insists that we express and live accordingly to what we believe we've found. And it's what entitles us to religious liberty.""In other words, conscience arbitrates what we think to be true and what we feel to be right, and then requires us to live--socially, publicly--accordingly. Allowing people to live according to conscience creates a genuinely diverse society, one where people arrange their affairs according to their best lights, in cooperation with and without coercion by others. Claiming religious freedom as a right for yourself entails that you recognize in others a right to be wrong (at least according to your rights). Only by recognizing this right to be wrong can we end the culture war over religion, in which Puritans try to impose a one-size-fits all religion on a religiously diverse populace and Park Rangers try to scrub the public square of any reference to religion at all.The Right to Be Wrong is a short read (154 pages of text), but it narrates the history of American religious freedom quickly and neatly summarizes the argument in favor of a broad construal of it. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10A9Q0FNKOOTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307718107#wasThisHelpful","R10A9Q0FNKOOTU","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Stott died in 2011, but his legacy lives on through his writings. The Radical Disciple is his final book, which he self-consciously wrote as a ‚Äúvaledictory message.‚Äù In eight short chapters, simply written but spiritually deep, Stott addresses ‚Äúsome neglected aspects of our [Christian] calling.‚Äù They are nonconformity, Christlikeness, maturity, creation care, simplicity, balance, dependence, and death.Stott‚Äôs concern throughout the book is the discrepancy between Christians‚Äô stated beliefs and their actual behavior. ‚ÄúWhy do you call me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô‚Äù Stott quotes Jesus saying in Luke 6:46, ‚Äúand not do what I say?‚Äù Radical discipleship, then, is ‚Äúwholehearted discipleship,‚Äù a form of following Jesus that is not ‚Äúselective‚Äù about ‚Äúwhich commitment suits us‚Äù and avoids those areas which are ‚Äúcostly.‚ÄùThe ‚Äúneglected aspects of our calling‚Äù relate to Western Christians‚Äô practice of the faith. Were Stott writing at a different time or for different readers, no doubt his list would‚Äôve looked different. As it is, the eight aspects he identifies have a prophetic edge to them.Two chapters in particular struck me with particular force. The first is chapter 5 on simplicity. This is the book‚Äôs longest chapter and includes excerpts from ‚ÄúAn Evangelical Commitment to Simple Life-Style,‚Äù published by the Lausanne Committee in 1980. Americans‚ÄîWesterners more generally‚Äîare among the world‚Äôs wealthiest persons by any imaginable metric. We are used to high levels of consumption. Unfortunately, American Christian giving habits have been declining for decades. The solution is a simple lifestyle that minimizes consumption and maximizes generosity.The second is chapter 7 on dependence. In this chapter, the book‚Äôs most personal and intimate, Stott shares the personal indignities he experienced when he fell and broke his hip. Using his personal experience as a window onto Scripture, Stott writes, ‚ÄúI sometimes hear old people, including Christian people who should know better, say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to be a burden to anyone else‚Ä¶‚Äô But this is wrong. We are all designed to be a burden to others... ‚ÄòCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ‚Äô (Galatians 6:2).‚Äù This is an apt reminded that none of us can live in isolation from others. We need, and are needed by, family, friends, fellow citizens, and even strangers.The Radical Disciple is a short book, simply written, and filled with the unique grace that is characteristic of a long-time disciple of Jesus Christ. It is worth reading and will repay re-reading, especially if its wisdom is taken to heart and put into practice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJXANHX4J8Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830838473#wasThisHelpful","R3IJXANHX4J8Y2","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Jesus Angleton famous described the eternal battle between espionage and counterintelligence as ‚Äúa wilderness of mirrors.‚Äù I thought of that phrase while reading A Mind Programmed, the latest installation in the Quantum Mortis series of science fiction stories. Few people or things are what they seem in this story, and even when you see what they really are, you still have questions.Here is the plot: Humankind has spread throughout the universe. It is governed by the Ascendancy, which in turn is ruled by the House of Malhedron. Not everyone is happy with Malhedron‚Äôs rule, however. Prince Li-Hu of the House of Dai Zhan, for example, aims to challenge its power. So does the Integration, the confederation of man-machine cyborgs existing on the edge of the Ascendancy‚Äôs borders.When agents of Dai Zhan somehow hijack the Shiva-class Navy vessel Rigel, with its sunbuster technology (basically, a weapon that makes a sun go nova), the Ascendancy and the Integration move their best agents into play‚ÄîDaniela York and Miranda Flare, respectively.

"This past summer was exhausting. Between work, chauffeuring our son to three sports on four different days, shuttling our oldest foster daughter to daycare and speech care, waking up several times a night to bottle feed our youngest foster daughter, and church and other activities, my wife and I felt tapped out. And so, when Bill Hybels mentioned the words ‚Äúexhausted, overwhelmed, overscheduled, anxious, isolated, dissatisfied‚Äù on page 1 of his new book, he immediately grabbed my attention.‚ÄúSimplified living is about more than doing less,‚Äù Hybels writes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being who God called us to be, with a wholehearted, single-minded focus. It‚Äôs walking away from innumerable lesser opportunities in favor of the few to which we‚Äôve been called and for which we‚Äôve been created. It‚Äôs a lifestyle that allows us, when our heads hit the pillow at night, to reflect with gratitude that our day was well invested and the varied responsibilities of our lives are in order‚Äù (pp. 2‚Äì3). He goes on to write, ‚ÄúSimplified life requires more than just organizing your closets or cleaning out your desk drawers. It requires uncluttering your soul‚Äù (p. 3, emphasis in original).Hybels shares Bible-based, experience-tested advice about how to do this in the book‚Äôs ten chapters. He shows you how to move from‚Ä¢ exhausted to energized by replenishing your energy,‚Ä¢ overscheduled to organized by prioritizing your calendar,‚Ä¢ overwhelmed to in control by mastering your finances,‚Ä¢ restless to fulfilled by refining your career choices,‚Ä¢ wounded to whole by practicing forgiveness,‚Ä¢ anxious to peaceful by confronting your fears,‚Ä¢ isolated to connected by deepening your friendships,‚Ä¢ drifting to focused by choosing and then living out your life verse,‚Ä¢ stuck to moving on by welcoming new seasons in your life,‚Ä¢ and from meaningless to satisfied by choosing to live now in the light of eternity.Different readers will be attracted to different sections of this book. At this season in my life‚Äîfeeling busy and tired all the time‚ÄîI was especially interested in the first two chapters dealing with energy and calendar. As I read the book, however, I found myself reading the chapter on friendships with closer attention. Could it be that my life has too few deep relationships with non-family members? Whatever your interests or needs, my guess is that several of these chapters will address felt needs in your life.So, what‚Äôs the best way to make use of this book? First, it‚Äôs tailor-made for individual use. Each chapter ends with an action step for readers to journal about. Page 311 gives a URL and promo code for online resources that readers can access for 90 days. Second, there is a DVD-based small group curriculum that can be used alongside the book. And third, I can imagine enterprising pastors using the book and DVD curriculum as elements of a multiweek sermon series campaign.Now that I‚Äôve read the book, I intend to read it again with my wife, working through those chapters that address issues we are experiencing in our current season of life. ‚ÄúWe get one shot at this life,‚Äù Hybels writes in conclusion. ‚ÄúChoose a purposeful, God-first life, and you will reap rewards for today and for eternity‚Äù (p. 282).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WL7FVWUCANUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414391226#wasThisHelpful","R2WL7FVWUCANUC","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rick Dial has had a bad six months. A truck T-boned his car, resulting in back surgery, crutches, and the end of a promising future in college football before it even started. Topping it off, his college-professor father has skipped town with an old flame, leaving him, his mom, and his kid brother in emotional turmoil and straitened financial circumstances. To cope, Rick closes himself in his bedroom and plays endless hours of video games online.Which brings him to the attention of a secretive agency within the U.S. government. The agency has been tasked with a project called MindWar, whose purpose is to defeat the Realm, a game-like virtual reality created by a Russian genius named Kurodar. Unfortunately, Kurodar created the Realm so that terrorists could take control of the good guys‚Äô computer systems and wreak real-world havoc. The only way to defeat the Realm is to portal into the game. Who better to win the game than a gamer like Rick Dial?The deeper Rick goes into the Realm, however the greater the real-world dangers he faces, and the more he realizes that his bad six months‚Äîhis car accident, his dad leaving home‚Äîare not what they first seemed to be.MindWar is the first book in a trilogy by Andrew Klavan. It is written for young adults and has a faith-based perspective. On the whole, I thought it was an entertaining read, though I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder whether it might make for a better graphic novel or movie than a print book. The virtual reality Klavan describes is so intense that showing it might be a better way to go than saying it, if you know what I mean.Here‚Äôs to hoping that some faith-based movie production company picks the MindWar Trilogy up and turns it into a entertaining film series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJGM6BEZV3L7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401688926#wasThisHelpful","RJGM6BEZV3L7G","A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q03BGZSFQZ2L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vachanamrut is the collected teachings of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, and is his distillation of the complex and varied Hindu sacred texts for the modern Hindu sect that bears his name.  It is studied today in the Swaminarayan Sampraday.Swaminarayan himself, the author, was born Ghanshyam Pande in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India.  After a seven-year pilgrimage across India, he settled down to become the spiritual leader of the Uddhav Sampraday in Gujarat, adopting the name Swaminarayan upon his veneration as an incarnation of God.  These texts, originally composed in Gujarati with many Sanskrit terms throughout, and somewhat academically translated by five of Swaminarayan's most devoted Sanskrit scholars, are the greater sum of his teachings and reflect the spiritual essence of Hinduism.  As a fundamental, revivalist text, these teachings are devoid of the kind of emotional mysticism that came to dominate so many popular Hindu and Buddhist interpretations of scripture of the time.  One way to think about this book and its following is to compare it to another modern revival, for example, the Mormons.  The Vachanamrut is to Hinduism somewhat like the Book of Mormon is to Christianity.This is a good book to read from anyone looking to better understand fundamental Hinduism, and is absolutely essential for any person seeking to understand the Swaminarayan Sampraday, particularly the popular and influential Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGJEMV1CEBQ0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Q63VIC#wasThisHelpful","RGJEMV1CEBQ0H","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fodor has been doing a guide like this for a long time, and it's a well refined product.  The coverage is exhaustive but, more than anything, the balance of content between details about the cruise lines, points of embarkation and ports of call is just about perfect.  There's no one area that gets deep, detailed coverage, and that type of content is really not appropriate for a cruise anyway.  This book is written with the knowledge that your time spent at any given location is going to be relatively short, so it covers the highlights only.But what a wide swath of the world it includes!  Everywhere from Galveston, Texas to Bermuda, all the way down to Cartagena and up to New York.  It's all got a place in this book.  Then there's the coverage of the cruise ships themselves.  This book will really help you select a cruise that is to your taste and budget.  There's enormous variety.  Keep in mind that this book is really about cruising, so there is a lot of practical information about how to select and plan a cruise.  If glossy color content is what you're looking for, this is NOT your book.We've found that on our two cruises with Disney this guide was spot on, and that shows a real working knowledge of the region and its cruise operators.

"Virginia is so smothered in important and beautiful historic architecture that any survey of the state's buildings is summary by definition.  So, what you get here are the highlights, but that does not diminish the quality of the volume.  The sample of structures is absolutely representative, if not exhaustive, and covers most of the major landmarks you're going to expect.  I am particularly pleased with the relatively comprehensive treatment of three very important towns - Staunton, Lynchburg and Petersburg.The format is carried over from earlier volumes in this series, and is arranged geographically by county.  About one out of every four entries includes a small black & white photograph.  These books are NOT intended to be picture books, but are directories of buildings written in a style similar to an AIA guide.  Entries are accompanied by a short descriptive paragraph of the structures' architectural history and features.  Each chapter is introduced with a paragraph which places the towns and sites within larger historical context.  These written pieces contribute significantly to the interpretation of the architecture and should not be skipped.  Sometimes, additional sites appear within the written material rather than as separate entries.Coverage of the Valley is probably most complete, and coverage of the Southwest is thinnest.  That's really too bad because Washington County alone has so many lovely Federal buildings that need to be surveyed and cataloged.  These regions are particularly interesting because they form a large part of the first colonial frontier, with a built environment more pragmatic and vernacular than the high-style examples of the Tidewater.These books are expensive, but they require an enormous amount of research and editing.  Really, they are a labor of love for their authors, and the quality of each volume is a direct reflection of the contributors' enthusiasm for this subject.  I would highly recommend the book to architects, architectural historians, craftsmen, local historians, and serious heritage tourists with an interest in this part of Virginia.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3BPZ3ELTFBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813935652#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3BPZ3ELTFBF","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in Houston and I'm constantly looking for things to do that don't require me to buy an airplane ticket.  I've found a solution in this book.Austin and San Antonio don't really need introduction, but Hill Country is the beautiful rural surroundings of these two urban gems featuring beautiful limestone landscapes, lovely German villages, and wineries and restaurants to satisfy any sophisticated foodie.This is not a large book, but the quality is very high.  The author has a gift for concise and engaging language that makes the most of its brevity.  The lodging and dining listings are comprehensive and right up to date.  Activities included are diverse, from interesting music venues to outdoor activities.  The book even includes coverage of the new Circuit of the Americas race track.  Sprinkle all this together with interesting sidebars like ""Unusual Things You'll Notice"" and you've got a fantastic guidebook.I would say that the coverage of Austin is most complete, while San Antonio and Hill Country are only slightly less so.  The Hill Country, with its beautiful rolling low mountains, fields of wildflowers and live oaks perhaps deserves a bit more attention, but the attraction of the land and its small villages doesn't lend itself easily to capture in a guidebook of ""sights.""  Otherwise, the recommendations are well thought through and reflect an honest working knowledge of this region and its unique character.I especially recommend this guide to visitors from abroad (or from a different part of North America) who may maintain certain stereotypical images of this part of the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3XIYV4LG4UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612388302#wasThisHelpful","R2M3XIYV4LG4UQ","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Brevity aside, Jim's recommendations are spot on, and the listings he has chosen are sure to provide travelers with an exciting, authentic experience.  There is coverage of sights, activities and listings for a variety of tastes and budgets, from the historian to the party animal.  There are many sidebars and special interest sections (Literary Lark, African-American history, Civil War, etc...) that add diversity to the guide and make it more than a directory of tourist sights.The chapter on Savannah is particularly good, since this is the place where Jim is most in his element.  The side trip to Beaufort is a nice addition, and Beaufort is a beautiful town well worth your time, but it consumes space in the guide that should be allocated to more from Charleston and Savannah.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSXRZORQD416U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6GC180#wasThisHelpful","RSXRZORQD416U","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a bad book, it's just too small.Charleston and Savannah are such lovely destinations that they deserve 1) a guide completely independent of other area destinations such as Hilton Head, Myrtle Beach and Beaufort, and 2) a book comprehensive enough that prospective visitors get a feel for the real diversity and historical authenticity of the respective cities.This book, unfortunately, does neither of those things.  Sure, at least it's got the facts right, and the author is obviously both informed and enthusiastic, but where's the beef?  It's the same old tourist destinations written with the same old tepid recommendations.  In two cities where historic architecture is a major, MAJOR draw, a book like this should feature at least 20 sites from each, minimum.  Listings of hotels should be as comprehensive as possible.  I've yet to find a Charleston travel guide that mentions the best small boutique hotel in the city, Zero George, anywhere within its pages.  A listing of Charleston restaurants that fails to mention Slightly North of Broad is, quite simply, incomplete.So I'll get off my soapbox.  This book is not going to steer you wrong, but it's not going to give you the tools to appreciate the full scope of Charleston and Savannah attractions either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I46H1O9N9EDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1581572336#wasThisHelpful","R2I46H1O9N9EDG","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No, no, no.  While the author's intention is good, I just can't help but cringe every time I read something like ""Hurricane Hugo devastated the city, destroying three-quarters of the homes in the Historic District.""  Then he continues, ""urban renewal in the 20th century leveled many landmark structures.""  These statements may seem dramatic, but they are simply false.  Charleston is known world wide for its amazing state of preservation, for the fact that urban renewal did NOT level many landmark structures.Hurricane Hugo caused a mess, no doubt, but it came nothing close to destroying 75% of the homes in the ""Historic District.""  First of all, Charleston has many, not one, historic districts.  And few, if any, buildings of record were destroyed by the hurricane.He constantly refers to St. Augustine as ""reconstructed,"" which is a serious misrepresentation.  One gets the image of Disney or of an outdoor museum, when St. Augustine is a living, working city with many original structures intact.The sights and listings are good enough, and the itineraries are pretty thorough, but I have to question the credibility of a book that makes these kind of sweeping, dramatic statements.  Otherwise, I would say that the recommendations are pretty good, leaning more toward what I would call ""touristy"" rather than more profoundly authentic.One last thing, and something that is a problem common to many Charleston/Savannah travel guides.  These guides spread Charleston and Savannah, two cities that deserve a separate travel guide EACH, far too thin by adding coverage of places like Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach.  Perhaps that sells more books.  Perhaps not, because a good guide to Charleston could fill 300 pages alone.  Same with Savannah.My recommendation is that you buy the Moon Guide by Jim Morekis.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDMIESO1ZBQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628871245#wasThisHelpful","R1BDMIESO1ZBQ1","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book tells the story of how New Orleans fits into the greater Caribbean Creole world that spreads from Haiti to Cartagena, with colonial tentacles as far away as Chile, Argentina and Reunion.  It's a fascinating historical and architectural analysis, told with beautiful color photography and insightful narrative.This volume is not strictly a ""coffee table"" book, and is as much a sociological analysis as it is an architectural portrait.  The architecture portrayed is not limited to high style examples, and includes many images of decayed vernacular buildings.  The purpose is to illustrate how the Creole culture sprung from French and Spanish colonial settlement maintained a surprisingly uniform depth independent of its geographic location.In the places explored in these pages, French, Spanish, African and Indigenous populations have mixed to form a local culture as rich as gumbo from Treme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FVA371KQ31H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0917860667#wasThisHelpful","R3FVA371KQ31H4","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's yet another iteration of the ""fit vs. brand"" movement in the American college admissions game.I don't like these books, mostly because I believe I'm going to find one with a truly rigorous methodology, but they're all pretty much the same.  This book, like so many others, claims to offer insights into quality that are perhaps undiscovered by the general public.  While that may, in fact, describe some of the entries in this book, I believe it's just coincidence, since the author lays out a very simple formula for inclusion in the book that any serious parent or rising freshman could have derived.  There's nothing new here.  The book exaggerates the selectivity of the best colleges in order to make average colleges seem distinguished.While books like this claim to chip away at elitism in American higher education, what they really do is further support it by solidifying the exalted status of the most reputable institutions.  So, if you've read Loren Pope's book, you'll find little new here.Don't get me wrong.  I'm not claiming that there's no quality in the institutions presented here, but quite the contrary.  I believe that relegating colleges and universities into an artificial subclass defeats the very purpose it claims to solve.  There's just no need to recognize colleges and universities that are ""slightly less"" than distinguished.  And it's patronizing to students and parents to try and convince them that ""brand"" isn't that important.

"These destinations are mostly about white sand beaches, palm trees, and crystal-clear blue water.  This guide covers those things, and the various resorts, hotels and restaurants that complement those things, very well.  But there's more.If you're interested in the history and culture of the islands, this book has you covered in that department too.  Actually, it is this quality that makes the guide so good.  You get a complete picture of the islands, and the book constantly reminds you that there's more to do here than lay on the beach.  This is particularly true in sophisticated little Reunion, which is a fully-integrated legal department of France.Coverage is absolutely exhaustive, both geographically and for listings of hotels and restaurants.  Recommendations are surprisingly candid, and critical where appropriate.  That's a refreshing escape from travel guides that fill the ""everything is good in its own way"" formula.Tie all this up with nice historical and cultural contexts, and a section of practical matters that is perhaps a wee bit thin, and you've got a pretty darn good guide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRG036C4PVXKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742200451#wasThisHelpful","RRG036C4PVXKA","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just love the Rough Guide to Germany, and here's why.Rough Guides appeal to a specific type of traveler.  I would say that a Rough Guide is the opposite of a Rick Steves guide.  These books are intended to be absolutely encyclopedic in their geographic coverage, and they present the widest possible range of dining and lodging options.  They are also quite detailed regarding historical and cultural contexts.  Travelers looking for a practical, quick-and-dirty guide that prioritizes sights and makes recommendations will be disappointed with the Rough Guide.  I would call this book a ""country handbook"" that is most appropriate for heritage tourists, history buffs and university students.Rough Guides have been slow to adopt some of the more popular trends in travel guides, namely, color content, author recommendations, suggested itineraries, fewer maps, etc...  Instead, what you get is the entire country presented in a rather dry format.  I really like knowing that I've got the whole country in my hand when I lug one of these books around, even if reading them is sometimes an academic exercise.  Think of a Rough Guide as similar to a Michelin Green Guide without the stars.I like the fact that the Rough Guide includes so many maps.  It includes maps of all kinds.  City maps, regional maps, topographic maps, etc...  Another thing that stands out is that the travel recommendations are frequently thematic (visit a Christmas Market, Dine in a Ratskeller) rather than geographic (Nuremberg, Berlin).  Those types of recommendations increase the authenticity of your trip.  The color photography which IS included is beautiful, and will pique your interest in that location or activity.So, Rough Guides will probably continue to be most popular with solo heritage tourists who have an interest in places that are sometimes off the beaten path.  This book will almost always cover a city or small town that other guides pass over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSCE49ATUPIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848360169#wasThisHelpful","R1JSCE49ATUPIW","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rick Steves guides are always excellent, but there is a major caveat.  You have to appreciate Rick's approach to travel to really enjoy these guides.  There are three characteristics that set these books apart from other travel guides.First, they are NOT encyclopedic, but are selective surveys of the countries they cover.  Rick does not attempt to cover the country in an exhaustive, comprehensive way.  He selects sights, hotels, restaurants, and other attractions based on the things he believes most travelers will want to visit, and prioritizes them.  For example, this guide recommends a trip to Nuremburg, but not to Bamberg.  He recommends enormously popular Rothenburg, but not lesser-known but equally lovely Quedlinburg.  All this adds up to make Rick's book very much an ""on the beaten path"" guide.  Rick believes that if something is popular, there must be a reason.  To really enjoy a guide like this, you have to trust that Rick's recommendations are made based on a thorough working knowledge of the country, and you must be able to accept his judgements of certain popular destinations (such as Heidelberg) as not worth your time.  I do find it odd that Rick dismisses Heidelberg as ""too commercial and too popular,"" but provides feature coverage of over-the-top commercialized Salzburg, and it's not even in Germany.Second, Rick makes hotel and restaurant recommendations based on authenticity and value.  He doesn't just offer listings with little or no evaluation.  He actually considers whether a hotel will enhance your feeling and appreciation of the local culture, and whether it provides excellent services and facilities for its price.  Don't misunderstand.  This is not a listing of locations for travelers on a shoestring budget, but it IS a listing of places that offer a lot for guests, proportional to price.  The same philosophy applies to restaurants and other attractions.  This is what Rick calls his ""back door"" philosophy.Finally, this is a guide that really stands out regarding travel practicalities, and in concise historical and cultural contexts.  The practicalities are very good, with suggestions for everything from how to rent a car, to what trains to use, to when is the best time of day to visit an otherwise overwhelmingly popular attraction.  For example, most of us will understand quickly that daytime crowds in Rothenburg are going to be enormous.  Want to enjoy this gem of a town without the daytime crowds?  Stay overnight, in one of Rick's recommended lodgings, and you'll be sure to have a rewarding and authentic experience.Historical and cultural contexts are bare bones, and cut right to the pertinent issues a traveler will want to know.  This is not textbook-style dreary history.  Rick tells us when this or that cathedral was built, and why that's important to know, all very concisely and with a lively, witty writing style that keeps the reader engaged.  While the book pays due respect to history where appropriate, Rick makes sure we understand that his guides are not simply about history and the historical.  There are many modern attractions in Germany, particularly in the former East, that are very well covered.  The chapters on Berlin and Dresden are excellent.Listings are right up to date, and maintained that way through Rick's network of writers and reporters.  Plus, he spends over three months per year revisiting many of these locations to update.  Maps are very basic, but they are surprisingly easy to use and always spot-on accurate.  Rick knows the frustration of a bad map, especially for someone in unfamiliar territory.Bottom line is this:  These are selective travel guides designed to be practical and concise.  They are, more than anything, designed to make your trip authentic and valuable.  If you are looking for a truly encyclopedic country guide, there are better books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLYYANEOHOS4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612389708#wasThisHelpful","RLYYANEOHOS4Y","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most people think of Austria as a southern extension of Germany, but nothing could be further from the truth.Crossing from Germany into Austria, heading southeast from Munich, the traveler crosses a frontier at Salzburg.  Many things change once we cross the Salzach River.  Any remains of the Teutonic aesthetic from further north are gone, and the Gothic gradually starts to blend with the Romantic Baroque more profoundly.  The geography shifts from fertile foothills to mountains and lakes almost immediately.  Yes, we have certainly left the lands of the Hohenzollern and found the lands of the Hapsburg.I like this book for recognizing that though these countries share a language, they are from different mothers.  What you get here is a guide that includes comprehensive coverage of this little country so immediately dependent on tourism for its economic well-being.  The coverage is not only comprehensive in a geographic sense, but also in diversity of interest.  Austria has many wonderful cultural attractions, but it also has an extraordinary number of outdoor attractions too.  This guide covers them well.  The balance between cultural and outdoor attractions is just about perfect.Unlike many travel guides that are abandoning these chapters, the historical and cultural contexts in the back of the book are very good and will enhance the authenticity of your trip.  Maps are very basic but are accurate and reliable.Listings of hotels and restaurants aren't ENTIRELY comprehensive, but they DO include the best and recommended options.Suggested itineraries are excellent, if a bit long.  You're going to need at least two weeks to give Austria a fair shake.  Because the country can really be overrun with tourists, and can be overrun with tourist traps (think Mozart, The Sound of Music, etc...), you need to take your time and get off the beaten track a bit.  Let it soak in over a longer period of time rather than trying to ""power visit"" as many sights as possible.  That's the approach this guide recommends.Despite some negative reviews I've seen here (?), I believe this is the best single-volume guide to Austria you can buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ZYQ537FIRTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742200478#wasThisHelpful","R29ZYQ537FIRTF","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Want comprehensive, critical coverage of the entire country?  This is your guide.  There are others out there, but none of them is going to give you the combination of encyclopedic coverage and critical insight that this guide does.  The authors have been refining this volume over many editions and it shows.Listings are numerous, and there are suggestions for a wide range of budgets and tastes.  Recommended sights and itineraries reveal a profound knowledge of the country, its history, and its culture.  There's a terrific chapter on Berlin and its many attractions.  Actually, I'm a crazy historic architecture fan, and Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig and Nuremberg, being largely reconstructed cities, were always a hard sell for me.  This guide lays is out for you:  If you come to Germany and you miss these places, big mistake.  Take the recommendations seriously and you'll be guaranteed an authentic, rewarding experience.The maps are numerous, but they can be confusing, cluttered up with all those points and numbers.I would say that this guide has a slightly more cultural bent than is typical for Lonely Planet.  Outdoor attractions aren't ignored, but they do seem to be concentrated around winter and lake resorts and river tours.  There's not as much focus on eco-touring as some travelers might want.  It's easy to completely overdose on churches and castles, and if that's your thing, by all means.  I'd like a guide to offer some balance, some way to escape what can be cultural sensory overload.

"This is a good, solid comprehensive guide that gives the former East its proper due.  Actually, the chapter on Berlin is very good, up to date and complete.  Since Germany is such an awesome country, with more for a curious traveler than one volume could possibly capture, some of the guide to the provinces and smaller towns is quite summary.  That makes the book very much an ""on the beaten path"" type of guide.Listings of hotels and restaurants are good for the major tourist centers, but are very thin for more hidden treasures such as Bamberg, Goslar, and Regensburg, for example.  Actually, there are also very few maps included, and the book really feels more like a chunky guide to sites, listings, and itineraries.This is a good comprehensive guide to the major tourist sites.  If you're looking for more encyclopedic coverage, Lonely Planet is a better choice.

"Finally, a major publisher has released a good, comprehensive, UP-TO-DATE guide to this awesome South American country.  It always seemed that you could get one thing or the other in all the other books - good photography, comprehensive coverage, up-to-date listings, good eco-tourist recommendations - but no single guide offered all of these things.  Peru, in particular, has inspired a lot of mediocre guidebooks, but Avalon's Moon series has emerged as a serious and excellent addition to the other regulars, and in many ways, it's better.This is a very nice, chunky book.  There's a perfect blend of lovely color images and informative text, but what's really impressive about this book is its comprehensive scope.  Geographic coverage is absolutely exhaustive, and there is a special emphasis on interesting indigenous and ecological sites and events.  Recommended itineraries and listings are based on a real working knowledge of the country.  There's a real sense of authenticity that runs through the book and its narrative that is just not possible to extract from simple collections of listings on Trip Advisor or Expedia.  That's why we still buy travel guides.  Also, Moon hasn't abandoned historical and cultural contexts the way some other guides have.  You still get exposed to the pertinent history and culture of the place you're visiting.My only real complaint is relatively minor:  In an intentional effort to remain concise, the listings of hotels and restaurants can sometimes be a little thin.  The book will usually have the best options covered, but every now and then one slips through the cracks, such as the Palacio Nazarenas in Cusco, for example.  The listings really appeal more to independent and adventurous travelers than luxury seekers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHKB3T3XEGM7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612386210#wasThisHelpful","RHKB3T3XEGM7V","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only thing that recommends this edition above previous editions is the fact that the listings and some of the narrative sections are updated.  Otherwise, I'd have to say that the 89th edition (2013) is still the best.For this edition, the chapters of historical and cultural contexts have been removed entirely, replaced by a vague reference to online material.  Coverage is still good, and is generally comprehensive.  There aren't going to be many places on this vast continent that this guide doesn't cover.  As you might expect, the major tourist draws get the most attention, so this is not really an ""off the beaten track"" guide.  The recommended itineraries in the front are well designed, provided you have at least a month to dedicate to your travel.  Actually, the guide frequently mentions the fact that a real comprehensive tour of the continent is going to take a long, long time.  Three months, minimum.  This is a guide that can be easily used for a focussed tour, though it is really designed for a long-term journey.Footprint and author Ben Box have been at this for a long time, so they have this guide down to a well-designed handbook to the continent.  There's nothing really comparable out there.  The major destinations - Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Cartagena, Cusco, Salvador - are right up to date and well documented.  There are nice guides to the frequently overlooked countries, and the coverage of Bolivia is particularly good.  The guide includes good coverage of important natural attractions as well.  It's only when you escape into the provinces and the true hinterlands that you'll find this guide leaves you behind.Maps are very, very basic but are accurate.One thing I have noticed with Footprint guides lately is that they frequently come damaged.  Bent pages, creased spines, bent covers, water damage, mis-cut pages.  These are not things that happen during shipping, but happen at the printer.

"This book equally emphasizes the two subjects of its title:  Alaska and Cruise.Part traditional travel encyclopedia, and part pragmatic ""how to"" cruise guide, if it has to do with cruising in Alaska, it's probably here.  That said, there is an awful lot of information in this book, which means that it can stretch very thin in certain places.  This is not a traditional travel guide with listings of hotels, restaurants and sights, but is a travel narrative that describes each destination and related physical features.The practical information is comprehensive.  Coverage of the lower ports of call is extensive, as is coverage of geography and wildlife.  Historical and cultural contexts are concise and interesting.  Coverage of upper and central destinations (Anchorage, Fairbanks, Kenai, Seward) is thinner, but is still satisfactory.  Readers should keep in mind that this is not a detailed guide to the cruise operators or cruise ships themselves, so there are better resources for people looking for that information.The real standout features of the book are its comprehensiveness, its many color photographs, and its dependable information which has been refined over eight editions.The pull-out, mile-by-mile map is excellent, and adds an additional level of enjoyment when planning or taking your cruise.

"I'm a fan of Rick Steves' ""Back Door"" travel philosophy, but I was surprised at how selective this guide is.When you buy a Rick Steves' guide, you know you're going to get well refined content that has been organized and prioritized to allow for an authentic travel experience.  Some places will be included and some won't.  Rick does not intend to make his books encyclopedic or entirely comprehensive in their coverage, but his choice of locations (or, rather, his exclusion of locations) in this book can leave a traveler scratching his head.Almost the entire western part of the country, and particularly locations on Lake Geneva, are ignored.  Basel and Geneva are completely absent.  The French-speaking part of the country is very poorly represented.His selection of Alpine villages is also a bit odd, choosing to include Murten and Zermatt which, though lovely, are so small that they can only accommodate a very small number of tourists at any given time.  Authentic?  Certainly.  Practical?  Feasible?  Questionable.  And Rick falling for the touristy glitz of mountain resorts like St. Moritz seems very, well, un-Steves-like!  His chapter on scenic rail journeys is good, and certainly represents are high quality attraction that should not be missed.You certainly get Rick's signature selectivity in this guide, but if his tastes aren't compatible with yours you may find this guide lacking in coverage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XFESKWAMOTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612387667#wasThisHelpful","R1XFESKWAMOTR","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Portugal makes me wax lyrical.  It is hard to overstate what an incredibly gorgeous country this is.  So many people think of Switzerland, or Austria, or Italy, or Spain.  Sit down with this excellent book and let the skilled writers of Lonely Planet introduce you to lovely, lovely Portugal.First, let's talk briefly about the country.  Portugal is blessed with diverse geography, rich culture, and a history that has not been obscured by war or diluted by decades of consumerism.  Authenticity is one of the prime reasons people visit Portugal.  While so many other destinations is western Europe can feel like preserved museum pieces, Portugal is the real deal.This book is dedicated to capturing that authenticity and presenting it to the traveler.  From Faro to seafood, from the beaches to the mountains, from quaint Obidos to mighty Lisbon, there's something here for every taste.  The guide is arranged with typical Lonely Planet completeness.  It includes well thought through recommendations and itineraries that are genuine, and not just constructed randomly.  There are themes that give each of these travel devices continuity, which all adds up to give the reader an authentic experience.This book is the most comprehensive travel guide to Portugal now in print.  I was surprised at how broad and encyclopedic the coverage of the country is.  The listings are complete and concise, and all are subject to Lonely Planet's subjective recommendations.  I have found these recommendations to be spot on, and using them allows the traveler to prioritize.  The writing is concise enough that this book can be used on the fly, as you're engaged in your travel, rather than just a reference to pour over while having breakfast and coffee in your hotel.Historical and cultural contexts add just enough information to be interesting without bogging down into textbook style.  Portuguese history, cuisine, literature and architecture are distinct from any other country in Europe.  They are particularly unique and local in their quality, and this book captures that uniqueness.  Pragmatic information is absolutely complete, and remember that Portuguese is NOT Spanish.If you've not planned a trip to Portugal, make it a priority to do so.  Then make use of this guide, the best of the bunch, to add direction and meaning to your travel.  What makes this guide stand out from the others?  The critical and comprehensive listings and recommendations of a huge network of writers far surpass the resources of any other publisher.  This one sets the standard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSIH6OO6XNN6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742200524#wasThisHelpful","RSIH6OO6XNN6O","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frommer's is introducing the Easy Guide series in 2014, and this particular example proves that this travel guide publisher is back from near obscurity.Frommer's came late to the full-color party and almost disappeared as mainstream publishers like DK Eyewitness, Lonely Planet, Fodor and Rough Guide introduced flashy new color formats.  What those publishers did NOT do, however, is introduce a fresh way of presenting travel content.  Underneath all the gloss, those books offer the same ""what to see, where to stay, where to eat"" encyclopedic format.This book does essentially the same thing, but the content here is far more genuine, organized and accessible.  All travel guides are trying harder to give their readers better, more substantial and critical content.  Rick Steves', for example, makes this a priority in his books, and these Easy Guides feel similar in presentation to the Rick Steves' guides.Don't expect glossy color content.  The name of the game here is simplicity.  The material is purposefully filtered and selective, and the entries are concise and right up to date.  There's a cautiously irreverent tone to the book that let's you know that the writers have done their homework.  This book is better organized and prioritized than any other New Orleans guide I've seen.Though something of a cliche, this book really IS like having a local tour guide in your pocket.  While it is a decidedly classical ""on the beaten track"" guide, the reviews are as insightful as they are selective.  This is a very, very good guide for first-time AND many-time visitors.  There's excellent material dedicated to the important festivals of New Orleans, including Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EUXOBZX9T1JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628870133#wasThisHelpful","R2EUXOBZX9T1JS","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this book because I love Russia.  All of it.Every other travel guide to Russia available today will cover Moscow, St. Petersburg, and probably the Golden Ring, but that's all you'll get.  The rest of the country, literally 90 percent of it, will be ignored.This book is different.  You get good, comprehensive coverage of Russia from coast to coast, across all nine time zones.  Moscow and St. Petersburg, obviously, are feature attractions and get major chapters, but so do the cities along the Volga River and fascinating cities along the trans-Siberian.  Want a good introduction to the lovely capital of Tatarstan, the city of Kazan?  You'll get it here.  Want to understand why the Siberian cities of Tomsk and Irkutsk are worth a journey?  You'll find those reasons, and the practical information you'll need to get there, in this book.  I've spent a lot of time in the Russian cities of Ulyanovsk and Bryansk, both of which are included in this book.  Most people will have never heard of these cities.  This guide brings you the Russia of the provinces.I bought the Lonely Planet guide to the USSR way back when I first traveled to Russia not long after the fall of Communism, and I've been using Lonely Planet in Russia ever since.  You're simply not going to find a guide that combines the breadth of coverage with a depth cultivated by decades of refinement.Another thing that helps distinguish this guide is its relatively irreverent treatment of the sometimes surly Russian service attitude.  While the situation is improving, it's nice to know where old Soviet-style service practices linger on so you can steer clear of those establishments.If there's a weak point to this guide, it's the relative lack of discussion of Russia's enormously diverse geography.  There are landscapes in Russia so beautiful that they have inspired poets for centuries.  From the Caucasus mountains to the rolling central steppes to the great eastern rivers, there's more here than can possibly be covered in one book, or in one lifetime.  And though the coverage of the geography is a bit thin, the book DOES mention that an overnight trip on a Russian train is a must.  This experience will give you hours of time to stand at the window and take it all in - the vast Russian land where you'll see not a single man-made object for miles.Russia is a country that a traveler simply can not appreciate without SOME history, because Russia's history is so immensely important to, and indicative of its rich culture.  This book will give you that overview, to enrich your experience while you learn about one of the most fascinating and important countries on earth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NEBL3SJAIX8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1741795796#wasThisHelpful","R3NEBL3SJAIX8K","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this is your kind of thing (you know who you are), this is a book you're going to like.It is a comprehensive encyclopedia of submarine boats and their respective armaments.  The coverage is excellent, and includes every military boat from all the major navies worldwide, since 1940.  Each entry includes an nice color plate, a general specification, and a short essay detailing the history of the design.  There is a good introductory chapter about the history of submarine technology.All this fits in a neat, compact book that fits easily in one hand.  The only real gripe I have is minor:  I wish the color plates were drawn to the same scale so we could get an idea of each boat's relative size.  Otherwise, this book is exactly what I wanted, for less than ten bucks.  Can't beat that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV3723J80V9RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785830006#wasThisHelpful","RV3723J80V9RM","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hooked on the sound of a Japanese inline four at 16,000 rpm, or the roar of a Ducati V-twin or the wispy smoke of a hot two-stroke?  Does the idea of a 14:1 compression ratio get your heart racing?  Want to learn about the historical foundations of modern engine technology, about who invented what and why it was important?  This is your book.Kevin Cameron is both a master engineer and a fine, skilled journalist.  He brings highly technical material to the general reader and interested enthusiast.  The best part of this book is that it teaches you the technical material without deteriorating into textbook arcane.  It makes you FEEL like a skilled engineer when you read it.  Cameron has the skill to pull this off.The book features detailed chapters about the historical and technical backgrounds of 53 important motorcycle engines.  It's a varied mix of configurations, from the Harley XR to the Honda NR to the modern Yamaha inline fours.  Most of these engines were race only designs, but more than a few were eventually configured for street use, such as the Suzuki GSX-R.The color photographs and few technical graphics which are included are from archival sources, and were not commissioned specifically for this book.  Generally, the feature of this book is the text, and the illustrations serve to enhance the text.More of a motorsports history book than a technical manual, the book nevertheless includes enough wizardry to keep even the most fanatical engineers engaged.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYF5K4UTKZ3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844259943#wasThisHelpful","R3LYF5K4UTKZ3U","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book for several reasons.  I'm a committed amateur architectural historian, and I have a specific interest in the sociological elements of high-style architecture from the deep South.  This book is a good study of the sociological elements that came together to form the great houses we know today.Next, the illustrations include floor plans for each of the houses studied, which is a feature that exists in no other book, at least for these particular sites.  And finally, this book includes a few houses that were important examples of their respective style and time, that no longer stand either because they were neglected or wantonly demolished, such as Mount Brilliant in Kentucky.So those are the reasons for reading this book, but there is a major caveat:  The author is racist.  The text itself runs from merely irritating in places to downright deplorable in others.  The racist slant of the writing may be a product of the times, but that does not excuse its vanity and insensitivity.  As it is, understanding the sociological elements of the book requires a somewhat dry, clinical approach in order to avoid offense.  The chapter about the technical elements of design are really quite good, and tend to be free of racist allusions.This is not a coffee table book or a casual browse of sites.  It's not a tourist or travel guide.  It is something of a dry academic treatment of architecture from the deep South.  I say the ""deep South"" because the sites featured in the book are from what we would call the Old Southwest - Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana - and not from the more ancient eastern states like Virginia and South Carolina.  It is really a study of the Federal style as it developed on the frontier, and of the Greek Revival style.  There is no discussion of Colonial.This book will find most interest from architectural historians and local historians, but will be of limited interest to the casual reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJAEZ58A81KJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486278484#wasThisHelpful","RJAEZ58A81KJW","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The plantations of Louisiana are beloved historic monuments, and books dedicated to their preservation abound.  Here is yet another.  Those of you familiar with Sexton's book ""Vestiges of Grandeur"" know that you're in for a treat in this book.  Here, the author's pen and photographer's lens are pointed at Pointe Coupee, north of Baton Rouge.This book brings the same kind of excellence in photography that has so frequently been applied to the River Road up north to the equally stunning Pointe Coupee Parish.  The book is organized as an architectural catalog of about 50 well-chosen sites, grouped by geographical area within the Parish.  The photography, which is mostly external, is simply outstanding.  While architecture is very much the feature attraction, the author and photographer have decorated the entire essay with shots from everyday life.  Portraits and still life give the book an intimacy that makes it more than simply a catalog of buildings.  The text serves to frame the photography, and is not intended to be an academic study of the region's architecture or history.This is a book that made me want to plan a journey.  Very much a book intended for informal browsing, it will not serve the more academic interests of architects or architectural historians.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an casual interest in architectural history or local history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I3F2Z39M8T09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807145440#wasThisHelpful","R1I3F2Z39M8T09","A1WGUNNY90U041","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WGUNNY90U041?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great wallet and case for your cell phone.  First and foremost I love the hot pink color.  So pretty, This works by putting the magnetic cell phone case on your phone,  The case hugs your cell phone and it still allows you to have all access to your buttons along with being able to charge your phone while it is in the case.  It then sits by magnet in the wallet,  by sitting I mean the magnet is VERY strong, It even has a hole cut out of it for the camera so you are still able to take pictures while it is in the wallet.  The card holder is secured by a snap closure button and it seems to be a very firm snap button.  This has plenty of card holders, in fact if you fill this wallet up with cards you need to get rid of some cards.  That is my opinion.  This has a clear open spot for your photo ID,  and all the slots are adequate sizing to get the cards in and out of.  The whole case is secure again with a magnet flap closure,  This magnet isnt near as strong but it still holds unless you are rough with the case and then it will pop open.  The strap is a nice added feature however I had issues getting mine on,  It took me several tries before I finally got it secured properly.  Overall I dont have anything negative to say about this case, I would purchase again,I received this case at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes,  this is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to this by using this wallet on a daily basis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SC1DT96TQ1JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151TTMOO#wasThisHelpful","R1SC1DT96TQ1JF","A3NVW7DPEEREYS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NVW7DPEEREYS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tablet has many features,  hard to go over them all,  The key major selling points for me would be the case that comes included with the tablet.  Its not the heavy duty type of case but a soft silicone one.  Still offers protection for minor drops.  It has Childrens World already installed on it so you can limit what your children have access to.  I also LOVE the feature of the time limit,  no arguing with your child that its time to get off, it just happens.This is a 7 inch tablet with 8GB of internal memory,  which was plenty for the games we installed on it, however if you require more storage, you do have the option of adding more memory by installing an sd card,  I believe it will accept a card up to 32GB of data.  This is an Android based tablet so its a great tablet and works very well.Tablet is not one of those cheapy feeling type of tablets,  This has a good feel and appearance so it looks high end.  When the tablet is out of the case it is also yellow based.  Not a problem for me as yellow is gender neutral.Overall I personally can't think of any thing negative to say about this tablet, it functions great and appearance is outstanding.I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

"This game is a lot of laughs and a lot of fun.  I tried playing this with my children who are 11 and 8 but they had a hard time with the songs.  They didnt know many of them.  I did decide to play this game with a group of friends and we had a blast.  Of course I am the most tone deaf person on the face of this earth, it doesn't matter with this game..  We all had fun and played for quite some time.  Overall I am pleased with this game, I wouldn't list this for any children to play as they may not know the songs which makes playing the game impossible and just being sore loosers.

"This is an absolutely beautiful table cloth.  It has a floral jacquard design in the cloth and it really is something to look at.  Looks very high end quality.  I found no flaws in the hem with the stitching, and no imperfections in the material or in the jacquard design.  There is no lining sewn in this tablecloth so its not really waterproof,  It is machine washable in cold water.  You can even throw this in the dryer on a low heat setting.  You can iron as needed.  What a fantastic table cloth.My only complaint I have is that the package insert lists material as Polyester, cotton, PVC, EVA.  However the sewn in label states it is 100% polyester.  I believe the sewn in tag as the material feels like polyester.  I believe package insert is a typo.Overall this is a beautiful table cloth and looks fantastic on the table.

"This is  neat mask.  Love the light up feature.  I got the blue mask and where there is blue there is light.  The mask fit my face well and there was a lot of give to the elastic strap.  It did not bother my face at all while wearing and I really stood out as I was the only one with a lighted mask.  The overall quality of the mask is decent I am giving 4 stars because when the mask is turned on it has a very loud humming noise coming from the battery pack.  It actually coincides with the light feature, constant on = constant hum  blinking = a repeated tone to match the blinking.I like the idea of the different features of the light.  3 modes to choose from, constant light, slow blinking and fast blinking.

"I was needing a toiletry bag, I am usually away from home 2 weekends a month so I am always needing ways to pack my items.  I hate throwing them in the bag with my clothes and I hate putting them in the pocket of my luggage, One wrong squish and it could be a disaster!  This bag is great it is quite large to hold my shampoo, conditioner, lotion, fash wash, facial cleaning products.  There is room for it all.  Such an awesome life saving bag this is.  I like the mesh pockets on the inside of the bag, it holds my cotton wipes along with q-tips.  The outside mesh pockets just work for those extra items that you grab and need to put somewhere.  This bag only has a small carry handle.  I kind of wish there was a shoulder strap so you could pack it separately.  However it does not but it still works fantastic.  I like the the little hook so you can hang it up on a hook once you arrive.  Fabric is fantastic, very durable and it actually wipes off easily.  I got the pink and blue and I LOVE the color combo.

Im not sure how it even works but if squeezed holding upwards they lock in place.  If squeezed holding down they open.  What is this???? IM not sure but I LIKE IT ALOT.  They do not pop open in the drawer and are so easy to open and close.Great tongs.  The locking mechanism alone has me sold. This is a set of 3 tongs ranging from small to large each a different size for different tasks.I received these tongs for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

"Great pair of socks,  They are super soft and I love the way they feel on my feet.  Seems like the material is thicker on the heels and toes.  These are designed for diabetic people who have issues with their feet.  However I am not diabetic but my feet swell and ache  from being on them all the time and these socks help so much.  I could tell the first day I wore them.  Love the coloring.  They washed well with little to no shrinking.  Fit as expected!  Stitching is of high quality seems like they should last for quite some time.  They do not squeeze your ankles they fit snug but not to tight but yet not to loose that they fall or slide down.Overall I am very satisfied with this pair of socks and will be purchasing more.I received this pair of socks for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

"Love this tenderizer. I was used to the ole hammer style meat tenderizer and I fell in love with this one the first time I pushed down on it.  This cover so much more of the meat and is less time consuming than the hammer style.  Basically this is a stamp style tenderizer,  It has 48 stainless steel blades and when pushed down on a steak it penetreates the steak to make it tender.  Such a fantastic idea.Love the ease of use and the simplicity.Now cleaning it was a breeze, the metal clips pull out and the cover comes off.  I just pulled apart and put in the dishwasher and it cleaned it well.To put it back together was just as easy.  This does have a clear plastic cover for storage purposes.I am in love with this tenderizer. Seems to be sturdy and made to last.  Blades are very sharp and seem like they will last a long time also.Overall I am please with this tenderizer.I received this meat tenderizer at a discount for testing and reviewing  purposes.

"This case has a very special saying on the cover. My grandma would always sing this to us as we were growing up and now we sing it to our children.  So it is nice to have a case that we can look at every day to have that memory alive in us.  This case is great I have found no irregularities in the material or in the stitching.  zipper is a hidden style zipper.  Zipper is great, it does not hang or catch on nothing.  Material is thick so you can not see my existing pillow thru the material.  This case is meant for an accent pillow the material is not meant to be super soft for comfort.

"This dress fit me a little differently or maybe my body is shaped odd.  Either way the dress still looks fantastic and beautifully designed.  I love the cut out back and that is wear it fits me odd as it want to poke up and not lay flat.  I would prefer it to lay flat but it does not affect the dress in any way.  I got lots of compliments while wearing this dress.  The bottom was a little short so if you like short dresses this is for you,  It is asymetrical so dont expect a clean cut.  However this is what makes this dress the uneven lines.  The material is soft and 100% polyester so there is very little stretch so pay attention to the sizing guide.

"So I was looking forward to these curtains but was a little hesitant because of the claims these curtains claimed to have.  Block out light, temperature, noise!  That just doesn't seem logical from a curtain!  Well I will admit that I was wrong  Please write that in the record books a woman admitting she was wrong.  These curtains are wonderful.  I have glass french doors and come winter time the glass lets in so much cool air it ridiculous.  So imagine how thrilled I am that these curtains are going to reduce my heating bill dramatically considering the french doors are close to my thermostat.  These curtains are amazing they are sewn extremely well.  The rings at top are sewn in well and look fantastic with the gray color.  The way these curtains hang is to appear as if they are folded and have that semi pleat look.  These curtains are really long and heavy.  I have to buy a new curtain rod and raise up the rod so it will look good up on my wall.  Right now they are too long and touch the floor.  The Light blockage is phenomenal.  I thought I had a good curtain before boy was I wrong.  This curtain blocks out ALL the light!  Weird right? well It does.  It blocks out so much light I have noticed that I have been turning on my light more because I cant see in the morning as I am doing my normal morning routine.  Then when I do open the curtain it is so bright!  So I thin it is safe to say it blocks out the light.  As far as the sound goes,  I live in the country the only noise I ever hear is normal outdoorsy noises so I cant make any claims that they block noise but with 2 out 3 claims I think its safe to say they do block out noise.These curtains are very nice and very High quality I was blown away at how nice they are.  My mom is in love with them and would like some for herself.  I am attaching some photos however my wall and curtain color completely clash so please look away.Overall I am super satisfied and give 2 big thumbs up with these curtains!  They are everything I would and can expect out of a curtain.I received these curtains at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes.

I use this one for my back door, and since it pretty much mounts anywhere with the adhesive tape, you can use it anywhere. No electrician needed. No technology skill needed. No DYI experience needed. This is truly something your kids can set up. It looks very modern, but I like that it stands out. My old bell blended in and often people did not press the button.

We got through this year, and so will go to next year as well. He loved it, and his friends thought it was cool. The only problem is that he found it hard to see at night and ended up taking off the hood.

"I was asked to review these sunglasses and was provided them for an honest and unbiased review. With that said, I have a a pair of Oakley's that look similar and came with two different lenses. They are carbon fiber and cost over $400. These are significantly less expensive, note I did not say cheaper. The cases are about the same size and all 5 lenses fit nicely and securely in the case.  The one polarized lenses is labeled and looks the same as the others when looking through it. There is less glare, and I used it while fishing and found it was fine. The lenses are are great for the price. They are not as sharp as my Oakley's, but they do the job. The vented lenses mean they are less likely to fog up, and I didn't experience any fogging yet. It also comes with a soft cloth to clean the lenses, and you will be cleaning them. The one thing I found is that they like fingerprints, especially when changing the lenses. My guess is the quality, but again, at this price, I am not complaining. There is a clear difference in these lenses and the Oakley lenses.Changing lenses is relatively easy, but you have to use a lot of pressure and I worry that I might break something. They are also easy to misalign, but once you get used to it, it is easy. They stay on and don't slip off, but also came with an adjustable strap, so they can hang.

"This AmazonBasics tripod is VERY lightweight....almost too light. It is great for a novice, or if you are going on a hike and want to take it along without being over burdened. It does have a convenient carrying case, and it is very easy to put in and take out. Over all, this is a good, inexpensive, take along tripod. However, the problem becomes apparent if there is wind and you are shooting a distance or if you are trying to pan a shot. The stability is not the greatest when the legs are fully extended. They are so thin that I worry about them breaking, and so I am not taking shots as quickly as I normally would. I prefer my monopod (also AmazonBasics) which is really great, and very solid. My regular tripod is solid as a rock (but was more expensive and much heavier). The latches to extend the legs are easy to use, just need a bit of force to open them. The level is standard on most tripods, but is very small and the bubble on mine is REALLY little. They should have left out another drop (yes, it is that little). For the price, I don't think you will find better, BUT, unless you need something this basic or light, you might be better served with something a bit more stable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2A9O58TPTLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI87KV8#wasThisHelpful","R1R2A9O58TPTLA","A2S26YGSVXBCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S26YGSVXBCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely LOVE Burberry Brit Splash, Eau de Toilette! It is a perfect blend of sporty and mature-ish scent and is not overpowering. You don't have to use much at all, and yet, the fragrance will last all day, even after a night of dancing and stuff. The best is my wife loves it (her new favorite, she said)....It is clean, fresh, and still subtle, and as my wife says, ""sexy."" Fragrances are so subjective, and often depend on skin type, etc. My skin is usually dry and not oily. I also find that I always need to let a cologne (or EdT) kind of settle in before I pass judgement because things change for me after just a few minutes.This is a big bottle, and unlike some there Burberry products, this spray is easy to modulate so you don't get a huge spray. The only negative I can think of is that the cap is very tight a little difficult to remove, and because the bottle is so smooth, it sometimes feels like I might drop the bottle or fling something as I am pulling it off. Still, it looks nice. You see the Burberry design, but doesn't look stuffy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NYIQNAXM2UFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIGCKHE#wasThisHelpful","R2NYIQNAXM2UFY","A2S26YGSVXBCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S26YGSVXBCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the same nail clippers for quite some time (many years). They were my favorite. Then I received these to review and I have to say that they are pretty amazing. First, they are long and the bend allows for a nice fulcrum to give you effortless clips. There is a slight lip at the ends to make sure you don't slip. I would like it just like that. Now, throw in a moving clipper head and I love it. It's almost perfect. The ability to change the angle makes clipping finger and toe nails so much easier! These are also very sharp and hopefully will hold that sharpness (it does come with a lifetime replacement warranty). So, why is it almost perfect? It doesn't have a file/cleaner (for under the nail). If it had this, it would be a home run! Still, I think it is worthwhile and a great product. It's a great clipper that is easy to use, and I am glad to offer an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KTH9AYOIP375/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013G2YS9C#wasThisHelpful","R1KTH9AYOIP375","A2S26YGSVXBCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S26YGSVXBCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quit Nit is a natural way of getting rid of head lice. It might take a little more work, and might take a little more time, but it is a much safer way than exposing our kids to harsh chemicals, or shaving their heads. My sister-in-law swears by it (her son has had head lice twice). We get notes from school a couple of times/year letting us know that our children might have been exposed to someone with head lice. We usually use a tea tree oil shampoo in the beginning of the year, as that seems to be the most common time for us to receive ""the letter.""

We mix our own, and in a pinch have used mixes, and this is the sweetest we have tried. If you like it set, this is for you.

"So, we are invited to a bunch of Halloween parties. I am planning on going as Dracula this year, but all the make up is a pain. I tried it out, put on the make up for a test run and it looked terrible. No problem, I used the remover wipes and everything comes off easily. Ok, so that's not the primary use, but it did work well. Next, ask my wife. She uses make up, though not a lot. She loves it. Says it takes it off quickly and easily. Neither of us experienced and rash or irritation, and my wife has sensitive skin.

"Preventing Cancer: Reducing the Risks, is an awesome book! I wish I had read this book years ago. This should be required reading in your senior year in high school. The idea of preventing cancer as a real option was never a thought in my mind....until I got cancer. Just over 4 years ago I was diagnosed with late stage oropharyngeal cancer, with metastasis to my lymph nodes. That was one of the worst days of my life. I had quit smoking and drinking 25 years ago. But I didn't eat well, nor did I take good care of myself. I didn't sleep much (4-5 hours/night). Looking back, I did almost everything possible to damage my body. I never thought it would happen to me. I do believe I could have done things differently to prevent it. Obviously, not smoking and not drinking, but more than that. When my oncologist told me that everyone has cancer cells in them, and that stress was a big factor, I realized that keeping my immune system strong was really the key. Eating right, and sometimes that means going against everything you are used to, is so important! But....who knew? I found out too late. Reading this book is important to keep yourself, your family, and your friends healthy. Make it so that your body will fight off those cancer cells and not let them take over. A healthy lifestyle is a healthy life, plain and simple, and this book will help you get there.....and even though I read it late, I am glad to have it now (it's never too late), and very glad to recommend it. I can tell you that I knew most of this, but learned it the hard way! Initially, I was told I had a 20% chance to survive 5 years. Ha! Now, my doctors are telling me that I am doing great and that I will be fine. Read this book, then give it to your family and friends and make them read it too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24F70BL1F1ZC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770856331#wasThisHelpful","R24F70BL1F1ZC4","A2S26YGSVXBCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S26YGSVXBCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description says it all. ULTRA SOFT. Right out of the box, you can feel the difference! I never knew, but now I'm sold. These are the softest washcloths I have ever felt. All natural bamboo being soft? I would have lost that bet. I don't think I can go back to a regular washcloth again. They are packaged nicely as well, but really, that's not as important as how they feel.

"The recommended use does not match up with the advertised use! It comes with leg, arm and bikini attachments. The problem is that it comes with so many disclaimers and warns to only use between the knee and ankle and elbows to wrist. Warnings abound for suntanned skin, pregnancy, menstruation, diabetics, etc., send a mixed message to say the least. I tried it on the back of my neck and it did not do a great job. I had to make several passes and left welts. I tried in different directions and nothing seemed to help. Often breaking the hairs (and the were about 1/4 inch long).

"The De'Longhi EN550S Lattissima Touch Nespresso Single Serve Espresso Maker is an amazing little machine! I have a Jura, that I love, and it's nice to be able to compare the two. This EN550S has a small footprint so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. It looks amazing and works very well. The only real downsides is having to use the Nespresso pods (more expensive than using your own coffee) and a small reservoir (if you have guests you will be filling up a lot). With that said, there are so many good things that it is hard to beat. First, it makes a great cappuccino...and it makes it fast. This was the most impressive feature, and something that my Jura (at double the price) lacks! It is programmable, like my Jura, so you can set it up as you wish. The difference is that you have a lot more options than my Jura. It is touch sensitive which I like. Milk foams up very nicely. Removing that water tank is not as easy as the Jura, but since it is small, it shouldn't be a problem, just grab it right or it might slip. The nice thing is that it is easier to lift up (I have some room above it) and can tilt it a little, but the machine is small enough that moving it is not really an issue. I still love my Jura, because it grinds the beans and I can use any beans I want, but if I had to choose one, I think the Nespresso wins because of the cappuccino and smaller footprint, and half the price of the Jura.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FF6YCFNXF79P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI44XIK#wasThisHelpful","R3FF6YCFNXF79P","A2S26YGSVXBCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S26YGSVXBCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LED bulb looks good. It gives off a lot of light with little consumption (6 Watt). Having a bulb that is cheaper to run and gives off more light than my current ones is great (I like it bright). If you don't like it bright, no worries, these are dimmable. Perfect for setting the mood at dinner. I like that I don't  have to worry about glass.The only thing is that the minimum requirement for a 60 watt bulb is 800 lumens (one site said 900). The minimum for a 40 watt bulb is 450 lumens. This is rated at 550. I only use 40 watt bulbs in my chandelier, so for me it is great. If you are looking for more light, you will probably want something putting out 800 lumens. There are calculators out there that will help you figure out the exact wattage, but figure this to be over a 40 watt bulb and under a 60 watt.I was provided this item to give an honest and unbiased review.I am pleased with the performance of this bulb.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PFS20X7IAYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9W7HH8#wasThisHelpful","R27PFS20X7IAYT","A2S26YGSVXBCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S26YGSVXBCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Panasonic ES-ED70-G is easy to handle and contours to most curves/angles well. It is by no means, ""gentle."" I tried it on my neck and man did it hurt. Worse, it ripped the hair half way, so did not pull it completely out....so....I had to do it again! The next day, when the welts went down, it was fine, but there is no way I would every use it on my neck again. So, my wife was not willing to try it, so I put it on my legs. Same thing! It seems to hurt less if you put more pressure on it. I used the sensitive skin attachment, the regular one was just too much torture. The razor is useless, but the trimmer is ok. After all that, my wife said she hadn't shaved legs today and that I could try it on her leg. ""You're not used to it,"" she said. Well, she asked for it. I tried it on her leg (with the sensitive attachment). ""Ouch!"" she yelled, ""that hurt!"" Maybe you have to get used to it. LOL.While it's nice to be able to take it into the shower, it's not that great if you have welts, tears, etc. I don't think it is worth the pain, especially when you have to make several passes. Of course, if you can take it, it will ultimately get you smooth. It is not what I expected.

"For the price, this is a great Snorkel and Mask set. The snorkel is flexible, which allows it to contour well. It purges easily and takes in air well. It cleans up easily (rinse after every use and it should last you a long time). The mask is clear and comfortable and very adjustable, so it should fit anyone.

"I love my Braun. I have used Braun for over 20 years and have never found anything close to it. So, for me to give this Panasonic 5 stars should say a lot. Keep in mind that this is ""just"" a travel shaver. I will mention what I don't like first, and that is, no sideburn trimmer. That would make this perfect. I was thinking I would use this when I travel, but I have found the shave to be so close (maybe better) to my Braun (blasphemy, I know) that I am using it every morning. So far, this week, the batteries are doing fine. Please note the Braun I use costs about 5 times more! Everything here is smaller, lighter, etc. These are not negatives for me, because it is marketed as a travel shaver. They really don't mean it to be a daily user, even though that is how *I* am using it. The shave is very close, razor close. It goes around my chin easily and smoothly without pinching or cutting. It works well in the shower. It cleans easily, but doesn't come with a brush (you don't need one) because you can just rinse it. It comes with a foil guard and a little bag (that I wouldn't use). The on switch takes a little pressure, nothing difficult, but enough so that it won't easily turn on while you are travelling. I shave every day, and have not missed a day, so I can't say how it works on a couple of days of growth (I will update if it handles poorly). You can easily keep this I your care, briefcase, etc. One thing that is interesting, even though the foil is not as wide as my Braun, I didn't notice a difference in shaving time. It was pretty much the same. I had no irritations or reactions after shaving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PPRU0IC65KE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009DT34W#wasThisHelpful","R12PPRU0IC65KE","A2S26YGSVXBCFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2S26YGSVXBCFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an amazing filter. This is the first time I have used this, because I never knew it existed. I will continue to purchase this ultra fine particle reduction filter as it has made a HUGE difference over the 2200 I used to use. It is amazing how much less dust there is in the house, and the difference in air quality. These are pricey, no doubt, but well worth it. I didn't notice that my HVAC worked harder (no difference in my electric bill), but I did notice that the filter needed to be changed sooner the first time, which means it pulled a lot of dust from the return, and that is dust that would have circulated in my house!

My husband tells me it feels good against his skin.Now the weird stuff: The shirt has a boxy cut, so it doesn't contour well with the body. This fits my husband's shoulders and chest well, but there is a lot of excess material bagging out around the midsection. The shirt is also quite short. And the v-neck cut is a little too shallow, I think. It sits just below the hollow of the neck, making it not quite a traditional v-neck cut.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VSLRQDIXC3OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXIT9T2#wasThisHelpful","R2VSLRQDIXC3OG","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The necklace comes inside a nice cloth pouch, which is then inside of a pretty purple gift box.The chain is average quality, not so thin that it will break easily. It has a dainty, feminine appeal.The pendant is solid and seems to be well made. The engraved word 'Hope' is small, though, making it difficult to read while wearing it unless someone is examining you closely. The style of the ribbon makes me think of the ubiquitous breast cancer awareness ribbons. I mean absolutely no offense on that observation. It's just that those ribbons are everywhere, and so that was my first reaction when I pulled it out of the pouch.

"This appears to be an excellent quality food. The first ingredient is pollock, which is a type of fish my dogs had never tasted. This also contains turkey, which is probably a least favorite meat source for at least one of my dogs. (Unless it's freshly cooked!) This food also contains a healthy and wide array of fruits and vegetables, such as carrot, apple, and cranberries. And I was interested to find this food has some probiotic strains for, I'm assuming, digestive and immune health.The nuggets are small square shapes. They look a bit like a bowl of Chex cereal.One of my dogs immediately took to this food. The other two were initially hesitant, likely because the pollock was a strange scent for them. It didn't take long for all three dogs to find the strange smell had (presumably) a great taste. My girl, which is the dog least likely to eat turkey, will go to her other food if offered the choice. The boys are enjoying the new flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9KIOM3494468/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGNKQ#wasThisHelpful","R9KIOM3494468","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CoQ10 is an excellent supplement, particularly for issues related to the heart. Many years ago, my mother's cardiologist wanted to put her on medication (complete with unwanted side effects) for palpitations, extra heartbeats, etc. I suggested she first try CoQ10, 100mg per day, which she did. She has since had the rare, minor palpitation, but no other issues, all without prescription medication or side effects. My husband takes it for his blood pressure, and I take it for complications with a leaky mitral valve. In general, this is a supplement I highly recommend.Specifically, I am happy so far with this company's products. I've only just switched to their CoQ10, but I've haven't experienced any problems related to the quality. The softgels are relatively small and easy to swallow. This supplement needs to be taken with food, or at least something with fat content (milk, yogurt, chocolate, etc.).My experience with VIva Labs products so far has been excellent, and I highly recommend giving this try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBCNJE75OGHJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JWGXJG#wasThisHelpful","RBCNJE75OGHJR","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The towel itself is fine, as far as quality. They're soft and absorbent. But the color runs horribly. I'm always a little leery of red towels, because red does tend to bleed. So I first soaked one towel in a little bit of warm water for about 10 minutes. The water was pink. I rinsed it, let it dry, and tried again. It still ran just as much. I also had a package of the tan color, which I hadn't even considered would run. But, just to be safe with this brand, I repeated the same soaking exercise with a tan towel.

"I got this for my husband for work. Here are his thoughts:This eWriter is surprisingly thin and lightweight. It comes with a stylus specific for the product, but you could use any sort of blunt-ended object if needed. The great thing is that it doesn't respond to fingertips or other such pressure, so you don't need to worry about being overly careful in handling this while using it.The screen itself is grayish in color, and the writing is bright green. The contrast stands out well, being easily readable without a lot of bright light.Once you depress the 'erase' button, everything is immediately wiped clean from the surface. The downside of this is that you can't erase individual lines of notes or mistakes. I'd love to see this screen divided into one-inch horizontal lines, with an erase button for each line. That would allow far more flexibility. For instance, you could erase tasks as completed, rather than erasing the entire screen at once.There is no memory, so once the screen is full you need to copy the notes or, as I do, snap a photo with your phone if there are things you still want to keep but you need space for more notes. That being said, everything you write remains until you choose to click the erase button.I showed mine off the first day at work, and all my coworkers wanted one for themselves. It's a cool toy.Aside from work use, this is also great for people like me who need to draw while speaking. Drives my wife crazy, because I'm always snatching paper away from her to illustrate while I talk. Now I can illustrate and erase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQEKNCMRX6L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HWCEFY#wasThisHelpful","R2RQEKNCMRX6L7","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I connect to stories by connecting to the characters, and there isn't a lot of development here. We learn little about Leah or the people tracking her. I wondered, ""Who is this woman I'm following into the woods?""Then, as I followed along, I learned that the journey here is the heart and soul of the story. Leah could be my mother, your grandmother, or that lady in line ahead of us at the grocery store. She is a symbol of each of us, and of the people we love. I hope I have that right. Ms. Doreen Cox, feel free to correct me if I've gotten it wrong.The animals in the forest and the way they surround Leah with love is truly beautiful.

"This watch comes in a nice gift box, along with a small cloth for cleaning.The photo here doesn't really do the watch justice. The crystals give it a pretty sparkle, while keeping it classy.I was initially hesitant about this one. The watch is fairly heavy and solid, almost like a man's watch in feel. Yet, on the wrist, it is definitely feminine. There is an elegance to the appearance, making it ideal for casual or dressy events.The only drawback is the length of the band. I haven't yet taken it to the jeweler to be sized, but it looks like I'll need at least six links removed before I can wear it. That's a lot of extra. I honestly can't imagine any woman needing the watch band to be as large as it is. This seems to be a trend with quality watches these days, and I have to say that I'm not a fan.

"My husband has a coffee addiction. He goes nowhere without his coffee, and has a mug on his desk at work all day. I got this for him to keep at work, so his coffee would stay warm and not spill over on his work as it sometimes does. He is disappointed in this mug. Here are his thoughts:The plastic feels thinner than what you'd get with a good quality travel mug. There isn't any insulation to keep the coffee warm, so it's no better than a regular mug and less effective than a travel mug.The mug itself is fairly large, but the cover is screwed deep into the mug and takes up a lot of space. There is also a lot of empty space between the outer part of the mug and the inside cavity. The open area between is where the mechanism sits that is supposed to open and close to prevent spillage. Consequently, this large mug only holds about 10-ounces of coffee, which is just a big sip for me.The liquid gravity mechanism doesn't work like advertised. When I tip the mug in closed position, it still leaks. Granted, it doesn't pour, but it would still make a mess.The mug is a nuisance to clean. The space between the outside of the mug and the inner cavity can't be cleaned effectively. And coffee does get inside there. If you overfill the mug by even a little, when you put the cover in place the spillage goes in that open space.I'm going back to my regular mugs and travel mugs. I will not use this at all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HOYUZ423YPSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBLGRIY#wasThisHelpful","R3HOYUZ423YPSK","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mrs. John Doe is a fast-paced thriller with a unique heroine. Nora is an actress and an acting teaching, and here she relies on her skills in ways she never expected.I liked Nora's character. She's tough and self-sufficient, and she doesn't allow fear to cripple her. At the same time, she's not an obnoxious superhero who can do no wrong. The originality of her character intrigued me most about this book.The plot carries us along at high speed, with lots of twists and turns. At times it feels a little too far-reaching, with multiple offshoots and ambiguities. The entire story is told from Nora's perspective, and her confusion becomes our confusion as we try to sort out the tangled strands. Events do come together and everything makes complete sense, but you need to pay attention to the details.The writing puts us in the midst of the action. I could feel the emotions and the bursts of adrenaline. I really enjoyed the exploration through small towns in England and France. I felt like I was there with the characters.For me, the only negative comes in believability. Granted, most thrillers require that we take a leap. But the premise of this story requires quite a big leap. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll try to be vague while still making sense. First, I found it hard to believe that Nora's husband would have involved her in this on any level at all. Second, Nora is surrounded by the best operatives in the world, good and bad, yet she manages to make them all look amateur. And, finally, given the magnitude of what her husband was involved in, I just couldn't believe that he would try to play hero and handle it all himself. The 'trust no one' theme was just a little too much for me to fully accept. But what do I know?

You have cards with statements that you read aloud. You secretly choose true or false to your statement, and the rest of the players guess your answer. Some of the statements are indeed funny. Most, though, are intensely personal and sexual in nature. Some absolutely border on crude. It's like teenage truth-or-dare on steroids.An interesting thing is that this game is designed for a minimum of three players. This isn't a game meant to play with your significant other, privately, for some laughs. It is, however, perfect for swingers and/or open-minded couples. It's the kind of game I'd expect to find at Spencer's store, in the back with the body gel that heats up when you rub it on.So, this game is not suitable for my intended purposes. If you do buy this, and you have kids at home, make sure you hide it. I'm pretty sure you won't want to explain most of this stuff to your 12-year-old.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13N1W9Y1I8PZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3423AC#wasThisHelpful","R13N1W9Y1I8PZD","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This appears to be a healthy dog food with quality ingredients. There are no byproducts or hard to digest fillers.The nuggets are small, about the size of a pea, only slightly more flattened on two sides. My dogs are all under 15 pounds, and they prefer smaller nuggets so this food works well for them in that area.I put a bowl of this down beside their regular dry food. They tasted this one, then mostly chose to go for their regular food. Their preference might have more to do with the turkey flavor than the quality of the food. Their other dry food was lamb flavor, which I think they like better in general. Turkey just doesn't seem to interest them as much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGYX4OSZBUHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGFWM#wasThisHelpful","R3VGYX4OSZBUHM","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This train set absolutely requires adult assembly and assistance. It's not something you can hand your child and expect him/her to figure out alone. Little ones will need either an older child or an adult to help out.The pieces are all quite sturdy. This is well made and has a fun design. The track can be taken apart and redesigned in a variety of ways.The train goes faster than I expected. No lazy ride around the track for Chuggington.

"I don't play video games personally, but my son is an avid gamer. This is his review:Going to begin by stating that this wheel does not work for every racing game. I wanted to use it to play Need for Speed Rivals on my PS4. However, EA (producer of NFS) is terrible and doesn't allow/enable wheel function.I tested the wheel out by playing DriveClub, which is a more realistic racing game than NFS. It worked great and was easy to set up. The feedback function is cool. There's a feature that let's you change how much you need to turn the wheel, which is awesome.This isn't really something for everyone. More of an accessory that driving game enthusiasts should definitely consider.The wheel itself is well designed and is comfortable to hold and use. The weight is a problem, though. It's so light, if you don't have a surface that the grips on the bottom can hold on to well, you'll be pulling the wheel side to side instead of steering. The power cord is also quite short and thin.Overall, a fun accessory to have while playing a driving game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PIDWKATQF46L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014US02ZA#wasThisHelpful","R3PIDWKATQF46L","A3SMV35531YME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SMV35531YME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

By all of us networking together, internet commerce can be a win-win for everybody, because producers can learn what they need to do; consumers can purchase what they are seeing; and reviewers can improve their analysis and can then be a part of the solution.Questions that might come to mind are: Will this book actually teach me something I didn't already know by surfing the internet? Unfortunately, rather than being a book with everything you need to know, this is a brief, very brief, introduction to stimulate your curiosity.Is this a book that I can read without having to read others first? Yes.Are there other books by this author that might also be helpful? On this subject, no, but the author has other nonfiction titles on other topics. One I purchase is Strawberries: Everything You Need to Know.Are there a lot of typos/misspellings, grammatical errors or other editing failures? No, I found no typos of editing errors. Well, unless you include the misleading title.Is it a quick, easy read and is the writer enthusiastic in his/her approach? The one bright spot of this book is that it is an easy-to-read book. The writer is encouraged to expand this booklet, as it is apparent this writer has talent.What sort of language does this writer use to amplify the points made? Plain English. No foul language and no confusing jargon.My biggest pleasure or disappointment was? It did stimulate my curiosity and I will be searching for a more in-depth work on Scuba Diving.EXCERPT:Due to the number of pages I opted to not include any excerpts.Bottom line: As written, due to the extreme brevity, I‚Äôm rating this as a one star. There just is not enough information to justify a selling price of $2.99. Even at free, as it is on the date I am posting this review, readers may be disappointed in clogging up their Kindle Library with this.On the other hand, if the writer does expand this and insert some photographs to amplify the points being made or to ease the learning process, I will gladly reconsider my rating.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WZWQI959T4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B018367DRA#wasThisHelpful","R18WZWQI959T4P","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No. None that seriously alter the meaning.Language: Plain English. Absent any foul language or confusing jargon. She is clear and concise, as the excerpt below will show.Although I have posted a good deal more reviews and have been doing so for considerably longer, I learned several good points from this writer and will improve because of that. She knows her subject and, obviously, has good advice even for some reviewers currently in Amazon's Top 500.She has also written a book offering tips to people who want to set up their own web site for reviewing books, which I will read tonight, since I have got my site up and running...er, crawling. With her tips I hope to improve my design and content quickly.I appreciated her way with words. She writes in a calm, effortless style without exaggerating or making wild statements and with no malice towards other reviewers. More to the point, she makes solid points of value to reviewers and to people who enjoy reading reviews.EXCERPT:Clarity ‚ÄìHow clear is the subject discussed? Can you follow the writer‚Äôs thoughts or is there just way too much stream of consciousness that you can‚Äôt understand what is being presented?Biasness ‚ÄìNow, there is nothing wrong in a biased non-fiction, but it needs to be presented in the review. Is this a book that tries to be objective or does it take a strong stance either way? Let your readers know.Format/ Layout ‚ÄìA non-fiction book depends a lot on format and layout. It has to have some visual appeal as some of the information might be presented in graphs, pictures, and bullet points. Many non-fiction books tend to have little white space which can hurt the eyes. Note all of this in your review. In case of a cookbook, is the layout appealing to the eye and easy to read?Depth ‚ÄìHow in-depth does the author go?Visual aids ‚ÄìAre there visual aids: pictures, graphs, diagrams, etc.?References ‚ÄìDoes the author cite sources? Can you follow up on topics if you are interested and want to know more?Argument -How well does the author argue their point or support their topic? Or is it just a bunch of statements that say the same opinion over and over?Style ‚ÄìHow is the overall style of the writing? Engaging? Witty? Boring? Dry?I do have a couple points to note: the title of this book at Amazon is Writing a Book Review, but when it loads onto Kindle, the title is How to Write a Book Review.The other point is that the author links to her blog, abookloverslibrary but when I click on it, I am transferred to a site in either Japanese or Chinese.

"Length: Print, 62 pages; not yet available as an audiobook through Audible, but it definitely should be at some future date.Join in the conversation: leave a comment at the end of the review or to search my profile for more good books or my email contact information.This book is targeted to people interested in American history and, especially, in the struggle been Seminoles and Creek Indians to maintain their freedom from encroachment of pioneers from the new nation, the United States of America.What was the Amazon Rank on the date this review was published? 231,466.Questions that might come to mind are: Will this book actually teach me something I didn't already know by surfing the internet? Yes, definitely.Is this a book that I can read without having to read others first? Yes. This is a stand alone.Are there other books by this author that might also be helpful? The author has written other books about serial killers, but this is the only one regarding American History and about the Indian Wars.Are there a lot of typos/misspellings, grammatical errors or other editing failures? The only drawback with The Wild Wild West in the Deep South is that it would benefit from some professional editing. Please bear in mind, the editing that has been done is better than many books I‚Äôve read. It is even better than some reviews I‚Äôve posted, so, don‚Äôt let this point scare you away from reading this valuable tome.Is it a quick, easy read and is the writer enthusiastic in his/her approach? This is a quick, interesting book that I read in less than three hours.I also hope the writer will consider producing this as an audiobook through Audible. A recent book by Buck Flogging shows how easily and inexpensively it can be done and why every self publisher should consider doing so.What sort of language does this writer use to amplify the points made? The author relates the conflict in straightforward English, absent any foul language.I found this book especially interesting in the backdrop of current world events. It‚Äôs balanced, even-handed treatment of military leaders from both sides of the conflict is to be praised.EXCERPTS:Excerpt 1:At the age of fourteen, Horse would hang around the American military base, Fort Brooke, in order to see what he could learn from the Americans and possibly make some quick cash. Over time, Horse noticed that the American soldiers were fond of turtles, which they often made into a delicious soup or stew, so he decided to find a couple of the reptiles and sell them to the fort‚Äôs quartermaster. The quartermaster gave the young man a nice price for a pair of turtles, which turned into a daily occurrence ‚Äì Horse would show up with exactly two turtles daily. After a few days the fort‚Äôs cook noticed that there were only two turtles in the pen at any given time, which quickly led to the realization that the young black Seminole was selling the soldiers the same two turtles every day! Instead of being angry, the soldiers were actually amused and impressed with Horse‚Äôs guile and fortitude. The daring and reckless attitude that Horse employed in his deception of the soldiers at Fort Brooke is what later helped propel him to war-chief during the Second Seminole War.The daring and reckless attitude that Horse employed in his deception of the soldiers at Fort Brooke is what later helped propel him to war-chief during the Second Seminole War.One final Indian leader worth mentioning here was not a Seminole, but a Cherokee ‚Äì John Ross (1790-1866). John Ross was only marginally Cherokee, genetically speaking, as his father was a Scottish trader and his mother was a quarter Cherokee. Despite being considerably more white than Indian, Ross served as chief of the Cherokee from 1819-1826. By all accounts Ross was a thoughtful, intelligent, and erudite man who was fluent in both English and Cherokee and was responsible for writing the Cherokee nation‚Äôs constitution. Ross experienced the plight of Indian removal first hand during the 1830s when his people were forced to take the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory. He also faced Indian removal during the course of the Second Seminole War when he worked as an intermediary between the United States government and the Seminoles in order to try to reach a peaceful resolution to the conflict.Walker, Dwayne (2015-11-14). The Wild Wild West In The Deep South: The Second Seminole War (Native American History Book 2) (Kindle Locations 271-285).  . Kindle Edition.Excerpt 2:I write this from my sick room. Five days since, I was attacked with the dysentery again; and the Dr. cannot, as yet, control the movements of my bowels. I am writing this letter, supposing it may be the last one I shall write you. For I cannot conceal from myself that I am pretty sick. I have though much of dying lately, since my sickness.Lieutenant Smith survived that particular bout of illness, but hundreds of soldiers suffered from illnesses that left many incapacitated and scores dead. The deeper the Americans went into the Everglades in search of the Seminoles they found out that the Indians were not their only enemies. Diseases such as dysentery and especially malaria awaited to kill those who had little experience with such things and the Everglades are also home to a host of poisonous snakes and insects that many Americans soldiers found out could be just as harmful as a Seminole warrior.Finally, the U.S. forces resorted to tactics that had been used before the Second Seminole War and afterwards ‚Äì the targeting of civilian populations.As the Seminole guerilla raids continued, General Zachary Taylor and later General William Worth embarked on an aggressive counter-insurgency campaign that was directed at eliminating the Seminoles‚Äô sources of food and shelter. The American forces burned Seminole fields and villages and captured men, women, and children by the hundreds and put them in camps and prisons to await removal to Indian Territory. The counter-insurgency tactics employed by the U.S. army were brutal, but ultimately successful as John Horse surrendered in the summer of 1838. After a stint in a military prison, the black Seminole leader was then deported to Indian Territory. With Osceola and John Horse out of the picture the Second Seminole War was all but over, although a few bitter and brave warriors kept fighting.The Caloosahatchee MassacreOver the course of the Second Seminole War there were many massacres and atrocities committed by both sides, but a notable massacre perpetrated by the Seminoles renewed the American vigor to prosecute the war. In 1839, with the war largely contained to the Everglades and the surrounding region, Americans‚Äô and even Floridians‚Äô taste for the war was greatly diminished. 1839 may have been a good time for the Seminoles to approach the Americans with a new deal, but then the Caloosahatchee Massacre took place.Walker, Dwayne (2015-11-14). The Wild Wild West In The Deep South: The Second Seminole War (Native American History Book 2) (Kindle Locations 551-569).  . Kindle Edition.As shown by the above excerpt, and as mentioned elsewhere in this review, professional editing will may improve the overall quality and legibility of The Wild Wild West in the Deep South. Specifically, I am noting the misspelling of the word ‚Äòthought‚Äô near the end of the first paragraph in excerpt 2. Still, despite the occasional typo and missing comma, I found this book exceptionally interesting. So much so, in fact, that I had difficulty in tearing myself away from it even to jot a note here and there.Despite that difficulty, I did Google Apalachua to learn about the city and about the county in Florida. It is not often that a writer so stimulates my intellect that I do so. Also, I checked a suspect word that I felt was clearly wrong, only to learn that there is such a word as manumitted and what it signifies. I will avoid defining that word here, just to see how many readers look it up the definition online.My overall assessment of this nonfiction book? Despite the editing snafus, I am rating it as a Four Star, must-read for any historian or person interest in American History or the battle between New World aboriginal people and those who emigrated from Europe.One additional note:America and the world are currently at a crossroads in the battle between civilization and a small percentage of peoples comprised from another culture. It is imperative that we not repeat the atrocities mentioned regarding how the settlers and frontiersmen took out their vengeance even against Indians who were not involved in combating the new Americans. We must unite against evil, but let us not be also guilty of harming innocent members of other cultures.For this reason, I am convinced there are valuable insights provided within this book that I hope will not go undetected by others reading this interesting history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G755H4U6JQCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0181M1V74#wasThisHelpful","R2G755H4U6JQCN","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently started feeding my Egyptian-born Yorkie, Buddy, EUKANUBA Adult Hearty Stew with Beef and Vegetables in Gravy Canned Dog Food which he absolutely loves. The problem with that is the price, but, if fed on a 50-50 basis with a good dry food, the cost can be justified.Thus, when I found this Senior Maintenance Dog Food available, I though, perfect solution for my 12-year-old best friend.Well, if Buddy could talk he might give me a gruff, ""Not so fast bucko! This is okay, but the canned food tastes lots better."" I say this because, Buddy will eat this dry food after cleaning up his dish of the canned, he seems to slightly prefer another brand of dry food.Still, this variety produced under license from Iams seems to be a healthier food with, to my nose, a more inviting aroma than the other brand. The small chunks are a perfect size, it seems, so I intend to wean Buddy from the other and feed him Eukanuba, dry and canned, over the coming year. Well, unless he shows signs of illness or outright refusal, that is. At 12, one cannot be too careful.That reminds me, one of his sons, back in Egypt, died a couple days ago. My wife and I suspect his nutrition was less than optimum, but purchasing American-manufactured pet food over there is much more difficult, and far costlier, than here. I'd be delighted to find Eukanuba Senior Maintenance Dog Food available for just $2.00 a pound in Cairo, but, like many, I admit to be a little hesitant Stateside.The only justification I have to pay such a cost, though, is Buddy's health. For me, that is plenty..I recently started feeding my Egyptian-born Yorkie, Buddy, EUKANUBA Adult Hearty Stew with Beef and Vegetables in Gravy Canned Dog Food which he absolutely loves. The problem with that is the price, but, if fed on a 50-50 basis with a good dry food, the cost can be justified.Thus, when I found this Senior Maintenance Dog Food available, I though, perfect solution for my 12-year-old best friend.Well, if Buddy could talk he might give me a gruff, ""Not so fast bucko! This is okay, but the canned food tastes lots better."" I say this because, Buddy will eat this dry food after cleaning up his dish of the canned, he seems to slightly prefer another brand of dry food.Still, this variety produced under license from Iams seems to be a healthier food with, to my nose, a more inviting aroma than the other brand. The small chunks are a perfect size, it seems, so I intend to wean Buddy from the other and feed him Eukanuba, dry and canned, over the coming year. Well, unless he shows signs of illness or outright refusal, that is. At 12, one cannot be too careful.That reminds me, one of his sons, back in Egypt, died a couple days ago. My wife and I suspect his nutrition was less than optimum, but purchasing American-manufactured pet food over there is much more difficult, and far costlier, than here.

"Length: Print, 426 pages; Audible audiobook, 10 hours 55 minutes.Feel free to leave a comment at the end of the review or to search my profile for more good books or my email contact information.This Action-Adventure fiction is targeted to people who love a good story that ties in elements of ancient history with modern technological suspense and political intrigue. It is part of a series referred to as the NUMA Files.The setting and technique used as a foundation for this story is not so different from a series I recently have reviewed by author Inge H. Borg, in that the prologue is set in ancient Egypt (17th year in the reign of Akhenaten) and then leaps forward to present day. Unlike Borg‚Äôs storyline, though, the reference to Ancient Egypt is a mere prologue, contrasting greatly from the book Khamsin. Other differences would be that Pharaoh‚Äôs Secret consolidates the story into one book and has less of a romance bent to it than do Borg‚Äôs sequels to Khamsin.Early on in the book there is also a brief description of interest to folks interested in the brief period during Napolean‚Äôs expedition to Egypt‚Äôs Mediterranean Coast that helps flavor the story.Despite the general similarities, Cussler‚Äôs work, as well as Borg‚Äôs, makes for a delightful immersion, provided you are able to suspend disbelief.What was the Amazon Rank on the date this review was published? 256.Is this a book that I can read without having to read others first? Yes, but reading the other books remains an interesting endeavor.Are there other books by this author that might also be helpful? Yes, this can be read without first reading any of the other books in the series.Are there a lot of typos/misspellings, grammatical errors or other editing failures? This is professionally edited.Is it a quick, easy read and is the writer enthusiastic in his/her approach? This would be more of a curl up in bed or in one‚Äôs recliner. At 426 pages, there is ample time for character development and for bringing several related stories together in the typical Cussler manner.What sort of language does this writer use to amplify the points made? General spoken English, even among the Egyptians portrayed. It is interesting to note, the harshest cussing in this book is one occasion in which the d-word is used, and a few uses of the h-word. Surprisingly, I did not come across a single f-bomb. I say surprising, because I've not read or listened to a Cussler novel in several years.My biggest pleasure or disappointment was an error at the beginning of Chapter 13. Reference is made to the, ‚ÄúWhite Desert of Egypt, seven miles west of the Pyramids 1130 hours‚Äù.- Cussler, Clive; Brown, Graham (2015-11-17). The Pharaoh's Secret (NUMA Files series) (p. 89). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.My difficulty with this stems from my several years working and living in Egypt. At least thrice weekly I drove through the area mentioned and, although this was indeed once desert, it has been increasingly developed and, alas, for the last decade, has not been desert. I mention this not as a severe flaw. Rather, I just want to show that suspending my disbelief at this point was challenged. I did get over it and was able to kick back and enjoy an otherwise terrific yarn set in one of my favorite genres.At the same time, the story relates a determination for a comeback by the nucleus of the foundation, or supporters, of the previous Mubarak regime. In that this is entirely logical and may indeed be the critical factor in turning back the recent Arab Spring in Egypt, it is not quite so difficult to suspend that disbelief. Having so stated, though, the premise surrounding their methods is a bit far-fetched. Note: I will not disclose here because I don‚Äôt want to spoil the story upon which that is so key to this story.The below excerpt relates a key point in the novel that explains more about the psyche of a villain and his determination to win in this diabolical contest between east and west.EXCERPT:‚ÄúA report came in from Malta,‚Äù Shakir said. ‚ÄúHagen and two members of your handpicked team were tasked with eliminating the Americans. One of them was killed, Hagen was captured and one escaped. I‚Äôm sure you understand why it is imperative that none of our operatives be captured.‚Äù‚ÄúOf course I do,‚Äù Hassan replied. ‚ÄúFor that reason, I sent‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúYou sent a candidate who failed me,‚Äù Shakir boomed. ‚ÄúOne who I was led to believe had died in the desert three days ago.‚Äù‚ÄúI never suggested he was dead.‚Äù‚ÄúYou kept his survival from me,‚Äù Shakir said. ‚ÄúOne and the same transgression.‚Äù‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Hassan insisted. ‚ÄúHe survived. You didn‚Äôt inquire. I took it upon myself to execute your offer, which was that any of those who made it back to the checkpoint would be given another chance.‚ÄùShakir despised having his own words used against him. ‚ÄúExcept that it‚Äôs not possible for anyone to have survived the march back to the checkpoint. Not thirty miles, across the desert, in the blazing sun, without any water or shade. Not after weeks of draining competition with little sleep.‚Äù‚ÄúI tell you, he made it,‚Äù Hassan said. ‚ÄúAnd without help. Look at his face. Look at his hands. He burrowed into the sand when he thought he was going to die. He hid there until dusk. Then dug his way out and continued on.‚ÄùShakir had seen the scars. Smart, he thought. Resourceful. ‚ÄúWhy wasn‚Äôt this reported by the men?‚Äù‚ÄúThe checkpoint was deserted when he arrived,‚Äù Hassan insisted. ‚ÄúThe men had left assuming, like you, that no one would live to finish the trek. Number four broke in and made contact with me. Seeing his strength and determination, I decided he would be the perfect choice to watch our own men. He was there without their knowledge. Should they falter, his orders were to eliminate them and keep us from being exposed.‚ÄùShakir was the unquestioned leader of Osiris, but he wasn‚Äôt afraid to admit his mistakes. If Hassan was telling the truth, then number four was indeed the one candidate worthy of being honored with a position‚Äî and, just as important, a name.Ordering Hassan to keep silent, Shakir unmuted the satellite link and questioned number four. The answers were close enough without being identical. Shakir felt he was hearing the truth, as opposed to a practiced story.He glanced at the guards behind Hassan. ‚ÄúLet him up.‚Äù The guards pulled back and Hassan stood. Shakir turned to number four.‚ÄúLet me tell you a story,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúWhen I was a child, my family lived on the outskirts of Cairo. My father scavenged metal from the trash heaps to sell. That is how we survived. One day, a large scorpion came into our house. It stung me. I was about to smash it with a brick when my father stayed my hand.‚ÄúHe said he would teach me a lesson. So we put the scorpion in a jar and tried to drown it, first with cold water and then with hot. Then we left it out in the sun, beneath the clear glass, for days. Then we poured rubbing alcohol over it. It tried to swim but couldn‚Äôt and eventually settled to the bottom. The next day, we drained the alcohol and dumped the scorpion out onto the dirt beside our house. Not only was it still alive, it immediately turned to attack us. Before it could get me, my father flicked it into the distance with a broom. The scorpion is our brother, he said to me. Stubborn, poisonous and hard to kill. The scorpion is noble.On-screen, number four nodded slightly.‚ÄúYou‚Äôve proved your worth,‚Äù Shakir said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of us now. A brother. Your code name shall be Scorpion for you have proven to be stubborn, hard to kill and, yes, even noble. You did not beg me for mercy in the desert. You did not give in to fear. For this, I commend you.‚ÄùOn-screen, the man with the newly bestowed title bowed his head.‚ÄúWear those scars proudly,‚Äù Shakir said.‚ÄúI shall.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat are your orders?‚Äù Hassan asked, trying to get back into the conversation but mostly just thankful to be alive.‚ÄúThey remain as before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGet the artifacts before they‚Äôre made public and erase all record of them within the museum. This time, you will go and supervise personally.‚ÄùCussler, Clive; Brown, Graham (2015-11-17). The Pharaoh's Secret (NUMA Files series) (pp. 155-157). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.Critics beware: On two occasions, the author commits one of Elmore Leonard‚Äôs pet peeve number six: never use the phrase ‚Äúall hell broke loose.‚ÄùBottom line: Despite some fanciful stretches, this is an enjoyable intrigue of politics and secrecy that should keep many readers up late in night. I, at least, had great difficulty in stopping at the end of any chapter. In part, because these chapters are quite short and each ends on a note that had me only too eager to flip the page for just a little look-see as to what was about to happen next. This is probably the fastest I‚Äôve ever raced through a 400-page book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLT1JIPFO7N8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZNRO#wasThisHelpful","RJLT1JIPFO7N8","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: Print, 254 pages; not yet available in audio format at Audible.Feel free to leave a comment at the end of this review.Amazon Kindle Sales Rank when this review was posted: 180.This nonfiction history of the Indian Wars is a terrific overview for each of the more significant campaign exerted against the various groupings of aboriginal peoples of what would become the United States.Written in standard English, this is clearly intended as an objective discussion of the general causes of each military campaign.Although some detail is evident regarding the differing attitudes by the contestants, in just 254 pages it is impossible to even mention a number of the significant skirmishes and battles. Although I'd have preferred much more depth to the main battles and at least some mention of the lesser fights that occurred during each campaign, this was a good summary that can foster a great curiosity among those who do give this work a once over.But, there is far more worthwhile reading than one might expect from a text of only 254 pages.

"Length: Print, 50 pages; not yet available at Audible.Please feel free to leave a comment below and to let me know if this review helps you decide whether to buy The Last Level Project.Amazon Kindle Sales Rank when this review was posted: 102 free.This nonfiction how-to booklet is focused on informing people on a model for setting up a network. It differs from other similar books on networking and includes a link to a free eCourse to further detail the methods touched upon in this introduction.Unlike most of his other guides, this booklet is absent any f-bombs and only has two cuss words, one each of sh&$ and da@?. For a Buck Flogging book, this has to be some sort of record.But, trust me, absence of swearing does not mean his brand of humor is lacking. He eloquently, and with only one very minor editing snafu, presents a solid case for a method he claims can help many people succeed more effortlessly than is generally believed.Of course, there are many questions remaining to be answered before I am persuaded to go hog wild into networking, but, as will many readers, I have signed up for his eCourse.Insofar as the quality of writing and editing, though, this is an extremely interesting and intriguing booklet that I purchased while it is free.EXCERPT: if you're still reading this review, I'm thinking you're unfamiliar with Matt Stone's writing style. His style and flow are a hybrid of sarcasm and Andrew Carnegie. Sometimes inspirational and sometimes raucous but always more fun to read than anything even your most interesting professor ever lectured you on in class. Stone (or Buck Flogging) just plain knows how to communicate.What is network marketing? Network marketing is a system in which independent ‚Äúdistributors‚Äù are compensated by a company to sell a product or line of products. That part of it makes it identical to the traditional sales rep type model that many companies follow and that everyone is familiar with. With network marketing however, the real money for a distributor is not in selling retail products, but in signing up other distributors who sign up more distributors who sign up more distributors. This enables the distributor at the top to earn a commission for every product sold by hundreds, thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of other people.It‚Äôs pretty ingenious really. A company creates products and then, without having to provide much training or take on any financial risk, a massive, viral distribution network forms over time. The company only pays these sales distributors when a sale is made. They don‚Äôt have to worry about ‚Äúemployees‚Äù and tons of overhead and other things.A massive, viral distribution network forms because when one person signs up two distributors, and those two distributors do the same, and so on, you see logarithmic growth. 1 gets 2, those 2 get 4, those 4 get 8, those 8 get 16, those 16 get 32, those 32 get 64, those 64 get 128, those 128 get 256, and before you know it there are hundreds of thousands of distributors out there buying and selling products and trying to make a buck.What‚Äôs even more ingenious about it is that, unlike with typical storefront items, which are bought and sold because people are seeking to use those products, network marketing adds a secondary motivation to buy products: making money.That‚Äôs right. Networking marketing uses people‚Äôs desire to make money, and make that money from home no less (a higher echelon of financial freedom), as a motivating force to sell their products.You can make money in network marketing by running around telling everybody how awesome the products are no doubt. And you will inevitably do some of that once you become educated about the company‚Äôs products. But that‚Äôs hard work, you have to be skilled to do it effectively, the products are usually less than exceptional which makes selling them harder, you‚Äôll be exchanging hours of your time for dollars, and you‚Äôre unlikely to actually achieve last level status and truly passive income.It‚Äôs best to think of network marketing as a slightly bizarre way to get people to buy products. Most of the products are bought by distributors that are forced to buy a certain amount each month in order to receive commissions. The amount of products bought usually far exceeds what any normal person would actually want or need. The price of those products is usually priced way above the true market value of those products as well, but none of that matters. Distributors buy however much they need to perpetuate their business. Extra is typically given away to friends and family...The foregoing review and the excerpt above should not be construed as an endorsement of his proposal. Each reader must exercise due diligence. But, I love this book and am rating it as a five star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN6JRCKBSJJS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B018099D50#wasThisHelpful","RN6JRCKBSJJS6","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fate of the UnionLength: Print, 320 pages, Audible, 8 hours 21 minutes.Amazon Kindle Sales Rank when this review was posted: 122.This is an intriguing fictional political suspense novel, the second in a series featuring Joe Reeder and Patti Rogers.When you read that it is a political suspense novel, you can probably figure that the story arc is going to include a hard-edged military anti-establishment character and that the language will be seedy, (what my mother always referred to as mule skinner language). If the f-bomb annoys you, look for a different story.Although this stereotype has been around in print for a couple generations, it seems it will last for much longer. Certainly, it still works with this PI, as brought to life in this great story by Max Allan Collins and Matthew V. Clemens.Although this is a series, I did not read the first book and don't believe I enjoyed this story any the less. Also, there is no cliffhanger ending, although there clearly we are left aware that follow on work related the this story is coming, someday.Note: I discovered this book through Audible and got into it so fully, I added the Kindle version a short while ago. What astounds me most is that until this book, I was not aware of Max Allan Collins, despite his great success with Private Eye books, and a score of TV credits that includes Mike Hammer, CSI, etc.EXCERPT: The below excerpt should provide a good feel for the pace and flow of this story:‚ÄúThen . . . then we showed up.‚Äù""If he recognized me as we drove past‚Äîthis was likely our blond perp‚Äîhe knew he‚Äôd scored a bonus round. If you and I hadn‚Äôt chatted a while in the car, we‚Äôd have already been inside when he hit the detonator.‚Äù""We . . . we‚Äôd have been . . . scattered all over this parking lot . . . with the rest of the debris.‚ÄùSirens sang their distant song. This was the boonies, but somebody had seen the flames rising into the sky, and/ or heard the big boom.Their breathing slowing, the air clearing some, the smoke on its upward trajectory, the two got up and had a look at their rescued corpse. Only the figure‚Äôs back was charred black, the front of him appearing relatively normal‚Äîhis expression almost serene, as if he‚Äôd slept through the other side of him getting cooked.""Dead before the explosion,‚Äù Rogers said.Reeder pointed out the two punctures in the blackened back of his neck‚Äîbarely visible but the indentations were there, all right.""Double-tapped,‚Äù Rogers said.Reeder nodded and looked back toward the trees on the other side of which was the service road. Just then flames illuminated something over that way, and glass winked and blinked at him.A sniper scope.""Gun!‚Äù he said, and then came the muzzle flash.They both hit the snowy cement, sending up puffs of white, then each scrambled around behind the car, Reeder around front, Rogers around back. The shooter had seen that action through his scope, because two more rounds slammed into the car, and then another took the back left tire, which hissed as if a villain had come on stage, and hadn‚Äôt he?Each sat with their backs to the passenger side of the Fusion. Breathing hard again, Reeder said, ‚ÄúYou got extra magazines?‚Äù""Yeah. Two.‚Äù ‚Äú""Good. Keep him busy.‚Äù""What do you mean, keep him busy?‚Äù""Do it.‚Äù From around the rear of the car, Rogers threw shots into the line of trees. She had a handgun and the shooter had a rifle and the advantage of firepower and distance were his. But she kept it up, the sharp cracks of her Glock rising over the rumbling murmur of the burning buildings.She was shooting as Reeder took off, very low, right toward the facing fires, running between them and skirting around the building at left and staying parallel to it. He couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he‚Äôd run on snow. He was trying to be careful in the dark, trying not to trip over any chunks of debris, and was grateful for the minimal moonlight and even fire glow, assuming it didn‚Äôt give him away.As he reached where the building ended and concrete parking lot yawned to a strip of snowy landscape with the line of trees waiting, he climbed out of his Burberry and left it behind, his dark suit better suited for his purpose.With the night alternating pops of the Glock and resonant reports from the rifle, Reeder headed over to where the service road curved around behind the buildings, the line of trees ending where that curve began. As the shooter exchanged shots with Rogers, the rifle‚Äôs scope would not be swung way the hell over here. Or so Reeder told himself as he kept very low on the asphalt, as low as possible and still run.Any other Tuesday night, this industrial park would be all but silent. An occasional car would thrum by, the odd owl might hoot, tree leaves might rustle with wind; but tonight was a cacophony of howling flames, screaming sirens, crunching snow, all punctuated by the bellows of his own labored breathing.Overall, despite the thin premise of the story so reliant on a worn stereotype, this is a terrific story worth reading, hearing, or reading and hearing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQ4RGEBSBE81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF4B4D2#wasThisHelpful","R2MQ4RGEBSBE81","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Egyptian-born and raised Yorkshire Terrier, Buddy, loves this stew. Even I am tempted to give it a try.The large chunks of chicken and beef (liver and meat), immersed is a thick, creamy gravy, looks to be a passable stew for people.The cost, at just over $1.60 per can is a bit rich for my budget, if I depended on it as the only source of food for my 12-year-old dog. If it is augmented on a 50-50 basis, though, with dry food, I will use about half a can per day. Still not cheap, but manageable.I am rating it only four stars because of the price and because it is 8.5 percent protein. I would expect more protein from a meaty dish such as a stew.Overall, since Buddy loves this and since I trust what I see, and Eukxanuba, that's good enough for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BB14IQJT80E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VJ1G66#wasThisHelpful","R1BB14IQJT80E7","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now there will not always be the perfect strategy that you can always rely on the internet and YouTube changes rapidly and you have to adapt to that change by keeping up to date with your field, the easiest thing to do however is to start doing things you think will work on impulse without considering them in relation to your principles. So, a topical case study. I mentioned before we have a forum over at WebMoneyTutor.com that has a very active section devoted to YouTube. A member of the forum was highly concerned that he had ‚Äòtried everything‚Äô and yet his visibility was low, his channel was barely growing at all and he hadn‚Äôt had a video that peaked over 1000 views. His Channel was a Gaming Commentary Channel. To be fair to this member he had tried a lot of things, he was very ‚Äòbusy‚Äô. He was doing lots of sporadic activities that on paper sounded like good ideas, endlessly requesting for collaborations with big Channels. Endless spamming of his videos on semi-relevant forums and Facebook groups. He was definitely not lacking on the ‚Äòeffort‚Äô front but as myself and a few other forum members began to investigate his Channel and see what he was missing we realised straight away he was just stabbing around in the dark. He had no clear strategy set-up and was doing lots of activities that had no direction, nor did he even understand why he was doing some of them. So we went back to square one, made him look at those basic principles and begin using methodologies that actually had a clearly defined point.Silver, Daniel (2015-01-20).

Yes, this is stand alone, although the author does give a link to another title for just a dollar.Are there other books by this author that might also be helpful? Possibly, but they would need to be more thorough than this.Are there a lot of typos/misspellings, grammatical errors or other editing failures? I saw none.Is it a quick, easy read and is the writer enthusiastic in his/her approach? It is quick, easy, but not likely a worthy pursuit of your time.What sort of language does this writer use to amplify the points made? English language. No swear words that I recall.This booklet, or pamphlet, really, is too brief to warrant an excerpt. Further, an excerpt might be seen as conveying too large a percentage of the total content.My biggest disappointment was that, unless I badly misunderstood the title, the description, or the material I read, YouTube Video SEO: Rankings And Optimization Guidebook simply did not deliver on its purported objectives.Aside from that major snafu, and the brevity of this 'guide,' the writer does write in an engaging style. If the writer would now pen a real book on the topic, I would be first in line to try it.The one fact I am most pleased by is that I borrowed this through my Kindle Unlimited account and, therefore, saved some coins.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJNAQDRLH1FKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPZN3OQ#wasThisHelpful","RJNAQDRLH1FKG","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: 67 pages.Feel free to leave a comment at the end of the review or to search my profile for more good books or my email contact information.This nonfiction book is unique in that it is a summary and analysis of a debut novel. As such, it provides a bit more depth in terms of what one might expect from a review.What was the Amazon Rank on the date this review was published? 285,202.I bought this book for reasons exceeding the customary buyer. I wanted first to understand why someone would post a review for sale, especially for $2.99. Secondly, I wanted to understand another, more professional perspective on writing reviews. I mean, am I missing an opportunity to be genuinely helpful with my reviews and, just as important, am I missing an opportunity to turn a hobby into a revenue producer.Further, what might I do different if I were to explore the financial option?Yes, one could read this book without reading another, but, that might be missing the full value, at least insofar as I am concerned. So, of course, using my Kindle Unlimited account, I got the actual book, My Sister‚Äôs Grave, in  Kindle format with audio. If I do enjoy it as much as I expect, I will go ahead and purchase the book by Robert Dugoni. Which, I hasten to note, makes for a somewhat costly excursion to buy the debut novel that is the subject of this analysis and summary, (buying the summary plus buying the book plus buying the audio version is what I am meaning, is a good deal more costly than simply buying Dugoni‚Äôs original book.I discovered no typos, misspellings or grammatical errors in this brief work.Is it a quick, easy read and is the writer enthusiastic in his/her approach? This is an easy, fast, thought-provoking read, worth my time and, for my purposes, cash outlay. It is written in straight forward English with no numor.This excerpt not only gives a feel for the tempo and pace of the summary and analysis of My Sister‚Äôs Grave, it is an interesting, intriguing, synopsis of what special value can be inserted into a top notch book review:BOOK REVIEW Robert Dugoni‚Äôs My Sister‚Äôs Grave, follows Tracy Crosswhite as she puts to rest the case of her sister‚Äôs disappearance some twenty years after the fact. Through her efforts, the improper conviction of Edmund House is overturned and appropriate justice enacted upon the person who had abducted, raped and killed Sarah Crosswhite, Tracy‚Äôs sister, in the early 1990s. Along the way, the small town of Cedar Grove, Washington, is afforded final closure, and Tracy is able to set aside a decades-long obsession and live in the present once again.As with any work, My Sister‚Äôs Grave suffers problems. One that attracts particular attention is inconsistency within the work. For example, at one point, Tracy remarks on not being able to exercise sufficiently well to overcome the problems of the working police diet. Later in the novel, she explicitly notes working out ‚Äúfour times a week,‚Äù a disjunction that suggests authorial or editorial inattention. Also, the unfortunate coincidence of George Bovine‚Äôs name and racial identity (as well as his interaction with some dogs) and the comment that stereotypes are usually true come off as insensitive choices on the part of the author, not a mark in his favor.That said, there is much to recommend the novel. It is an easy read, presenting little in the way of challenge for a general audience and thereby facilitating the entry of the text into the prevailing consciousness of mainstream readership. Chapters are short, making the book easier to read in odd moments of free time, and the unresolved endings of most chapters promote continued engagement with the work. The shift late in the text serves to distance the work just enough from the tropes of the genre to defy a blatantly obvious supposition, helping to draw the reader along. In addition, narration of action is tight, and many of the secondary characters are admirably fleshed-out; they feel consonant with the setting and plot, which does much to enhance the literary effect Robert Dugoni‚Äôs 2014 novel, My Sister‚Äôs Grave, produces.Book*Sense (2014-11-05). My Sister's Grave: by Robert Dugoni | Summary & Analysis (Kindle Locations 150-164).  . Kindle Edition.If you had told me that I would, essentially, post a review of what amounts to another review, I would have chuckled and scoffed at such a moronic thought. Then again, in this world, anything and everything is beginning to look to be reasonably possible. What‚Äôs more, I actually enjoyed the analysis of the major character and found more value than I honestly expected to find.Still, paying $2.99 to read a review, even a good review that includes psycho analysis such as this work does, might exceed the disposable income of many folks. For my purposes, though, it was worth a couple of dollars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17N4FLXS19DI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBAOYR4#wasThisHelpful","R17N4FLXS19DI1","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: Print, 196 pages; Audio, 2 hours 27 minutes.To give you a hint as to how I value this work of history, while preparing to post this review I noticed it is available as an audio book at Audible. Consequently, I purchased an audio version so I can be reminded, from time to time, of the value of good, honest reporting.Feel free to leave a comment at the end of the review or to search my profile for more good books or my email contact information.Amazon Kindle Sales Rank at the time this review was posted: 4,450.NOTE: Because this work is of such vital interest for so many reasons, I am including two brief excerpts.Possibly the greatest value of this book consists of the reprinting of the initial reports so one can experience the story as if it were taking place these days. The included copies of print photos and newspaper headlines is immensely helpful.In this stunning reminder of a time now referred to as Yellow Journalism, huge errors, even outright fabrications, were printed in the major newspapers regarding the Titanic accident: [Excerpt 1]The New York World wasn‚Äôt the only newspaper to run with the errors mixed with the conjured and fabricated news stories.The Washington Post reported in a banner headline which reached the full width of its front page: ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äôs 1,470 Passengers Are Now Being Transferred in Lifeboats to Cunard Liner‚Äù.The Christian Science Monitor also ran with the story that all passengers were safe and had been transferred to another ship while the Titanic was under tow.An English newspaper reported that the Titanic would have to be towed back to Britain as there were no shipyards in America large enough to work on the Titanic.The New York World printed even more details about the Titanic, reporting that the ship‚Äôs bow had been ‚ÄúCrumpled by Collision with Iceberg‚Äù.Not only witness testimony by the crew at the official inquiries on both sides of the Atlantic revealed that the ship had not hit the iceberg head-on but had brushed by it on the starboard side with an underwater protrusion ripping open the hull like a can opener.The New York World staff must have been in a real frenzy conjuring up more details. The newspaper reported that the Allan Liner Virginian was towing the Titanic, which was in ‚Äòbad shape‚Äô to Halifax.The many notable passengers were reported by the New York World to have been transferred from the Titanic to the Carpathia and the Parisian. In reality, the Carpathia actually did pick up all of the survivors while the Parisian didn‚Äôt find anyone alive.The London Daily Mail also reported in early coverage that ‚ÄúNO LIVES LOST. COLLISION WITH AN ICEBERG. 2,358 LIVES IN PERIL. RUSH OF LINERS TO THE RESCUE. ALL PASSENGERSRossignol, Ken (2012-03-27). Titanic 1912: The original news reporting of the sinking of the Titanic (pp. 5-6).  . Kindle Edition.Titanic 1912 is a reminder, regardless of the contempt one might have for modern media, that there was a time when sloppy journalism (and propaganda and even outright lies to sell newspapers) were the rule, rather than the exception.One learns first hand the just how critical it is that one get the facts straight, as regards the early accounts, since proven false and, even, as fabrications conjured up by the writers of the day provided false hope to people following the most important disaster of the lives up to that point in time.There are a few typos, but not a great number. This is pretty well written and edited and is a quick, interesting read that is essential for historians and useful to members of present day media.What sort of language does this writer use to amplify the points made? Clean, everyday, spoken, English.As the below excerpt shows, greed is not restricted to present day society: [Excerpt 2]Chapter Sixteen ‚Äì Shut Up, Big Money!The controversy over whether or not the news of the Titanic disaster was intentionally held back as a result of payoffs of the New York Times to Marconi officials was fully examined by a competitor of the Times, the New York Herald.New York Herald, April 21, 1912, page 1:'Keep Your Mouth Shut; Big Money for You,' Was Message to Hide NewsHold Story for 'Four Figures,' Marconi Official Also Warned the Carpathia Operator,While Anxious World Waited Details of Disaster. While the world was waiting three days for information concerning the fate of the Titanic, for part of the time at least, details concerning the disaster were being withheld by the wireless operator of the steamship Carpathia under specific orders from T. W. Sammis, chief engineer of the Marconi Wireless Company of America, who had arranged the sale of the story.This was admitted yesterday by Mr. Sammis, who defended his action. He said he was justified for getting for the wireless operators the largest amount he could for the details of the sinking of the ship, the rescue of the passengers and the other information the world had waited for.Rossignol, Ken (2012-03-27). Titanic 1912: The original news reporting of the sinking of the Titanic (pp. 69-70).  . Kindle Edition.All in all, Titanic 1912 is a valuable not merely for the quality of writing and editing. It is a valuable resource for historians and for those with occupations related to journalism and public relations. As such, I enthusiastically rate this as a Five Star history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YYEB8ZCJEI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PDKGL8#wasThisHelpful","R5YYEB8ZCJEI0","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This writer is similar to Elmore Leonard in tempo and language, albeit, Crais is more circumspect than Leonard. There, of course, are f-bombs sprinkled in the colorful language.The best part about this novel is the pace and tone. Description of the scenes and characters is sufficient to paint a picture that the reader can still color according to his/her desires and imagination. This is what I find most appealing in a good novel.Also, as in most any good, modern novel, there is character development that is more than mere filler material. There probably would be more, except this is a series of novels.Speaking of a series, despite this being one story within a series, I found it a fun read despite never having read any other of the stories. It is not necessary to read the others, but I certainly will now go back and order the other titles in audio book format through Audible.That reminds me, although this is a good read, I think audio would be a better way to digest this story, as the pace and flow, built on dialogue, is especially good in spoken word books.The below excerpt should help readers gain a better feel for this can't miss best seller:‚ÄúThe people you work for listen.‚Äù""I‚Äôm home two days, bro. What are you talking about?‚Äù""Stolen ordnance in Echo Park. RPGs and forty-millimeter grenades. Cole‚Äôs trying to find a woman. He thinks she‚Äôs with the dealer.‚ÄùNow Jon was pissed. After thirteen years in the Army, the last six with Delta, Jon Stone had jumped the shark to become a private military contractor. He sold his services and the services of others to various clients, one said other being this very Joe Pike, who, by the way, commanded top dollar, which meant a top commission if Pike let Jon set a contract, which he wouldn‚Äôt, because Pike wasted his time with Elvis Cole, a low-rent peeper without two twenties to wipe his butt.""What the hell, Pike? I don‚Äôt care about Cole and his problems. Tell me you didn‚Äôt pull me away from those women without serious cash on the table.‚Äù""If the woman‚Äôs with him, he probably sells to al-Qaeda.‚ÄùStopped Jon cold. Jon Stone‚Äôs primary client was the United States of America, with most of his work being directed against various terrorist factions and the governments, corporations, and individuals who supported them. Off the books, and deep in the black. When Jon Stone told the French chicks he was a professional warrior, he wasn‚Äôt lying.Jon glanced at his bedroom again. Nothing moved within the black rectangle framed by the doors.""Al-Qaeda.‚ÄùPike nodded.""Listen, so you know, just because some idiot sells this crap doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to terrorists. All-American morons turn grenades into paperweights, and RPGs into lamps.‚Äù""The woman doesn‚Äôt care about morons. She‚Äôs been trying to contact an FTO.‚ÄùFTO.

What are we talking about here, a crazy person, or some kind of anti-American lunatic?‚Äù""They killed her son.‚ÄùAlthough there is a teaser at the end, leading into the next story, this is a solid novel worthy of my time and money, despite a somewhat high price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3CH6CY3DOEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0U6MRU#wasThisHelpful","R2F3CH6CY3DOEW","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Length: 79 pages.Amazon Kindle rank at the time this review was posted: 990,793.This is a remarkably written and edited biography of Old Blood And Guts, George Patton.This quote of Patton, at the lead-in th Chapter 6, speaks volumes:‚ÄúIt is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived.‚Äù ‚ÄìGeorge S. Patton.Before I go further in this review, I just have to comment on one of the video clips.Less than a month ago I chanced upon an interview with a local unsung hero. He came to our local American Legion post on his 60th Anniversary. I snapped a pic of him with the Post Commander and got some of his information to post in the local newspaper. Thereupon learning that he was under the command of Patton, I was so intrigued that I decided to conduct an in-depth interview.That's when I learned he had opted to traverse the last 80 miles, or so, n a Piper Cub enroute to a battle at Minsk. It seemed to Ervin Longnecker a no-brainier - 80 miles in a two-seater Piper Cub or jostling back and forth, up and down, in a convoy troop truck. Little did he then know that his greatest nightmare was yet to come...At the end of the flight, he was ordered to greet none other than General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Longnecker told me, ""I was scared to death, shaking in my boots, certain I was going to make a mistake. Ike told me 'At ease, son, we're at war.""Eisenhower even shook Longnecker's hand to calm the young unsung hero of Little Branford's hand.I included the foregoing after viewing a short video clip in this Interactive Biography of George Patton that, I believe, may include Ervin Longnecker standing before the Supreme Allied Commander. I will show the video to Longnecker to confirm, if possible. Bear in mind, though, Longnecker is now nearly 97 years old.Okay, back to the review...I did not come across any editing snafus - no typos, no spelling errors and none of the mistakes typical of failed proofing or editing.There are a number of quality black and white photographs and video clips, and even at least one full color photo.All considered, possibly because of my own slight personal tie-in, I confess, I believe this is the best interactive volume Charles River Editors has thus far published.Certainly, this book deserves a place in every military historian's Kindle library. I also hope it is included as an audiobook for audible.com in the future.By the way, although Longncker was aware of the slapping incident, he was quick to inform me that all, or certainly the vast majority of soldiers under Patton's command, ""Loved and respected Old Blood and Guts.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J196XTLX6O22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYLG5OI#wasThisHelpful","R3J196XTLX6O22","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: 30 pages.Rank at the time of this review: 158,099.The writing and editing are pretty good. I found one or two typos or misspellings, but nothing too severe, other than a price range of £7,000 to $70,000 which probably was meant to read $7,000 to $70,000. Oh, and right at the beginning the author states, ""The world is literally your oyster."" This error is common, but begs to be corrected. Literal means truly, which implies fact. The correct word to use is figuratively, since, as we all know, the world is not in fact an oyster.I know it sounds like I'm being picky, but a good copy editor would tell the author the same.Aside from the above minor points, although this booklet is well written and certainly a terrific inspiration, it falls short of the implied promise to show people how to live debt-free and stress-free.Having stated that it falls short, though, I do believe it succeeds in inspirational advice to stimulate readers into getting motivated into living an RV lifestyle for long term living.

"Length: 88 pages.I have mixed emotions regarding this interactive biography.On the one hand, it does an excellent job highlighting he great military leader's splendid accomplishments, not the least of which was his becoming the first son of a Congressional Medal of Honor winner to also be so awarded. MacArthur was unquestionably a brave warrior and great strategist.I also appreciated the candid appraisal of the man's blunders during WW II and, especially, at Korea.My misgivings are two-fold:There are more typos and editing snafus in this book than I have seen in almost any other CRE book. A stray 4 and a stray 6 early in the book, and some typos here and there, plus a word missing in the last paragraph of chapter 10: the word ""years"" is missing after 36, making it read 36 after instead of 36 years after...The sloppy editing, though, is not the only concern. The video clips don't seem to properly amplify the points, for me, and, hence, just don't add the value that I expected. Also, the clip of his address to congress seems shorter than intended, but, perhaps I am spoiled by so many other great CRE interactive presentations.I do feel that an opportunity to present the heart and soul of this great leader was missed. On the other hand, I am grateful to CREfor being able to see how the ever growing ego of this leader whose errors came mostly after his prominence seemed to lead him to believe he was invincible.I also want to mention, there are several nice photographs plus on fantastic color picture of MacArthur surrounded by fellow troops on a beachfront.I liked this book, but didn't love it. Not certain why, though, aside from the above mentioned points.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HDGPLOM97JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2WKBOY#wasThisHelpful","R22HDGPLOM97JO","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: 70 pages.This is a fun read. Usually we think of gold diggers being women on the prowl for a rich fool who, let's face it, simply wants a trophy to escort him to parties and country clubs.Of course, there are at least as many men trying to con rich women with their suave, sophisticated accents. Usually, the accents are British, as, for some reason, many women conjure up fantasies pertaining to princes and earls of the British Isles.Edward is the one of the more talented cons you ever shall encounter. But, he is a scoundrel who will have you wishing you could tear his eyes out one moment. The next, you will be guffawing in anticipation of his nerve.The stories were delightful, smooth, and painted quite clearly by the author. I like how she presented this con man with a light touch, not going over the top, so to say. What I mean is that she could have been quite brutal with this fiend. In some manner, I think Inge H. Borg dreamed up a character she wanted to despise. Then, somewhere along the way, she grew attached to his inner soul and could not so easily dispatch him.Edward is clearly the scumbag every woman wants to meet so she can be swept off her feet, but, in the end, they are instead cleaned of their worldly possessions, their honor and their own self respect. And, sometimes, these women, truth be known, are open for yet another Edward to come into their lives.Well written, well edited, with no serious typos or grammatical errors.

"Length: 124 pages.This nonfiction book about Amazon's newest device is well-written and well edited.The only editing snafu I found was at 43 percent through the book, where it is written to go, instead of go to. In other words, the two words are flip-flopped, which is a not uncommon error when a writer is thinking faster than they type. At any rate, his small error is not sufficient to weaken the value of the book.What is confusing however, is the discussion regarding having Alexa read your audiobooks. I own approximately 900 Audible programs. Most are full length books, but many are old time radio plays, and a few are some contemporary productions by Colonial Radio Theatre On the Air. My confusion is, why would I have Alexa read these productions when I've already paid a good some for the professional narrators and voice actors?At first, I was intrigued that Alexa would read my books, but, if Alexa won't read my Kindle books, this feature is unimportant to me. Further, if the speaker won't simply serve as a speaker via Bluetooth to play my audible.com books in the voices I paid for, then Alexa is a minus, in my case.Of course, had I not read this book, I might have purchased an Alexa only to be disappointed, so I am quite pleased to have read this through my kindle Unlimited account.McKinnon writes in a smooth, business English manner.

Sometimes, reading a large volume will nourish my hunger for information, and the civil war is just such a topic. Other times, though, especially while commuting, reading quick histories (or listening to Kindle read them to me) is a nice way to learn, or refresh one‚Äôs memory of that which was previously learned.Having stated that, I want to point out that this book by Charles River Editors is, possibly, the largest page count I have yet read by CRE.Are there other books by this author that might also be helpful? Charles River Editors has more than 1,000 inexpensive books posted at Amazone.com and a few at audible.com, my favorite source for audiobooks since 2002.Are there a lot of typos/misspellings, grammatical errors or other editing failures? I didn‚Äôt detect any.What sort of language does this writer use to amplify the points made? Common, clean, everyday English.Is this better to read, or is it better to listen to? Audio would be nice, but reading is fine.Unlike most other CRE books I‚Äôve read, this is laced with excellent modern photographs and illustrations. I mean, they are not just historical in pics. One in particular is a present-day photo of Grant‚Äôs birthplace. Better yet, the front cover illustration used for the book is among the best Kindle covers I‚Äôve seen. It depicts a battle in progress. Another is of William Tecumseh Sherman‚Äôs boyhood home in Ohio. There also is a photograph showing the location where Stonewall Jackson was shot and one of his tomb. Just as with Grant and Sherman, there is a modern photograph of home that is presently preserved in Arlington National Cemetery.Aside from the above photographs, there are color illustrations that depict the battle plans and troop movements, as well as authentic black and white photographs taken at battlegrounds during and/or after battles.Although this volume is not extensive in its coverage of the war, it is a well-written, well-edited volume that should be in every historian‚Äôs Kindle library. It ranks as one of my favorite CRE books that is not interactive. I would expect that is primarily because the war pre-dated video, obviously. Still, it could benefit with some video clips taken at several of the battlegrounds and shrines that exist today.I do want to note that the legacies of Stonewall and Lee are included, as well as some treatment regarding the post-war lives of the Yankee generals, especially the man who went on to serve as President, the general known as Unconditional Surrender Grant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY28R8MC7NG0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DC8Z80O#wasThisHelpful","RY28R8MC7NG0M","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My family was camping one summer, possibly 1962 or 1963, at Big Bear in California‚Äôs San Bernardino Mountains. While Dad was driving, looking for a campsite I think, we saw a small shop or store with a sign posted. The sign read, as I recall, Closed Until That Catholic Traitor Kennedy is Removed From Office. I recollected Mom‚Äôs shock that somebody could be so hateful.I recall a bit more about Robert. I criticized Mom for becoming a volunteer in his 1968 campaign, teling her, ‚ÄúYou know he‚Äôs just going to get shot.‚Äù Only years later would I come to realize how wrong I was about the country‚Äôs need for RFK and how much we lost by his assassination. While I doubt Sirhan Sirhan had assistance, I wish he had been prevented from so hurting our nation.Ted Kennedy, though, I have many memories of. I know for certain, through a shipmate who‚Äôs uncle was Mayor Bradley in Los Angeles that Ted had chosen not to challenge Carter. Then, news leaked that Carter had told someone that he would kick Kennedy‚Äôs &$$ if Ted entered the race. I phoned my contact and learned that Ted Kennedy was reconsidering. Might have been a nice touch to have included this tidbit in the book, but, probably, nobody would have cared to know.I also was a volunteer in the 1980 campaign for Kennedy. Even worked for a few days with a nephew of his, a 19-year-old named William Kennedy Smith, in New Hampshire. Working in Maine, I even met Ted one weekend, while I was escorting some senior citizens to caucus for him. I was stunned at how much Ted looked like my own father, save for my father being bald and just a little older than Ted Kennedy.Okay, I did include a little of my life into this review. If that bothers you, please accept my apology. Regarding An Interactive Biography of the Kennedy Brothers, though, this is a remarkable, if all too brief, history that young and old should find interesting and educational. With the included video clips, it should also entertain youngsters while roping them into an educational experience.

To name just three: Phonograph; Light Bulb; Moving Pictures.Whether it is the Sioux Ghost Dance, the Sisters Boxing, or the Mock Battle at the 1901 Expo, I am certain kids, and parents, will be enthralled by the video clips in this interactive booklet.I love the Edison Quote at the heading of Chapter 2:‚ÄúOpportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.‚Äù ‚Äì Thomas EdisonIs this a book that I can read without having to read others first?

Yes, a quick tempo that most children should find interesting.Is there humor? Is it wry, laugh-out-loud funny? Is it moronic? A light touch, yes. Humor, as such, no. Still, I cannot help but note the irony in the second paragraph of Chapter 2, in which a vote counting machine was Edison‚Äôs first patentable invention. Of course, I am recollecting the debacle in Florida in the 2000 Presidential Election. Excerpt:In 1869, Thomas Edison was awarded his first patent by the United States government. This meant that nobody else could make the product he had invented. His invention was an electronic way to count votes.  No one wanted to use it.  The only people who could really use it were politicians. But Congressmen didn‚Äôt even want it. They didn‚Äôt trust a machine to record their votes.Charles River Editors (2013-05-16).

A version of English that is a little simpler for youngster to understand than that normally used in everyday English.I found An Interactive Biography of Thomas Edison for Kids to be quite educational and entertaining, even inspirational due to the quotes for the first four chapters.Probably, though, the greatest value derives from the short, stimulating videos; one of which is of the Sioux Ghost Dance. The Ghost Dance was at the time this video appears to have been recorded, was at the height of controversy ‚Äì a time when whites feared attacks and a renewal of the Indian Wars of then recent history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IREWLK2L7EZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUI8TF8#wasThisHelpful","R2IREWLK2L7EZI","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What was the dog‚Äôs name and whatever became of it? Was it paraded as a hero or was its fate celebrated by anybody?A ‚Äì Yes, Laika was a dog owned by a famous German-American scientist interested in promoting animal welfare.B ‚Äì Yes, Laika was a dog from the Soviet Union that Premier Kruschev championed as proof of the superiority of dogs raised in the USSR.C ‚Äì No, a stray dog from Moscow named Laika died in space with little fanfare or concern for what many people regard as man‚Äôs best friend.D ‚Äì No, Laika did not survive the trip but was heralded by both America and by the Soviets as a heroic volunteer in humanity‚Äôs space exploration.For details, you can read the booklet or read the excerpt below, which may be the first time Laika was singled out in print. Air Bud, Lassie, and Rin Tin Tin all would have been disappointed to learn the dog‚Äôs fate‚Ä¶Excerpt:As a stray dog from Moscow, Laika seemed an unusual candidate to make history as the first living thing to orbit around the Earth. At that time, however, nobody was sure what effects space travel might have on the human body, and the Soviets weren‚Äôt confident enough in their launching technology to risk their cosmonauts‚Äô lives. Thus, Laika and two other dogs trained for the Sputnik-2 mission, which included isolating the dogs and forcing them to live in cramped compartments.Laika was the winner, but that didn‚Äôt make her a lucky winner. Unbeknownst to the poor dog, she was given a suicide mission. In 1957, the Soviets had no clue how to de-orbit a spacecraft through reentry into the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, and they had no intention of trying to figure it out for a stray dog. It is still not entirely clear when or how the dog died during the mission; the Soviets later claimed she lived for days, either euthanized with poisoned food or dying when the oxygen onboard ran out, but it‚Äôs now believed she died within hours from an overheated cabin.Charles River Editors (2013-02-06). An Interactive History of the Space Race (Kindle Locations 177-184). Waxkeep Publishing. Kindle Edition.Overall, I believe An Interactive History of the Space Race is a good tool to use by parents and educators alike to foster an interest in history and science. I consider it a good choice for any parent or grandparent to consider as a gift for stocking, figuratively, in a Christmas Stocking. What I mean is, buying a kindle, or having the free Kindle App loaded onto a child‚Äôs smartphone or tablet computer, and then ‚Äògifting‚Äô them a copy of this inexpensive booklet could make for a quality gift that entertains while it educates.Why a smartphone or tablet? The interactive media (video)  works on smartphones or tablet computers, but not on the kindle app available for laptops or desktops. Note: I do not have access to a Microsoft Surface, so perhaps someone who uses a Surface can check to see if it works on one. I have not yet checked to see if the video works on my Kindle Fire HD or on my Paperwhite, but I will check and add my observations as soon as possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZWRPRLYZKFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCPWEHO#wasThisHelpful","R3BZWRPRLYZKFM","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first saw this was available for testing, I declined , because several years ago I bought what was then said to be a state-of-the-art ASUS Desktop Computer.I had so many troubles with that one, I didn't know who to blame, so I blamed ASUS & Microsoft for its BSOD issues.Mind you, that was in Egypt and that was 12 years ago. So, just in case I was missing out on a good opportunity, I discussed the specs for this desktop with my IT guy at work. He thought I was making a big mistake, so I went ahead and ordered it through Amazon Vine,Hey, it is a jewel for its price. Loaded with Windows 10, it seems Microsoft just might be recovering some lost ground.First though, let's discuss the hardware:I took everything out of the box. Hooked up the mouse and keyboard into the USB Ports in the back. Hooked up the HDMI cable to the back. Plugged in the power cable and....Everything worked. I let it install updates and the took the quick tour. Then, I immediately downloaded Google Chrome and made that my default browser, since it is superior to all other browsers, in my opinion.I didn't spend a lot of time testing the DVD player today, but will test it in coming days. Regarding the other hardware:The computer has good speed with the i5 processor.Keyboard, about average. There is a decent spring back feel to the keys, but it doesn't feel as good as most quality keyboards. Also, I'm a little harder on keyboards than many, so I expect keys to break soon with this. Also, the labeling on the keys appears less than optimum - my experience tells me the I'd will wear off quite soon. I will definitely replace this with a better keyboard. I will probably opt for a wireless keyboard similar to the one I bought for my Mac Mini.The mouse works quite well. It isn't the best I've used, and it isn't wireless, but, I am pleased with it and expect to keep it.I was actually quite pleased with how easily and quickly I was able to get up and running.Although my preference remains the Mac Mini, which I now have updated to elCapitan operating system, I can definitely see where other geeks would enjoy using Windows 10 on an ASUS M32Cd Desktop.Unlike a Mac, this computer does not come equipped with iTunes, Photos, and the other freebies that are loaded on a Mac. That lack, though, is not the fault of ASUS, so it is unfair to hold that against them. Then, too. ASUS costs a lot less than a Mac...Judging this computer, as supplied, hardware and software, for the selling price, I rate as a five star. If my siblings or in-laws were to ask my appraisal, I'd give the ASUS M32CD an enthusiastic thumbs up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Q8HGULW2141/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVM2KO#wasThisHelpful","R27Q8HGULW2141","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Length: 280 pages. This is not yet available at audible.com for some reason.I note this author, and this series, is a huge hit on Amazon. Having said that, I have read none of the previous books, so, bear with me. My eyes are a fresh look at this monster hit series.This is a combination war storie, science-fiction action-adventure. In other words, this book will best address the cravings guys have for hot and dirty get-in-your face action with no, uh, politically correct niceties.Put another way, this is not a story we ever are likely to view on Hallmark Channel. For me, that is great, for I read it in parallel with a book that is perfect for Hallmark. I needed to offset that other excellent literary work with something that, if not a literary masterpiece of mainstream prose, would appeal to my John Wayne/Clint Eastwood cravings.Okay, I admit it, I am an old geezer. I love gritty shoot-em-ups and football.Even so, I also sometimes abhor stories of war guys loving the action shooting enemies whom they don't acknowledge as also being human. Navy Seals with Charlie Sheen was, for me, a total waste of time, even though I usually love his flicks.So, that should let you see why I was so late in discovering this great series of stories that, despite not being great literary works and despite not working towards character development. I have been trying to avoid stories that feel too similar to Navy Seals.By the way, lest I forget, the language is the sort we all have come to expect from military heroes. It is coarse, but, the language is perfectly consistent with that I would expect to hear in situations similar to those in which these guys find themselves. Certainly it sounds more believable than the artificial cussing I came across in a recent sci-fi, Dark Space.One quote, in particular, has won a place in my lexicon. Until this book, I often found myself quoting a friend who liked to find something more interesting that that offered to him. He'd quip, ""I think I'd rather pick fleas off my dead dog.""My new favorite quip goes something like,(paraphrasing) ""You boys look about as confused as my cat trying to bury his leavings on a frozen pond in the Dakotas.""Granted, it is far funnier the way the author puts it, but Amazon doesn't permit such language on its review pages.I loved this book as a great relief from other recent stories. It is intense and studded with action throughout.Two observations that are not pertinent to the story:Too much of the front matter consists of promoting other books in the series. I prefer to delve straight into the reason I spent my hard earned money for.The back matter that ordinarily is promotion, though, is terrific. The author explains where and how he was inspired to show certain key points. I have not seen other writers do this so well and with so much class.As stated at the start, I can't believe it took me so long to find this series. Though I read book 10, it felt as good to me as a book one. Perhaps I shall feel different after I read the previous books, but right now I am a huge fan.Also, I don't know why this is not yet available at Audible, but, you can be sure I will be among the first to but the audio version.I can't wait for the movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FRL1RBIW4HLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VQCDG0#wasThisHelpful","R1FRL1RBIW4HLC","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: 304 pages.This is a novel more about the struggles married couples encounter while trying to muddle through life in the 21st Century.In that sense, this was less about the dog than I anticipated. I should have realized that when I read the whiz bang opening paragraph.I would summarize this as a romantic comedy especially appealing to professional women in modern society. Except it's more literary and laced with several layers of doubt and self doubt.Before I forget, it is important that in one instance, the f-bomb is uttered. In today's society, though, I would have expected such an expletive to be uttered in exactly the same situation in which it pierces the air, even by some of the older ladies I know here in North Dakota, so it should not deter anybody from buying. However, I have known a few people who would want to know, so I do mention it.As I mentioned earlier, I bought this expecting a story more about the dog and the birth of an unexpected baby. After all, although I do have two (adult) sons, but my current wife, though previously married, has no children. Not long after we married, we took in a Yorkie while living in my wife's native home in Cairo, Egypt. I therefore expected to be able to immediately relate to this story, in an abstract way, if, at least, we were able to bear a child.Still, even though the dog was not central to the story, and even though this was far more literary than I normally read, this did grab me and hold me from beginning to end. I did experience frustration with the back and forth hot-and-cold romantic goings on, but that is what makes romantic comedy entertaining.The writing and editing is superb and professional throughout. Further, written in first person, this sort of story is more difficult to write and keep interesting than one might expect.Character development for the husband and wife was good, but, honestly, it was a little difficult for me to fully identify with either person. Not sure why, though, so it may only be that I am older and am a guy.

My fingers are clumsy so please excuse an typos that escape my notice due to vision failures.This is, generally, as well written of a guide on the topic of writing for Kindle that I've yet read.The only error I found, grammatically, was in regards two two alternatives. He should have used the singular 'is' instead of 'are' but such a distinction is nitpicking. This book has excellent editing.There is mild profanity. I found one instance in which hel/ and one in which da$& was used. The are numerous times in which the three-letter word as$ was used as kick-as$ but otherwise there is no serious profanity.The language is quick, snappy and, well, written in common everyday spoken English.Although most of the book is useful, it is Chapter 9 that is outstanding when he talks about rewriting.Overall, this is a terrific guide for any self publisher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FMD51BJQFSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I63XRW6#wasThisHelpful","R21FMD51BJQFSH","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: Print format: 119 pages. Audio format, 1 hour 57 minutes.Before I begin this review, I want to pay tribute to a fellow Amazon Reviewer who recently passed away ‚Äì Harriet Klausner. She published more than 30,000 reviews on Amazon until, on October 15, 2015, she went to the great library in the sky to join another recently deceased Amazon Reviewer, Hall-of-Fame member, Peter Durward Harris.Although I never communicated with Klausner, I feel a certain kinship with her, primarily because we both started reviewing about the same time and because we both were born in 1952.Mr. Harris and I did share an email or two and he did provide some reviewing tips to me once or twice.Because of my sudden realization that reviewing might well be the most lasting mark I make on this world (pitiful as that may sound to a few of you), I have decided to take this craft a bit more seriously now. I am going to experiment with a new structure, in an effort to provide more useful information in my reviews, but, as I have always strived, to avoid rambling so much about the contents that I burn out the readers desire to read the book.Further, I will continue to avoid spoiling the ending or critical points of the book. Especially with fiction, I want my review readers to get a good feel for the quality of writing; the tempo of the story and a general understanding so they can make a better, informed judgement, as to whether the book is something they will find useful and/or entertaining.In short, my reviews are not intended to be used for book reports for school.Feel free to leave a comment at the end of the review or to search my profile for more good books or my email contact information.This nonfiction book is targeted to indie writers in search of how-to books that show them the most efficient steps to market their books.Q - Is this a get-rich scheme or is it good, fundamental advice?This is good, fundamental advice that, if followed, will not merely help you sell more books, but will help you provide better written and better edited books that people will find useful or entertaining.Q - What was the Amazon Rank on the date this review was published?Selling rank on date of this review was 280,733, which is exceptional for a book originally published two years ago, on September 6, 2013. That means this book has superior staying power to most books in its class.Q: Will this book actually teach me something I didn't already know by surfing the internet?Yes, it probably will teach you several points that, if they are indeed on the internet already, are certainly not too easy to ferret out.Q - Is this a book that I can read without having to read others first?Yes, but, as with most similar books, this writer has published a series of complimentary titles that you will want to check out.Q - Are there other books by this author that might also be helpful?Yes. Several.Q - Are there a lot of typos/misspellings, grammatical errors or other editing failures?I did not come across any. At least not worthy of mention. Probably, because he has had professional editing done.Q - Is it a quick, easy read and is the writer enthusiastic in his/her approach?Yes. Rogan writes in an engaging, enthusiastic style that you will want to read or listen to quickly, then go back to the points that most resonate with you.Q - Is there humor? Is it wry, laugh-out-loud funny? Is it moronic?Light humor, not laugh out loud or moronic, but a more of the humor suitable for young and mature audiences.Q - What sort of language does this writer use to amplify the points made?Pretty much the same sort of language your college professor might use in a lecture, provided he/she is not trying to impress you with seven-letter words. What I mean is, the language is good, crisp, everyday English that will not require access to a dictionary for high school graduates or most high school drop-outs.Q - Is this, or should this, be available on audible.com?Yes, it is available on audible.com. In fact, if you purchase the whispersync at the same time you buy the Kindle version, you can save $3.00.Q - Is this better to read, or is it better to listen to?You will want a Kindle version so you can refer back (or bookmark) to key points, but, I immensely enjoyed listening to an outstanding narration by Greg Zarcone. In fact, at just 1 hour 57 minutes, I will certainly listen to this book another time or two so I can embed the information so that, when I finally do publish a book, I can make it the best seller it can be.Note: if you buy the whispersync version at the same time you purchase it on Kindle, instead of buying it later at audible.com, you can add save three dollars.Q - To what degree or percentage does this book succeed in its goal?I would judge that it fully met its goal. Still, there is one tip he gives regarding acquiring reviewers that I found does not ring quite true. Speaking for myself and, I believe, many fellow Amazon Reviewers, I never open attachments from unsolicited emails. I am almost certain to never review any eBook that is not in Kindle format.Further, concerning complimentary reviews upon request, I only review print format, or Kindle format that are gifted to me through Amazon‚Äôs outstanding KDP program. Otherwise, I review only books that I purchase myself.Q ‚Äì Overall satisfaction derived from this production?As hinted above, I found this to be a valuable addition to my library and plan to put its principles into action, if and when I ever actually do start producing books about my several entrepreneurial endeavors or about my expat residency in Egypt (before and during the revolution and counter-revolution), Libya during Moammar Gaddafi or in Southern Africa as Nelson Mandela commenced his drive to take power.I hope you find this review helpful and even that you leave a comment. We reviewers, just as most writers, love to learn if our work is useful and why. Until then, good day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZX32QE1HN9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1LS97E#wasThisHelpful","RFZX32QE1HN9Z","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: 50 pages.Unlike some of the other interactive biographies recently published by Charles River Editors, the video clips do not include sound. If they do, the audio did not work with my iPhone, even with auxiliary speakers hooked up. That reduces, slightly, the value of the interactive nature.Also, there are only two clips included. A parade in her honor and a very short clip, the last known clip, of her before her ill-fated trek in an attempt to circumnavigate Planet Earth.This is a pretty good, if short, biography. I found three very minor typos: One is merely a repeated word early in the booklet. I went back looking for it for this review, but couldn't find it; 2nd error was at location 143, second paragraph, where it reads, 'first record as a s female...' Obviously, the a and the s are not needed; The third, and last typo I found was substitution of the word Here instead of Her, at location 392, referring to ""...Her last entry...""I believe, as does the other reviewer, that this could be useful in bringing to life an historical point so a young audience can learn about a most important female who pioneered the way for equality in employment free of sexual discrimination. Considering how enduring that battle has been, the early 21st Century needs to grapple with all forms of discrimination.But, just as electing a Black American President has not eliminated racial discrimination, it also is likely true that electing a woman President is not likely to herald wage equality. Accomplishing either goal requires each of us Americans to recognize the root of the problems and to deal with those causes.The feeling that any particular group is more qualified or capable or more in favor with God is outdated.Okay, I know I am pontificating, but, if educational books can not stimulate inward thinking and foster change, then what use is education?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36H3VSI64PUSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B75R7XK#wasThisHelpful","R36H3VSI64PUSX","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: 546 pages.Target audience is Young Adult, but even , a senior citizen, found this an engaging science fiction story, with the right blend of romance, action, and fantasy (time travel). And, yes, even though it is the third (conclusion) book in a trilogy, it is the first of the three (plus two novellas) that I have read.I note that, even to I am sure I missed some of the meaning by starting with the third, it is certainly a stand alone that will bring pleasure to most every reader.This author has, apparently, grown into the Kindle publishing business. I say this, because she put all the skippable information at the back of the book. Very smart and very smooth. Just as many of my friends, I prefer to jump right into the story, especially with Kindle, and not be bothered with what I call the fluff, or skippable information.Also, even though, unlike writing instructors (I think it was Elmore Leonard) I will read prologues, but prefer not to. In Time's Divide there is no prologue.An other sin most new authors commit is the opening scene: they love to open with a statement regarding the weather. Again, this writer does not. Fantastic.Usually, I am the type of reader that Leonard claimed to write for. I tend to skip scenes such as romance and excess description. Partly because I am in a hurry to get the main story without wading through all the obligatory stuff that I love to skip over. In fact, until recently, I tended not to purchase books that exceeded the thickness that would fit into my back pocket. Then, I got a Kindle. And, then I read some of Stephen King's books that required half of the Cascade Mountain Range forests for printing.You see, on Kindle, number of pages is inconsequential to my lugging the book to and from work. Well, when I read The Stand, at some 1,400 pages, I realized I was missing out on some great stories. That marked my change as a reader. Now, I am far more willing to read 400 and 500 page books.That is not only fortunate for me, it is a good thing for Rysa Walker. At 526 pages, were this in paperback, I would have never tried it. Then again, perhaps it is I who is fortunate.I can visualize, with some adaptation, the conversion of this book into a future Star Trek motion picture. If that occurs, I'd love to attend the opening. One other Time-Travel Action Adventure book pleased me as much as did Time's Divide: that is Dinosaur Four. However, Time's Divide is, honestly, written by a more seasoned author who has been developing a terrific following.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT9UOVX4DBJFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WL6QGGS#wasThisHelpful","RT9UOVX4DBJFG","A2WG33SBOT901X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WG33SBOT901X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Length: 256 pages.I'm a sucker for trivia, especially quizzes, so, of course, I like this.Learning through trivia games can be fun, but the way this one is setup is less enjoyable than I expected. Also, as alluded to by another reviewer,you cannot afford to make mistakes.Furthermore, I expected this to be a book to read while answering nature's call - similar to a series of books referred to as The Bathroom Reader. Alas, Bathroom Reader remains authentic and stays at the top of the, uh, no, not THAT pile, the top of the pile of books on the water closet.Misgivings aside, I did still like this book, even if I only got to the January 5 test the first night.If you're looking for something to read, this probably will not interest. If, though, you're in preparation for Jeopardy, this is one resource that might help, so long as you don't bet everything in Final Jeopardy based solely on the answers provided here. Alex Trebek will scold you for sure.I do wish they had more than just three questions per day.

"Essentially this Conair does what it says it does but the problem with a lot of the written explanations seem more like  hyperbole than fact. For instance:  It's called a 2-in 1 Clipper and detailer. Uh, okay, so it has the clippers and you can unscrew those and put on the thiner detailer  (something most of the ones I've gotten can do) it gets to be counted as 2 in 1.  Then there is the ""NEW Comb Technology""  they are red and supposed to cut around your ears.  Nine combs that feel like cheap plastic.So if you can get past the hype, it's a fine trimmer, really pretty quiet and some nice (albeit cheap) accessories.

"I bought the bronze expandable towel holder from a brick and mortar store locally (for more than Amazon is selling them for). They are an incredibly helpful solution to a seemingly ubiquitous problem: where to put the kitchen towels.  We have been storing them on the refriderator handle but it not only looked messy but it was inconvenient for us. We use kitchen towels for two functions, 1. to dry dishes,  2. To dry hands.  And we like to keep them solely for that specific job (can't use dish towels for hands and vice versa).We also used the dishwasher and oven handles but the towel would have to brush along the floor every time either appliance was opened - unacceptable.The expandable towel bar was a welcome addition. There isn't much to the installation but if you don't mind putting two tiny screw holes into your cabinet, they do come with pre drilled holes in the back that allow you to secure it to the cabinet door.  Perfect solution.The hooks on top are lined with a nonstick grip to help it stay on the door. We initially installed them to the top DRAWER for ease but realized the towels would hang over the cabinet. Yep, I'm not the brightest crayon in the box for DIY things so I keep a lot of spackling and glue and duct tape nearby.  I took a star off for the lack of direction, suggestions, additional foam for making them more secure and two tiny screws for installation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSGT3KRFMIHQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPBNETU#wasThisHelpful","RSGT3KRFMIHQE","A2BCE305MUUP8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BCE305MUUP8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, I was pretty excited about this Belkin Charger. It is heavier than it looks and my 6plus fit in perfectly without a case. I ordered a very thin case for this phone and felt assured after a scant perusal that there would be no problem fitting with the case.  Even the side of the box gave me some assurance that it is ""Compatible with open base cases"".NOT!I've dropped some pictures here to illustrate the point. I was thinking if Belkin didn't claim it was to fit open base cases then I need to rank the product according to its ability to charge my phone, the ease of fitting it into the base, and overall quality -  Which to me are fantastic.  But the problem is the promise to fit open base cases (and mine is really slim) isn't true. These days, we ALL have a case to protect our phones so designing something that expects a disrobing every time you want to charge it is - ill conceived.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38W82K8PD6CZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E965FGK#wasThisHelpful","R38W82K8PD6CZR","A2BCE305MUUP8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BCE305MUUP8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm giving the Zero Water filters 5-stars because they do exactly what they say - take just about everything out of the water and last for about 3 months.

"The NUYU  looks like a well designed and solidly engineered sleep system with a very innovative idea: ""you emulate the circadian rhythm's temperature cycle so that your body is kept at the warmest temperature when you first get in bed, then slowly drop it to it's lowest temperature in the middle of the night and then back to the starting temperature to wake up [paraphrased from the website].Okay, I was sold so now lets look at the process of getting it set up.1. Download the app BUT only if you have a phone later than iphone4 (which you wouldn't know if you didn't go to their website's FAQ), an iPad later than the iPad4 or all but a few Android systems.2. Fill the machine with distilled water. (about 500ml or a standard sized water bottle will be needed )3. Attach the mat to the water tank. If you can't get it to ""click"", then flip the plug over and try again4. Plug in5. Put sleep mat under the fitted sheet or over the mattress.6. open the app/ press the big green button on the water tank (don't look for the zzz symbol, you won't find it.) until the blue light starts to blink7. Start the app, answer the questions (i didn't know the answer to some of them) and wait until they are paired.The unit started with a motor noise that was somewhat muffled but got louder as the world around me started to quiet down. I could hear and feel water rushing through the hose and through the mat BUT nothing was warming up. Then I glanced down and the phone was turned off (in sleep mode) for lack of activity.  But when I woke it up it wouldn't connect without a hard reboot. When I changed my setting for the phone to NEVER enter sleep mode (lock mode), the connection continued.  I pushed the unit under the bed to minimize the sound of the water tank. I could feel my body energy drop. I could feel the movement of water under me and the call to go to sleep. But i did not feel any warmth from the unit (the app was set for 75) until I turned it up to 80.It is in these areas where it would have been helpful if the unit had more explanatory directions like, ""You may not feel heat at first"" or ""You should feel heat instantly"" just to help us know how to tell if the unit is working properly.It was too noisy for me and too bright, even pushed under the bed. Again,  I felt that there was just not enough information in the manual to address this.  I gave it 4 nights of trial and even though I did find the motor loud, I was able to use it as ""white noise"" by the third day and found my sleep beckoning me but still remaining elusive.  There was a gentle comfort in the subtle wash of water circulating under me and I could tell that It was starting to work! I consistently woke up before the alarm so I don't know how it wakes you up. One big problem I had was that during  the night, I was fully aware of what I was sleeping on.  I was afraid to turn onto my side. I did manage to mangle the unit once or twice by my tossing and turning so I suggest that you place this under the sheet and right on top of your mattress for stability.If you're having problems sleeping, this is an expensive alternative, but it could work!  I honestly think it is a little early. The generic directions,  (i.e. no where do they suggest turning off  the phone's sleep cycle), the unclear ""What to expect directions"", and the absolute dependency on the app contributed to the downgrade of stars.

"Let me start off by saying ""My cats love this flavor by this company"".  I want to say that up front because I think it is not appropriate to completely 5star a product just because YOUR cats like it and of course the reverse is equally true; that's it not appropriate to one star a product because YOUR cats don't like it.  Of course it makes me happy that they like it but digging deeper into this company makes me appreciate their efforts and their consciousness.Both of my cats are 12 and after years of being on Raw food, the slightly older one has begun to show his boredom (I think it's his inability to smell) with the raw diet.  I will try to mix in other cans of food in small amounts to give him some variety but it wasn't until this turkey flavor for ""I and Love and You"" showed up that I started having success.I wrote to ask the company about a couple of practices and about their Rabbit blend which was suddenly missing. They answered very quickly and with very clear explanations. So, I'm comfortable letting the ""oldest"" make demands in his later years. He does seem really happier and I'm grateful for the consistency of I and Love and You's product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUSDL5VU1E2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBSUBKA#wasThisHelpful","RSUSDL5VU1E2M","A2BCE305MUUP8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BCE305MUUP8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perfect addition to a ""Trick or Treat"" bag for youngsters of all ages.  There is a monster or alien head that has a suction cup right below it. You press the head down so that the Suction Cup sticks to the base and in about 30 seconds it pops up to surprise you.These are seriously cute. The manufacturer recommends for ages 4 and up--  but I do get the privilege of being around my friend's unpredictable (shy/ not shy) 29 Month old and there is a genuine appreciation of these heads (of which he is not allowed to be unsupervised with) but delights in their surprise popup action!My concerns for the very young is that they don't get popped in the face, (although the pop up is very gentle) and that these do have tiny springs in them that could come out and be a choking hazard.They are well done, however from the coloring of theh heads, to the pop, these are sure to be a delight for all ages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PUMBW3FUK3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001U9KHBW#wasThisHelpful","R2PUMBW3FUK3S","A2BCE305MUUP8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BCE305MUUP8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There appears to be a consciousness evolving in their new products that (perhaps in my imagination only) seem to be based on a continual re-looking at what might be needed by their consumers.  This Contigo Matterhorn is a slim and attractive addition. Think of it as a stainless steel thermos / cup without the fancy one flip buttons for the lid. This bottle seems to say, ""Stop and take a drink"". It holds both HOT and COLD beverages keeping the cold, really cold even when left in the car on a hot day (which i did).It's all human grade (BPA-Free) plastic and the removable mouthpiece is convenient both as a way to safely had a Hot Beverage but for washing purposes (they do suggest to hand washing but it will go into the dishwasher - it's just suggested that you hand wash.I think that the word SCUBA in the title is the color of the Blue handle and mouthpiece.

This cat tree is light weight and made of particle board under the flat base at the bottom and the flat piece in the middle.  You can tell just by looking at the picture that this thing is going to wobble and it really does.My cats also dislike the Velour feel of the fabric, preferring the twine feel more traditional cat trees where you can tug really hard as if just sharpening your nails.This is a cat tree for kitties.

It is almost completely made of plastic, which I'm not opposed to but I like to know the kind of plastic that my water will be sitting in for the cats. The product is not listed on the Oster sight so it could be new but I didn't have an easy way to call the company to find out.  The blue reservoir is a recycle #2  HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) which is considered one of the safer plastics. It's the stuff Milk cartons are made of so it should be fine.There wasn't much I had to do, wet the filter, fill the bowl and reservoir and plug it in.

"This is an amazing product and I was surprised that this wasn't recommended more enthusiastically at my local hardware store when I asked for Water Proof tape.  My surveillance camera went out!

I replaced the wire on the rusted side and wanted to wrap it in water proof tape - if there was such a thing (you would think there wasn't with the answers I received at the hardware store).  When this tape arrived I was stumped by the lack of adhesion. No sticky stuff anywhere. One reviewer explained that you roll it on itself while stretching it pretty taut. Sure enough, there is a beautiful ""Stick to itself"" process that occurs and it stays tight and I read that I eventually bonds to itself.I wrapped my two cables effortlessly and could just look and tell it was sealed tight (see pictcure).  What's even cooler is the camera picture instantly improved.

"I'm new to professional photography and the deeper I go, the deeper I fall in love. I was talking to a Photographer/Friend. She asked me why I had a UV filter on my Canon 60d and I explained that it was to protect the lens when I was out on a shoot for my instructor (finally found someone to tutor me at home).  She Pfft'd that and said, ""What you need is a Polarized Lens and if you are going to use a UV filter get a good one not one that costs $10.""  Weeks later I show her this polarized from B+W and she said, ""You just got the best!""We went outside so she could show me some tips. I have wanted to get a good picture of the birds eating from the feeder but when I go outside to take a picture the glare from the window just destroys it.  I was explaining to her that adjusting the f-stop and shutter speeds are not natural for me yet and I lose a lot of shots. She had me aim the camera at my feeder with glaring glass and all and she turned the lens and I was blown away. I mean I scared away every animal within a mile over the excitement of watching this glare disappear.The idea behind ""polarization"" is that when light is reflecting off of smooth or highly reflective surfaces tends to create a haze or ""glare"" because the light is ""polarized horizontally"" as opposed to normal light reflection which is essentially more ""scattered"" and allows us to see dimensions.  A polarized lens blocks horizontal glare and allows you to see more depth or what's ""behind the glare"".This makes these lenses great for highly reflective surfaces where glare is created. They have a turning ability to help you find the perfect amount of blockage for the most realistic or clear picture.I tossed the UV lens because after feeling the quality of this one I wanted to work with a better quality one. I'm going to get this one B+W 67mm XS-Pro Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Nano Coating (010M) as soon as I master my polarized one. That way I can really see the difference of what they do. So I'm very happy and want to get one for all my lenses. I don't think you will regret the upgrade in picture quality and the improved ability to shoot in low light. B+W has a strong and well deserved reputation for knowledge and quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S4UYEZWE58DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PH4L6Y8#wasThisHelpful","R3S4UYEZWE58DY","A2BCE305MUUP8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BCE305MUUP8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a strong supporter of Raw Food for my two boys. they've been on it most of their lives. Before we got one of them he was just a year old an they fed him on cheap cat food kibble. So in his heart, he has a hankering for dry food. I've managed to quell the urges by grinding up his hard food and putting it as a  topping on he wet raw stuff, it does excite him.Now in my research I found that many theories support the idea that grains are not easy for cats because they don't have the digestive capabilities to break them down, resulting in bloating. I had overlooked that this bag had rice. So in an attempt to give a fair review I ground some up for the boys and they LOVED it but there was a distinct difference in their energy levels.  I think it was the rice but it could've been the new diet in general.  So it looks like this small shaped kibble is  fun and easy to eat. Yeah, rice is the only complaint I have regarding this product that has an amazing amount of  really good food, but it's a big issue for me because of my concerns regarding grains.  So if you already are giving your cat raw food, this stuff is off the charts healthier than most you've tried so give it to them in peace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38TRPFD07R18C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTVQK#wasThisHelpful","R38TRPFD07R18C","A2BCE305MUUP8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BCE305MUUP8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Though looking down the brass chambers it does reveal a bit of white that could be PVC or other kind of plastic. Only time will tell.It is remarkably easy to install, I really did use one hand so I could hold the camera (too hilly for tripod).

" 4:18 Mins My roommate has the Bose Wave 1. Which honestly looks no different than this one with the exception of the touch top (but between us, I think this one sounds better).There is virtually NO set up. It plugs in, you set the clock with the remote and enjoy radio or cd's. The bass is lush and the mid-tones are clear, and we played it during a party and people kept commenting about the sound but they could find the source which was on top of the fridge.I know the cd thing will have to be addressed at some point as we move beyond the digital era but I like ""burning"" special songs and moods onto cd's so I can be selective (cd's were like the first digital playlists). It looks like there is an adapter you can purchase for bluetooth so you may be able to connect your phone or sound device and have access to your play lists etc, Now that would have been a cool feature to include, alas.  Bose 727012-1300 Bluetooth Audio AdapterThe radio signal without help from an antennae was phenomenal and I live in the country. The Bose displays the message of who the artist is and the song they are playing.I do feel that this machine has been around a long time and some design tweaks are probably in order, but for me (probably JUST me), it provides exactly what I want for a bedroom alarm clock.  If you have the extra dough and need a beautiful sound machine somewhere in your house, this could be the ticket. (Bose is known for excellent customer service).

"I'm not saying this in a disrespectful way but I've never had luck using products from Google. Especially online software. They seem to be made for people with a good understanding of how things work online - and if you have a problem, you Google it and cross your fingers you find it. So trying out this router had me quite dubious of it being as easy as they said it was.  But seriously, OMG!I've had an ongoing battle with Century Link DSL because it is the only company I can get out here in the country. But the speed is abysmal and the money I have spent to fix that or at least enhance it was more than the cost of a year of service. so the fastest speed we could get was 7mbps (Paying for 20 - perhaps in the hopes that some anomaly would come along and fix it, but no luck).I've learned to live with 7mbps but I ache when my friends talk about their speeds.  So I get the Google Hub for testing and download the app for setup, I'm told to plug in the power, plug in the ethernet cable to the modem  and it started updating the software, telling me every step of the way on my phone what phase they are on.  It lit up and the app told me we were ready after we name the network and give it a password.My roommate lives two stories below me so I asked him to try it.  Now he as accepted 7mbps as ""what is"" and uses it contently. His Zen-like acceptance drives me nuts but I get it.  15mbps!!!!  He lit up like it can't be true.  15mbps for realz- two stories below where the router is.We tested everything in the house from laptops to tablets, taking them outside on the deck.  Here's the funny thing, I had talked to C.L. about adding another modem and separate wiring in the lower part of the house, it was going to cost me $400 installation and 179 extra per month. I called to cancel and she wanted to know why, so I told her. She went to look at it and said she knows 5 people that could benefit from it.  And I know at least 50.So, I bow to you with a sincere apology, Google for presuming that you couldn't do.  You Did it!

"This is listed a the #1 best seller on Amazon as of this writing (Sept 2015) and I can easily see why. A box arrives with a carrying case, two Tripods, two folded Softboxes (folded like an umbrella) and two HUGE 85w CFL 6500k Bulbs (huge).Setting up the tripods was easy enough and putting the softboxes on them was too, BUT figuring out how to firm up the softboxes was a little tougher (I didn't mention that there were NO directions came with the kit).What you do is: 'act"" like you are going to screw in the lightbulb. You will see a ring that is elevated above the socket for the lightbulb - Push it (the ring) towards the socket and it locks in place and firms everything up. Really nicely.Put the bulb in and look in the softbox bag for a diffuser which will be a tiny folded cloth that opens big and fits perfectly over the softbox - be sure to match all the velcro strips.The price gives it the extra star that the lack of instructions took away.

"I""m a beginner who wants to learn the art of lighting and this book gives me goose bumps to read. The pictures set great examples of what the lighting does and what the effects we need to be looking for.

It's a great shot, I know it because it's easy to look at and there is no part of me finding a flaw in it. BUT if it were a shot I took, I would wonder if the model has too much dark on her face or if  the lower part is in too much shadow.

It has a ""Lifetime Guarantee"" which was a nice touch.Turning the dials is solid and they have the written definition of the spray types clearly on the side.  The very back of the sprayer is a nob that just turns the water flow down. I was hoping it would turn it off just to have a nice double safety in case the nozzle would drip or the release of the handle dripped but less power is a good thing.Overall - a powerful little device that is easy to hold, easy to use and has 8 different patterns for most Garden and Lawn needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GEULFG0TAGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRIK1U2#wasThisHelpful","R3GEULFG0TAGV","A2BCE305MUUP8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BCE305MUUP8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The rest of the jars are sealed tight and stored in a cold dark cabinet in another room.This is a smooth quality coconut oil. No grit or sandy bits. Appreciated the inner seal cover that you remove, because quality pure coconut oil like this will have an inner seal that prevents leaking when shipped as well as less possibility of the coconut oil going rancid which it can do is air gets in.While we use it on our skin, in our hair, for tooth care, a friend recommends it for preventing diaper rash.

"Ivation is a brand I now recommend a lot!  This humidifier is neither to big or two small.  Great because you can do cool mist or warm mist, depending on the situation.  Because of wood floors, wood furniture this will be used daily to keep needed moisture in the air so the wood doesn't crack and dry out.Especially wood chairs, whose rungs can loosen in winter when the home is warmer and little humidity is in the air.  And this humidifier sure beats having to mist every wooden chair rung, table leg, or damp mop the wood floors and even the quality wood panels on the walls in some rooms.Appreciate the sturdy handle that folds down when not in use.  A few humidifiers we looked at had the indentations where your hand would fit to lift and carry, but the handle on this Ivation humidifier is easier and safer if you need to use two hands because of arthritis or because you are not as strong as you once were.Easy wipe clean surface.

" 3:58 Mins First off, you have three color options with this so explore a little if you want. I personally like the blue and would choose it again, but the other options also look appealing. Also note that this uses 18650 batteries and comes with two. Please review the instructions, specifically those involving the removal of plastic, before use.When it comes to the GRDE 2000 Lumens Headlamp, I like the options it has and the brightness it touts, plus the design wears comfortably and is easy to use.For settings, you have a bright, dim, and flashing light, and the lamp has a zoom feature that you can easily maneuver.

" 1:55 Mins The SADES Gaming Headphone Cradle combines design aesthetics, functionality, and a simple design to give you something you really do need when it comes to your gaming setups.When this arrives, it comes with 5 pieces that easily snap together and can be assembled within a few short minutes to give you both design and safety considerations. I like the fact that the mount is long so you do not have to worry about your headphones touching the base, that the top is padded so you do not have any excess rubbing or wear on your headset, and the fact that it has the double tower design so you can run a cord around or through it depending on what you want.I also like the coloration and how the plastic designs allow lighting to pass through the red, highlighting your headset. This does not need to be limited to gaming, either, and could easily hang any other type of headset you have. You also do not have to worry about sizing constraints because you are simply hooking this on something and draping it down, so it accommodates a number of designs. The lack of overthinking in the simplistic design also gives you durability and extended lifetime, which is great for either yourself or other gamers/music lovers/etc in your life.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes. I am both a gamer and a music lover and I know how much time/effort we put into finding the right sets, so I really do see the need for something like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CGXXIXNHQGGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012MET1ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CGXXIXNHQGGM","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After seeing a few reviews for the pocket chainsaw, I  thought checking one out would be interesting and am really glad I did. There are quite a few uses for this that would allow use around the home cutting down debris, camping and setting up or cutting firewood, survival uses, kayaking and tying off, and much more.Basically, we are talking something that reminds me of a chainsaw blade connected by two handles with metallic connectors, so you have a very solid blade you can use with a comfortable handle you can easily manipulate. I like how easy it is to get started and how responsive it is, plus I was really surprised by just how easily it cut. I am not sure what I expected but I do know I expected my hands to hurt, and I am glad to find out that the straps fit comfortably and kept the effort from causing any discomfort.This comes with a carrying case, too, so you can easily store and retrieve it. This makes it good to stick in survival packs, to store in a kayak, or whatever you are carrying with you.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RM3FV6EVJI3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCNYJI2#wasThisHelpful","R1RM3FV6EVJI3D","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Looking at the non-slip handles, for example, you can see how aesthetics and functionality mesh to make an attractive-yet-functional item you can keep with you in the supplied carrying pouch.

" 2:59 Mins Lately, we have been fishing for Gar a lot, and this is something that is not only nice to have but is also essential. Basically, you are adding a buffer between teeth and your fingertips, which is really nice to have considering something like a Gar is armored, thick, and has no qualms taking a little something back to the depths with it. Unlike simply using pliers and trying to guide a catch with the line, you have control over what goes on as well, meaning you are more likely to keep what you catch and do so safely.There are 4 different types of Gripper here, so check the specs for the model that best fits your needs.You have a good design, a build that is resistant to rusting, and a good spring that will last a while. You also have something that is easy-to-use with one hand, which is absolutely essential when you are trying to bring in something with one hand and trying to hold on with the other. The wrist strap helps with that, too; the first time I was using this, I had a fish struggle and knock this out of my hand, but luckily the guard caught the Gripper and the boat caught the fish.Please note this was provided for sampling purposes and has been fishing three times now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RX69K566OMFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01554L1X0#wasThisHelpful","R1RX69K566OMFF","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:28 Mins The Ivation E10 safe is a very good model for home use, with an easy-to-understand, simple-to-use design that makes it perfect for all types of users. To note, the E15 model is much the same except it comes with a 10-button setup instead of the E10s 4, which makes them great for anyone wanting a safe.When you first pick this up, you will notice a lock in the front for a key. Open your safe, insert batteries, and follow the instructions on how to set up fingerprints and the key reader. The default is 1-2-3-4 so it is easy to access at first, so you will want to change this as soon as you put the batteries inside.Something I found really great about the E10 is that it works. The biometric safe actually does read fingerprints and it does it well, so there is no real slipping up. Since you have 30 plus fingerprints that can be added, you can add multiple readings of your main fingers in case you hurriedly need to access it. I think this is a good idea and the sheer amount of reads allows me and my wife to put our fingers on it, plus more.As far as room goes, this will hold 4 pistols inside to give you an idea for room, or more if you want to remove the interior shelf. I placed a .38 in it for reviewing purposes because I like to see something in use, and you can see just how much room there is inside.For mounting, the safe is set up where you can mount it different ways, and it is thick enough to make anyone feel secure while also being small enough to put in a closet if you want or even sit it close to your bed. That is how I am using it; I wanted something to keep my firearm close to my bed, but I want to keep that well away from my child. This allows me both, plus it is easy to open so I can get inside quickly.Please note this was provided for sampling purposes and is very utilitarian. I am VERY pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38DJAEUIPLSNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DSUA94#wasThisHelpful","R38DJAEUIPLSNS","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was a new parent, I recall one of the most frightening things I faced was the fear of not knowing and feeling like I simply was not there. Aside from trying to grow accustomed to my child being in their crib, one of the worst times for me was when my child was in their car seat facing away, because I could not see nor comfort them. They would sometimes respond to that as well by crying, because they wanted to see me or simply know that someone else was around. Even if they were calm, I personally wanted to know what they were up to, if they were playing or being silent because of that sneaky way kids can be when they find something they should not have, and that made things difficult.The first baby car mirror I tried out was one of those items that was really small and pretty much only showed me the baby's eyes, and I found that neither I nor the baby liked it too much. The Bable takes care of that by being large enough to allow you to see pretty much everything, and because it is concave and the design shrinks things down a little and allows you to simply see more. If you have used a fisheye lens on a camera or have seen a mirror hanging in a convenience store, you know how that works, and I personally like that because it includes not only the baby but their hands and their seat as well.Another thing I really like about the Bable is the design, with it being very lightweight and portable while also maintaining that a larger design. That works really well for me because I can place it just about anywhere and effectively move it from one vehicle to the other without having to worry about weight or construction. The strap designs make it very easy to place while also keeping it secure, and this can be moved easily as well. It also includes a pretty much shatterproof acrylic mirror, soThe Bable is constructed out of ABS material, or Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, which you commonly find in things like keyboards because of ruggedness. ABS is noted as a stable material that does not leech toxic materials, and is found in many types of items including some Legos, high chairs, and the like. Many reputable sources have tested ABS, too, and that is a very important consideration for me.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and tested in both my Jeep and in our Caravan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OW9FZ4TQVE8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169YWY8G#wasThisHelpful","R1OW9FZ4TQVE8B","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Soundpeats M20 are a good pair of headphones with a better-than-average sound quality that tout crisper bass while still allowing good tremble and ranging, a basic microphone setup, and a nice design including a tangle-free cord. I personally like the Soundpeats designs and say that having  tried a lot of different ones, from the Q800 and other wireless types to wired ones. Added to that is the fact that I actually picked these up almost 50 days ago and they are still going strong despite not only myself using them, but also other, less-careful members of my family.Looking at design first-and-foremost, you have a good earbud design with solid connectivity to the cording, which lends itself to longevity and a lack of fraying. Fraying has been an issue I have run across with other, lower-cost headphones, and that is why I mention it at all. I also like tangle-free headphones because you can stick them in your pocket and take them out without worrying about tangling. You may have to maneuver the cord a little, but knotting pretty much does not happen and this keeps fraying down, plus it makes things like working out a lot easier. Aesthetically, I think the design compliments the wearer, with the black blending in and with smaller details like the coloration of the ends or the brand design looking nice (it is a little musical note on the end, for those who have not noticed it). Cord length is good as well, and the 3.5mm jack is well-designed and does not put pressure on the device it is hooked to or sit oddly, which is equally important when you are talking both immediate and long-term use.As far as sound goes, these have a better-than-average sound quality that is made even better at this pricing point, because most headphones here are simply bass magnifiers or cheap treble boosters. The M20s do produce some higher levels of bass, but they also produce a good vocal sound, which also compliments phone use. When testing sound, I utilize some pretty strict standards so I can compare and contrast sounds, with specific qualities such as LOSSLESS or Flac being used (or 320 if that simply is not available), plus a genre cross-referencing to see if these work with everything from pop to rap. There is also a range testing of sorts, whereby electronic music by IDI bands such as Autechre or bands such as Haujobb are used to see if the headphones pick up eclectic ranging. I know that is a lot to note, but I feel it is warranted given the fact that substandard headphones (and you would be surprised how many are lackluster) would not pick up specific sounds, leaving you missing parts of music you might not have heard all your life.With microphone use, this is a very basic design that allows you to answer calls or switch songs. This does not bother me in the least because I personally do not answer calls and listen on the same device unless I am out-and-about and running/hiking, but if you want more control, this might be something to note. The positive here is that this is not complex so you do not have to worry about having to stop everything and drop off to answer a call, and the omnidirectional microphone type is a standard across many providers.Other specs, according to the product description: ""mylar thickness I 6 an normal impedance is 1 Amp¬±20% at 1 kHz And normal power rating is 3mw. The maximum input power is 5mw. The output S.P.L: 100+_3db SPL at 1 kHz with 126mvrms input/L output difference is 3db at 1 kHz 1m. The distortion is 3% maximum, frequency response is 20-2000Hz.""Note that these were supplied for sampling purposes and due to a posting issue, i ended up with these for double my normal testing timeframe. I gave them to my wife for continued use, and they have been stuck in the door of the car, in a purse, and other places I would never place them for fear of damage. They have continued to function, too, and admirably.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R295GEFENC3HNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RXUX60#wasThisHelpful","R295GEFENC3HNX","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like it for a kayak or a larger boat, ATV, or bike use, plus I am thinking of using this as a stable platformer when considering specific types of outdoor uses.The reason behind its success is it being: (1) really strong when it comes to the clamp and(2) easily manipulated so it can film whatever.When it comes to adjustment, i was really impressed by just how much this could be manipulated. I can take pictures of the clamp if I wanted, to note how far down it will flex, and it will also face upward, back, or to either sides.

" 3:48 Mins The Sentey ThorX wired headphones are excellent headphones from a quality company that really impressed me with these. To note, I am primarily a wired headphone user because of sound quality and find myself hard pressed to stick with any Bluetooth designs. That is because of the way Bluetooth trades convenience for quality at this time. Anyone wanting to check the difference should test something with a high quality sound file over both types and see for themselves.For the ThorX, they have a great aesthetic and a comfortable fit that makes them something I personally have enjoyed using. They look great for onlookers and they feel great when adorned, and they also have a really good sound for this pricing point and beyond. You have a foldable design so you can face your headphones outward and so you can store them depending on which direction you turn them, and you also have a tremendous amount of comfort added around the ears. I will say that the foam in the top of the headphones took me some time to adjust to, but this was something I warmed up to quickly after it contorted to fit.Speaking of sound quality, these really do have good bass and excellent equalization, making them something I feel really good about using. When it comes to testing, I have strict methods for sound quality that I continually utilize, and these preformed really high in both their pricing point level and beyond. That says a lot for them.The headphones also come with a basic cord for phone use and a hard case, which is nice. I rarely mix my music with my phone, but some people enjoy that design type.Please note that these were supplied for sampling purposes and that I am quite happy with them.

I also thought the cord removal was interesting, and I was surprised that this did not harm the sound quality in any way. Before, I had thought this might degrade it somewhat but it has not so far, and if it does I will revise the review (although I am expecting solid performance form these).When it comes to these headphones, the LS-4205s have an in-ear, looping type of fit, whereby you place the earbud and then contort the cord to fit. I like this type of fit in sports headphones, and I can say that having tried quite a few different types. One of the good things about this fit is that the earbud sits on its own and is not forced inside, and the cord holds them in place without pressing on the ear. This works well for keeping them from slipping, and it also provides comfort for the wearer.For sound, these worked well and especially while working out/running, with the headphone sitting correctly and delivering well. The quality of calls was good, too, with the easy-to-use button basically allowing you to answer and hang up or to stop and start music. This is not a lot of functionality in the cord, but I personally do not like being bogged down when I am out.This is the 6th Sentey brand item I have tested as well, and they provide a nice sound. I am personally using the Sentey Thor X brand wired headphones for a lot now, but these have also gotten some use as of late because I like their fit and the brand.Please note these were supplied for sampling, tested for 17 days, and then considered. Sampling does not impact review rating considerations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBI6VKLP6948/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMZ746#wasThisHelpful","R2FBI6VKLP6948","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have recently been introducing my daughter to the world of painting and colors while also reintroducing myself as well, and we have been using MyArtscape products to do so. The reason we have done so is because MyArtscape supplies quality paints and supplies and they do so at a very reasonable price, and they provide very positive customer responsiveness.For the MyArtscape Paint Set, you have a range of colors including Titanium White, Lemon Yellow, Yellow Ochre, Vermilion, Crimson, Sap Green, Deep Green, Violet, Cerulean Blue, Prussian Blue, Burnt Sienna, and Burnt Umber. Each comes in excellent packaging, with tubes you have to pierce the tops of so you do not have to worry about your paints being older or diluted, and each applies well and does not dilute with use. It also did not get lighter as it dried, nor were there issues with paling. I was extremely impressed by this, and I was also impressed by the amount of paint you receive because 12ml is a nice amount.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and that I really do like the brand.

" 5:11 Mins The Brainwavz S3 in-ear headphones have quite a few things going for them including design, functionality, aesthetics, microphone and remote use, and sound quality.To note something on the remote, please look at the video to see what functionality is included on non-IOS devices.

"Depending on what you want from a selfie stick, this might be something you would consider because of its pricing point, the ease of use, and the fact that it has been a solid performer so far. Were this released a year prior, I would have given it higher marks,  but there are better types in the field in my opinion and this is not my personal choice because of grip style and connection. For me, I prefer a grip with ridges, and I prefer a remote type of selfie stick, but that also comes with higher price considerations and a smaller level of tech confidence. That does not mean it is hard, but with this you simply plug and go.Basically, for the average user, this compact model, pricing point, and easy use would probably equate to 5-stars.For anyone wanting to know, there are basically three types of selfie sticks available at this point, with those like this one connecting via wire to the phone, others synching and having a trigger on the stick like this, and those with remotes that require synching and a remote trigger. I use the last two and a more expensive setup with a remote for action camera use, but a lot of people default between the first and second. The benefits of the first (this type) is that it plugs into your device via wire and does not need to be synched. You also do not have any interference, so nothing can interrupt your connection and you know exactly how much distance is required. The downside is that it has a wire, so it has something hooked to your phone.When it comes to design, this has an above-average to good grip and a nice compact design, which means that you can hold it well and that you can store it easily. The downside to the compacts is that they are shorter, but if you are wanting something for vacationing and the like, this would work extremely well. I especially like packing something like this because it takes up no room, and carrying becomes simple. For grip, the handle is easy to hold and the wrist strap helps, plus the cradle design adds safety for your phone. With the cradle, you can see how it is curved outward, so  the cradle holds your phone in. That means you do not have to worry about it falling out. You also have an easy-to-use charging setup, so that makes it pretty user friendly.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and that these are my opinions, as the preference notes hopefully suggest. I am not knocking this, I just encourage people to know what level of need they have and what design they like to inform their purchases.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16I0PSUTJ7AWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XLVCJE#wasThisHelpful","R16I0PSUTJ7AWQ","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a bed in our home that has the best mattress I have ever slept on attached to the worst corners imaginable, and I cannot begin to tell you the number of times I have hit my knee or cracked my hand against it while walking by. That alone is annoying enough, but our daughter just turned two and is also actively exploring her environment and that adds a lot of concern. She had some walking delays and is a little uneven when she stands, plus she is tall and I worry about her falling and hitting one of these as well as other haphazard spots. Add those elements together and these bumpers, designed for a table but equipped to handle whatever, are just what the doctor ordered.Included in the packaging here is everything you would need to secure a few surfaces, whether they be tables, the bed, or whatever. You have 8 corner guards included in the pack, as well as 16 feet of edge guard and enough 3M tape to secure your child to the floor while watching you install these if needed. You get a roll of 3M tape, which is quite a bit, plus squares of it to secure your items.When we used the set, we placed some on the #M both sides of the edges and a strip down the length of the bumper guard and they stayed in place really well. We applied bumpers the length of the foot board, both edges, the edges of an additional table, and still have a massive amount of  bumper left over. To me, that is impressive and makes me happy because I can place it on other items. I included pictures, too, noting beforehand that I am not a professional at adding things in any way and that I could have done a better job. Still, the bumper was really easy to place, situate and cut as desired, and I was really happy with that.When it comes to cushioning, this is really good as well, with enough solidity not to give or end up feeling like foam, but with enough give to buffer any falls. I mention the foam thing because that was the way some of my earlier bumper buys were, and I was extremely disappointed with them. I tested this by hitting my leg against it softly at first and then somewhat foolishly amping it up, and it did really well, making me feel good about it for both myself and my daughter.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes, and that it is in-use in my home. I take safety seriously and especially things that impact my family, so my review rating is not impacted by sampling. Also note that the pictures were taken as an afterthought, so excuse the lack of forethought and lower quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OX26QFM1LN25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YB02JZ4#wasThisHelpful","R2OX26QFM1LN25","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Leward Portable Strip Charger is a nice, easy-to-carry charger that you can take almost anywhere, with a lightweight, portable design that makes it easy to pack, unpack, and go. It has multiple charging options with it as well, including 4 5V USB charging slots and 1 Universal Socket. It is very lightweight and has a unique design, which is interesting about this. Were a couple of things modified, I would consider it a 5-star item.When it comes to charging, you have 3 5V/1A charger ports that are good for charging most items including phones, tablets, action cameras, and more, plus a 1 5V/2.1A that is good for charging tablets and the like. I like having both because items like Li-Polymer batteries are a safety concern when they receive too much of a good thing, plus you have slots for phones and/or tablets. Each of the ports was tested by first checking functionality to see if they would (1) work and (2) power something like an individual USB-powered LED for one hour, and they did that and functioned well. I then tested them with a multimeter to check output flow, and they worked well and correctly.You also have an additional universal socket with a maximum output of 300W, and it is convenient to have something like this when travelling. I cannot easily count the number of times I have looked for a place to plug in my laptop and other items, or when I have needed to plug up some USB-related and keep my plug for my laptop handy at the same time. It works for a lot of other items, too, and really assists travel.So, why 4-stars.First, the way this wraps and unwraps is due to have issues, with the plug hooking and hinging around an adjustable plug that can be positioned in a number of ways. This seems nice until you not how difficult it is adjustable because of a u-shaped restraint, and you think og how easily it would be to break that off were you to push it too hard or hit it when travelling. I have been careful with it so far and have not had that issue, but I figure this could happen pretty easily.Second, the cord has to be manually wound and I think that is a little mental. It is also held into place with the plug and its positioning, too, so were the plug to break, it would not secure easily. Again, this has not happened to me and I am deducting only because i think it could be designed smarter, but I would deduct more were this to break off and cause issues.Third, the bottom of the universal plug is wide open and could end up with something in it. I have taken to fixing this by using a child's safety plug cover, but I could see something small getting wedged in there and causing a blockage or something worse, depending on the circumstances.Fourth, the upper slot covers on the universal plug are difficult to manipulate, which can be trying. The first time I plugged something in, I honestly thought I was doing something wrong because of the resistance. That could end up being a pro, too, because this might cause the piece to  last longer and no wear down as quickly.All-in-all, I find this a good product and think, were these suggestions remedied, they would have a great product to use.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and was tested over a 14 day period, to give an example of time frame.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4X4JKGOMRLJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CWQVYE#wasThisHelpful","R4X4JKGOMRLJ1","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to note a few things about this:First, the pictures seem to give the false impression that there is a stand included. Unless the item I received is different, it only includes the Ocarina.Second, this has a white base with gloss blue paint covering it and a tiny Triforce painted on top of this. I think the product pictures do a great job showcasing the paint job on this, and it looks good. I also like how it handles and how it sounds, so it is something you can display or tinker with.The Ocarina has a decent size and weight to it; both my wife and I can handle and play it pretty well, and I can even do a few small tunes with it.With regard to songs, you have an instruction booklet included with the Ocarina that has some specific lines from the game and songs you can goof off with, including Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, Happy Birthday, Mary Had A Little Lamb, and Auld Lang Style. I personally was glad these were included here because it gives me a feel for how the item is supposed to be used and how it is supposed to sound, and the instructions do a good job showing what holes on the Ocarina need to be covered and how breathing is spaced.For play, you position the mouthpiece with the Triforce facing up, making certain not to block the ""sound hole,"" as the instructions laughably call it. You position a thumb over one of the two holes on the bottom and you position two fingers from each hand on the holes on the top. Depending on the song, you meter your breaths and move your fingers and the sound reminds me of a recorder as a kid.It is easy to play and fun to goof off with; in less than five tries, I had Twinkle Twinkle down somewhat and I was goofing off. Someone feeling motivated could have a lot of fun, and the tinkerer can, too.Please note that this was supplied for sampling purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BE525IRJTS0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QK4AA8M#wasThisHelpful","R2BE525IRJTS0N","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking at pictures of this pillow, I was unsure what to truly think about it. I mean, one reviewer noted how it looked like a tapeworm head, and to me it looks a little like a plush reimagining of Gypsy from MST3K. I also did not know what I thought about sticking my head into it for napping, and I almost passed on this. Still, I was intrigued somewhat and do have problems sleeping without something covering my eyes, so I wondered what was the worst thing it could do. Weirdly, this worked out well, just not in the way I expected.First thing, I am unsure I if could actually sleep sitting up at a desk, and my workplace has a VERY strict no-napping policy besides. I tried sitting at my computer desk at home with this on, and I could see sleeping with covering my head provided I was exceptionally tired. That says a lot about the comfort of this to me, because anything you slip on the way these are advertised has to be comfortable in order to use. You slide it on over your neck and can rest your hands in the top holes with your mouth and nose facing out, with a pose that reminds me of sleeping at a school desk. And the beaded padding feels really good against your skin, to the point where I actually liked that and use this as a neck pillow when just sitting aorund. Where that REALLY works for me is when travelling, though, and especially if I am tired and need to nap when riding.When I ride, I always feel sick if I try to nap and I have weird dreams of motion. The light mingles with moving features and I imagine road on pavement and it makes me feel really, really bad. I have tried masks and covering my head with a blanket, but getting hot is really problematic, and i hate taking medication to ride. That is where this helps out, because it is soft and comfortable, blocks light, and it allows me to breathe.The Leward slips on easily and it fits well; the neck seems constricting when you are slipping your head inside and especially that first time, but afterward it fits comfortably and makes a reasonable amount of space for your nose and mouth. I could put on a sleep mask inside this if I wanted to as well, which works out good. You can rest your head against the window or lean back and get comfortable, or you could lean your head forward and put your hands in if so inclined. The material breaths, as I mentioned before, and the make is really comfortable.When not using this, I sometimes place it on my bed and use it as a cup holder, too, and it interestingly provides a pretty stable platform.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and that I tested it for a period of 10 days before reviewing. I tried it out on one car ride and actually napped with it, which says a LOT for me. Note this is made for an adult, too, and while it might fit a child, I would handle with care around them because they can get inside and put their arms in, too, and could get stuck or worse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IK75DOIJM0RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TK3QU5W#wasThisHelpful","R2IK75DOIJM0RI","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:13 Mins Apologies for any video quality issues beforehand. Current Amazon standards dictate that videos have to be under 100MB, so quality is normally compressed from 1080P to Medium Quality WM. Also, the review page currently lists these as white, but the products sampled here are black, as shown in the video.The Sentey Orbeat GS-4440 Gaming Headset is part of the Sentey Elite Gaming Headset line and is currently my favored headset for specific features. Comparing these to the Artix, you basically have a couple of spec differences, plugging differences, microphone design differences, and control distinctions. They are both nice headphones, however, and they both have distinct differences that make them viable headset choices.With regard to the Orbeat design, you have an outer framing that is sturdy and allows the rest of the design to fit a variety of heads, which is something I really like. Otherwise, you end up trying to find something to fit and everyone sees it differently depending on the size of their melon. You have an adjustable band that contours to the top of your head in a way that feels good and uses padding without going overboard, and you have proper ear padding so your ears are cradled, so you hear everything but the sound does not leak out, and so you are comfortable.For interface, you have a USB port and an audio and mic port, with the USB basically functioning for light control. I like this setup and think it does well, plus the abundantly lengthy cord helps with mobility and avoiding those fiascoes that get your social media acclaim for all the unwanted reasons.As far as controls go, they are all located on the cord. This is different than the Artix and is something I like, BUT there are times when I prefer one to the other or vice-versa. The control are easy to to use and include lighting options for the exterior, a control for the microphone, and volume controls. This does not come with vibration controls, so if that is a feature you want, the Artix has it.The microphone design is nice here, too, because you can adjust it to your desired positioning. This can come with a con depending on how close you adjust it to your face, so make sure to position it accordingly. With regard to the microphone, you have a lighting element attached to this that can be turned on or off, and I REALLY like that option. Otherwise, I get distracted by the lighting and it ends up getting me killed.The exterior areas around the ears glows as well, and the glowing is nice without being distracting. I like that about these because the glow does not distract others around me unless I really make it distract them, the color is nice and noticeable, and I can control whether it is on or off.Sound-wise, these are pretty nice sounding. I have used them for matches and for watching videos on social media, and the vocal use and range is pretty good. I do not mean that for music, mind you, but the things you normally consider for music are not the things you are considering for a gaming headset.Other specs include:( The Artix weigh in 385g, Mic sensitivity is listed at -46, and speakers at 107dB)Mic / Impedance ‚â§2,2 KŒ© / / Sensitivity -47dB±3dBSpeakers with 40mm Drive Diameter / 32Œ© Impedance / 10mw Rate Power / 20Hz~20KHz Frequency Response / ‚â•-60dB Signal to Noise Ratio 2% T.H.D / 92dB¬±3dB Sensitivity (S.P.L)Weight 350gPlease note that these were supplied for sampling purposes and that any opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V6PPJSLM8SRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F5MZEO#wasThisHelpful","R2V6PPJSLM8SRI","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:08 Mins After 4 weeks of testing, I feel really good about the Enpassion LED Submarine Light.It is bright, waterproof, is mountable, and come with a number of useful items including a solid case, two battery options including an 18650 battery and a single charger, and the flashlight itself. The Enpassion Submarine Light works for underwater use, nighttime use, and emergency situations and the fact that the rechargeable battery lasts a long time makes me feel good about adding it to a car or taking it out for camping, diving, and otherwise. Since it is sealed very well, you do not have to worry about water damage, and underwater use is something that I tested by first submerging this and then using it to backlight underwater filming with a Dazzne P2 action camera.This uses a rechargeable battery and supplies a charger, and requires 3AAA IF you feel like you want some other option for some reason, like the battery goes dead and you have 3AAA sitting around and no 18650.Note this was supplied for sampling purposes.

" 2:33 Mins I like novelty items, and when I was offered this Fashion Badge to try out, I kind of jumped at the opportunity. It is kind of funny in a way, too, because I really did not know what it was until I received the item. (This is currently a little under 11 dollars, to note).What you have here is a Micro-SD USB music player. It has some basic features including stop/play, forward and back, as well as volume up and down. You also have a power button, a USB charging slot, and a Micro-SD slot capable of using up to a 32GB card. Now, you end up playing tracks in order each time it turns on and off, so I would recommend using a smaller card, but you could carry around a huge tracklist if you so desired.Something that surprised me was the sound quality associated with these. Now, I am NOT saying these are something I would turn to for music, but for a kid or for novelty, it is great because it can be used. I honestly think that it sounds much better than the lower pricing point MP4 players I have seen recently, and that makes me kind of happy. NOTE that this do not come with headphones.I will be using this as a gift in conjunction with some kid-friendly headphones, because they will be enjoyed by those around as well as my child. The Micro-SD card stays in well so you do not have to worry about it popping out accidentally, and there are few items that can be damaged on it.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and that this was rated as a novelty with some uses but as something I found entertaining.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XETXCIHVBJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012GY3I1A#wasThisHelpful","R35XETXCIHVBJA","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zing Toy Legends Pop Gun is an interestingly fun throwback that reminds me of playing when I was younger. We would go outside and run around, reenacting scenes from our Wild West stories, when items like these were more readily available.The item itself is fairly simple; it is constructed completely out of plastic, with most of the frame made from one solid piece and the barrel being a moving piece, with a red cap on the end of the Zing Pop Gun. To use, you place the red cap in the end of the gun, press it down, and then pull down on the barrel of the gun. The resulting action will cause the end to ""pop"" out and hang via string, so it can be reloaded and utilized again and again. The process takes seconds, too, so there is no delay in playing with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HRU75UBLPJET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q86YIRG#wasThisHelpful","R2HRU75UBLPJET","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you need for operation aside from this is simple, too. You require:(1) A phone.(2) A VR application.(3) Headphones. Headphones are optional, but the experience is better with headphones.Suggested apps to test: (I'm prone to horror, so...) Sisters, Chair in a Room.With regard to phone, I want to note that I tested this with a Samsung GS5. Many, many other phone types are listed and the basic requirement settles on screen size, with 3.5-to-6"" screens working with this. I am going to eventually test this with a 4K screen and see the difference in presentation quality, but the S5 was pretty awesome.When it comes to applications, there are a lot of VR ones out there. The product page here notes that there are over 300, and I could well believe that. More importantly, there are loads of free ones to goof off with, so your item is not simply a novelty. You can find split screen applications, which help with tuning the device, and other types you can goof off with including classics and more. The first thing I tried was a roller coaster, and the second was a haunted house, both of which were interesting. I really enjoyed the immerse experience added with some of the horror games out there, and the fact that you can turn and look around is kind of freaky sometimes.The addition of the remote ""joystick"" was interesting, and this became easier to use with time. It has a few dedicated buttons but the size was my issue; still, the overall impact it had was really impressive. Now, the testing product did not come with NFC, but it was noted that NFC will come with the finalized product, so that was not deducted but I felt needed to be noted in this review.Headphones, in my opinion, add to the immersion as well, and I really enjoyed their addition. You do not have to have them and they do not come with the set, but they are fun to have included. The fact that the set allows them to be plugged in is a great thing, too, and speaks highly of this setup.Operation of this is really easy, although the instructions actually work against rather than with you. If you really think about what the pictures and instructions are saying you will figure the use out, but I personally think some updates should be added to make that portion more user-friendly. That does not impact actual use, however, so I am not deducting anything for non-concise instructions. If I did, half our modern products would never make a good grade.What you do is open the VR goggles by folding the area in the front down. This does so easily and reveals the mounting inside. You had an adjustable bracket that grips the phone from the top and bottom, and it holds pretty well. I think the thing should have included a lock on the front as well but it holds pretty nicely, just keep an eye out if you get too involved or you give it to a kid who moves around a lot. You have adjustment knobs on both sides and an adjustment allowing you to move it back and forth, which really works wonders. I am farsighted and wear glasses, too, but I could use them (without my glasses on) perfectly. You can then adjust the three straps that are situated via velcro, which is a great setup for that.I also like having a chair that can turn all the way around, so I do not have to explore while standing because that can be disorienting and especially in horror. Since the environment is so overwhelming, you might also want to avoid friends that could try and prank scare you as well.Overall, I loved using these and still play with them. My family has loved them as well, and we had a lot of fun getting together and goofing off while playing.

"I am torn on this product because of its smell.The coconut smell is something that I identify in association with something like activator, and since I do not like heavy scents, this seems overpowering to me. Were the product solely for me or were it not good at tending damaged and frayed hair, I would have rated it lower than a 3-star for the smell. The results it offered for my wife have been great, however, and she notes liking the product despite its smell. I do want to note the despite, and say that this can be construed as a positive because, despite the smell, it works well enough that I want to continue use. Still, that is around a 3 to me for family and my wife's experience .The Luseta set comes with two large bottles of product, which is nice for those with short hair because it will last forever or for those with longer hair because they tend to mow through product quickly. Something else that helps is the design of the pump, because the bottle seals pretty well and the pump dishes out enough product without overuse. Something that did throw me off was that the bottles look the same in the shower, though, and that can be somewhat confusing. We normally avoid issues with something like this through placement, but since this is a new product, there has been a little confusion here and there.Hopefully the smell will be changed in the future because it really is strong. Were that switched out, this would easily rank 4 or 5 stars, and the usefulness of it can rate it that way for people not bothered by strong scents.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes. Hopefully the scoring here and in other reviews shows that sampling does not impact review rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D6LQLUMQWQXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HRLI62#wasThisHelpful","R3D6LQLUMQWQXX","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really disliked this product and felt that it was flimsy and did not sport the added protection/ recovery options that individuals like Brett Favre note during advertisement. This was supplied for sampling and I have numerous problems with my knees, and I ended up leaving this to collect dust and was not impressed at all.I am not going to spend a lot of time on reviewing this item, but I will say that my cons are as follows:(1) Fit - When it comes to fit, I thought that this constricted too much to provide the necessary comfort for recovery and that it restricted range-of-motion. When I would try to flex my knee, for example, I found that it would cut in and that I was much more inhibited than without it. That is a very frustrating feeling when you consider the fact that you are already dealing with pain and that this is not supposed to increase your discomfort. I have seen individuals claim that this is partially due to sizing, and some people may not size correctly. I had a good size for my leg, however, and have a thin, bony leg as-is. for this to be uncomfortable for me says a lot on the way it wears.(2) Assistance - It did nothing for my pain. When you take that into account, I think that say a lot by itself and a lot on what properties a product like this touts.(3) Material - Overall, the material was flimsy and especially considering what other products add to the equation. I have other assistance devices and this did not compare to them in the least.Again, this product was supplied for review considerations and these are my own opinions. Others tout this working for them, but I honestly feel it is a fad at best and would turn elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39D2GOKFUGPTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNY3DS4#wasThisHelpful","R39D2GOKFUGPTH","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife likes this item for driving and I like it somewhat, and I much prefer the HD yellow visor to the shaded one and tend to avoid the shaded one altogether and the HD one at night.For me, I think the differences in preference are in the way you drive and more so in the way you set, with the average-height, posture-conscious driver finding this more beneficial than someone like myself. For me, I am tall and ride with my seat arching back, and the placement of this ends up only partially coming into my field-of-vision. In the daytime, I can still use the HD visor and benefit from the magnification and light-blocking aesthetics, and enjoy it in fog. That is why I give it three-stars, because my wife likes it and I end up using it somewhat, but at night I end up not wanting it because I feel it allows headlights to stream in and out and only give me a small block for positioning.Were this larger and had an army to add to positioning, I think I would like it better and hope the makers take and modify the existing design. As it stands, I only use it somewhat and only then because I wear glasses, and think I would not at all were it not for the glasses addition.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and that the opinions are solely my own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30YI1JYAGCQQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGP8I1S#wasThisHelpful","R30YI1JYAGCQQD","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up for my wife to hold her purse(s)/bags when she drives, but have since taken to storing some of my work items in it depending on what I am carrying. My wife likes it for her Timi and Leslie purse/diaper bag, and I like it for holding my camera bag when we are travelling or my action camera holders when I am driving and have my dash camera hooked up and need somewhere to put the casing.Installation is really easy and the purse pouch holds a lot; now, I would question some of the more monolithic purses I have seen people carrying around fitting, but your average purse or bag equivalent fits in this well. It secures easily and well by hooking around the headrests of the front seat, so you can hold your purse/items evenly. It also makes the space that we sometimes omit useful, and would even work to keep items in like tissues, cleaners (which are great if the baby is in the car), excess toys you want easily on-hand, and more.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and tested in our Caravan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0D72YGYC004/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7KIZPA#wasThisHelpful","R1E0D72YGYC004","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had seen these advertised so many times on TV and wondered if they really worked, so when I was asked if I wanted to sample them I was intrigued. Please note this was some time ago because I wanted to note the overall results over time, and that I wanted some weathering to see if the changes lasted. Also note that this was supplied for sampling purposes and that it was used on a 1999 Jeep to see what it could really do.Basically the process here involves a few steps, the first of which is washing you headlights to make sure they are clean and the second is putting on some gloves. You NEED to do this because of safety and follow all directions. Secondly, you are going to utilize the scouring pad, or wetsand, side of the pad provided to get the funk off. I was surprised by just how much of this was on there and this did take some time, but it was worth it. You can see if you have everything off if the light is wetted and it still appears murky, which did take me a little time to get right. After this is done, you are going to polish this down and further clean the lens, and then you will end up drying it. If there are any issues left, you repeat until cleaned.The set has everything you need in it (except a hose if you want to wash your vehicle beforehand), and is essentially a one-off operation. It made a huge difference on my vehicle's visuals, too, and I was extremely happy with the end results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G233ABY7599W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K889FCI#wasThisHelpful","R2G233ABY7599W","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:23 Mins I have always hated seeing a nice pair of headphones sitting on the floor or discarded on a desk and try to pick up something suitable for their storage/display.

"I picked these up so I could use them for goofing off with my daughter, and they have been fun for that. From a distance, and mind you I noted distance, they do appear to be tattoo sleeves, with interesting work in each. Some of the themes are somewhat adult, too, which makes them more fun for costuming and for pictures, and some appear to be tribal designs.In the picture attached, this is my almost two-year-old daughter and it fits on her leg. It will not fit on her arm because it is a little too large for that, but these are built like they would be more appropriate for kids or a very slender female arm than even a skinny male arm. They fit like pantyhose and you can see the seaming up-close, but I personally do not find that to be a problem. I did deduct a star from the review for the pictures showing them blending into bulky-looking arms, however, because the image stretches for larger arms and distorts somewhat. Even for slender arms, you can see this transpiring; I am very tall, with slender arms, and they fit my arms tightly. For Halloween or parties, that still works out and the addition to a child is more entertaining than I would have first considered.Note that I picked up the 6-piece for sampling and that they also offer a 10 and 20 piece.

"When I was first ask if I would be interested in considering these for review, I admit to be intrigued not necessarily by functionality alone but by what this  presentation has to say about compact tech uses. Looking at them, you can see how they could immediately be added to any USB ported device for novice use, and how more skilled users could combine them to other items easily. I am thinking of placing one in a small enclosure to utilize as a small nightlight for tinkering myself, and I am sure that people with more imaginative skills could have fun adding them to tinkering projects. As I have been playing with these, I have found a lot of ways to use them, from plugging them into USB chargers for lighting to adding them to my power banks to see what I am doing to adding them to computer outputs for assistance. This would be an easy way to check output and see if something is working without getting out a multimeter or other tools, and they do provide lighting to allow you to see. I could not see reading by just one, mind you, and since they cannot be turned off, they would be a constant source of lighting. They can be plugged in either way to provide lighting in an upward or downward-facing positioning, and they are cheap enough that toting one on a keychain would not be terrible because damaging one is not throwing a ton of money away. They are also made on a thick board, so you do not have to worry about them easily snapping/breaking.Please note these were supplied for sampling purposes and that I have enjoyed tinkering with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PCAELY33QU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TMYHM2E#wasThisHelpful","R32PCAELY33QU7","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 10:05 Mins The Foxnovo 123 with 2 inch LED screen has some uses that it would work for including dash camera use, which does not require a large video sensor and is more about overall picture than clarity. It comes with items that would make this something easy to set up and have right from go including the cut-out of skeletal case and 32 GB card, and for that use I would rate this higher than my overall review.It also works as a VERY basic introductory camera, given that you prefer the ease of use features to image sensor, which is something I would not particularly be swayed by considering the fact that there are other introductory level cameras. I let my daughter, who is not yet 2, play with this for example, and I would allow her to film with this rather than a more expensive device. She cannot flip the waterproof case switch and open it easily, and that was fun to see her do while playing in her little pool. Still, there are loads of cost-effective models on the market.My video breaks things down more, but my main issues here are as follows:- Image quality. The video sensor here is around half of even the more cost-effective competition. Again, for dash use, this is acceptable to even good, but I do not like the idea of diving or taking it out and using it under a lot of touted conditions. I have stuck it underwater for quick use, but that is about the extent this worked for.- This is a 720P camera max, furthering video quality complications.- The waterproofing is 10M, which is 1/2 to 1/3rd of that offered by many other cameras.-The shape means that a lot of generic gear offered by several companies will not work with this. I do not like having to buy my supplies from one specific manufacturer because I like to shop around ANd I like my gear to work for multiple camera types.It does have some pros going for it that you may consider including:- Ease of use. You literally hit a button, flip the switch on the side, and click. I'd like to see this functionality ported over to another model with an updated sensor.- It is ready to go out of the box since it comes with all the needed gear.- It has a 32 GB card with it.This was received at a discounted cost and these are my opinions. I have tested it over a month in a variety of conditions and compared/contrasted it with other model types.

" 7:15 Mins I am a fan of the newer-style metallic mounting that companies offer, so I like the incorporation of a metal tripod mount and screws with this. I also like the adjustment wrench because they help no matter what, and the metal accessory is a vast improvement over the plastic one I sometimes use.The set comes with two metal screws of differing sizes plus the tripod mount, and it comes with a plastic screw as well. It also comes with the monopod, which is a smaller model and good for taking this out and recording on land. The lanyard wrist attachment is nice to keep you from dropping it, and the added grip pattern keeps it from being easily dropped even if you hand is wet. The weight is good, too, with it having a bit of heft but nothing that is not manageable.The set also comes with mounts that allow you to stick them to all sorts of surfaces, and the adhesive is strong. If you have used a set before, these are comparable with the name-brand ones, and if not, they are tough. I like these mounting types as well because you can place your chest/wrist/head mounting and use the same bracketing with them.There is also a bag for holding, which I did not include in the video not because of quality, but because I combine all accessories into a larger hard shell bag. If you are going out and do not carry a hard shell, however, this works to keep things together and is small enough to fit in a pocket for use.Please note this set was supplied for sampling purposes, has been tested (the monopod, bracketing, and more have been out a lot), and that these are solely my opinions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U3M7X5JK1PKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKXG2A8#wasThisHelpful","R3U3M7X5JK1PKU","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been really pleased with the Aquafree Dry Bag so far because it essentially allows me an extra bag on outdoor and/or fishing expeditions to keep my items dry. I had never consider just how difficult that could be until I was caught in the rain with a modern phone, an IPOD, a DSLR, and an action camera and needed to get them out of the rain quickly. And, yeah, it is nice to be able to carry a soundtrack with you and take pictures of whatever you accomplish, but destroying thousands of dollars of equipment can also ruin an outing, which i luckily did not but came pretty close to.The Aquafree Dry Sack folds up quite easily and stores simply, so I do not have to tote anything extra, which I am thankful for. I can add device safety or keep dry clothing while storing this at a camping site, in a kayak compartment, or even in my fishing gear bag, and that is nice because carrying recording equipment, charging items, and so on can make things a tad difficult sometimes. The waterproof material is thick enough to avoid smaller punctures that take out a lot of supposedly durable items, too, and that makes a lot more reliable than many of the items i have tried.Now, I tested this outdoors, taking it out and using it when a nice little storm blew by, and it worked like a charm. i was able to quickly put in  some dry clothing and my DSLR and IPOd (i already had my phone in a waterproof pouch) and nothing got wet. I cannot begin to tell you how good it feels to be able to change clothing after a huge rainfall when you are far away from everything, or how nice it is not to have to worry. The color makes it easy to spot, so tipping a kayak or a canoe would not be as horrendous, either. I am thinking of preloading it with some of my survival items like dry matches and other accessories, because even though some already have waterproofing, this would add further protection and make them easy to find.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and kept for almost three weeks. These included two outings over 4 days time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFKKM9PLT74M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XDMZ598#wasThisHelpful","R2QFKKM9PLT74M","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the kid that likes to hit everything or is simply learning how to play sports, here is a ball-and-bat combo that is perfect for them and the parents that sometimes need a helping hand. I say that as my daughter approaches those exploration years and mimics things she sees on TV, and when having a soft foam baseball bat definitely seems preferable to finding my television or tablet assaulted by a reenactment of last night's game. Here, you have an item you do not have to worry about being swung inside and hitting someone because it is super soft and still allows your child to play sports. It allows goofing off and working out frustration at the same time, which I again prefer to a wooden or metal bat.On the subject of being soft, I tried this out by at first wacking it against my hand. Finding that did not hurt at all, I continued to do so to see if it would at least sting. It did not. That surprised me because I expected the interior design to at least carry weight, but the soft foam actually more than makes up for it. I like the design because the blue sticks out without looking too kiddy or too safety colored, and because it is easy to grip and hold. Additionally, you have here is a bat that works great for teeball practice, since a teeball bat cannot be over 33 inches in length and more than 2 1/4 in diameter (according to the 2015 official teeball bat rules). You have something that can be practiced in most environments as your child learns how to swing and connect, plus there is a soft ball for your child to practice fielding with.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and was played with thoroughly by both a child and their adult counterpart before reviewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADBD4UIX6MRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZF3YMV0#wasThisHelpful","RADBD4UIX6MRG","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:16 Mins The Sandmarc Telescoping Pole has quite a few things going for it including the quality of the design, the way it locks into place and holds without any issue, and some of the safety elements. It notes being a ""selfie stick"" in the product description provided, but if this is a selfie stick, it is the selfie stick that lords over all other selfie sticks. I say that because it is thicker than most other devices and that increases durability, plus it extends well and does not thin while doing so. This is nice because you do not have to worry about the upper portions weakening as it extends and giving out somewhere just out-of-reach.Speaking of extension, what you essentially have here is a 17"" device that can be extended to 40"", so you have quite a bit of reach with it. That is a lot of height or depth to control by hand, and you can control it through the easily-gripped handle and the adjustable wrist strap. What's more, it locks safely and securely, so you do not have to worry about holding it skyward or sticking it underwater, wiping out, and finding your pole lost or destroyed. I like the method it uses for locking, too, because the locks are secured in place and twisted/released when you want to compress it, so you do not have to worry about this giving way immediately or over time.Please note this has been tested for around two weeks, and was taken out with a Dazzne P2 to test how well it worked. I have been nothing but pleased by this, and think anyone wanting quality could benefit from the Sandmarc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXJ6TBXH8P09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014414KFG#wasThisHelpful","R3JXJ6TBXH8P09","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:28 Mins The Ho Stevie Carbon Fiber Floating Grip Stick is perfect for a videoing both on the water and on land, making it a great addition to your action camera accessories. I personally use a Dazzne P2 and I love taking my Dazzne out fishing, and this allows me to get great angles while also adding control and stability. That means I can position my angle on the fly, dip my camera underwater without worrying about it being mounted well or not, and never have to worry about losing it if something happens and I let go. When you combine this with the Ho Stevie product guarantee, that makes me feel good about chasing that hard-to-get angle while landing a fish, kayaking, or just wading and having fun.I also like that the Ho Stevie has a place for accessories on the bottom, so you can mount it to something or use a tripod when setting it up. In the video I place a cheaper tripod on it to show just how easy this is to set and to detach, and quality ones are just as easy to place. You can also attach different types of mounts this way, and doing so will add numerous angles/vantage points while you are concentrating on other things.The Ho Stevie Grip Stick feels good when handled as well, and it is a good size to avoid being damaged while also being easy to place and store. That makes it something I really like and appreciate when I am out and trying to carry my camera pack and only one more additional accessory pack.Please note this item was supplied for sampling purposes and that it was used for three weekends before reviewing.

" 7:09 Mins When it comes to powerbanks, I feel like something of an addict because I pick them up all the time. To date, this will be the 27th powerbank I have tried out, and I note that to say that I have a method of testing them and look for specifics in their use. Testing includes the Digital LED multimeter shown in the video to note several things as well, including if it is performing correctly with output and if it cuts on/off like it is advertised.To date, this is one of my two favorite powerbanks, with the Zoom powerbank products ranking there as well.When it comes to the Kayo Maxtar, you have a combination of aesthetics and functionality coming together to make a lovely product. As far as looks go, I like the way the color blends with the different styles of design, adding gloss and flat features to the item. The size makes it appealing on both a looks and functional level, and the positioning of the ports and the button assist with dual roles, too. Added to that is the presentation of the LED internal lighting, which also compliments both areas.Functionality-wise, the Kayo is a beast when it comes to its size, touting 13,000 mAh. You see devices tout things like this and make erroneous claims all the time, but the Kayo delivers on its charging promises. It also cools well, which is something that a lot of the more compact models have trouble with, and this means a lot because I loathe an item that touts ease-of-use but then complicates it through modification.This model sports two output ports, one at 1A and one at 2.1A, so you have something for both tablets (the large number) and items like phones or action camera batteries (like the Dazzne P2, for instance). Both are clearly marked, so you do not confuse them. There is also an input for easy access when you are charging it.A feature I REALLY like here is the LED readout with percentage of charge. This is something that a lot of powerbanks do not come with, and it adds more concise measurements on what you need and how much power you currently have on-hand. It additionally has an indicator with a small light that notes when something is charging.Please note that this was provided for sampling and that it has the potential to be very useful or dangerous, so I accordingly test it heavily. Safety means a lot to me because it involves people I know and care about, so I accordingly do NOT allow sampling to impede review rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8W5DK3OVUSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1QVWX4#wasThisHelpful","R3B8W5DK3OVUSB","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you think bamboo, what are some keywords that come to mind? Well, if you are like how I was before I began exploring alternative children's products, you might not automatically think of ""soft"" as a way to describe it. After doing some research into bamboo for use in my home for cooking, however, I found that bamboo could not only be soft but that it also has qualities that promote health and agree with humans in ways many other items do not. That led to findings with other home and homeopathic uses, with headphone uses and how they promote sound and cleanliness at the same time, and then into kid's products and bamboo's potential. Add to that the way the items in The Motherhood Collection are crafted without pollutants and with care and you have something truly worthwhile.Without overly pulling up the soapbox, we know that our children should not be exposed to chemicals, dyes, and other irritants that we are not allowed to test on animals but that some companies still try to pimp onto our children. Diapers truly drove that point home to me, and other products marketed to those individuals that cannot speak for themselves continue such terrible trend. My daughter, who turns 2 at the end of October, first made me aware of this when she developed a rash at the hospital that would not cease and that was only fixed after we switched from their preferred brands to chemical-free ones. That is why I am glad for alternatives like these washcloths, because you can tell the difference.From packaging on, you have items that are presented in a way that seems to indicate that more time was spent on them, making them perfect for gifting or personal use. Each washcloth is wrapped by itself and all of them are extremely soft, to the point that I considered keeping them for me. Honestly, the baby even used the qualifier ""soft"" to let me know just how much she liked them. They are dye-free and you can tell that as well, and they have a look of quality to them. Even after washing them three times so far, they still look and feel perfect.Please note that these were supplied for sampling purposes and that samples involving children specifically are extremely important to me. Accordingly, I test them to the best of my ability and never allow sampling to influence rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLA5Z63VVJ9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J9BYC8#wasThisHelpful","R2XLA5Z63VVJ9Q","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:01 Mins The EC Technology Screw-on Tripod is a nice little item to have for a number of different devices including monopods, telescoping poles, selfie sticks, action cameras, DSLRs, and more. I use a tripod in my reviews for overhand use, and I also use them for quick pictures with regard to DSLR use or setting my action camera on some type of mount.Unlike your cheaper tripod attachments, this provides a stable platform, with 3 metal legs attached by no-slip grips, allowing you to set up your device and go. The fact that the legs are made of metal means that there will be no stress added and surprise breaks later down the road, which is something I truly appreciate. The way it screws in allows it to work quickly and easily, so you are not left fumbling with a monster device while trying to snap a quick picture.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and used over almost 3 weeks. This included outings with all the devices named, and the tripod worked well. You can also review other reviews and see it attached; I only used a cheaper tripod for this review to make certain this could be seen and demonstrated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCNS4QJ5E9H0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011D5XV5G#wasThisHelpful","RCNS4QJ5E9H0D","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:59 Mins The Ruban 6.2 Foot Universal Security Cable is a great way to add security when you and your laptop are on the go. It's interesting and odd to type that, too, because a few years ago I would have considered something like this overkill, but as more and more people target consumers, you have to think deterrent. I say that because, if you are like me, you have 1000s of dollars in hardware and software combinations, not to mention the keepsakes inside your devices that cannot be replaced.The cable reminds me a lot of a bike chain in that it is basically cable coated with a smoother plastic overlay, thereby allowing you to handle it while also providing strength. You hook it into your laptop via the security port on your computer, flip the device into the locked position, and secure it to a desk or whatever you want. The extra-long cord allows you to place it just about anywhere, and the look of this works to confuse snatch-and-grab individuals looking for an easy mark.Setting this is easy; you have detailed instructions walking you through use, which is basically just starting with a 0000 default code, setting it to your preference, locking and going.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and has some great real-world uses. You could use it with other items as well; basically they just need a place to lock into, which quite a few items have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QB45TIQT37EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1WO7OY#wasThisHelpful","R2QB45TIQT37EI","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:16 Mins The Sandmarc Telescoping Pole has quite a few things going for it including the quality of the design, the way it locks into place and holds without any issue, and some of the safety elements. It notes being a ""selfie stick"" in the product description provided, but if this is a selfie stick, it is the selfie stick that lords over all other selfie sticks. I say that because it is thicker than most other devices and that increases durability, plus it extends well and does not thin while doing so. This is nice because you do not have to worry about the upper portions weakening as it extends and giving out somewhere just out-of-reach.Speaking of extension, what you essentially have here is a 17"" device that can be extended to 40"", so you have quite a bit of reach with it. That is a lot of height or depth to control by hand, and you can control it through the easily-gripped handle and the adjustable wrist strap. What's more, it locks safely and securely, so you do not have to worry about holding it skyward or sticking it underwater, wiping out, and finding your pole lost or destroyed. I like the method it uses for locking, too, because the locks are secured in place and twisted/released when you want to compress it, so you do not have to worry about this giving way immediately or over time.Please note this has been tested for around two weeks, and was taken out with a Dazzne P2 to test how well it worked. I have been nothing but pleased by this, and think anyone wanting quality could benefit from the Sandmarc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R346B3YRO71EU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WZZVI4#wasThisHelpful","R346B3YRO71EU8","A96JD9312DHWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A96JD9312DHWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where I work, we end up requiring readings on individuals multiple times daily, and when you need something like that, you want something that is going to be comfortable to wear, quick to give readings, and accurate. In this type of setting, a device like this works out well, and it is not solely limited to these types of use. Take, for example, your own personal needs and add them to this.How often could you benefit from knowing something that is oftentimes reserved only for health medical persons or for sampling along with your blood pressure and heat beat? Have you ever wondered how your rates fare and whether or not you are healthy or getting healthier, or have you been working out and wonder what impact it has? Have you done something recently and wonder how it impacts your health? I did the last one in my personal life, for instance, when I stopped smoking and wanted to know how that impacted my health.Knowing can be great motivation, too.Before buying, know you are going to need 2 AAA batteries and that they are not included so pick some up (i hate not having them when I get a new product). They will last a long time, so you can pick up rechargeables or probably have a set last for quite some time due to the fact that this cuts off in less than 10 seconds if there is no reading.Aesthetically, this looks sharp and comes in multiple colors, so you can pick and choose exactly what speaks to you. For myself, I picked up the white exterior with green inlay, and i think it looks nice.This is very simple to use; you have one button and it slides on, you read it, and that is it. Very simple. It is soft inside and comfortable, too, so you do not have to worry about it being annoying for yourself or for troublesome others.Please note this was supplied for sampling purposes and tested bot in the home and outside.

"This is the third book in the Lockwood and Co series.  This was a wonderful addition to this creepy middle grade series; I thought it was the best book in this series so far.  I absolutely loved it.A supernatural outbreak is happening in London and absolutely baffling Scotland Yard.  Even before being called in to help with this outbreak Lockwood and Co are being run ragged.  Lucy is extremely surprised when, during her absence, Anthony and George hire the perky and efficient Holly Munro as an assistant.  Then Lockwood and Co get called in on a high profile case involving a ghostly boy and bloody footprints.  They rush to solve the case and it ends up being their entry into the bigger mystery surrounding the larger supernatural outbreak.This was a wonderful continuation of the Lockwood and Co series; I really really enjoyed it.  I continue to enjoy this world where children must save adults from the ghosts that haunt them.  The book is very creepy and very well done; full of mystery and action.We learn more about Lockwood‚Äôs past in this book and more about the haunted past of London in general.  All the characters are incredibly enjoyable and well done.  The addition of Holly made things even more interesting.The politics between the different ghost fighting companies remains intense and interesting.  I also love that we continue to learn more about why the appearance of ghosts happened and why it has been intensifying.The plot is incredibly well done.  Things are just creepy and gory enough to give you the chills, but are never completely terrifying.  This is an excellent series that combines mystery, action, horror, and supernatural elements in a story that ages middle grade and older will love.Overall this is an incredibly well done middle grade horror series that I think adults will enjoy just as much as kids.  I love the world, the characters, and the mystery.  The story is incredibly engaging and hard to put down.  I would definitely recommend to middle grade readers who love the creepy and supernatural.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WX8TM2UYGSF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484709683#wasThisHelpful","R2WX8TM2UYGSF9","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this through the Amazon Vine program to review.  These are decent place-mats.  From a distance they look like woven fabric; up close you can definitely tell they are plastic and a bit cheap looking.The color is very nice and neutral and matches just about anything.  The mats seem durable and are easy to rinse off and wash.I have a couple complaints about packaging: first of all the mats were folded over in the box when I received them and even after a couple weeks of laying on our kitchen table they still have that crease, second there is a really gooey sticker on the back of the mats which left a lot of sticker residue which I haven't been able to get off.Overall these are good everyday use place mats.  They are easy to clean and decent looking from a distance.  The plastic material is durable but a bit cheap looking.  Packaging could have been better.  However, these are decent mats for the price and I would recommend.Pros:- Good Price- Nice color- Easy to clean- Durable- Look nice from afarCons:- Cheap feeling/looking up close- Came folded in the box and seem to be permanently creased- Sticker on the back of the mat leaves a sticky residue that I have yet to fully remove.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPB2WLBTV6VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005K6RLY2#wasThisHelpful","R3VPB2WLBTV6VK","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got copy of this book to review through NetGalley.  Previous to this book I had read The Child Thief by Brom and Alias Hook by Lisa Jensen, both were Peter Pan retellings that I really enjoyed.  This book was okay, but pretty slow and predictable.  Also a quick caution this book is the start to a new series and doesn‚Äôt resolve anything.Wendy Darling is living a perfectly respectable life in London, her only issue being her budding romance with Booth which her mother doesn‚Äôt approve of.  Then Peter Pan shows up one night and whisks Wendy and her brothers to Neverland.  At first Wendy is overwhelmed with joy at the beauty and freedom of Neverland.  However as time goes on she realizes she is forgetting her former life and that life with the Lost Boys is not what it seems.This book starts out very slowly (you are 30% of the way through the book before you even get to Neverland).  The book follows the Disney version of Neverland (and maybe the original book which I have ironically never read) very closely in the beginning.  It‚Äôs pretty boring because it‚Äôs something most of us have either seen or read before.I had trouble engaging with the characters.  Wendy is somewhat despicable, her beau Booth is right...she is not brave and she is not committed.  She is blown away by Peter‚Äôs good looks and attention and is a fairly shallow heroine.  This changes some as the book goes on.  Probably my favorite character in the book is Wendy‚Äôs little brother Michael, who is very sweet and honest and resists the corruption of Neverland more than anyone else.  Tink is an interesting character but she also seemed a bit shallow and one dimensional to me and she isn‚Äôt in the story much.This book is marketed as showing readers the dark side of Neverland and I guess it kind of does in a very light YA kind of way.  However, it was fairly predictable and never all that dark or surprising.  This is just the start of a series and I wish it had been marketed as such; the story pretty much stops right in the middle without any resolution which left me frustrated and disappointed.The most positive thing about this book is that it is beautifully written with excellent description.I think part of my issue with this book is that I have read much better retellings of Peter Pan.  Brom wrote a retelling of the Peter Pan story called The Child Thief, which was amazing and incredibly dark.  Lisa Jensen wrote a spectacular retelling of the Peter Pan story called Alias Hook which I absolutely adored; this is a version that is sympathetic to Captain Hook and told an amazing twist to the Peter Pan story.Overall I found Wendy Darling to a bit empty, fluffy, and incomplete; it‚Äôs okay but nothing special.  It does have some excellent imagery, but if you are truly interested in a creative retelling of the Peter Pan story check out The Child Thief by Brom or Alias Hook by Lisa Jensen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV3SUBZMMHMBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940716950#wasThisHelpful","RV3SUBZMMHMBQ","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved the first book in this series and enjoyed the second book as well.  This is the final book in this series and honestly my least favorite of the bunch.  The beginning is a bit awkward and hard to engage with but the story improved as it continued.The story starts with Titus and Iolanthe in the desert with the Rebel forces.  The Bane is still hunting them and has issued an ultimatum; Titus must hand over Iolanthe or the Bane will destroy all of Titus‚Äôs realm.  Titus and Iolanthe decide they must finally cut off the Bane at his source; they must find his original body and destroy it.  However that is not an easy task.  To get to the Bane‚Äôs body they will have to journey into the heart of Atlantis and deep into the dark depths of the Bane‚Äôs fortress.This book starts right in the middle of a battle in the desert, pretty much where the last book left off.  However, it was a bit jarring to be thrown right back into that battle while you were struggling to remember what happened in the last book (for some reason the 2nd book was a bit forgettable for me) and try to remember who was who.  I really struggled with the first 20% or so of this book and almost stopped reading it.However the story does pick up and gets better as Iolanthe and Titus get back on the road and come up with a plan to destroy the Bane.  There are a lot of surprises and the 2nd half of the book is very good.  I think the main problem with this book is pacing; the beginning and parts of the middle really drag while the end is absolutely crammed full of revelations and action scenes.  It makes for an inconsistently paced story that‚Äôs a bit hard to read.The other complaint I have is that despite Titus and Iolanthe‚Äôs declared love for each other they still don‚Äôt trust each other and work together.  They don‚Äôt respect each other‚Äôs skills but are constantly trying to protect and exclude each other.  I have a real problem with this.  They do start working together a bit better toward the end of the book; but throughout most of the story they make a lot of the same relationship mistakes over and over again,Towards the end of the book there are some awesome magical battles which were very fun to read about.  Additionally I enjoyed some of the plot twists in the second half.  I also enjoyed how everything wrapped up.Overall this was a decent conclusion to the Elemental Trilogy.  I think it could have been a much better book if it had been paced better.  I did enjoy how the story was wrapped up so that was nice.  I would recommend this whole series to fans of magic heavy fantasy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FIDI6F6HJD35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFYIZCI#wasThisHelpful","R3FIDI6F6HJD35","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So Marrill re-enters the Pirate Stream along with her babysitter to find the source of the Iron Tide and prevent disaster from striking her world.  Marrill finds herself reunited with Fin and the Kraken crew on a journey to the crazy world of Monerva...a world no one can seem to leave.I continue to really enjoy the creative premise of this book and all of the wonderful and interesting characters throughout.  There is some spectacular world-building here; I love all the parallel worlds and the idea of a Pirate Stream...basically a stream of magic.  I also really enjoy the Map to Everywhere that is an incredibly powerful piece of magic that can take you anywhere you want to go.The characters are very well done.  Marrill‚Äôs babysitter joins the crew in this adventure and she was extremely fun to read about.  I especially enjoy the friendship between Marrill and Fin (a boy that no one can ever remember).  In this book we finally find out why Fin is always forgotten and it was incredible to learn that back story.There are some truly creative and awe-inspiring scenes in this book.  I loved the city built on a cliff that is eternally falling and people are eternally building their way up higher and higher to prevent falling off the bottom.  It was just very imaginative and way these scenes are described really made them come alive.Overall I absolutely loved this continuation of the Map to Everywhere series.

"This is the 2nd book in the Snow Like Ashes series, I got a copy of this book through NetGalley to review.  This was an absolutely wonderful continuation of the Snow Like Ashes series; I absolutely loved it.  We see so much of this complex world and learn so much more about these intriguing characters...I just adored it.Meira‚Äôs people are free and safe and have been for the last three months thanks to Cordell.  However now Cordell wants the Winterians to open more and more of their mines digging and searching for something.  The result is that the Winterians aren‚Äôt that much more free than they were before.  Things change when the Winterians stumble upon something in their searching, unearthing Primoria‚Äôs lost chasm of magic.The King of Cordell immediately orders his son, Theron, and Meira to journey to the other Rhythms and Seasons in search of answers to how to open this chasm of magic.  However, Meira is afraid...the last time the people of Primoria had access to this sort of magic they made Decay magic.  So Meira has her own agenda on these visits; she wants to amass  allies so that the Winterians can stand up to Cordell at last.We get to see a lot more of this amazing world in this book.  I am amazed and in awe of Raasch‚Äôs world-building skills.  We journey through many more of the Seasons and Rhythms here and get to meet their rulers and citizens.There are also many more new and amazing characters in this book.  Some of them were incredibly fun to read about and I can‚Äôt wait to learn more about them.Of course there is still a bit of a love triangle between Meira and Theron and Mather.  I was a huge Theron fan last book, well let‚Äôs just say times are a'changing.  Although I still enjoyed Theron as a character, he has an agenda of his own.  Mather‚Äôs isn‚Äôt in the story much in the beginning but he makes his entrance in a big way later on.  All of these characters just have so much depth and are so complex, they are incredibly engaging and interesting to read about.There are a lot of politics, some magic and action and mystery in the story as well.  The books take on a bit of a treasure hunting feel to it as Meira tries to track down these keys that are supposed to open the chasm of magic.  We also see a lot more as Meira as a Queen in this book; she has grown and changed quite a bit from the first book.Overall this was an absolutely amazing story that I really loved.  This is fantasy at its best and is an excellent blend of awesome world-building, intriguing and engaging characters, and a plot that is so engrossing you won‚Äôt want to put the book down.  This is a somewhat lengthy book but I read it in a couple days...just like the last one.  Fans of this series will  not be disappointed.  I would recommend to those who enjoy fast-paced fantasy books featuring strong heroines.  I would also recommend fans of this series pick up Sarah Maas‚Äôs Throne of Glass series or Rae Carson‚Äôs Fire and Thorns series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PAQW3QO0IVI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062286951#wasThisHelpful","R2PAQW3QO0IVI4","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a copy of this book to review through NetGalley.  This was another fun tomb-raiding paranormal adventure featuring Owl and her cohorts.  I really enjoyed this book a lot.Owl is getting used to her new job working for Mr. Kurosawa, a red dragon who loves ancient artifacts.  He has his sights set on some pieces from the Syrian City of the Dead.  Owl is always up for a good theft, but this is one of the most highly guarded dig sites in the world and there is a rumor that some of the items might be cursed.  Oh and not to mention the items might enable people to resurrect the dead leading to an undead army ravaging the earth.  Of course, Owl is up for the challenge in her own stubborn way.I loved all the tomb-raiding, the ancient curses, and interesting mythological monsters we run into throughout the story.  There is a lot of action and I really enjoy the scenes where Owl is creeping through ancient and creepy tombs.I really enjoy the characters, they have a lot of depth and are fun to read about.  I love Rynn, he does a great job of backing up Owl and doesn‚Äôt take her crap (well he does take some of her crap but he is trying to hold her accountable for her actions).  I also enjoyed Captain, the vampire attack cat.  Although I continue to find some of the scenes with Captain to be a bit forced and improbable.My only problem with this book is that Owl doesn't grow or change much as a character.  She keeps making the same mistakes over and over again.  It's painful to read about and a bit frustrating.  I really don‚Äôt understand why her friends put up with her continued stubbornness and incompetent behavior.Overall this was an excellent continuation of the Owl series.  I continue to enjoy the world, the action, the mythology, and the characters.  My only big problem with this book is that we aren‚Äôt seeing Owl grow any as a character.  I would recommend to those who enjoy action packed urban fantasies full of adventure.  Fans of Jim Butcher, Kim Harrison, and Tomb Raider should enjoy this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NHHHZ7CFWZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCNHJQ#wasThisHelpful","R30NHHHZ7CFWZ4","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh book in the Remy Chandler series.  I think it was probably my least favorite book in this series so far.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me just losing interest, or if the stories have just veered way to far from their urban fantasy roots...but I struggled to finish this one.Remy is on the brink of death, struck down by one of the Bone Masters (famous assassins who never miss their targets).  The Almighty himself sends Remy‚Äôs consciousness to an alternate reality where Remy struggles to combat the evil there.  Meanwhile Remy‚Äôs friends are trying everything they can do to bring him back and defend his body against the rest of the Bone Master clan.  To complicate matters the Almighty has announced that he wishes to forgive Morningstar and go forward with Unification of the realms.  As if this wasn‚Äôt enough The Forever Man has plans of his own that involve getting his revenge on The Almighty once and for all.This was an okay continuation of the Remy Chandler series.  The story switches POV a lot (many times per chapter) and was a bit confusing (at least in the ARC these switches weren't marked well, so you would have to read for a bit and then figure out that you were reading from a different point of view).There's a bit of a time travel/parallel reality thing going on in this book and I felt like it didn't work all that well for the story.  The story has just gotten too convoluted.  In fact I would definitely recommend reading the books previous to this one because if you don‚Äôt you are going to be incredibly confused.The writing flowed decently and I still enjoyed some of the characters, but at the end I was kind of like ""Eh...well I guess I won‚Äôt be reading more of that series.""  The book is long and feels long, and really could have benefited from a bit more editing and tightening up of the storyline.Previous to this book this has been a very solid urban fantasy series that deals with angel mythology.  However, after reading this book I think I am done with this series.  It wraps up at a good place and I just didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as previous ones.Overall an okay addition to the Remy Chandler series.  If you are a huge fan of the series give it a read.  The series seems to have left its urban fantasy roots and veered into some strange territory involving parallel realities which I thought was too convoluted to enjoy.  I won‚Äôt be reading more of this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14YC2Z9J31E13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451470028#wasThisHelpful","R14YC2Z9J31E13","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a copy of this book to review through NetGalley.  I really enjoyed Lewis‚Äôs last book Stitching Snow and was super excited to read this new book from her.  This book is supposed to be a retelling of the Seven Swans.  Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt like this book as much.  I had trouble engaging with the main character and thought that the plot was a bit convoluted and slow moving.Liddi is the youngest of eight siblings (and the only girl) and a heiress to the richest tech company in the galaxy.  However when her brothers disappear and the men lurking outside her house end up not being the normal media types but are out to kill her...well she knows something is wrong.  Liddi is able to escape but in doing so gets drawn into a galaxy wide conspiracy.  She ends up escaping to a planet that she didn‚Äôt even knew existed and has to rely on a boy her age named Tiav.  Tiav is a dignitary and is trying to understand Liddi‚Äôs intentions to help her plead her case.Right from the start I had trouble liking Liddi as a character.  She just seems so whiny and lacks self-confidence.  She does grow some as the story continues, but I had trouble engaging with her throughout.Much of the plot involves around these portals that are used to get from place to place.  This whole concept was hard to picture and a bit ambiguous; it was hard to care about what was happening here and hard to imagine it in my head.There is a romance between Liddi and Tiav, but honestly this also fell short for me.  The romance felt forced and cold; almost as if the whole story would have been better off if Liddi and Tiav had remained good friends (however, this being a YA book that wasn‚Äôt going to happen).  There is never much trust between the two which bothered me.There are a number of parallels between this book and the Seven Swans fairy tale.  Liddi has seven brothers and they get trapped in the portals (in this case by an evil scientist).  The evil scientist implants a device in Liddi‚Äôs throat so she can‚Äôt talk (so she is forced to communicate in other ways).  Liddi has to perform some actions with the portal to free her brothers which leave her hands shredded by the energy use (similar to the damage in the fairy tale the character gets from weaving nettles).  So there are parallels; they feel pretty forced at times but they are there.A quick comment; throughout the majority of the book Liddi can‚Äôt talk and is forced to type out the sounds on a computer phonetically since she can‚Äôt read either (reading was abolished in this world in favor of voice recognition).  This means that much of Liddi‚Äôs speech in the book is incredibly hard to read unless you read it out loud to yourself.  I hate it when authors do this...it is really really annoying.  So just be aware of that.  The story would have been just as effective if the author had mentioned that Liddi has to spell things phonetically and then had actually written things out correctly.  Ugh, this drove me nutso!Overall this was an okay science fiction retelling of The Seven Swans.  It definitely wasn‚Äôt great and it definitely wasn‚Äôt as good as Stitching Snow.  I had trouble engaging with the characters and staying interested in the somewhat convoluted storyline.  At times the parallels between this story and the Seven Swans felt pretty forced, but it was okay.  I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend reading this book.  If you are interested in reading some great retellings of the Seven Swans fairy tale check out Daughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier or Dearest by Alethea Kontis.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHRE9LE8BFA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423185153#wasThisHelpful","R3GHRE9LE8BFA8","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a well done book about eating disorders.  The story was engaging and easy to read.  It was heartwarming and thought-provoking.Janie‚Äôs issues climax after Janie Ryman ruins her half sister‚Äôs wedding with a big barfing scene in the men's bathroom.  After this (and publically admitting that she has been binging and purging for a while) Janie is placed into Golden Slopes a facility that deals with teens with eating disorders.  Here Janie must navigate the politics of the Barfers and Starvers and deal with the psychiatrist who wants to fish out all of her deep dark secrets.  Janie is desperate to get out of the ward, but will she escape it before divulging the dark secret that led to her ultimate meltdown?I liked that this dealt with multiple types of eating disorders and also dealt with eating disorders in both men and women.  It was interesting to see which issues in the characters pasts led to their eating disorders.The book alternates between Janie‚Äôs journal entries and her everyday activities.  Janie was a very engaging heroine; she is smart, hard-working, and likable...she just obsesses over food.The other characters who surround her are just as interesting.  This book goes beyond just classic bulimia and anorexia.  There is also a guy that gets brought to Golden Slopes for alternatively starving and binging himself for his Wrestling career.There is some humor in there and the dialogue between characters is witty and engaging.  This was a quick read that was a bit heart-wrenching but still hopeful.  As a parent and a woman it made me think a lot about how my actions affect my child and how the actions of society affect the young women who live in it.  People‚Äôs relationship with food is a complicated one whether they are struggling with obesity or self inflicted starvation.The only other fictional book I've read about eating disorders was Wintergirls and I actually liked that book a bit more than this one, it was just more intense and impossible to put down.Overall a well done book about growing up and eating disorders.  The story was well written and engaging and I enjoyed all of the characters.  I would definitely recommend for to anyone looking for a fictional books about eating disorders.  I would also recommend reading Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRZ72UWV0UH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545052378#wasThisHelpful","R1RRZ72UWV0UH7","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this through the Amazon Vine program.  I am a fan of shounen and have read quite a bit of it.  Some of my favorites are the Hellsing series, Berserk, and Claymore.  With a title like Ninja Slayer Kills, I wasn‚Äôt expecting a masterpiece but something that was action packed, full of ninja awesomeness, and maybe a bit tongue in cheek.  This ended up being a pretty awful book in just about every aspect.Fujikido Kenji swears revenge on all of the cybernetic ‚Äúwicked‚Äù ninja after they blow up his apartment resulting in the death of his wife and son.  In process of swearing revenge he is somehow possessed by the soul of a Ninja allowing him to become a Wicked Ninja killing machine.  That is pretty much the extent of the story as he faces off and destroys one evil Ninja after another.I am going to try and make this a fair review, but I fear it will be more of a rant.  I‚Äôll start with everything I didn‚Äôt like and then move on to what I did like.The background for how/why Fujikido became ninja slayer is very stereotypical and set up in just a couple quick pages.  It had a feeling of, okay let‚Äôs make this a viable story and get all this background stuff out of the way quickly.  It was rushed, incomplete, and hollow feeling.  Of course, like many, I am mostly here for the action scenes (although I really would appreciate a good story too) so I am willing to forgive that if the action is well done.  If you want to get an idea of what the story actually is I recommend reading the summary on the back of the book first, if you don‚Äôt you will have no clue what is supposed to be happening here.However, the illustration and action scenes are absolutely awful.  They are impossible to follow and just a mess of lines.  I had no idea what was going on in the action scenes or who was who.  It was just absolutely one of the worst mangas I have ever read with regards to illustration and action scenes.  It seriously ticked me off and I almost stopped reading 20 or so pages in.The manga redeems itself a bit when you get to a scene where we meet Ninja Slayers‚Äô sensei and one of the other female ninjas he lives with.  You get an inkling of a story developing...but that only lasts a couple pages before it is brushed aside and replaced by more awful and impossible to follow action scenes.In addition to the above the book takes itself very seriously and is plagued with awkward sounding dialogue.  The reader is constantly bludgeoned over the head with authentic Japanese ninja terminology (which is in bold throughout as though to emphasis its importance).  Ugh just awful.The story does have a couple of small redeeming qualities.  I did enjoy the glossary in the back which goes through some ninja terminology and definitions; this was fun learning.  The concept was a good one, if poorly executed.  I also think there is a hint of an interesting story in here; if it hadn‚Äôt been so rushed this could have been at least a decent start to the Ninja Slayer story.Overall not recommended.  The story is rushed and poorly done, the action scenes are poorly illustrated and hard to follow, and the dialogue is awkward and takes itself way too seriously.  If you want to read some good shounen check out Hellsing, Berserk, Claymore, Deadman Wonderland, or Attack on Titan...all of those are much  better than this manga.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K41DRV40RPNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632360861#wasThisHelpful","R2K41DRV40RPNE","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have pretty much loved all the books I have read by AS King.  To date I have read The Dust of 100 Dogs, Reality Boy, and Everybody Sees the Ants and loved them all.  I didn‚Äôt like this book quite as much as those ones, but it was still a very well done story that is a bit mind-bending and surreal.This story follows four incredibly talented teenagers as they cope with past tragedy in different ways.  The first character (and main one) is Stanzi; Stanzi believes she is two people in one body and they struggle against each other.  The second is her neighbor, and best friend Gustav, who spends most of his time building an invisible helicopter.  The third is China, one of Stanzi‚Äôs friends, who has swallowed herself and is now an inside out girl.  The last is Lansdale, one of China‚Äôs other friends, who is a habitual liar and can‚Äôt ever seem to tell the truth.  This book is about their struggle dealing with past trauma and trying to live in the real world.Now I won‚Äôt talk about the trauma all our characters have endured, it is different for each character and spans different degrees of trauma.  Discovering what happened to these characters to lead them to be the way they are is part of the journey.  And that is really what this story is, a magical and surreal journey through the reality these characters make for themselves.Overhanging the whole story is the constant bomb threats that their school receives.  These bomb threats are so common that the students and staff have come to see them as the norm.  Yet, still this threat of violence and death constantly hangs over their everyday lives.There are a bevy of strange side characters in here.  My favorite (and one of the strangest) was the naked bush man, who hides in the bush naked and gives out elaborate letters (like ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúq‚Äù, etc) to those who pass.  Personally I thought he was a bit freaky, but then as the story progresses you get to know him and find out that even he has a method to his madness.As mentioned above the story is surreal and ambiguous.  The reader is left with a number of questions...is Stanzi really two people, is China really literally inside out, and does Gustav really have an invisible helicopter, or is all this just an analogy?  The whole thing is a bit of a mind trip.  Yet it is all the more entertaining because the answer to all those questions is yes.  If you believe Gustav has an invisible helicopter then he does, why not?  Or you could say that this is an analogy for a long personal journey.  Is China really inside out?  Sure she could be, anything is possible...or could she just feel exposed to the world around her because of what she‚Äôs been through.In a way this is a coming of age story for all of these characters, a commentary on society today, a heartbreaking story about the pain of life and how to cope, and a magical story about riding in an invisible helicopter...really it‚Äôs all those things and very well done.  The basic message is this, we make our own realities and crawl through them until we finally find the one we want to live in.I should mention I would recommend for older YA.  There are some violent things in here and swearing; so that‚Äôs a heads up for those concerned about that.Overall an incredibly well done story about pain and reality and surviving it.  The story is heartfelt, surreal, a bit ambiguous, and magical.  I think this is another great book by AS King and I would highly recommend to those who don‚Äôt mind their contemporary fiction having a bit of crazy ambiguity to it.  Loved this book and can‚Äôt wait to read some of her others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19YO37EACQD38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031633409X#wasThisHelpful","R19YO37EACQD38","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a copy of this book through NetGalley to review.  This is the first book in the Gold Seer trilogy by Carson.  Previous to this book I had read Carson‚Äôs Fire and Thorns series which I really loved.  This was an excellent start to a new series and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Leah (aka Lee) Westfall can sense gold.  It‚Äôs a secret that only her and her family know.  Her best friend Jefferson lives with a very violent father and, when it is announced that gold has been found in California, Jefferson decides he will journey to California to find his fortune out there.  He asks Lee to join him, but she refuses because she loves her family and wants to stay and help them out.  Then Lee‚Äôs family is brutally murdered by a man who wants Lee‚Äôs powers for his own.  So Lee disguises herself as a boy and starts the long journey to Independence, Missouri in hopes of meeting Jefferson there before he continues on to California.This book was an excellent western type of adventure story with a twist.  At times it reads like a novel version of the Oregon Trail game I used to play on the computer in elementary school.  Life is hard on the journey west as Lee and the folks she travels with battle nature, disease, each other and the natives.There are a couple things that really make this story grab the reader.  Lee having this power to sense gold during the Gold Rush is amazing and intriguing; it makes her a hot commodity and is an ability that controls her as much as she controls it.  The story also takes place in a time where women don‚Äôt have a lot of rights; so masquerading as a boy gives Lee a lot of freedom.  However Lee is torn between having to lie about being a boy and the freedom it gives her.I also really loved reading about the friendships Lee makes and the hardships she encounters on her journey west.  They are things we‚Äôve all heard about but Carson writes about them in a way that makes them feel very real and urgent.  I absolutely loved their journey across what we would call Yellowstone today; having recently visited Yellowstone I often wondered what early travelers would think about it and Carson does an excellent job portraying this.  I loved the hope throughout this story; every one of these characters is absolutely convinced that California holds their salvation and future life.Additionally I really enjoyed the friendship between Lee and Jefferson; they have both faced ridicule by society but they have always had each other.  They are loyal and steadfast friends and wonderful to read about.  As you might imagine in a young adult book, they are both at the age right now where that friendship has potential to turn into something more.The story was beautifully written with a lot of adventure and some humor.  It wa incredibly engaging and hard to put down.  I constantly found myself staying up late to read this and having trouble stopping; it was just such an engrossing story.Overall I absolutely loved this book.  It was engaging, full of wonderful adventure and entertaining and heartfelt characters.  This story is a wonderful blend of western adventure with some magic.  I would definitely recommend to those who are interested in reading a YA book with a western feel to it and lots of adventure and survival.  The story reminds me a bit of Patricia Wrede‚Äôs Frontier Magic series, although I enjoyed this book more than that series.  However if you are interested in reading another American Western themed YA novel with magic that is a good series too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5RTMWT0Z0X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242911#wasThisHelpful","RY5RTMWT0Z0X8","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a copy of this book to review through NetGalley.  Prior to reading this book I had read both the Winterling series and the Magic Thief series by Prineas and loved them both.  As you can imagine I was thrilled to see another book coming out by Prineas and doubly thrilled that it was a sort of fairy tale retelling.  This story was well done and engaging and is a blend of a number of fairy tales.Pin doesn‚Äôt know how she came to be in the Godmother‚Äôs fortress.  She only knows that now she is a Seamstress assigned to sew all hours of the day for the Godmother and before‚Ä¶.well she can‚Äôt remember before.  Then one day her routine changes and she is asked to be a foot model for the Shoemaker a young boy named Shoe.  This change in routine starts Pin thinking about escape.  She decides to enlist Shoe‚Äôs help and make an attempt to escape the Godmother‚Äôs fortress and find out what is Outside.Pin isn‚Äôt free for long before she is recaptured, her memory is erased, and she is forced into a new life.  However, Shoe has not forgotten and Shoe will not give up his quest to find Pin.  However neither Pin or Shoe know that truth...that the Godmother might not be the true enemy after all.This story is a blend of a number of fairy tales.  You have the castle surrounded by briars with the sleepy docile servants in it (Sleeping Beauty), you have the story Pin is thrust into after her recapture (Cinderella), and a spattering of others like The Shoemaker and the Elves.  However, the book isn‚Äôt really about any one fairy tale.  It is more about the power of Story itself.I really enjoyed Pin and Shoe as characters and how their roles change throughout the story.  Initially Pin is the one seeking escape and Shoe follows her.  Then Shoe finds Pin and he is the one driving rebellion while she follows.  They end up having a very equal partnership and they each bring out the best parts of each other (just how a relationship should be).There is some mystery, lots of action, and of course a lot of Story.  I thought the book was well paced and easy to engage in and read through it very quickly.Overall this was an interesting fairy tale retelling that is more about the concept of a story than the fairy tales themselves.  I enjoyed the story and the mystery as well as the action throughout.  The characters were interesting and engaging and the book was well paced.  I would recommend to those who enjoy fairy tale retellings and are interested in adding a bit of a twist to your typical fairy tale retelling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T88FB2HAOG84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062337947#wasThisHelpful","R2T88FB2HAOG84","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this through Amazon Vine to review.  This is a pretty nice waistpack; basically a more modern and sleek looking fanny pack.  It fits nice and snug and doesn't bounce around a lot when you run.  I tried it out while running some, but I am not a huge runner..I am more of a cyclist.  So, I also tried it while riding my road bike and it worked really well for that as well.In the future I could see using it for short hiking trips too.  The fabric breathes well and stays snug to your body.  I love that there are two pockets/pouches.  One is perfect for my cell phone/money and actually removes from the belt so you can easily take it with you.  The other is bigger and would be perfect for a ran jacket or other snacks.My only complaint is that the gel bottle and the water bottle are both very cheap and plasticy.  They are also a bit hard to use; top of the water bottle gets stuck a lot. However, I just swapped out the water bottle with a Camelbak water bottle and now I am good to go.I have tried some other fuel belts and fold over belts before and really didn't like them much.  This is a much better option.  It's fairly low profile and stays on well.  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good multi-purpose fuel belt; this works well for not only running but also activities like biking and hiking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R4727XPELSP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7HAHKS#wasThisHelpful","R1R4727XPELSP8","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had this book on my to be read pile for some time.  This was a decent middle grade book set in present day where a bunch of kids find out they are descendants of Norse Gods.  It was easy to read and fast-paced; although there is a lot of set up here.  It reminds a bit of the Percy Jackson series by Riordan but with less action and different mythology.Blackwell, South Dakota is a town where the residents are all descendants of Norse Gods, mainly Thor and Loki.  Matt is a descendent of Thor and finds out that he is supposed to be Thor‚Äôs stand in as Ragnarok draws closer and closer.  His classmates Fen and Laurie are descendants of Loki and end up coming along with Matt on a quest to stop Ragnarok.  They have to find the other descendents and find Odin in an effort to learn how to stop Ragnarok.This book is a lot of set up.  Basically Matt, Fen, and Laurie are trying to collect the other descendents together and then find Odin.  We learn a lot about the other descendents and go on some adventures in South Dakota.  I was a bit confused as to why the Norse descendants are living in South Dakota, but I assume that will be explained in future books?I did enjoy the interplay between the different characters.  There is a lot of personality conflict between Matt and Fen.  Fen has led a tough life and has a huge chip on his shoulder.  Both Fen and Matt are constantly trying to protect Laurie (it‚Äôs kind of in their blood) which irritates her to no end.  As we meet more descendents the interaction between all of the characters gets more and more interesting.I enjoyed the book fine but am not sure if I will continue reading the series or not.  I think kids in the middle grade age set will enjoy it more than I did.  The language is a bit simple and the plot a bit predictable for me (and most likely other adults will find it the same).  I am going to give this book to my 8 year old son and see if he enjoys it more than I did.Overall this was an okay middle grade fantasy that is set in modern day but involves Norse mythology.  I thought it was okay but think that younger kids will enjoy it more.  The dialogue and language were a bit simple for me and the plot fairly predictable.  I would recommend to middle grade kids who enjoy mythology and adventure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IADRIX7WYTRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316204978#wasThisHelpful","R1IADRIX7WYTRU","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have heard some really awesome things about the Elder Races series and got this on audiobook quite a while ago to read.  It is okay, but overall I was pretty disappointed.  This is definitely one of those paranormal books where the plot takes a backseat to the romance between the two lead characters.The audiobook was narrated decently.  It wasn‚Äôt narrated so well that I thought it was awesome, but it wasn‚Äôt badly done either.  The narrator did a decent job of having distinct voices for all of the characters and portrayed emotion well.Pia Giovanni is a half-human/half-wyr.  She has spent most of her life keeping a low profile and hiding what she is.  However that all changes when an old boyfriend blackmails her into stealing something from one of the most powerful and feared creatures of the Elder Races, Dragos Cuelebre.  Little do Pia and Dragos know that the blackmail was instigated by one of Dragos‚Äôs sworn enemies and part of a much larger plot to bring him down.  When Dragos hunts down Pia, he spares her life but tells her he must work off her debt to him.  Pia agrees but refuses to be his slave.  Both Pia and Dragos are strangely drawn to each other; yet each is too prideful to submit to the other.This is a very very typical paranormal romance.  Dragos is your super alpha male who is centuries old, yet for some reason there is just something that instantly draws him to Pia.  Pia is the kind of heroine that has a secret hidden power, yet constantly needs to be rescued by Dragos (to be fair she does help do some rescuing as well).  Pia also constantly protests against Drago‚Äôs advances but when he really asserts himself she melts against him in need.  All very eye-rolling inducing and typical romance.  The whole series reminded me a lot of the Black Dagger Brotherhood books, but not as well done.There are some interesting elements to this world.  The Wyr are all different types of creatures.  Generally they can take a human shape but also have a Wyr shape (Dragon, griffin, etc).  I enjoy the wide variety of Wyr creatures that we meet.  There is some talk about Other Worlds, which are parallel magic worlds that the characters can journey in between and this was pretty neat too.  Unfortunately all of these elements weren‚Äôt expanded on all that much and were brushed under the rug in favor of the relationship issues and romance scenes.The romantic scenes between Dragos and Pia were decently done.  They weren‚Äôt the best I have read but weren‚Äôt the worst either.  The scenes are very explicit and Dragos and Pia do have great chemistry together; so the scenes were engaging.  There wasn‚Äôt a ton of creativity in them, but they were good.This book seems to wrap up the story of Dragos and Pia and I am guessing the next Elder Races book will feature another couple...as is done so often in these types of series.Overall this was an okay paranormal romance.  This book followed a plot and had characters that are very typical to paranormal romance genre.  So...if that is what you are looking for this was a decent book.  There are some other elements to the story that were interesting; I loved the ideas of the Wyr and of alternate magical worlds.  The relationship between Pia and Drago is incredibly predictable and Drago is very much an alpha male stereotype.  I won‚Äôt be reading anymore of this series, but I think for those looking for a serial type paranormal romance series this isn‚Äôt a bad one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23962XFJMV8UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425241505#wasThisHelpful","R23962XFJMV8UG","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Ready Player One by Ernest Cline and absolutely loved it, so I was very curious to read Cline‚Äôs next book.  This was a decent book with an interesting premise.  I thought it was a bit predictable, but it was fun to read all the same.I listened to this on audiobook and it was narrated by Wil Wheaton.  He did a fantastic job narrating this book.  The characters all had distinct voices and Wheaton did a great job portraying emotion as well.  I really enjoy listening to audiobooks narrated by him.Zack Lightman has two obsessions: the video game Armada and the vintage video game and sci-fi materials his dad left behind after his death.  He spends most of his time obsessing over both.  He works at a video game store and avoids any topic involving his future (much to his mother‚Äôs frustration).  Then he sees a spaceship outside his window...a spaceship from the video game Armada.  Imagine his surprise when a secret organization offers him a position fighting for the human race...it‚Äôs a position he‚Äôs been training for his whole life through the video games he plays.As Zack reels from the information that video gamers across the globe have been unknowingly training to save humanity from alien invasion he can‚Äôt help but feel that something is a bit off.  The way the aliens react seems familiar and a bit stupid...what exactly is going on here?This was a well science fiction story with a few big twists.  There is a lot of 80‚Äôs paraphernalia in here again, which should appeal to those who enjoyed Ready Player One.  There is also a lot of video gaming which should appeal to gamers.  I mean isn‚Äôt it kind of every gamers‚Äô dream that their gaming skills will one day save the world?  Not to mention that the whole idea of your everyday human controlling drones in war seems like something that maybe isn‚Äôt all that far in the future.This book takes place over the span of a day, and man what a day it is.  A lot happens in the day and one revelation after another leaves poor Zack reeling.  I really enjoyed Zack as a character, and I loved the great relationship he has with his mom (his mom is pretty darn cool).I just couldn‚Äôt give this 5 stars because it was so predictable.  There are just too many things in here that are supposed to be twists that were absolutely predictable right from the beginning of the book.  I think maybe there was too much foreshadowing throughout the story and it just made the big reveals kind of...well...boring.Overall this is a decently done science fiction novel that was a fun read.  It should appeal to fans of 80‚Äôs gaming culture and gamers in general.  There is the whole alien invasion theme to it so fans of those kind of stories will probably enjoy this.  This book didn‚Äôt have the same level of awesomeness as Ready Player One, but let‚Äôs be honest that is a pretty hard book to follow up.  It‚Äôs a fun read and I would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4DHDRSVLC97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137250#wasThisHelpful","RT4DHDRSVLC97","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I usually get my undies at Victoria's Secret, I am not a huge fan of budget underwear because they just don't last as long and aren't as comfortable.  Although that being said I have bought some at Target lately and found them to be very comfortable if not that high of quality.I have to comment on the ""assorted color"" first of all. You do not get the nice sedate white, pink, beige, black shown in the picture.  Instead I got bright purple, teal, magenta, and some leopard spotted type of thing that was black and white with other colors mixed in.  None of these match my bras and they are all pretty unattractive colors.  So just be aware that the colors are very assorted.The fabric these are made of is nice and soft but feels a bit cheap.  I liked the flex panels, they made the underwear move nicely with you.I was not a fan of the elastic they used on the edging both on the waist and legs; it chafes some and irritated my skin throughout the day.  This elastic was also fairly inflexible (ironic considering the flex panels built in to the underwear).Sizing was good and as expected.  So just match the underwear size to listed standard jean size and you should get the proper fit.For those who care about their underwear being attractive...well these are definitely not attractive underwear.  They are just very basic underwear.  I though they fit more like a brief than a hipster; they don't really rid that low on your hips.Overall I won't be wearing these anymore; although they are an okay underwear. The elastic was uncomfortable, they feel cheap, and aren't at all attractive.  They are okay; the material is soft and the fit is fine.  However, if I am looking for cheap underwear I can get much more attractive and comfortable underwear from Target.  Personally though I will be sticking mainly with my VS underwear, they are totally worth the money.Pros:- Fabric is soft- Flex panels are nice and help with comfort and movement- Fit is as expectedCons:- Crazy assorted colors- Elastic is inflexible and uncomfortable- Fits more like a brief than a hipster- Unattractive","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15M6HAKRECGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTV8C54#wasThisHelpful","R15M6HAKRECGV","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this through the Amazon Vine program to review.  This is a very well made basket with pockets that is waterproof, dries quickly, and is great to carry items in that are going to be in wet places.I put all of our shower items in here and they all fit great.  The mesh is plastic so it dries quickly, the pockets around the outside are a variety of sizes so they fit a large variety of items.  The black grip on the top of the handle is made out of a neoprene material, so it grips well even when wet and dries quickly.My only complaint is that the size is a bit awkward.  It's too wide to sit on the edge of the tub or a shower shelf without falling off; so you have to sit it on the ground.  It's too small to be useful for taking to the beach (towels and stuff won't fit in the center).Other than the above this is a well made, durable item, that is very useful for holding a variety of things in wet environments (shower, beach).  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a waterproof organizer that is easy to carry.Pros:- Plastic mesh dries quickly- Neoprene handles provides good grip and dry quickly- Pockets fit a variety of different size items- DurableCons:- Awkward size.  Too wide to sit on tub edge or shower shelf.  Too small to be useful at the beach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JRHX7L50ISHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGRN00S#wasThisHelpful","R3JRHX7L50ISHB","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a stand alone book done by the artist Amano who has contributed art to both the Vampire HUnter D series as well as Final Fantasy (among a million other things).  He is one of my favorite artists, so when I stumbled upon this in Half Price Books I was excited to pick it up.This book deals with the mythology of Japanese Buddhism.  In this book the twelve Juni Jinsho stood guard over the cosmos, each guarding a point on the zodiac‚Ä¶now they have vanished leaving humanity to fight against the forces of darkness on their own.  Enter Deva Zan, a samurai with no memory who ends up journeying through time and space to find the Juni Jinsho and help restore their memory.This book contains some amazing artwork, which I absolutely loved.  The art pretty much makes this book.  The book is amazingly well put together, it is a large volume with huge color plates and very high quality.The story was decent and focuses mainly on Japanese mythology and one samurai‚Äôs quest to find the Juni Jinsho and help them remember themselves.  The Juni Jinsho themselves end up being pretty stereotypical characters who vary in quality; some of them are incredibly interesting and some are forgettable.The story is decently done, but can be a bit confusing and ambiguous at times.  It jumps around some in space and time, but in the end everything came together nicely.  The story does lag a bit at some points and, to be honest, it was the awesome art rather than the story that really drove me to keep reading the story.Overall this book had some amazing art and a decent story.  I enjoyed learning some about the Juni Jinsho and enjoyed some of the characters throughout.  The art, more than story, was what made this book engaging.  I would recommend for fans of Amano‚Äôs art and also for fans of the Vampire Hunter D series (the story has a similar tone to it).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JHJJNWWOUWPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616550309#wasThisHelpful","R1JHJJNWWOUWPG","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed The Girl from the Well and was excited to see that there was going to be a sequel to that book.  I got a copy of this book to review from NetGalley.  This ended up being a very well done and creepy ghost story with a lot of Japanese mythology throughout.  I enjoyed it a lot.It‚Äôs been two years since we left Tark and Okiku.  Tark and Okiku have continued to work together hunting down child murderers and releasing the innocent souls of the children bound to them.  It‚Äôs been a solitary life for Tark but him and Okiku are very good at what they do.  Then Tark receives word that one of his friends in Japan,  Kagura, has gone missing.  Kagura agreed to lead a TV crew from the US TV series, Ghost Hunters, to the mysterious Japanese forest of Aokigahara (also known as ‚Äúsuicide forest‚Äù) in search of a mysterious village rumored to exist deep in the forest..  Unfortunately neither Kagura or the crew of Ghost Hunters has returned.  Tark, Okiku, and Cassie journey to Japan to search Aokigahara for this secret village and hopefully find Kagura.The story takes a bit to get going, but once Tark gets to Japan and enters the Aokigahara forest things really get creepy and move fast.  I am kind of a wuss about scary books, but although this book is creepy it never got too scary for me.  It does get kind of gorey at points and there are definitely some creepy scenes, but it never gets to the point of being terrifying.I enjoy Tark and Okiku and their interesting ghost/host relationship.  They have both grown a lot since the first book and learned to work well together.  Okiku is a ghost strong in water element (since she died in the water) and faces a lot of changes in this book because the ghosts of the secret village are earth-based ghosts.There was some crazy Japanese mythology and history in here that I enjoyed a lot.  The story was very engaging and interesting to read about.  There is a lot of action, some mystery, and of course a lot of creepy.My only complaint is that some of the dialogue between the characters is a bit awkward at times.  There are many times where Tark and Cassie are talking or Tark and Kagura are talking where the dialogue sounds stilted or staged...it just doesn‚Äôt sound natural.  I did read this as an ARC, so hopefully the final book will have dialogue that flows better.Overall I really enjoyed this creepy supernatural horror story.  I love the characters, the eerie Aokigahara forest, the creepy ghost scenes, and the action.  This book is a bit gory and creepy but never totally scared me.  I enjoyed the mythology and history throughout.  The book is left open ended, so I could see there being future books with Tark and Okiku (although I haven‚Äôt heard of a third book being planned).  I would recommend to those who enjoy creepy and somewhat gory ghost stories.  If you are a fan of books with excellent creepy ghost stories for the middle grade and YA crowd I would also recommend the Lockwood and Co series by Jonathan Stroud; I like this series a lot and highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6RBHZJROUJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492629839#wasThisHelpful","RS6RBHZJROUJ3","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a well done autobiography about a young girl‚Äôs stay at summer camp and her discovery that she is gay.  It was well written and easy to read.  I enjoyed it and thought the illustration was okay.Maggie Thrash writes about her summer at an all girls‚Äô summer camp, her struggles with her sexuality, and with the other girls there.  It‚Äôs an interesting look into the life of lesbian pre-teen and into the politics of summer camp.This book reminded me a bit of This One Summer, it has that same somewhat wandering story quality and is just telling about the day to day life of a girl in the summer.  This story is supposed to be non-fiction. Maggie is dealing with the realization that she likes girls, one girl in particular, in a more than friendly way.The drawing is pretty rough; it‚Äôs full color but it done in a very sketchy type of style which isn‚Äôt my favorite.  You can follow the drawings just fine and see character expression fine; so it‚Äôs not hard to follow...it‚Äôs just not my favorite type of illustration style.The story has some closure but is a bit open-ended just like real life.  It was a good read and well done.Overall a decent graphic novel biography about one girl‚Äôs summer struggling with her sexuality.  I would recommend to those who are interested in ‚Äúday of the life‚Äù type of graphic novels or interested in GLBT graphic novels.  I thought it was okay but didn‚Äôt enjoy the illustration that much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EPVLSDI8XUZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076367382X#wasThisHelpful","R2EPVLSDI8XUZH","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book in the Tombquest series.  This series is ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù by the same people who worked on the Infinity Ring series and the Spirit Animals series.  I have read some of the Spirit Animals books and they weren‚Äôt my favorite.  However, I kept picking this book up and looking at it and finally decided to get it when I saw it at my son‚Äôs book fair at school.  There are five books planned for this series and they will all be written by Northrop.Eleven year old Alex has suffered from sickness his whole life and it‚Äôs getting worse.  After a horrible attack the doctors are worried he won‚Äôt recover.  That‚Äôs when his mom, who is an Egyptologist, uses one of the Lost Spells from the Book of the Dead to save him.  Unfortunately she unlocks a doorway that does more than save Alex‚Äôs life.  Now strange things are happening all over the world and Alex‚Äôs mom has disappeared.  Alex will stop at nothing to save her.I really enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I was going to.  There is a lot of mystery in here, some creepy parts, some good action, and some magic.  I really enjoyed it all.  The book was fast-paced and easy to read.I liked Alex as a character and wanted to know more about his illness.  After his mom uses the Lost Spells on him he starts gaining endurance and this leaves the reader wondering what else about Alex will change as the series continues.I loved that him and his mother have an open and loving relationship.  I also enjoyed the friendship between him and Ren.  Ren was another fun character, she is a girl and has a lot of spunk.  I enjoyed that there was both a main boy and girl character; this makes the story accessible and fun for both genders.The plot was well done, pretty much the story is just getting started here.  I loved the Egyptian mythology throughout too.  The story is exciting and fast-paced and was easy to engage with.  I gave it to my 8 year old son and he is reading it now, so we will see what he thinks.We have not checked out the game yet, but plan to in a few weeks when we are moved into our new house.Overall an excellent start to a new series.  I thought the book was fast-paced, exciting, and really well done.  I thoroughly enjoyed the mythology, the characters, and the plot.  I can‚Äôt wait to read the second book in the series, Amulet Keepers.  Recommended to those who enjoy mysteries with some action, mythology, and magic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRRYPIF0ZNG3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545723388#wasThisHelpful","RRRYPIF0ZNG3L","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"House Immortal has been my absolute favorite series by Monk so far.  I read the Allie Beckstrom series and really enjoyed it.  I also read the first couple books in the Age of Steam series and thought they were okay.  This book ties up the House Immortal series and it was absolutely perfect; this is just such a great series...it blends together a lot of wonderful genres and has a bit of an urban fantasy feel to it pace-wise.After fixing time Matilda (Tilly) finds out that things haven‚Äôt turned out as planned.  She wakes up in an alternate universe, a universe where she didn‚Äôt survive her transfer into the galvanized body and everyone thinks of her as Evelyn.  Instead of being leaders in society in this world the galvanized are mercenaries and outlaws surviving as they can.Matilda is willing to deal with all this until she finds out that Slater Orange is still present in this world and still a threat.  Even more confusing is that fact that Matilda keeps having brief moments where she falls between realities and Slater is in every reality.  However the most heartbreaking thing is that when Matilda finds out that Abraham has no idea who she is.  Now Matilda must get her brother and Abraham to believe her outlandish story and to help her stop Slater Orange once and for all.This was a spectacular conclusion to this amazingly creative trilogy.  I continue to love the wonderfully creative world that is a bit post-apocalyptic, a bit steampunk, and a bit sci-fi.  The story has an urban fantasy feel to it in how it's paced as well.  The underlying Frankenstein theme to how the galvanized are formed adds to the creativity and makes the series even more interesting.Matilda is an excellent character, she is tough and practical and doing her best to not let the whole ‚Äúarriving in an alternate reality thing‚Äù bother her.  You really feel for her as she tries to fit in in a completely new world and cope with reforging friendships.  In fact this was one of the highlights of the book; I loved how we had to re-meet all the characters from the previous books and see what kind of lives they had made for themselves and how they fit into this new reality.Abraham is in the story in a big way.  It broke my heart that he didn‚Äôt know Tilly.  He is a tougher and meaner Abraham than we knew in Tilly‚Äôs original world, but he is still Abraham and he is still loyal and capable and drawn to Tilly.The way the story wraps up is amazing and I absolutely loved it.  I pretty much just loved everything about this book.Overall this was a perfect conclusion to a wonderfully creative and action-packed series.  I love the characters and the time travel; the story is just woven together perfectly.  This is just an awesome trilogy that I highly recommend to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CM26QM4EWR1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451467388#wasThisHelpful","R1CM26QM4EWR1F","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a copy of this book through NetGalley to review.  Previous to reading this book I had read DeStefano‚Äôs Chemical Garden series which I really enjoyed.  This book is written in DeStefano‚Äôs beautiful writing style and is mostly a ghost story.Pram was dead before she was born.  Her mother committed suicide while she was still pregnant with Pram, but the doctors were able to revive Pram.  Now Pram lives with her aunts and has the unique ability to see ghosts.  In fact her best friend is a boy named Felix.  Then Pram‚Äôs aunts decide she needs to go to school and while there she meets the quiet Clarence whose mother has just died.  Clarence can sense that Pram is special and asks her to help him search for a way to talk to his mother‚Äôs ghost.  Their search leads them to  a spiritualist named Lady Savant.  The Lady Savant promises to help, but she knows the true power Pram has and what the Lady Savant wants to do with Pram is scarier than any ghost could be.This is a middle grade novel that deals a lot with death.  So just a heads up there is discussion of suicide, depression, madness, and (of course) death throughout.  DeStefano explains in the foreword that she wrote this book to help one of her young nieces (I think it was a niece) deal with the death of a loved one.  There were some elements of this book that reminded me a bit of The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman.Pram (whose full name is Pragmatic) definitely reflects her namesake.  She is very intelligent and quickly realizes that she is the only one who sees ghosts, she knows it‚Äôs not normal and knows that she needs to be careful or people will think she is crazy.  Meeting Clarence is a relief for Pram because he is so very interested in tracking down ghosts that he sees Pram as special and interesting.I absolutely adored the friendship between Pram and Clarence; they are so kind and understanding and supportive of each other.  They both need each other so badly and their friendship is so important.  Clarence is desperate to find his mother‚Äôs ghost and Pram is desperate to figure out where her father is.Felix is a wonderful character as well and adds an interesting twist to the story.  He‚Äôs a young boy who doesn‚Äôt want to remember his life and that‚Äôs an interesting thought.  Maybe sometimes these ghosts of Pram‚Äôs are happier as ghosts than they ever were alive, which is sad but thought-provoking.This is both a story about coming of age and about friendship.  At the beginning of the book Pram is constantly trying to find where she belongs, but as the story continues she finds out maybe she‚Äôs been searching too hard.There are some parts of the story that might be a bit scary for younger children in the middle grade age set.  The idea of a parent killing themselves can be a shocking one for some kids.  The fact that Pram is kidnapped and hurt is also a bit scary.Overall I really enjoyed this book, it was a sweet ghost story.  It‚Äôs a quick read and has some wonderful discussion on friendship as well as an excellent coming of age story.  I loved the ghosts and Pram‚Äôs power and am excited to see how Pram uses her developing powers in future books.  I would definitely recommend to those who love bittersweet ghost stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36A0WSU0NIWSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161963600X#wasThisHelpful","R36A0WSU0NIWSS","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the tenth book in the Dark Tower Graphic Novel series and does a decent job of wrapping up the story arc.  There is one more graphic novel in this set called Last Shots which is a compilation of Dark Tower stories.  I enjoyed this volume and the artwork as well; it does a good job of wrapping up the story arc for the Gunslinger Born full length novel.Roland and Jake journey under the mountain in Roland‚Äôs continued search for the Man in Black.  At first Jake decides not to accompany Roland because the Man in Black says he will die if he follows Roland.  Then Jake changes his mind and he and Roland journey through these dark tunnels together.  They encounter rats and bats along with the more deadly Slow Mutants.  However, the biggest peril both to Roland and Jake is when Roland must decide what he wants more; to build a life with Jake or to continue to follow his obsession.I remember this part of the book being depressing and it was again depressing in graphic novel format.  This is the book where we finally learn the depth of Roland‚Äôs obsession with the Dark Tower and learn that maybe he isn‚Äôt the hero we thought he was.The artwork throughout is in beautiful full color and very well done.  I love reading these graphic novels partly because of the beautiful and detailed illustration.There are some very intriguing parts to the story as well.  We learn more about how Jake‚Äôs world straddles Roland‚Äôs.  In Roland‚Äôs discussion with the Man in Black we learn more about the Dark Tower and how it relates to space and time.I really do enjoy the relationship between Jake and Roland.  They are both tragic characters but still find some comfort in the father/son type of relationship they develop.This was another excellent volume in the Dark Tower graphic novel series.  I continue to enjoy the illustration, the complex characters, and the convoluted plot involving the Dark Tower.  That being said this is one of the most depressing books of the bunch.  I would recommend to those who enjoy dark fantasy graphic novels.  I look forward to wrapping up the Gunslinger Born story arc with the final collection of stories; Last Shots.I continue to enjoy the illustration throughout these books.  They have been easy to follow, done in beautiful full color, and have excellent detail.Overall an absolutely outstanding addition to the Dark Tower graphic novel series.  I would definitely recommend this whole series to those who enjoy dark fantasy graphic novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYM7UTCR1QLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078514935X#wasThisHelpful","R1UYM7UTCR1QLC","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the 26th volume in the Claymore series, and the second to last in the series.  The last book in this series, volume 27, is due to release in October 2015.  This book continued in the same vein as the first one; lots and lots of awesome fight scenes with a couple of amazing revelations.Cassandra and the uber Awakened One continue their battle.  Meanwhile Clare and Raki take on Priscilla in a final battle...or is it?This book picks up where volume 25 left off.  Lots and lots of fighting and some excellent action scenes throughout.  It‚Äôs been awhile since I read vol 25, so I found a few of the fighting scenes a bit confusing and hard to follow.Clare does take some time to reflect about how meeting Raki changed her life and her outlook on things; this was a nice aside.  We also get some backstory on how Raki trained with Isley.The majority of the book is the remaining Claymores trying to kick the stuffing out of Priscilla.  There are some crazy twists right at the end of the book, seriously the end...like the last page.This manga continue to be well drawn.  I love watching how Clare has changed over the series.Overall this is a good addition to this manga series.  I can‚Äôt wait to see how things wrap up in volume 27!  I would recommend this series to those who enjoy strong female characters and action packed fantasy manga.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BLSYMB3X98OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421578662#wasThisHelpful","R3BLSYMB3X98OE","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a copy of this book to review through NetGalley.  I really really loved this book.  I enjoyed the Victorian setting and the beautifully flawed characters, as well as the premise behind the story.The story is set in Victorian times and is about an 18 year old girl named Sezna who has everything but is absolutely terrified of death and losing her beauty.  Then a beautiful stranger strikes a deal with her...he will give her the ability to stay young and beautiful forever, the catch is that she must survive off of the heartbeats of those around her.I came into this expecting a YA paranormal book, but ended up with a story that was so much more.  The story takes place across many many years (we are talking over a century here).  The premise makes Sezna sound shallow and selfish, but she doesn‚Äôt come off as that way in the story.  Sezna has had a number of people close to her die and this had made her terrified of the idea of death.  In addition to that her mother has drilled into her over and over again that Sezna‚Äôs only worth is in her beauty.  Sezna is also smart and witty but she has been brought up to believe that those traits don‚Äôt have any value.I absolutely loved the premise of someone living off of other people‚Äôs heartbeats.  It is fairly vampiric but I love the subtlety and poeticness of it all.  Just a gentle brush here or there is all it takes for Sezna to steal a heartbeat.The story is beautifully written.  I love how our heroine is flawed and makes mistakes only to change her situation and make new ones.  She does learn, but she learns slowly and over many many decades.  It is a bittersweet story with an amazingly hopeful ending and both gothic and romantic overtones to it.I loved how the story spanned the ages and we constantly get to see Sezna living in new times with new people and still having similar problems.  The big reveal of who the mysterious young gentleman was was incredibly predictable...but that didn‚Äôt make it any less sweet.Technically this book is being marketed as New Adult, but I didn‚Äôt really read any parts in here that weren‚Äôt YA friendly.  The heroine does ‚Äúage‚Äù and get older in a maturity sense, but she remains forever locked at eighteen.Overall I absolutely loved this book.  I loved the premise and the main heroine and how the story spans a vast amount of time.  The book is well written and engaging and the main character is captivating both in her vulnerability and her selfishness.  I would definitely recommend to fans of Victorian or gothic YA literature with a bit of a paranormal twist to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVXD99RDBM0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZC9W7U#wasThisHelpful","R1DVXD99RDBM0T","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a copy of this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  This was a well done and intriguing start to a new manga series.  I ended up really enjoying it and being very curious about what will happen next.Inuyashiki‚Äôs life is pretty awful.  Him and his family have just moved into a new house, but he obviously gets no respect from them.  He looks very old for his age and this translates into him not getting respect in a lot of areas in his life.  His only joy is a small dog that he adopts.  Then things get even worse, he‚Äôs diagnosed with stomach cancer and only has a short while to live.  His luck takes a strange turn when he is struck by light one night, light that explodes everything around him...yet he emerges strangely unharmed.  As time goes on Inuyashiki finds out that he may not be as unchanged as he thought.This is a strangely compelling story.  It starts out like a pretty basic seinen and then towards the end gets very sci fi.  Inuyashiki comes across as somewhat pitiful, yet is strangely compelling as a character and lends the story a strangely melancholy, yet hopeful, feel.  His canine friend is very cute.The manga is really well drawn, has a lot of detail and is easy to follow.  I enjoyed the illustration and found it very engaging.  The look at Japanese society in these pages is a fairly bleak one; there just aren‚Äôt a lot of nice people or characters in the story.The story takes some truly crazy turns and towards the end things have gotten very interesting.  I would love to talk about this more in the review but it would include major spoilers...so I won‚Äôt.Overall a very engaging and interesting manga.  It‚Äôs starts off as a seinen about a middle aged man who leads a somewhat pitiful and aimless life, but ends up being a story with some crazy science fiction aspects to it.  I would definitely recommend and am incredibly curious as to where this story is going.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIUAPD0FA05V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632361213#wasThisHelpful","RLIUAPD0FA05V","A22B13EJTZKCTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22B13EJTZKCTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fits in a cup holder! This is perfect for road trips since it allows you to charge up 5 devices simultaneously without compromising amperage!

"These cases are surprisingly really protective! I have dropped my phone numerous times on concrete, screen first, and the biggest damage that occurred was scuffing and scratching to the case! I LITERALLY have dropped my phone in this case countless times, and it is a little beat up, but it still functions perfectly and this is honestly one of the BEST thin, light, and comfortable cases to use. I HIGHLY recommend you use a tempered glass screen protector with this case, just for added protection. It has saved me from cracking the screen and allows me to have some security knowing my phone will be safe in this thin case.

This cable works great and I love how simple and straight forward it is. It charges and syncs your phone, meaning it does everything you need with simplicity! The materials used seem pretty decent quality, and the only issue you may have is plugging it into a lifeproof or any case with a small lighting port. This cable has a slightly larger plug;meaning, if you have a small charging port on your case you might want to look elsewhere.

" 8:55 Mins You will definitely be blown away by the quality and sound that emits from this product. I am a person who LOVES bass, and that is usually what I look for in a bluetooth speaker besides the basics such as functionality and design. However; you DEFINITELY can feel and see the bass with this speaker! At maximum volume, the bass is so intense that the speaker begins to rotate and bounce around on a surface. It is absolutely jaw dropping how Ayfee was able to stuff so much sound in such a small form factor. This speaker is extremely affordable and comes in a variety of attractive bold colors. But it gets better, this speaker is waterproof to a level that allows you to take this guy wherever you want, just don't submerge it! I usually ride around my local downtown area at high speeds on my bike, and there was no breaking up or any issues with the bluetooth functionality even at high wind speeds and such.

" 5:41 Mins I was super impressed with these Groovy Duo bluetooth speakers when I first powered them on and cranked up the sound! You would not expect such great quality from a small and compact design. The speakers pair together simultaneously and will work as one when they are both powered together. So when a track is changed or the volume is raised, both speakers will play the same track or raise to the same volume level. However, you do need to power both of them on via the separate power buttons. On the contrary, when powering off the speakers you will only need to power off one! It is pretty awesome!The speakers produce a rich sound, you can hear nearly all levels of frequencies and the bass levels are great. The bass is so powerful that the speakers actually move across any surface you place them on, its quite surprising. The speakers also come with a carrying pouch and a dual micro-USB charging cable to help you get both of these babies charged with one ac adapter. They charge relatively quick, however I would recommend using a 2amp ac adapter to maximize that charge.Overall, I can highly recommend these bluetooth speakers and I was absolutely stunned by the quality. Check out my review video above if you have not yet! It will certainly help you on deciding whether to purchase these speakers or not.If this review helped you, please give this video review a helpful rating!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMXWCRANL0ALF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9RHJXG#wasThisHelpful","RMXWCRANL0ALF","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a super stylish car charger with plenty of power to get your device(s) *yes more than one* charged! There are numerous amounts of color combos that you can choose from and that is always a good thing! Except when you like all of the colors! It is fortunate that they are relatively inexpensive and you can surely purchase one for each of your vehicles. The car charger consists of a plastic and aluminum design that works great together. The aluminum portion surrounds the USB Ports and top end of the car charger which is great since this is the main part that will be sticking out of your car outlet. It looks awesome and is built to last which is why this is one of my favorite car chargers on the market. There are thousands out there and many that are even less expensive, however they likely do not come with iXCC's great customer service and warranty that I have experience first hand! Definitely an awesome charger!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9UPPPHIS57A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P060GNK#wasThisHelpful","RC9UPPPHIS57A","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the awesome looking grooves, this case definitely adds some grip and style to your iPhone 6 plus! I love the color choices that iXCC has provided and this is one of the best slimming and protective cases out there for one main reason: you get a protective kickstand holster that allows you to use just the back portion of the case, or both for maximum protection! I think this specific color looks great with all three iPhone colors. I did notice it is very difficult to clean the case if you do get any dirt or dye from blue jeans on it which was very unfortunate, however I rather have this than an easy to scratch and fingerprint attracting surface. I love this two in one design but do be aware that it is definitely not the most protective with or without the holster attached to the front screen. iXCC definitely impressed me with this case and I feel that they managed to place a lot of thought into such a simplistic and stylish case! Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGGCQ52QV7FR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P06JTBA#wasThisHelpful","RKGGCQ52QV7FR","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Samsung Galaxy S5 Armband From iXCC is your perfect solution for carrying around your phone with ease. I have used this band for nearly anything from cleaning the house to full blown workouts. If you are not interested in purchasing an expensive bluetooth device that limits you from full phone functionality while working out, boom here you go! It even includes a key slot and allows you to have full access to the headphone jack as well. Despite the armband being pretty large to accommodate for the galaxy S5's size, I found it very comfortable and never had any issues with it slipping off or anything of that sort. With a super affordable price and three different colored variants, I think this is one of the best armband options out there!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34RCBYCK6XL0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVT2WYS#wasThisHelpful","R34RCBYCK6XL0C","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can highly recommend this product for those looking for an easy and protective way to carry around their hard drive! It has many slots and areas so that you can pack all of your general necessities in there as well. The design is very minimalistic that just gets the job done. My favorite thing about Sabrent is that they always back up their products with great customer service and warranty. In addition all of their products do exactly what you would expect them to, and then some. This is not only a hard drive carrying case, it can carry virtually anything that is compact enough to allow you to close the case.

" 8:18 Mins I was very impressed with this battery case from mobilepal. They were able to stuff 4,000 mAh in a relatively slim form factor! It does take a bit of getting used to since it is hard to reach the corners of the screen than it already is without any case on the 6 plus, but it is definitely worth it! With hardcore use, I was able to last over 2 days! If I used it casually, I am confident that I can last well over three days with this case! It does take a few hours to charge so it is not worth charging the case before your phone. Charging over night is your best bet! The coolest thing is that the case automatically directs power to the device before the case itself, so you do not even need to take the case off! You also get to sync through the case which is an awesome feature. I have thousands of Micro-USB cords so it was nice to be able to use them again for charging and data syncing. The case MFI certified and the battery type li-polymer battery which demonstrates that mAh doesn't necessarily mean more charge. I can last just as long with the phone alone using the Lithium Ion 2,900 mAh battery as I can with the 4,000 mAh Li-polymer. Therefore with this case you essentially get one full charge: doubling the battery life which is amazing! You do have a little leftover if you charge form 20%, but anything lower will use all of the juice!Mobilepal even goes to the extent to include a tempered glass screen protector that I installed and demonstrated in the review video above! The bubbles all worked themselves out within an hour, I also showed a picture of this in the review video, and the screen protector works great! The oleo phobic coating repels fingerprints and does not distort the beautiful 1080p display. At this value, this is the best battery case for the 6 plus!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115K6FZ232AQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2B1S3Q#wasThisHelpful","R115K6FZ232AQL","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:14 Mins There is a lot to say about this camera, its light, wireless with the exception of the power cord, and even stealthy! You can hook up a few in series or even just use one! To really take advantage of the camera you have to use D-Links app which can be a bit gimmicky, however once you finally get this guy setup and working, it is a treat to use! You can hear audio, see in pitch black rooms, and even save pictures directly to your device from the app! I found it pretty difficult to set up if you do not have the recommended D-Link cloud router system, however it does work with any router and should not take TOO long if you follow the instructions carefully. I can definitely recommend this for someone looking for a basic system, however if you are planning to use this for a long time I highly suggest looking for a different model or brand.

" 7:13 Mins I absolutely love this bluetooth speaker from Mediabug's summit series! There is so much to talk about so I hope that you would check out my video review above for a more thorough and complete review. Everything down to the design and sound quality is super awesome about this speaker. Once you start using it, your hooked! Given the fact you can take this thing anywhere because it is iPX5 certified water resistant, it is an absolute amazing buy! Now you don't just get the attractive bluetooth speaker with amazing sound quality, you get a portable battery as well! The 4,000 mAh battery capacity is MENTAL and allows for an extreme battery life, but if you do not need all 14 hours, you can charge any device with the built in USB Port! This is perhaps the first time I have seen this on a bluetooth speaker and if you check out my amazon review profile, you will see I have reviewed ALOT! Of course the speaker is not absolutely perfect in the sense that nothing is, but I can highly recommend this speaker because it is just an ALL-IN-ONE that you can take anywhere. It even includes a carbine to clip onto something and comes with an AUX cable and a Micro USB Charging Cable. Again, check out my video review above for the full details!

" 6:42 Mins After using the case for a few weeks now, my first impressions compared to what I think about the case now has completely changed. At first it seems like the coolest case, which it almost is with its super slim design, impressive amount of protection for its size/weight, and just its overall purpose and appearance! However after a while you will begin to notice some major design flaws. It is almost impossible to use the mute switch since the cut out is so small and the instructions do not provide any explanation on how to address this issue. The headphone jack only allows the Apple Earpods to fit in the ultra narrow opening, and to top that off there is no included jack extender. I have millions of these little extenders from all of the cases and such I have reviewed and none of them were able to fit. I could only use Bluetooth enabled devices or the Apple Earpods to listen to music which was a big deal for me. The lighting port is very tight however that is definitely understandable since the case is so thin, I just wish they would include an adapter for the headphone jack. The screen protector often gets dirty very quick and attracts a lot of finger prints. There is even a grid design that can interfere with the quality of your screen. I would definitely recommend this case for the soul purpose of the maximum protection and waterproof features. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the idea of this case but some things desperately need some improvements. Acewin did a fantastic job making the worlds slimmest case, but perhaps it is a little underdeveloped. Check out my review video above for a full and thorough review including additional details.

" 5:21 Mins This product was supplied by Keedox for a completely honest and quality review.This bluetooth speaker, aesthetically speaking, is beautiful! The design is just super appealing to the eye and I always find my self tracing the awesome hexagonal patterns! The design is completely rugged and definitely well built! The speaker is only iPX4 certified which means it can't take to many direct splashes like iPX5, however it is definitely capable of being used in the shower, outdoors, and virtually anywhere where there are light conditions! I can recommend this speaker to those just looking for something cool, rugged, and for the purpose of showing off to friends while using it for light background music. However, for music listening this speaker lacks severely in a good bass balance and virtually has a flat EQ that is not so ""party-like"" or fun to listen to. As mentioned in the review video above there are two separate volume controls that can be a bit confusing so make sure to turn BOTH of them up! Hats off to Keedox for a pleasing and awesome design but I would really like to see more sound quality and development. The multiple color choices are awesome and I really appreciate all of the ports and accessories that come with the speaker!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGJSJUPTJ97WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PS2NW1Y#wasThisHelpful","RGJSJUPTJ97WX","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:17 Mins In my review video above you will see that I reviewed both the full-screen and regular tempered glass screen protectors. I must say that I was impressed with both and they both have been holding up amazingly. Fingerprints are rarely present on the screen due to the oleo phobic coating and the fact a simple wipe of the screen immediately removes any residue left behind. As long as you follow the instructions carefully, and exactly, you will have no problem installing either one of these glasses! One tip that I can give is to use pieces of tape by attaching your desired amount on both ends of the screen protector, to create a ""cheap"" suction cup-like solution to help accurately install the screen protectors. It works great for me every time, you can also use the ""hinge method"" where you literally make a hinge with pieces of tape to align and install the screen protector with easy as well. Screen quality is not diminished or interfered with and the cut outs for the camera, speaker, and sensors are somewhat very accurate. Of course it is nearly impossible to get a perfect install but you can get pretty close! IF USING THE FULL SCREEN TEMPERED GLASS, BE AWARE THAT SOME CASES MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE AND MAY INTERFERE WITH THE SCREEN PROTECTOR BY PEELING IT UP DUE TO THE CASE BEING VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGES OF THE DEVICE. It happened to my once, the case started to peel up my screen protector so be aware! I can highly recommend these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6RVKA5AIH0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGHM76O#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6RVKA5AIH0P","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:59 Mins Installation is extremely easy, yet meticulous with this tempered glass screen protector! It is ideally a bubble-less installation that will give you a high quality experience while using your iPad without diminishing the responsiveness and quality of your screen. Unlike plastic screen protectors, tempered glass lasts WAY longer and needs to be replaced less often. Now the idea of having glass on your screen sounds a bit pointless, however you would be surprised at how much stronger this stuff really is and how great it really works!

It is a one pack, however installation is bubble-less and the screen protector is very well constructed and can take quite a beating. If you are going to use this for an iPad Air 2, I would not recommend it because you could be interfering with Apple's new anti-reflective coating technology. It can interfere or diminish this feature entirely. Therefore, I could recommend this more for those shopping for their iPad Air 1st Gen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3U1RDV1W8WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY4NQDA#wasThisHelpful","R3I3U1RDV1W8WN","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is really awesome! It features a soft touch point that is really pleasant to use and mimics the responsiveness you would experience if you were using your fingers. Sometimes the tip will smudge the screen if it is already quite dirty or even if the stylus itself has any debris present. I found it very comfortable and I had no problem using it for long periods of time. The actual pen itself is nothing to get excited about, the quality is similar to the ink and tip found in a BIC pen. I think it is just something cool to add and it creates a purpose for you to have this around your desk while still looking really cool!

" 7:34 Mins I was extremely pleased with this brilliant product from Satechi. Not only is it a HIGH QUALITY and HIGH PERFORMING Ethernet Adapter, but it includes 3 USB 3.0 ports to add a grand total of 4 USB ports if you are using this on a device such as a macbook. The Aluminum body is extremely durable and matches mac-related products perfectly. You can use it with ANY computer, not just mac, and it even works with desktops. You do not need any additional drivers or software to use the adapter. It is literally plug and surf! I tested the ethernet speeds, refer to my review video above for live tests, and got my full 30 mbps internet speed. I was very impressed that this guy was actually able to live up to its 1000 mbps cap ethernet speed. The USB 3.0 ports are also full speed and work beautifully without any issues. There are also green and yellow LED indicators near the ethernet port to let you know that the ethernet adapter is actually receiving information and such. This ethernet adapter is much cheaper, better looking, and comes with more features when compared to other ethernet adapters, especially the Apple branded one. This is my favorite gadget so far and I can highly recommend it!

" 6:25 Mins I was really impressed with this external power bank from Elivebuy! They managed to cram so much power into an acceptable form factor given the amount of mAh. The battery is an LG Li-Polymer battery that is extremely high quality. Elivebuy also made use of the extra real estate by adding FOUR USB ports that all output over 2 amps! You can charge 4 devices at the same time without any issues! This power bank has enough power to regulate and charge four iPads, yes at the same time! The mosaic series is definitely a stylish power bank series that performs well too! The Powerbus includes a really nice and high quality braided micro-usb cable for charging the Powerbus, and micro-usb devices. You will want to purchase or use a 2amp or higher AC adapter because it can take 12-14 hours to fully charge this big guy. It is stated in the manual, and I can confirm from personal use that it does take a fairly significant amount of time to charge the battery. I suggest charging at night with a 2amp AC Adapter to speed things up a little bit. Overall, this is a very well rounded performer and it is perfect for nearly any situation or purpose! It is definitely not the most portable, however it is perfect for throwing in a traveling bag!Check out my FULL review video above for an unboxing, review, and of course additional thoughts on the battery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25128NH8DH3GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQV278U#wasThisHelpful","R25128NH8DH3GB","AOCQ1ORNR16AP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOCQ1ORNR16AP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

On a minor note, wish they had got his authentic hair color right; fierce redheads are special. Horrific that in trying to do more good, his guard was let down and the story ended the way it did.

"This story resumes almost immediately where the first left-off, with the shattered community of Broadchurch; we binged on Season One prior to watching, just for a refresher. It's quite an experience to watch both seasons consecutively! The hugely talented writer Chris Chibnall originally conceived ""Broadchurch"" as a trilogy - Season 3 is in the works! Set on the U.K.'s wind-buffeted Dorset coast, ""Broadchurch"" is a mystery series that deeply engages the audience. The narrative follows the loss and trauma following the murder of a young boy, the search for his killer, and the aftermath of the trial. DI Alec Hardy (David Tennant is superb) continues to work on the Sandbrook case, protecting a witness (Torchwood's Eve Myles) who is being stalked by the enigmatic Lee Ashworth (James D'Arcy). Hardy desperately collaborates with his former partner DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman, whose remarkable performance in Season 1 won her the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress). Charlotte Rampling also makes a welcome cast addition as a barrister for the prosecution.Series One began on a hazy summer morning along the lovely Dorset coastline, during the tourist season. An 11 year old boy, Danny Latimer (Oskar McNamara), goes missing. His mother desperately searches for her son. The mystery involves an entire community, exploring bonds of trust that are tested and broken. A remarkable cast makes both seasons of ""Broadchurch"" standout. David Tennant is one of the best actors out there, all intensity and nuance. DI Hardy, buffeted by life, took the case after barely surviving the ensuing scandal in Sandbrook, where the case was bungled; the victim's parents continue to blame him for the failure. Viewers learn that there is more to his past and their's. Tragedy drives Hardy on, despite the effect on his frail health.Olivia Colman, as DS Ellie Miller, lost out on a promotion to DI Hardy. She is also a victim, with her husband Joe having been accused of Danny's murder. She has lost her marriage and her friendship with Danny's mother, Beth Latimer (Jodie Whittaker). Her son Tom (Adam Wilson) is torn between loyalties. Wrestling with grief, Beth Latimer copes with her pregnancy and strained marriage, tumultuous since her husband Mark's (Andrew Buchan) affair with Becca Fisher (Simone McAullay). Alcoholic vicar, the Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill; glad to see he survived a thankless role in ""Doctor Who""), is quite an interesting character... Beth's frail faith is shaken to the core by the loss of her son, his absence is palpable and the trial strains everyone. Throughout, it appears Danny may have been blackmailing people; there is an undertow of darkness in Broadchurch.Miller's husband Joe (Matthew Gravelle) is oblivious to what is plea is costing the community.The editor of the local paper, Maggie Radcliffe (Carolyn Pickles), still can't control junior reporter Olly Stevens (Jonathan Bailey); he is Ellie's nephew. It turns out she and Jocelyn Knight, Prosecution Barrister, know each other well. Susan Wright (Pauline Quirke is perfect) returns to torment plumber Nigel Carter (Joe Sims).No matter how surrounded he is by people, DI Alec Hardy is dreadfully alone. As Broadchurch's cliffs drop dramatically to the sea, where water meets land and sky in sharp delineation, his soul seems on the cusp of a precipitous fall. He must find a way to survive. David Tennant as DI Hardy inhabits the character, a soul tormented by immense pressure, a storm within and without. Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, summoning a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold. You will be in suspense the entire, satisfying series. What a tightly and tautly written masterpiece. Past and present, Sandbrook and Broadchurch, are woven together; the continuity is breathtaking. This is quite the meditation on commitment, morality, and being careful of one's choices.

"As suspected, after enjoying this film, it turns out that Oliver's (Ewan McGregor) story is autobiographical. In 1999, writer/director Mike Mills' mother died of brain cancer. Shortly after that, his father came out as gay at the ripe old age of 75, after 44 years of marriage. He had five years of living ""out."" Christopher Plummer earned deserved accolades as Hal, completely inhabiting the role, a virtuoso performance for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Goran Vi≈°nji' is perfection as Andy, Hal's lover. Oliver's mother is wonderfully played by Mary Page Keller, whose nonconformism and witty dialogue with her son is a treat. The beautiful and multi-talented French actress M√©lanie Laurent is luminous as Oliver's intelligent, sensitive girlfriend. Cosmo, a remarkably emotive Jack Russell Terrier, is Arthur; his silent lines are one of the real delights of the script. The one weakness in the story is Oliver's inert lack of passion; due to witnessing his parents' odd marriage, he lacks the courage and intensity of either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOMR0M6BOQ9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006226EHI#wasThisHelpful","R1TOMR0M6BOQ9A","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

""Hector etc."" is badly written fluff that features an over-privileged putz wandering in foreign parts to see how the other half lives.

"David Jason completely inhabits pugnacious Frost, relying on his gut to solve mysteries whilst supplementing such with innumerable servings of fish & chips. By Season Five, the picture-quality has noticeably improved, with more filming in interesting landscapes. The story-lines have also gained in complexity. ""Penny For The Guy"" features kidnappers, and a missing child. ""House Calls"" involves housing-demolition and old/new murder cases. ""True Confessions"" is a stand-out with a great cast; fans will appreciate seeing the wonderful Jane Wymark (""Midsomer Murders""), the always excellent Anthony Calf, and the delightfully ginger Eion McCarthy. In ""No Other Love,"" Frost is reunited with long-suffering DS Clive Barnard (Matt Bardock); Supt.

"On blustery autumn afternoons some years ago, I walked along the River Cam to Grantchester, explored its lovely St Andrew & St Mary Church, and village pub, ""The Green Man."" So, I finally succumbed and watched this lite but entertaining series. James Norton is great as a troubled Anglican vicar (Sidney Chambers) who stumbles into crime-solving. The entire excellent cast works as best they can given the minimal narrative material they have been provided with. The acting is of the highest caliber, as are the locations. Chambers' flash-backs to his service during WWII are well done, and add much-needed gravitas. The character Leonard Finch, Chambers' curate, is perfectly nuanced by fine actor Al Weaver. Finch is one of the more compelling, deep characters in the series. One hopes the series explores more with Finch in Season Two, and that the stories begin to use the rich intellectual, historical, and spiritual resources of Cambridge University and environs. ""Grantchester"" at least features scenes filmed in and around the famous Cambridge pub ""The Eagle,"" where Watson and Crick worked out the Double-Helix on a napkin, and where the very best fish and chips are served to this day.

"A surprisingly fun romp, flawed in minor historical details, but good anyway. It's always a good sign when the distant past is depicted with enough authentic squalor and dirt. The story opens in the Dark Ages in 11th-century England, where the populace suffers from ignorance and disease. Itinerant barber-surgeons are all they have to turn to for medical help; Barbers risk being accused of witchcraft should anything go amiss.A young boy, Robert Cole (Tom Payne), witnesses his mother's death from ""side-sickness,"" or appendicitis; there is no understanding of the disease. It turns out that the boy possesses an unusual gift: by putting his hand on the chest of a sufferer, he can feel whether they will live or die. Orphaned, he runs away with Barber (the great Stellan Skarsg√•rd), a traveling barber-surgeon. Barber apprentices Cole, teaching the crude basics of his trade, such as amputation, bloodletting, and dentistry. But Barber slowly has been going blind. A prostitute tells Barber that a certain Jewish doctor could help him. With great care, this Doctor uses skills and tools left over from the Roman Empire and Middle Eastern knowledge to help. Remarkably, this Jewish family possesses an ancient World Map, and tell Cole how to find the famous Persian healer Ibn Sina (Ben Kingsley) in the far off city of Isfahan. Cole sadly leaves Barber, traveling across an unforgiving desert, where he meets a lovely bride being brought to her wealthy, older husband. Against all odds, Cole succeeds in being accepted into Ibn Sina's school, and taught philosophy, science, and medicine that are far more advanced than European knowledge. He and Ibn Sina save the city from the Black Death, but Cole breaks taboo by secretly performing an autopsy on a Zoroastrian who died of appendicitis. He discovers enough about anatomy to perform an appendectomy on the Shah (Olivier Martinez). An entertaining adventure, overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KUF6VQWFHT7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPJEJQS#wasThisHelpful","R3KUF6VQWFHT7R","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Superb continuation from Season Three. If anything, Seasons 3 and 4 continue the intensity and energy of the first two seasons, and actually improve the depth of characterization with superb writing and acting. Like its predecessor, this collection is less overtly gruesome. Thankfully, the brilliant Amelia Bullmore (DSI Gill Murray) is the Lead Writer for this season, writing four episodes. She deeply knows the cast and characters, and this is reflected in the quality of the stories. Bullmore is also superb in Ashes to Ashes: The Complete Collection - Series 1-3 (Region 2), which is the the sequel to the creative, unique Manchester police drama Life On Mars: The Complete Collection (U.K.). In ""Scott and Bailey,"" the writers, actors, directors, and entire team created one of the best and under-rated British suspense series out there. Lesley Sharp, magnificent in the BBC suspense series Afterlife: Series One and Afterlife: Series Two, brings her considerable talent to playing Detective Constable Janet Scott. She is well-matched by the extremely nuanced Suranne Jones as Detective Constable Rachel Bailey. They are members of the Metropolitan Police Major Incidents Team (MIT), headed by Amelia Bullmore as DSI Gill Murray.One of the aspects we appreciate is the nuanced way the tensions of working in a bureaucracy are cleverly portrayed, as well as exploration of maintaining professional and private relationships. Series 4 finds Gill experiencing PTSD after the trauma of the kidnapping, drinking overmuch, and struggling to maintain that challenging balance of authority and respect. her team must check her car before she leaves, ensuring there are no lunatics or bombs in the backseat.Both Janet and Rachael pass the Promotion Board, and Gill must choose who to pick as Sergeant. Janet faces challenges at home, but flirts with a charming new team member. Lonely, and coping with her ex and his new relationship, Janet dips her toe in the dating-pool. There is a hilarious scene with her interviewing male prospects whilst speed-dating, using her plethora of unnerving professional detective/interview skills. Rachel is involved with a senior cop, a great guy, but they have issues. In the final episodes of the series, Janet and Rachel fight to protect the reputation of Gill. Series 4 is the best of the show, and we wish it would continue indefinitely, but this seems to be the final offing. Catch the great bit of ""Extras: Behind the Scenes"" on Disk One.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1IRN8GVM7GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMDF33O#wasThisHelpful","RA1IRN8GVM7GB","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Watching this magnificently restored (in HD) series is an experience; like stepping inside another world. After an endless winter, we fully appreciate the vivid, tropical sights and sounds. There is an unusual degree of authenticity to the narrative, the series feels fresh and un-dated. Writer Paul Scott - his four novels ""The Raj Quartet"" are the basis for this series - actually served in India. In 1940, he was conscripted into the Intelligence Corps of the British Army. After Burma fell to the Japanese in 1942, Scott earned the rank of captain in the Indian Army Service Corps, where he provided logistical support in the reconquest of Burma. Scott's understanding of caste, poverty, and struggle provides a framework for a tragic, compelling story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4XXH1I94PL6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXDGJSA#wasThisHelpful","R4XXH1I94PL6L","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Series 1, we met the tattered and battered by life Alison Mundy (Lesley Sharp), washed-up in Bristol. Fans of ""Scott and Bailey"" will appreciate the superb Lesley Sharp - her acting is mesmerizing. Her Alison suffers emotional and physical scars. Lesley Sharp, as Alison Mundy, plays the character impeccably, with such depth and conviction, that she makes even the less credible stories more believable. Alison must come to terms with her psychic sensitivity, living with one foot in this world, the other the cold side of the grave. When she walks the hilly streets of Bristol, she is often unsure if the people she sees are really alive, or if they are restless spirits. Her narrow town-home is an artifact, marking her oddness, out of step with time, stuck in a previous period: 1970's avocado green looms in patterned wallpaper that is beyond retro, its dank hideousness dominates. Vinyl records are stacked on the floor; even her phone is old-fashioned.Series 2 drops the train-wreck story-line; Alison seems more maladjusted than before, with new, irritating quirks such as head-on-wall banging and OCD. The sorting of Smarties may induce hunger (these U.K. candies are like M&Ms, but with a vanilla-flavored sugar crust). Not until Alison resolves her issues with her father, and freakish dead mother, does she begin to seem less afflicted with hysteria. The whole story-line with Alison and her mother-issues is done with a heavy hand, scrawling ""End of the Series"" on the wall. But the last two episodes, ""Things Forgotten"" and ""A Name Written In Water,"" are excellent, weaving together her relationship with Robert Bridge (Andrew Lincoln) and his grief over Josh, coming full-circle in a powerful and profound way.The topics and stories of ""Afterlife"" exclude jolly cheerfulness; the spirits that contact Alison are troubled, damaged souls, with terrible, violent ends and unresolved issues. Some of these spirits even have deadly agendas towards the living. Overall, this is an interesting, experimental series that deserves a wider audience.

"I grew up in a genuinely haunted house, and appreciate this fine series, set in the haunted seaside city of Bristol, U.K. I don't understand why ""Afterlife"" is not better known, considering the quality of the actors, stories, and care with the sets. In Series 1, we meet the tattered and battered by life Alison Mundy (Lesley Sharp), washed-up in Bristol. Sharp inhabits her role impeccably, with such depth and conviction that she makes even less credible stories more believable. With emotional and physical scars, Alison survived a horrific train crash, and sees apparitions of her fellow travelers. She must come to terms with her psychic sensitivity, living with one foot in this world, the other the cold side of the grave. When Alison walks the hilly streets of Bristol, she is often unsure if the people she sees are really alive, or if they are restless spirits.

Robert feels responsible for his son's death, since he was driving the car in the accident that killed Josh three years ago. His marriage subsequently collapsed, and his wife has moved on with her own life. Robert is a complete skeptic about psychic mediums like Alison, but she is no fraud. His interactions with Alison constantly challenge his assumptions, but she must face him, since his son is one of her perpetual haunts. Josh's lost spirit keeps trying to make contact with his unwilling father. Alison must also cope with the damage to her body and spirit from the train wreck, and face her fear of fellow survivors who, like her, carry a burden of grief and guilt. Phyllida Law adds depth as a woman widowed by the crash, who organizes a seance in a scary old house, enlisting Alison against Robert's advice, in the magnificent closure of Series 1, with ""The 7:59 Club."" The painful journeys of the train crash survivors ultimately defy gloom with transcendence. But the consequences are dire for Alison.""Afterlife"" is rife with troubled, damaged souls, whose terrible, violent ends and unresolved issues haunt Alison.

In ""The Curse of the Golden Cross"" there are inaccurate, disturbing, and shockingly antisemitic phrases regarding medieval burnings, and rich, smug Jews scoffing.  This narrative is not acceptable, at present or when written in 1974 - only 29 years after the end of WWII. This dated series consists of unlikely, plodding mysteries, and dull dialogue.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97WZ1ZG3Z6CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0070XVQ5I#wasThisHelpful","R97WZ1ZG3Z6CJ","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most inventive, complex, mesmerizing, and creative films we have ever seen. A worthy successor to seeds like the classic ""Harold and Maude."" To say that each actor gives a remarkable performance is an understatement; the cast must have felt blessed to dive into such rich material. The narrative pushes the boundaries of identity, defying historic, socio-cultural limitations, showing why it is still worthwhile to make movies, why the medium continues to matter. An achievement that gives hope that insight and creativity are an integral part of our human endeavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VS1PGOOQZHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRWJ7VC#wasThisHelpful","R20VS1PGOOQZHY","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's great when low expectations are surprised by excellence; this unfairly critiqued film turned out to be a creative, entertaining experience. Jaden Smith's (Kitai) acting is luminous, nuanced, and remarkable in one so young. The visual conception and architectural elements are also superb. Sophie Okonedo is supremely intelligent and compelling (and of course, beautiful) as Kitai's mother. With the adversary Ursa, the story utilizes a monster as timeless as Beowulf's Grendel, ""he grabbed and mauled a man on his bench, bit into his bone-lappings, bolted down his blood and gorged on him in lumps,"" (Heaney edition). Man has consumed Earth, and a boy must learn to conquer his fear; a timeless narrative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HG4PTEU0URVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPH6M82#wasThisHelpful","R1HG4PTEU0URVH","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These characters continue to evolve in complexity, so this series just gets better and better. Doc Martin exemplifies an expression of Asperger syndrome that some viewers may be familiar with (we live with it). Louisa (Caroline Catz) seems to become less and less accepting of this condition, even forcing him to attend a toddlers' playgroup, to her frustration and demise. Sadly, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell is perfection) appears to be the only villager who understands the Doc, aside from his Aunt, however inappropriate her genuine admiration is. His odious, greedy mother turns up, which only adds to the strain on his marriage. New baby-minder Mike is OCD and thus extremely organized, great for the Doc & baby James, but threatening to insecure, messy Louisa. She preferred the odious Mel. Eileen Atkins is marvelous as the Doc's Aunt Ruth, and the honest friendship between her and young Al Large (Joseph Absolom) is one of the better story features.

"Give this vintage 1940 film a chance, because the moment Joan Bennett (a treat in the unique series Dark Shadows) enters, it's impossible to stop watching. Why Bennett is not an even more widely renown actress is beyond me, as her charisma and capacity for nuance are remarkable. Here, she plays a sassy nightclub singer who marries a shady businessman (George Raft). His lawyer also desires Joan, and sets his partner up for imprisonment at Alcatraz. Perennial good-guy Walter Pidgeon (as aviator Lloyd Nolan) also falls the the luscious Joan, how could help himself? Sadly, the film brought about the demise of Raft's career. Overall, a fun film for a rainy afternoon.

"I've done archaeology in Scotland, and enjoyed Diana Gabaldon's books. ""Doctor Who"" fans may appreciate that Gabaldon was inspired by early seasons of that BBC classic. Ronald D. Moore's production features an exceptional, intelligent cast; Scottish actor Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser, complex and wryly humorous. With strength and depth, Caitriona Balfe, while delicate, is remarkable as Claire Beauchamp Randall; she reminds me of Jessica Raine (""Call the Midwife""). Her first-person narrative is one of the best aspects of the show. Tobias Menzies (""Game of Thrones"") has intense range in the dual roles of kindly Frank Randall/his evil ancestor Jonathan ""Black Jack"" Randall. More Scottish greats are perfect here: Graham McTavish and Gary Lewis, authentic and spiny as thistle. The opening theme music, ""The Skye Boat Song,"" is resonant. The brave first episode is a standout, and scenes with Claire's apprehension over the Jacobite rebellion and the Battle of Culloden (April 16, 1746) are moving indeed. Occasionally, repetitive and cumbersome violence leaves too little to the imagination. While the books occasionally dwell on sadism, translating this into a visual narrative could be handled with more subtlety. We are looking forward to the next installments.

"Based on novels by Ann Cleeves, like Vera], this series is not to be missed. Douglas Henshall (great in Primeval: Vol. 1 & Primeval: Vol. 2) is perfection as the newly widowed Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez. No, his name does not sound Scottish, which is explained in one of the stories (old Spanish shipwrecks). The music and cinematography are breathtakingly beautiful. Sidekicks Alison O'Donnell (Detective Constable/Detective Sergeant Alison 'Tosh' MacIntosh) and Steven Robertson (Police Constable/Detective Constable Sandy Wilson) are good.Red BonesAlone in her croft, elderly Mima Wilson is murdered. This brings out family strife dating back to WWII, as well as complications with an archaeological dig on her property. Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez balances being the widowed father of a teenager, whose real father was his dead wife's ex. DI Perez can't shut down the traditional fire festival Up Helly Aa, while further murder ensues. The great Alexander Morton (Monarch of the Glen) does a memorable turn as Mima's son, Joseph Wilson.Raven BlackOn Midsummer night, the light lingers in the Shetlands. After visiting recluse Magnus Bain (Brian Cox is wonderful), a lonely, troubled young girl is murdered. Bain's croft overlooks the beach where she is found, and locals believe he is responsible. They also suspect him of being involved with the unsolved disappearance 19 years previously of young Catriona. The two victims lived in the same house. An absorbing, excellent mystery.Dead WaterThis episode has a great cast: Kari Corbett (also of Monarch of the Glen) in a star performance as beleaguered bride-to-be Evie Watt, the superb Clive Russell (also a guest on Monarch, and ""Blackfish"" in Game of Thrones: Season 2, and David Hayman as Joe Dalhousie. An old journalist friend of Perez's wife dies in a suspicious car wreck. Along with Evie, he was questioning the environmental impact of a controversial new gas pipeline. Beautiful scenes with Dalhousie out on his boat, listening to the clouds and water... Unfortunately, there are indeed some slow scenes that could have used some editing, namely, the long, dark, repetitive sequence in the missing bridegroom's home. But overall, a good mystery indeed.Blue LighteningCleves' real life husband is an ornithologist, no wonder birds frequently feature in ""Vera"" and ""Shetland."" Perez must return his childhood Shetland home, Fair Isle, to investigate the murder of a lead female ornithologist. Storms isolate the island, while his father tries to help, while Perez copes without a forensic team. The victim's husband (John Lynch, also great in The Secret of Roan Inish) is a suspect, so is an obsessive coworker, and a former flame. Perez finds that the victim's son and his friend's son may also be hiding something. The team needs to obtain a consistent dog, and please watch the sky with edits (stormy to sunny too quickly).The good news is that filming for a third series will begin in 2015, with a single-story arc told in six episodes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KT70BZKAN1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUFCPPC#wasThisHelpful","R4KT70BZKAN1F","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Conflict arises amongst the vaulted spires of Oxford whilst female clerics face an uphill battle, no matter how brilliant or dedicated. Beware the religious fanatic in ""Fat Chance,"" and enjoy a superb cast of guest actors. There is an odd subplot revolving dieting; amusingly, Lewis states his decided preference for a full-figured woman. Morse at least finds comfort in his ale, a ""favourite"" food.

I spend hours out in the woods everyday, on trail and off bush-wacking, crossing frozen streams and lakes, hiking up icy trails, and dealing with blizzards. I have not found these cleats to pick up any more snow in warmer weather, in fact, they have saved me from falling more times than I can count.

"Superb continuation from Series 3. And like its predecessor, Series 4 is less overtly gruesome than Series 1 and 2. If anything, 3 and 4 are even better, with superb writing and acting. Thankfully, brilliant Amelia Bullmore (DSI Gill Murray) is the Lead Writer for this series, writing four episodes. She deeply knows the cast and characters, and man, does she deliver! Bullmore is also superb in Ashes to Ashes: The Complete Collection - Series 1-3 (Region 2) which is the the sequel to superb, unique Manchester police drama Life On Mars: The Complete Collection (U.K.). In ""Scott and Bailey,"" the writers, actors, directors, and entire team created one of the best and under-rated British suspense series out there. Lesley Sharp, magnificent in other BBC series, such as Afterlife: Complete Series 1 & 2 (Regions 2 & 4), brings her considerable talent to playing Detective Constable Janet Scott. She is well-matched by the extremely nuanced Suranne Jones as Detective Constable Rachel Bailey. They are members of the Metropolitan Police Major Incidents Team (MIT), headed by Amelia Bullmore as DSI Gill Murray.One of the aspects we appreciate is the nuanced way the tensions of working in a bureaucracy are cleverly portrayed, as well as exploration of maintaining professional and private relationships. Series 4 finds Gill experiencing PTSD after the trauma of the kidnapping, drinking overmuch, and struggling to maintain that challenging balance of authority and respect. her team must check her car before she leaves, ensuring there are no lunatics or bombs in the backseat.Both Janet and Rachael pass the Promotion Board, and Gill must choose who to pick as Sergeant. Janet faces challenges at home, but flirts with a charming new team member. Lonely, and coping with her ex and his new relationship, Janet dips her toe in the dating-pool. There is a hilarious scene with her interviewing male prospects whilst speed-dating, using her plethora of unnerving professional detective/interview skills. Rachel is involved with a senior cop, a great guy, but they have issues. In the final episodes of the series, Janet and Rachel fight to protect the reputation of Gill. Series 4 is the best of the show, and we wish it would continue indefinitely, but this seems to be the final offing.

"""Vera"" is a tremendous visual and imaginative treat. Always superb, Brenda Blethyn is the driving, elemental force that is Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope: salt of the earth. Blethyn's face is as expressive and interesting as the blustery northern English landscape, weathering storms of conflict within and without. Blethyn grew up in unpretentious, working-class circumstances, and brings that richness of experience to her role. Great mystery series go beyond the genre to encompass a wide range of life-issues; ""Vera"" explores complexity beautifully. Filmed in clouded northern light, with nuanced shades of human emotion, DCI Vera Stanhope's unresolved pathos over her lonely life underlines the narrative. Slugging down whisky under sullen clouds, Vera once declared that solitude is not for the faint-hearted. Northumberland is another character, its rolling hills and rough coastline, the heavy line of the sea, castle ruins, and towns hit hard by decades of economic hardship, providing a unique canvas for these mysteries. Houses huddle under a leaden sky that slams down at the end of the street, a permanent dead-end. The northern dialect, strewn with a heritage of Viking remnants, is as hefty and delicious as meat-pies and ale. Northumberland's northern light and wave-tossed seascapes provide a timelessness to the human narrative strewn upon the landscape.The haunting soundtrack, by Ben Bartlett, adds an ominous depth to the series. The marvelous Brenda Blethyn is amazing; she and the rest of the talented crew authentically bring alive the mystery novels of Ann Cleves. The series is further enlivened by a great cast. David Leon is excellent as Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, coping with Vera's dark moods and worrying over her health. Jon Morrison plays long-suffering Detective Constable Kenny Lockhart, Sonya Cassidy perfectly depicts Sergeant Joe Ashworth's wife Celine, and Clare Calbraith is newcomer DC Rebecca Shpherd. In the U.K., theater, movie, and television productions value actors who are robustly, deeply human, and provide venues like this series that share this wealth of talent.

Happily, there will be future stories to come. Enjoy!""The Christmas Haunting,"" written by Chris Murray. This is great stuff! DCI Barnaby and DS Nelson investigate a murder that occurs during a ghost-hunting party at a haunted estate. The toys are indeed scary! A guest is stabbed with an antique sword. There is a legend involving a vengeful spirit, a blacksmith's daughter, whilst Barnaby and Nelson unravel earth-bound motives to find the killer. This is the first appearance of Gwilym Lee as DS Charlie Nelson - a fine addition to a great cast! Try a mug of ""Causton Special Ale"" in the pub...""Let Us Prey,"" written by Paul Logue. Wonderful guest stars add to another fine story. In soggy Midsomer St Clair, a woman is found drowned in a river with a mask on her head.

Rain continues to flood the area, mindful of ""The Nine Tailors"" by the great Dorothy L. Sayers.""Wild Harvest,"" written by the great team of Rachel Cuperman and Sally Griffiths. A great addition to the macabre oeuvre of Midsomer! An herbalist finds the unfortunate farmer Martin Strickland tied to a tree, covered in truffle oil, and subsequently mauled to death by one of Midsomer's roaming wild boars. A macabre murder fit for the classic series - right up there with death by trebuchet-launched wine. This being Midsomer, the body-count rises, and complex knots of tormented relationships must be unraveled by our intrepid duo.""The Flying Club,"" by Michael Aitkens. When the owner of Finchmere Airfield is dropped from a plane to meet a gruesome death, Barnaby and Nelson find the exciting world of stunt pilots and military heroes hides many dark secrets. It's a puzzle whether anti-airport campaigners are behind Bernard King's murder, or if it links back to a tragic World War Two mission. The wonderful Bernie Gribbens (Doctor Who) guest stars.""The Killings of Copenhagen,"" written by Paul LogueYay, we're back in Badger's Drift! A standout! An especially excellent feature, which is a treat since this is the 100th episode. While on a business trip to Copenhagen, the boss of Calder's Biscuits is killed when he opens a poisoned tin of his famous Golden Clusters, sent from Badger's Drift. Danish detectives (quite funny in their comments on English detectives) require the assistance of Barnaby and Nelson. Denmark is Midsomerized beautifully; the Danish cast is superb. There is a great scene inside Calder's Biscuits with the baker- maestro, a la Willie Wonka. Of course, more bodies are found, murdered in inimitable Midsomer style. Be sure to have plenty of and Carr's Ginger Lemon Creme Cookies on hand. Sykes is superb throughout, and we finally get to meet the newest addition to the Midsomer family. Enjoy!The Bonus Extras are a lot of fun, with New Blood: a charming interview with Gwilym Lee, a jovial behind-the -scenes romp, and another: Celebrating 100 Episodes.PS: You also may want to catch Neil Dudgeon's unforgettable performance in a superb story (episode 3) in the BAFTA Award winning series The Street, the first season. He plays Brian Peterson, a teacher accused of being a flasher, whose wife waivers in her trust. Peterson gazes out of a taxi window passing street after fogbound street, each full of stories about the complexity of life with its moments of mystery. Be aware that The Street can be gritty and harrowing, unlike Midsomer's hills and dales.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30B66PD65UVXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU4MP0K#wasThisHelpful","R30B66PD65UVXV","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Exquisite music that transcends time and space, sublime indeed! This collection is a balm for the spirit, contemplative appreciation can deepen upon repeated listening. ""Magnum Mysterium"" is especially luminous. The talent and guidance of the choir is remarkable. Fr. Michael Drea is clearly dedicated to Liturgical Music. Trained in the U.K., the choir's Director of Music shares his gifts abundantly, as does organist Dr. Jonathan Wessler. The choir's range, complexity, and teamwork is breathtaking, from the young trebles and soloists, to the adult altos and basses. You can treasure this CD beyond the Christmas season. I'm grateful that Monica and Kevin Fitzgibbons were moved by the Holy Spirit in their ""dedication to truth and beauty"" to help create this marvelous CD.

"""Vera"" is a tremendous visual and imaginative treat. Always superb, Brenda Blethyn is the driving, elemental force that is Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope: salt of the earth. Blethyn's face is as expressive and interesting as the blustery northern English landscape, weathering storms of conflict within and without. Blethyn grew up in unpretentious, working-class circumstances, and brings that richness of experience to her role. Great mystery series go beyond the genre to encompass a wide range of life-issues; ""Vera"" explores complexity beautifully. Filmed in clouded northern light, with nuanced shades of human emotion, DCI Vera Stanhope's unresolved pathos over her lonely life underlines the narrative. Slugging down whisky under sullen clouds, Vera once declared that solitude is not for the faint-hearted. Northumberland is another character, its rolling hills and rough coastline, the heavy line of the sea, castle ruins, and towns hit hard by decades of economic hardship, providing a unique canvas for these mysteries. Houses huddle under a leaden sky that slams down at the end of the street, a permanent dead-end. The northern dialect, strewn with a heritage of Viking remnants, is as hefty and delicious as meat-pies and ale. Northumberland's northern light and wave-tossed seascapes provide a timelessness to the human narrative strewn upon the landscape.The haunting soundtrack, by Ben Bartlett, adds an ominous depth to the series. The marvelous Brenda Blethyn is amazing; she and the rest of the talented crew authentically bring alive the mystery novels of Ann Cleves. The series is further enlivened by a great cast. David Leon is excellent as Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, coping with Vera's dark moods and worrying over her health. Jon Morrison plays long-suffering Detective Constable Kenny Lockhart, Sonya Cassidy perfectly depicts Sergeant Joe Ashworth's wife Celine, and Clare Calbraith is newcomer DC Rebecca Shpherd. In the U.K., theater, movie, and television productions value actors who are robustly, deeply human, and provide venues like this series that share this wealth of talent. All the guest stars are top-notch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VIDCREBIQYCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH98QR2#wasThisHelpful","R2VIDCREBIQYCI","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's clear that U.K. writer Peter Moffat knows what he's writing about in his depiction of working-class village life at the turn of the previous century. His Scottish grandfather and great-grandfather were shepherds (""Doctor Who"" fans, he is unrelated to Steven Moffat). An enormous feature of ""The Village"" series is its topography. Cinematographer David Odd captures a landscape where nothing is straight. The stone walls are the bones of the land, green with lichen and moss, seemingly holding the land together under a vast cloud-driven sky. Absolutely beautiful. Moffat's wonderful narrator, Old Bert Middleton (David Ryall), begins this story as the 2nd oldest man in Britain (and by episode 3, the 1st oldest dies-off). Vivid writing and a fine cast create an utterly believable world.The summer of 1914 was the first time ever a bus came to Bert's Derbyshire village, no one expected anyone to actually get off. Young Bert Middleton (exquisitely played by Bill Jones) was only 12 years old, but he fell in love immediately with new arrival, young Martha Lane (Charlie Murphy). He still loves her 100 years later. Bert's older brother Joe (perfectly portrayed by Manchester native Nico Mirallegro), is a servant in the Big House and he also falls for Martha. Both boys are afraid of their tormented father John, a drunken Peak District farmer (the always remarkable John Simm, catch the Manchester drama Life On Mars (U.K.)). For context, Simm himself researched what the life of his struggling-against-the elements farmer would have been, reading local history in Milk, Muck and Memories: Farming Lives Collected by Margaret Wombwell. Maxine Peake is mesmerizing in her powerful performance as the long-suffering boy's mother, Grace Middleton (see her in Moffat's Criminal Justice). Grace is a ballast for her family.Old Bert is asked what his childhood was like. His answer: ""Short."" What made it short? Wryly, he says, ""Being poor and being hungry."" This first collection covers the period from 1914 to 1920, with the harrowing fallout from World War I, with tragic consequences to the Middleton family, the entire village, and Bert's gentle schoolteacher Mr. Eyre (Matt Stokoe), who protects him from a bullying colleague. Eyre gifts the teenaged Bert (Alfie Stewart) with a camera, and we are thus treated to ""historic"" photos of a lost time. A menacing character is Detective Stephen Bairstow, darkly played by Joe Armstrong (we noticed an uncanny resemblance to another great U.K. actor, Alun Armstrong, and later discovered why).Thankfully, there is a second series in the works for 2014; this will progress the series into the 1920s. There is speculation that future series may also be created, to cover World War II, and possibly post-war Britain. We look forward to more!354 Minutes on 2 Disks, English subtitles provided.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XOP95POS834/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRAXG72#wasThisHelpful","R27XOP95POS834","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film is exquisitely written, by Vaughan Sivell. I appreciate strong narrative, and ""Third Star"" delivers in spades.I immensely relate to the film. During a tumultuous move to an arctic environment, a huge lump popped out of my neck. This, after a back injury from falling on ice (which still limits me). Weak, ill, and losing weight, I had no idea what was going on with my health. Even my insurance got lost in transition due to bureaucratic incompetence. Turns out I had a fast growing tumor, and by the time I could finally have surgery arranged, it was the size of a golf ball. I lived with months of struggle, not knowing if the thing was malignant or not. This time it was not, but can it can recur and then be cancerous.Benedict Cumberbatch is simply superb as James, terminally ill, who knows he won't live past his 29th birthday. He sets off on a mystical visit to  Barafundle Bay, on the Pembrokeshire coast with his three best friends, Davy, Bill and Miles. Hugh Bonneville does an exquisite turn as a beach nutter, can't be missed! There are moments of poetry, as in the opening scene with the ocean flowing backwards, and in James' dream with the tunnel of light. There is a grim humor that I can relate to, having walked the shores of a wintery sea, on a lonely boardwalk along the ice. ""The Third Star"" shows the anger of living with death, the searing honesty when one feels that there is no time to lie about anything - the sharp edge of reality. Death can be a vivid, an immensely alive time as well, pathos, pain, forgiveness, and love all searingly brought to life in this film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CHIHDSIZZ8RD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098QBEXO#wasThisHelpful","R3CHIHDSIZZ8RD","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Brits are a dab hand at portraying their ironic and difficult post-war years (""George Gently""), where materialistic plenty seeps into society, and corruption spreads even to the refined environs of Oxford. The score and narrative music of Barrington Pheloung's compositions deepen the experience, and are the connective narrative tissue between this series and the beloved, classic ""Inspector Morse"" with John Thaw. This new set of chapters in Morse's life is absolutely compelling. Shaun Evans' acting is a work of art, each nuance knitting the new/old Morse together, from brittle self-doubt, to stubborn intelligence. Even the origin of Morse's limp is woven into the story...After leaving Oxford without obtaining a degree, Endeavour (Shaun Evans) serves as a cipher in the Royal Corps of Signals, and then joins the police. In mid 1960s, he is transferred to Oxford. Roger Allam is wonderful as D.I. Thursday, Morse's caring mentor who has a few skeletons in the closet. The wounds of WWII run deep; in the third mystery, people wear the traditional red poppies pinned for Remembrance Sunday, a traditional that vividly continues in the U.K. Bonfires, smoke and ashes, an evocative and painful time of year underscores Thurday's turmoil. We meet the ambitious P.C. Strange, and see how it is he advances faster than Morse, while becoming a Freemason with Oxford's subversive elite. Anton Lesser as Reginald Bright, Police Chief Superintendent (PCS), is absolutely superb, a perfect foil for Morse and Thursday, his voice and manner straight out of that post-war era, where past values clash with progress. The writing is remarkable, the cast impeccable. When young Morse visits his difficult, dying father, the man lying on the bed could be John Thaw.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7L5LBA4G7XM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCHENE4#wasThisHelpful","R2F7L5LBA4G7XM","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Cobh, County Cork, Ireland, Ivan McCullough's magnificent cinematography brings this evocative film, written and directed by Conor McPherson, to life. I was surprised at what a good movie this is, not exactly horror, more subtle than that. Ciar√°n Hinds, always excellent, evokes quiet loneliness as Michael Farr, a recently widowed father of two children. At night, he secretly writes in his attic office, while during the day he teaches shop. A high-point for him is volunteering at the town's annual literary festival. The lovely seaside town is a perfect backdrop for the mysterious elements that begin to overtake Michael. His angry, aged father-in-law lies near death in a nursing home, yet Micheal glimpses his figure roaming the house at night.Extremely unpretentious, Michael is assigned to chauffeur and help out an acclaimed writer of ghost stories, Lena (Iben Hjejle). The quality of her writing and honest narrative causes Michael to incrementally confide in her. Meanwhile, a famous writer (Aidan Quinn), pesters Lena to get back together, despite his being married. There is a lovely scene when Michael drives off, leaving his daughter to open the shutters in the blueish light of dawn. One has the impression she is aware something peculiar is going on. Irish spirituality is hinted at in the old graveyard Michael and Lena visit, in the statuary of the nursing home, and around the large church prominently arising from the town like a castle. One has the impression of an ancient faith, still functioning, like a bulky ship plowing through the sea. Yet, despite repeatedly filming religious paraphernalia, the threshold remains uncrossed. One of the best moments is when Aiden Quinn's drunk character accuses Michael of being a hanger-on, a wanna-be writer. In reality, Hinds has more talent than anyone realizes. The film would have been stronger if there had been a more overt, less painterly narrative, especially regarding Michael's spiritual/personal journey, and depiction of real contact with Lena after some good news.The film's strength is how it quietly shows how a shy, hidden writer struggles to resolve his personal and real ghosts, and get on with life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7UYCSDEMC27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003A3PWFW#wasThisHelpful","RN7UYCSDEMC27","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Galway and Dublin, this Irish mystery series features tormented detective Jack Taylor; Iain Glen deeply inhabits this character. Art and pathos combine, with an overflow of booze, in this finely nuanced set of stories. The best mysteries ask questions about life's struggles, and the quest for truth. This second collection further deepens the narrative. While Glen is superb in ""Game of Thrones,"" in ""Jack Taylor"" he stretches his acting-chops to a harrowing degree. Reminiscent of the great film noirs of the 40s and 50s, Raymond Chandler, stained with whisky, smoke, and sea. Jack Taylor wonders, ""Why is it that family can push our buttons so effectively?

"After months of pain and illness, I had extremely serious surgery to remove a large tumor from my neck area. The procedure left an extensive, painful, pronounced-raised scar. After a month, the scar remained protruding, red, and painful. We had bought a smaller jar of this aromatic, delicious Nutiva coconut oil for other nutritious health purposes, but just out of curiosity I decided to apply a bit to the scar. Within the first day of applying Nutiva's pure coconut oil to the scar, it flattened-out and the pain decreased! After two days of application, the appearance and pain further improved. The scar now looks completely different. I would never have believed it, unless this actually happened, and hadn't expected such a positive result! So now I'm using this as an unguent for hair and skin, as well as a supplement. Amazing! Nutiva's coconut oil must have anti-inflammatory properties when applied topically; it did far more than simply sooth, it went deep and helped traumatized scarring heal way faster than normal. Highly recommended. Other brands don't taste or smell as good.

"Martin Shaw is superb as a deeply intelligent and ethical police detective who has become fed-up with corruption at London's Met. Complex, honest, and stalwart, Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw) is a veteran of World War II who had happily married his lovely Italian bride. After witnessing her murder in ""Series One,"" the grieving Gently seeks refuge in the North East. Shaw is masterful, powerfully depicting a man with deep integrity and convictions, and a talent for boxing. Those of you who enjoy Vera are in for a treat. Filmed in England's starkly beautiful North Country, and historic city of Durham, this vivid series boasts high-production values, and authentically recreates the ambiguous, and at times disturbing, era of the late 1960s.Series Five ended on a disturbing note, a cliffhanger, where the fate of our main characters was unsure. Veteran cop George Gently mentors Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby), a young fellow whose morals run adrift amidst the swirling social turmoil of the 1960s. As Gently's ambitious sidekick, Ingleby inhabits his character perfectly. You may recall Ingleby's inimitable turn in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , as the Knight Bus conductor, Stan Shunpike. Blessed with abundant talent and a memorable voice, Ingleby is incisive as the menacing Vic Tyler in the highly regarded 1970s police/time-travel hit Life On Mars: The Complete Collection (U.K.). A fine constant is PC Taylor (Simon Hubbard), who grumblingly serves many a cuppa of PG Tips Black Tea with plates of biscuits.Series Six resumes in 1969, several months after Gently and Bacchus were brutally shot admit the majestic Durham Cathedral. This encounter nearly claimed their lives, and both suffer post-traumatic stress, along with physical scars. Poor Bacchus is still recuperating in a police convalescent homeEach mystery is feature-length at 89 minutes. Thankfully, there are English subtitles, for those of who do not want to miss one word. For a three-dimensional taste experience, you may want to indulge in some Northumberland style bangers & mash, with a classic Newcastle Nut Brown Ale (a favorite of Bacchus') to top it off. Enjoy!""Gently Between the Lines""Gently is shocked to receive Bacchus's resignation, as the sergeant is suffering PTSD after the shooting (in the last season). Although Gently seems to accept the young man's notice, he insists that Bacchus help with another murder investigation. After rioters were arrested after Newcastle police tried to clear a poor neighborhood out, prior to demolition and redevelopment, one of the protesters is found dead in the cells the next morning. The case causes both Gently and Bacchus to examine their role as police officers, during a time when law enforcement changed from being seen as locally based, to being thuggish agents of the state. Young policewoman Rachel Coles (Lisa Mcgrillis) is wrongly fired from the force - just wait and see what our George makes of that! Written by Tim Prager; cast includes: Robert Pugh, Steve Evets, Ruth Gemmell, Matt Stokoe and Caroline O'Neill.""Blue for Bluebird""This mystery is written by Jess Williams, of the marvelous series ""Call The Midwife."" Personally, I tend to dislike mysteries set in coastal holiday camps, and this one features dreadful clown faces. A beautiful young ""Bluebird"" from the camp washes ashore. Under all the camp's revelry and playful permissiveness, Gently and Bacchus expose a web of greed and jealousy. PC Rachel Coles (Lisa Mcgrillis) assists the team, while Bacchus fights to see more of his daughter. Guest stars include: Lee Boardman, and Pixie Lott.""Gently From the Cold""As often is the case in murder investigations, cases connect in ways not anticipated. From a murder in a sauna, the case moves Gently to investigate the possibility of military abuse. He finds himself actually facing a wall of silence and Cold War conspiracy. Written by Jess Williams; guest stars include: Jemma Redgrave and Helen Coverdale.""Gently Going Under""The best mystery of the lot, with wonderful developments in the relationships between Gently, Bacchus, and newcomer Coles (Lisa Mcgrillis). During the late 1960s, massive economic shifts pressure communities in the North. As Northumberland's coal mining industry suffers, stress grows in tightly knit mining communities. In Burnsend, a body is found in the mine, and Gently and Bacchus must unearth the truth beneath the community's tensions. In this beleaguered community, schisms and ill-feelings there date back to World War II. Though WWII may seem distant now, in 1969, it had only been over 24 years. To make a contemporary comparison, many of us recall the 1980s up to 1990 quite vividly. Time is relative, and memory collapses intervening years quite effectively. Written by Mike Cullen (the great Scottish series ""Taggart""); guest stars include: Grant Crookes, Neil Eddy, and Poppy Lee Friar.While you wait for more George, there is another wonderful mystery series set in Northumbria, worth savoring. Based upon novels by Ann Cleeves (Crow Trap), the series features the great Brenda Blethyn as caustic DCI Vera Stanhope: Vera, Vera: Set 2, Vera, Set 3 (to be released).

"Some of us are blessed to know real minions, and they need the jolly reinforcement of seeing their brethren gathered en-mass in this film! The details of the art and film are overwhelmingly amazing, from the curly hairs on creature-dog Kyle's chin, to the underwater and jam sequences, the colors are delicious! There is even a love story here, quite delightfully done, along with mocking hideous, superficial puffed-up fake fish lips too prevalent in the plastic world today, anti-bullying, plus, pro-baldness, as there's nothin' wrong with less hair! And thank goodness for Minionese, we can't get enough of the little yellow guys. Good-hearted Gru and his girls Agnes, Edith, and Margo are a lovely family, and Anti-Villain League operative Lucy Wild is a treat.

"Wonderfully narrated by Denholm Elliott, this beautiful film, ""A Child's Christmas in Wales,"" delves into the richness of Dylan Thomas' prose. Gorgeous cinematography of the coastal Welsh village and surrounding landscape vividly brings to life this classic Christmas tale. Dylan Thomas' 1955 poem, originally written for radio, is meant to be savored on a chill winter's night, and nostalgically portrays a simpler time, with a child's special imagination. On Christmas Eve, kindly grandfather ""Old Geraint"" (Elliott) shares stories about his Christmas past with his beloved grandson, Thomas (a perfectly elfin Mathonwy Reeves). The narrative poetry will pull you in: ""All the Christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged, fish-freezing waves, and I plunge my hand in the snow and bring out whatever I can find. In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting on the rim of the carol-singing sea...""True to Thomas' story, the film delightfully describes a Useless Present: ""a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow..."" I have heard black and white cow-cats like that, who poke around the ground with their little faces, eating grass and moo-mewing.This film can enrich and inspire your family traditions during the holidays. To further savor the story, we also have the book, A Child's Christmas in Wales. You also might want to try another lyrical film: The Secret of Roan Inish.

"This inimitable series continues amidst Midsomer's deceptively bucolic hills and dales, whilst denizens inflict numerous creative demises upon one another. Three new, feature-length Midsomer mysteries are a welcome arrival. Of a fond and generous heart towards Midsomer, this would merit five-stars, but for the first episode and a fine cast of actors coping with material that is occasionally too contemporary, with less humorous banter between the main characters. These issues get ironed out. DCI John Barnaby is wonderfully played by Neil Dudgeon, while Jason Hughes has been given too little to work with as DI Ben Jones. On a musical note, loyal fans loved Midsomer's iconic score, composed by Jim Parker, and performed on the appropriately weird musical instrument, the theremin. Ears perked at Midsomer's spooky, inimitable opening notes. Unfortunately, a decision was made to replace the eerie theremin with a violin, resulting in a loss of continuity. There needs to be a return to charming but deadly places like Badger's Drift, with peculiar, humorous puzzles. Like a lace doily blotched with tea, Midsomer's coziness has a sinister stain, darkness seeps in at the edges.The running time of ""Midsomer Murders, Set 23"" is approximately 278 minutes; subtitles are available; Extras: audio commentary for ""The Dark Rider"" with Neil Dudgeon and director Alex Pillai, and a behind-the-scenes featurette for ""Death and the Divas.""""The Dark Rider""Written by Michael Aitkens, who antagonized loyal fans with the abominable ""Death in the Slow Lane,"" in Midsomer Murders, Set 21. Barnaby and Jones investigate a series of untimely deaths linked to sightings of a headless horseman. While Midsomer County sports a spectrum of deviant behaviors, this particular offering is overly preposterous and oddly paced, with a number of unsympathetic characters. The mystery revolves around the gentrified DeQuettevilles, who stage an historic battle re-enactment every year. There is silly competition with grating and obnoxious neighbors. At least there are bits about Barnaby, his wife (Fiona Dolman), and Sykes settling into Midsomer.""Murder of Innocence""Written by Elizabeth-Anne Wheal, this moody Midsomer mystery inveigles DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) with the protection a hated offender. Momentarily, the beginning is a bit off; Midsomer fans prefer views of chocolate-box villages, hedge rows, and tree-lined lanes, as compared to bleak bus stations. Hang in there. Released from jail, the parolee, guarded against angry villagers by Barnaby and Jones, lodges in a super-dismal cottage. Past and present collide, and a local barrister dies in suspicious circumstances. The accused culprit claims to be innocent of the crime he was locked up for in the first place, as well as the barrister's death. The suspense and body-count builds; layers of the past must be peeled back, while previous events ripple into the present.Death and the DivasThis is a standout episode, classic, quirky, Midsomer, wacky and weird; thanks to writers Rachel Cuperman and Sally Griffiths, who satisfy the macabre appetites of loyal Midsomer fans. The Midsomer Langley Film Festival is underway, and it turns out our Barnaby is a fan of the lead actress and her campy, gothic oeuvre. During the festivities, a writer is murdered whilst a campy horror classic plays on the telly. The murder is ghoulishly like one that occurred in a cult 1960s horror film. This being Midsomer, further murders ensue, each one reenacting a cult-film classic. Harriet Walter Dorothy L. Sayers Mysteries does a fine turn as an obnoxiously successful actress, returning home to Midsomer to upstage her sister, who happens to be the film-festival's star. Well done, in the spirit of the long-running series!You may want to try a wonderful mystery series, set in the U.K.'s blustery, beautiful Northumbria, based on novels by Ann Cleeves (Crow Trap). The series features the great Brenda Blethyn as caustic DCI Vera Stanhope: Vera, Vera: Set 2, Vera, Set 3 (to be released). Be sure to have plenty of hot, strong tea and Carr's Ginger Lemon Creme Cookies on hand.The U.K. boasts numerous fine and often underrated actors; catch Neil Dudgeon's unforgettable performance in a superb story in the BAFTA Award winning series The Street, (1st Season, Episode 3). He plays Brian Peterson, a teacher accused of being a flasher, whose wife waivers in her loyalty to him. When Peterson gazes out of a taxi window passing fogbound streets, we see that each street is full of stories, lives with moments of mystery. ""The Street"" is gritty and harrowing, unlike Midsomer's macabre villages.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HDLKF0U2AV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHH9IRG#wasThisHelpful","R20HDLKF0U2AV1","A3LQDYVAAHHV2T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LQDYVAAHHV2T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing cools like crazy. Its amazingly quiet. We really like it a LOT and now I'm considering a 3 stage unit for my mother-in-law's house.The only two problems that I had with it are:1-The manual covers three models on each page and is very confusing. Come on Pioneer -- its a PDF file. It costs nothing to make one specifically for each model. The manual does not cover the things you need to consider BEFORE YOU START installation -- like where is the drain going to go. This caused a LOT of problems when we discovered what was necessary AFTER it was on the wall with the pipes connected.2- The drain for the inside unit. OMG! This was the biggest pain in the butt. In the manual they keep saying ""be sure the drain is lower than the pipes"". Well, BE SURE THE DRAIN IS LOWER THAN THE PIPES. The slightest upward curve in the drain will cause a flood in your room. There was no mention of the second drain hole on the left of the indoor unit. THAT would have saved hours of pain. You MUST determine the hole through the wall based on the drain, not the pipes or you will have a LOT of extra work. The drain must be connected, re-connected, or plugged BEFORE you mount the indoor unit on the wall and it should go straight out of the unit out the wall -- not across the bottom of the unit as it is shipped. The drain tubing seems flimsy and is short. I could not find any way to extend it (like 1/2"" or 3/8"" pipe). Also found out the hard way that putting in a drain trap at the end caused the water to back up and flood the room. Still haven't figured out how that could possibly happen, but it does. Does this defy gravity?This was not a real problem but be sure you find the tube of sealant for the flared ends. Its very small and was lose in the giant box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388BQ6DP5U6JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0Z6FFQ#wasThisHelpful","R388BQ6DP5U6JC","A2N6850P9TDYFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6850P9TDYFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I always have trouble keeping ear buds in my ears and these also work their way out but not nearly as often or as fast as other buds I have tried.

I work a lot in my yard and have caught the earbuds on limbs and about everything else that sticks out and they are still intact.

"I got the Alpine 149BT last week as a gift (it was on my wish list).Let me start off saying that if you really care about the sound quality of your music, you just can‚Äôt beat Alpine. I don‚Äôt know how they do it, but Alpine units just SOUND amazing. Having said that, that seems to be Alpine‚Äôs only strength. I got the 149BT to replace an older Alpine head unit that was almost exactly the same but without BlueTooth and HD radio. I really enjoyed that radio except the CD player was not so great (sound-wise excellent, mechanically not-so-much), nor the iPod playing capability (sound quality excellent but plays out of order - sometimes/often), nor the fact that every add-on (HD radio, BT) cost almost as much os the radio itself.This seems to be a recurring theme with the new 149BT. It SOUNDS fantastic. But every time I turn it on I feel insulted that Alpine does not think I know if I‚Äôm listening to radio, iPod, or USB because there is a HUGE 1‚Äù by 1‚Äù animated radio antenna on the left side of the display when it is on radio or HUGE USB symbol, or HUGE iPod. Or if I have the display set for TIME, they must think that I might be confused as to which planet I‚Äôm on because there is a HUGE 1‚Äù x 1‚Äù spinning globe of the Earth on the left. Did I mention that this is on the DISPLAY? And that it is animated? In a car -- where you should not be watching your radio? That‚Äôs right, you lose the entire left one inch of the display, top to bottom, that could be used to show additional info like the title of the song, or artist, or some type of IMPORTANT info like radio signal strength. At the bottom of the display are three teeny, tiny icons that show if your phone has connected through BlueTooth, its battery level, and how many bars signal strength it has. THAT could be blown up in that one inch space and it would be very important to know -- but no, its so minuscule that you can barely see it.As I said before, the engineers at Alpine truly get it when it comes to sound, but that‚Äôs the beginning and end of their expertise. They have no clue when it comes to the user interface or experience. That‚Äôs why I had to give this a 4 out of 5 rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVNTFKP60IJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKYH9Q2#wasThisHelpful","RMVNTFKP60IJM","A2N6850P9TDYFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6850P9TDYFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review relates to the TV being used as a computer monitor - ONLY.As with everything there is good and bad.The Good:The screen is incredibly bright. So much so that my students don't like looking at it. I know, I know, you can turn the brightness  down but just a heads up. It is also has razor sharp images. Every little detail is immediately apparent. It automatically connects to the computer through the HDMI port -- no problems what-so-ever. The aspect ratio, at least to me, is much more preferable than that of Dell Monitors (I bought this to replace a 21"" Dell). You can  easily see two pages  side-by-side on the screen at 100% size with a little room left  over all the way around. It draws almost no power -- according to the Energy Label, only $5 / YEAR.The Bad:There is on ON button but no OFF button. You have to use the remote to turn it off. There is a sleep mode but if you have it turned on then its a constant hassle while you are using your computer. Eventually you will turn off the sleep mode so you don't go crazy and then you have to turn the TV off with the remote when you are finished for the day. DON'T lose the remote.The screen is HIGHLY glossy. It reflects light from everywhere. This is probably the main difference, and drawback, vs a computer monitor. I would HIGHLY recommend an articulating arm to mount this TV so you can adjust it for minimal glare. Speaking of movement, naturally it does not raise or lower or tilt like my Dell monitor did -- after all, its a TV, right?. I find this quite annoying and will fix it with a VESA articulating arm.Overall, I like this TV as a monitor. However, the glare is a real problem. If Vizio makes a matte screen TV in the future, I will definitely consider that for my next monitor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5BDWL8IJMKGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGSAPV2#wasThisHelpful","R5BDWL8IJMKGY","A2N6850P9TDYFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N6850P9TDYFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love this shampoo. I wasn't thinking that I would be impressed about a shampoo, but this one is so moisturizing and made my hair feel silky smooth. Amazingly you might not even need conditioner, that is how amazing this leaves my hair feeling. This shampoo comes in an extra large bottle with a pump. You only need about 1 pump of product and I have extra long hair down to my lower back. For a shampoo that is sulfate free it suds up nicely and almost immediately you can feel the softness while washing. I would definitely recommend this shampoo if you would love a softening and moisturizing shampoo or if you do not like to use conditioners.

"This HSI Professional Flat iron is great for my hair for straigt or curled styles. It comes in a sturdy box and a silky bag to storage it after use and one glove to protect your hand if you need to use it. It heats up quickly and the heat is adjustable to be as warm 140 degrees or hot up to 410 degrees. I personally use it at a cooler temp than most since I have thin hair that does not require a high temperature. I would like for the temperature gauge to have a few more temperature settings noted on the dial. The paddle glides right over my hair with ease and the additional bonus of the argan oil is great to use in my hair as well. There is a spring in the flat iron that opens the flat iron and you do not have to use much force to close the flat iron and ""squish"" your hair in it. The cord is long with a velcro strap to manage the cord when not in use and has a rotating base to prevent twisting of the cord.

"I really appreciate that this brush set comes in a solid case, that locks in place and will not pop open until you open it. It actually reminds me of another high end set that I own. It is great for travel or if you would like to keep an extra set of brushes either in your boyfriends place or at work. They are all kept nice and neat and you will have your basic brushes that you need to do your makeup look. I would love to have a fuller flat top kabuki brush since that is my preferred brush to apply my foundation. The blush/powder and contour does a great application job.The 3 eye brushes will give you a simple eye look, but there is space to add a couple additional small brushes in this set. All the brushes are soft and easy to use. The quality is very nice and I think this is also a great starter set to gift to someone who is starting out or just needs some extra brushes on hand.

"I have been using us for a few weeks now. I use it daily after my shower as directed. I put the amount in the dropper into the roots of my hair towards the front of my scalp which is where I feel I need it the most. I have a ton of new girls towards the front of my hairline I have noticed when I'm doing my hair I have all these baby ears that stick out. You're definitely not going to know if this is working in just a few days it is going to take a couple of weeks for you to notice any type of hair growth. The solution does not burn nor does it have an odor which is very nice. It does at times leave some areas of my ear a bit crunchy after application, but that is easily fixed by just running your fingers through your hair.

"This Concealer/contour palette has 6 large powder shades going from the brightest white to a medium to dark brown. While this says it is a concealer, contour and foundation palette. I would use this as a foundation since it would give a very light coverage. There is no scent, each powder is a very large circle which is perfect to use a large fluffy brush if you wish to. The palette is a generic black plastic case. I think this powder palette is great for light to medium skin tones. I have been using the second to the lightest shade and skin toned shade under the eyes. The peach shade I have used as a blush and it gave a very nice peachy tone to my cheeks.The two darkest shades I have use as a contour and using a fluffy brush so I won't have it get patchy. I have had no issues with blending this out with a fluffy brush. Each shade can also be used on the eyes as well and they are all matte in my opinions and does not give you a cake face.

This is a great starter set. You can try different designs and sizes so you can see which type of brush or brushes you decide is best for you to work with while applying your makeup. The brushes are dense and very soft. The multiple large brushes are great for uses for foundation, blush, all over face powder or blending out concealer. The brushes are very soft and dense. The brush handles have some weight to them and are attached well to the ferrules. They washed and dried without any issues.

"This has a great warming sensation upon application. It does not feel ""hot"" but you can feel the warmth and you can feel it working. As far as results it appeared as if it was plumping up my skin to smooth out any bumps on my legs, not to mention the golden shimmer that plays with your vision, however there are no immediate results and being consistent with use will hopefully have a great ultimate result. The surprising element about this was the amazing scent which most slimming creams do not have. I love the feminine beachy scent.

There's a light rose scent (reminiscent of Nivea) and no yucky sunscreen feel or smell. It doesn't erase wrinkles, alas, but my face does look brighter and smoother after application. It doesn't take a whole lot of this product in order to cover my whole face, so even though the tube is relatively small, it will last a decent amount of time.

"Ugh, where to start. First off, it does not look like the picture. The background in the photo looks iridescent, with gleaming mother-of-pearl. Mine looks like white plastic. The lines that you can see radiating out of the center are completely invisible in my watch.  It's enormous: far too big for my wrist, and I think it would probably overpower most women's wrists, unless a woman wants to have a clunky and huge watch. It literally spans almost the entire area of the top of my wrist. What's more, it's barely water-resistant. It says that it's resistant to 165 feet, which is about 50m.  Don't think about using this for water sports, in other words.  Worst, it's incredibly hard to get off without help. I have been wearing a watch with a similar clasp for years, so I'm familiar with how they work. It's usually a quick, one-handed operation and boom! the watch slides off. I was literally trapped in this watch until I could get a friend to reach underneath and release me from it. Who needs that?

The pattern seems a little more impressionist and a little less precise than my other Lenox Christmas pattern, but it's still lovely and exudes warmth and cheer and Christmas festivity. It's heavier than expected, much like stoneware, and not light and delicate like porcelain.My disappointment and dinging of one star is that the plate came with no presentation box; it is simply wrapped up in bubble wrap and sent alone. I think an accent piece like this would make a lovely gift for someone, but it needs a box.  My other Lenox Christmas pieces came in beautiful red boxes, so if someone wanted to give them as a present (teacher gift, etc), they are perfectly set up for that. This one, not so much.

"These pants are SO COOL, but run VERY big. My 9.5 year old son was very disappointed that they are too big, because he loved them at first sight. It took a lot of convincing to get him to fold them up and put them away until he grows a little bit.  But the fading and styling is perfect; just like his dad's jeans, and details like the metal hawk on the back pocket really add to the overall look.  I actually bought another pair of these in a size 8 (we started with size 10), and my son is STILL swimming in them.  He's not a huge kid, but he's not tiny, either.

"One of the most important things about hand lotion has to be that it absorb quickly and not make me leave a sticky, yucky residue all over everything I touch until it dries. This hand cream did just that. At first it did feel a little sticky right after I applied it, but within just a few minutes it had absorbed and my hands were dry and normal to the touch. In a way, it worked too well this way, as my hands don't feel particularly moisturized, and I'm feeling now that I need to reapply, even though it's been only a few minutes since I put it on.  But I'm hopeful that the moisturizing effects are more than ""skin deep"" and that my hands will be protected from chapping and other damage from the cold air.  There's no scent to this lotion, so it won't conflict with other scents you might be wearing.

"This is an absorbing game that's perfect for 8+. I often think the suggested age ranges are too conservative, but I think in this one, it's about right. So I won't be playing it with my 6.5 year old for a while, or if I do attempt it with her, I'm going to have to expect a good deal of confusion at first until she gets the hang of the game play.It's been often compared to Ticket to Ride, but I think a comparison to Blokus (with a dash of Carcassonne) is more fair. There's some planning strategy in the manner of Blokus, but there are also little people you put down to claim territories, much like in Carcassonne.  The strategy is built on a lack of resources (needing the correct color tile, not having enough laborers to play, or having buildings in the way of where you'd like to build), and it feels a little like a double-solitaire game than a truly interactive game.  However, you can definitely make decisions specifically designed to mess up your opponent, so it can be more or less interactive depending on how you choose to play.  It's one of those games that builds in intensity as you get closer to the end, and it's a good idea to watch the size of the draw pile (and the player's building pile) so you can plan and not got caught unawares as the end of the game sneaks up on you.  It's a fast-playing game, and I like having a game that's fairly simple to set up and then can be effectively played by 2 players in about 30 minutes (once you know the game rules). There is very little luck involved: although you do depend on having the correct color come up to make specific builds, there are enough possible decisions and build-spots that strategy can overcome nearly the entire element of chance in the game.  I think the game pieces are fine quality. It's true that wooden pieces would have been a bonus, but the plastic ones are okay and the cards used are nice and thick with high-quality printing.So to me, this is a valuable new game to add to my collection for all these reasons. It's a little too simple for me to truly gush about it and it's not going to displace my current favorite games (Agricola & Cosmic Encounters) any time soon, but it's a good choice for a quick strategy game to play with a child.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6YTGPCDTTXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IP3LEW#wasThisHelpful","RY6YTGPCDTTXJ","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful citrus-y, summery scent; very light and youthful. I really love this. It goes on light and bright, and has good staying power. I think as the afternoon wore on it mellowed into a slightly more mature scent, but nothing heavy or overly sexy. It reminds me of the Colors by Benneton scent, but a little brighter.  The bottle is classy and stable, and my one caveat was that it arrived to me from Amazon with a dented box. It was obviously just tossed in a cardboard box where it had room to slide around and get dented. Since perfume is often given as a gift, I thought I would bring that up, since it doesn't look as great for gift-giving as it would if you bought it from a brick-and-mortar store where it would presumably be more carefully handled.

My main concern is just that they are so small and light, they seem exactly like the kind of headphones that get lost or broken around my house. I also suspect that the rubber cover for the charging dock is not long for this world. The carrying case is suitably protective, but not much above what I keep much cheaper headphones in.

"My little princess is not always crazy about new food offerings, but this one she accepted without a problem.  I mostly like the ingredients list, too: most of the ingredients are ones that I would eat myself, or else they are vitamins or probiotics.  There are a few kinds of ""meal"" in the ingredients, which probably indicates low-quality food (meal can include entire carcasses of old animals, but it could also include just the meat portion of the animal). No added corn, wheat, soy, artificial preservatives, artificial flavors, or sugar.  ""Natural flavor"" in the ingredients list probably means MSG, but good luck finding a dog food without that. I've been looking for years and haven't found one.  And since I only have to feed my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel about 3/4 c per day of this food, the bag will last quite a while.

"If I face facts, my older golden lab is not as active as he used to be. It's important to me to keep his weight down. This food is exactly right. It's not one of those which has only like five ingredients, but when I look at it I feel that ingredients in there are mostly foods that I would eat myself, or vitamins. Also for the weight of my dog, this requires a full cup of food less per day than the food I normally use. That is a great sign, because it means that this food has fewer fillers in it. Less fillers, less poop!  Not to mention which it means that this little bag will last longer. In fact, if I had one complaint about this, it would be the price. It is kind of steep if you figure that a 4 pound bag is only enough for a couple of days for my big guy.

"This is ALMOST a five-star product.  I've gotten my son a bunch of Lego products, but we've always been biased against Mega Bloks.  I thought they wouldn't snap together as well, and that there was a fundamental difference in quality between the two.  This project definitely proved me wrong about that. These snap together very securely, and the final product is a very stable truck. Some of the pieces were almost too hard to snap together, when fitting in tight places!  These problems are par for the course in building with little plastic bricks, though, so I'm not going to ding it for that. What I will ding it for is the absolute lack of organization of the pieces in the initial bags.  Other (ahem) companies will put their plastic bricks in meaningful bags. Bag 1 is full of what you need for the first steps, Bag 2 for the next batch of steps, etc. This kit just puts everything in random bags, so you really have to open up all the bags right from the start.  That's both messier and makes it difficult to find the pieces you need. Spending that extra time in the beginning to sort the pieces is key.  Expect there to be a few extra pieces.Another thing to note is that obviously almost all of the pieces are similar colors. I think my son dragged a bit in completing this project because it was not the most exciting to put together (it's not a Death Star or anything), but that's the kind of thing you can predict before buying it.

"I rarely use cookbooks any more. I can make fruit pies from scratch without a recipe (including homemade crust), I bake muffins/sweet breads weekly, and I can make pizza crust and bread in my sleep.  I HATE cookbooks that give too much detail or assume I know nothing about cooking, and the cooking blogs that take a picture of every.single.step.  This book is the kind of book I can actually use; actually, the kind of book I dream of.This book focuses on pastry dough, the next step for someone like me: puff pastries, croissants, pains au chocolat, phyllo dough (!), danishes...I'm so excited.  It doesn't cover pasta dough or bread dough. It breaks down the steps into an appropriate level of detail, explains the keys to success for the type of dough, and gives both a traditional ingredients list and a ratio for more advanced cooks.  I use ratios a lot, so I know how helpful they can be. For example, with muffins, the quantity I can make depends on how many zucchinis I have (or whatever). One thing that jumped out at me is that the ingredients are listed in terms of weight, not volume, which is definitely a departure from the way most recipes are written. A kitchen scale will be vital to use these.So how are the results? I tried an apple-pie recipe, because I know how to make apple pies and I wanted to make sure whatever result I got was not due simply to lack of experience.  I followed the recipe exactly to make sure I was getting as close as possible to the results intended by the author.  So, the pie ended up looking and tasting wonderful; definitely the best apple pie I've ever made. But there were some surprises. First, for some reason I ended up with waaaay too much apple filling, even though I weighed the apples as directed and used a 9"" pie pan as directed.  I also ended up with some extra pie dough (possibly I rolled it too thin?), though, so I just made a second pie with only a top crust in a smaller pan. I'm definitely not complaining, but it was mystifying. I was suspicious when I was peeling the apples: I used about 18 apples to get 6 lb for the filling.  Still, it was cool to learn how to make a neat edge to the pie (never tried that before) and it really was delicious. Oh, and it did not take that long. The pie crust only took me a couple minutes (plus cooling time); max 10 minutes total mixing and rolling time.  The filling took longer, about 30 min because of peeling the apples, but still not too daunting. So not EVERYTHING in here is going to be an all-day project.So the upshot is that this is a serious book. Pretty much everything in here can be bought ready-made, but if you want to learn to make your own, this is what you want. Forget searching the Internet for this stuff; just get this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RY2IDPRVDE79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594748187#wasThisHelpful","R1RY2IDPRVDE79","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've seen other foot lotions (like the Burt's Bees peppermint one) that require you to wash your hands after applying, which to me always feels like a waste. My only complaint about this lotion is that the bottle is small for the price, so it's definitely a budget-buster for most people. But for a ""luxury"" beauty product, it's a nice one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OUK3PZGN00FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUY46E#wasThisHelpful","R1OUK3PZGN00FS","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blech. I really tried to like this, but nope. It doesn't mix well (including when I put it in a shaker bottle) and it has a really unpleasant taste that I can't get over. It has stevia, so that could be some of the artificial taste of it (yes I know stevia is natural, but to me, it tastes strange and artificial), but whatever it is, it's an unpleasant combination of ingredients. I give it 2 stars because I like the theory of this powder, because the ingredients (except stevia) are impressive and just what I want.

"My dog had no digestive problems at all with this food.  No tummy upsets or diarrhea. He also likes the taste (but then, he likes poop, so I'm not sure if he can be trusted).  I am happy with the ingredients list, and I'm pretty picky. It does have MSG (""Natural Flavor"") but in all the dog foods I've reviewed (and there have been many!) every single one of them has that ingredient.  Another reviewer complains about the presence of lamb, and I think there should be some defense of that meat.  First of all, lamb is the name of the meat product that comes from sheep. You will not find ""sheep"" on an ingredients list.  ""Lamb"" on the list is not like ""veal"" and an indication that a baby animal was used in the food.  Also, for people concerned about animal welfare of their meat food, lamb is one of those animals which is less frequently factory-farmed than, say, beef, pork, or chicken.  So I think if you're planning to feed your dog a meat product (which I think you need to for them to be healthy!), lamb is a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TMORAT7XM4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRLH4Q#wasThisHelpful","R12TMORAT7XM4F","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I appreciate the focus on strategy on this game.  Game-play is much like Go or Othello, where regions can swap hands based on strategic destruction and rebuilding of bridges.  Unlike Go, though, there is an element of luck in this game, so you have to wait until you get the card you need.  I'd say it's about 90% strategy, 10% luck.  I disagree that the game is decided by the end of the first round. For example, at the end of the first round, I stomped my opponent with 6 islands in my control, to 3 in his control. By the last round, we were tied in terms of island control.  I still won the game, but I did not feel that my position was secure through all 3 rounds. (I think I just played better that game.)The rules are very easy to learn and assimilate. One quick read-through of the rules was enough for me, and it took me about 3 minutes to explain it to my 9 year old son.  He plays a lot of games, so may not be typical in terms of picking up on it, but any habitual game player will find it easy enough to learn.I don't think it's quite worth 5 stars because I almost feel that if you're going to have a game that is that strategic, why introduce luck at all?  I know I'll play this again with my son, but I sort of would rather play Go and dispense with the luck and stick with the basics.  It's a decent variation, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UB5KTZ8Z7W9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY9GG#wasThisHelpful","R3UB5KTZ8Z7W9","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a cute game that is simple and very easy to learn, but still strategic and at least somewhat skill-based (but luck does play a factor). The instructions are so simple that they take up a single double-sided sheet of paper, and anyone can be taught the rules in under 5 minutes.  My 6 year old was able to grasp game play and join the fun.  We enjoy much more complex games as a family, and this one will NOT be a hit with my teenager (for whom Agricola is too easy), but for the younger set (6-13) it will be popular.  I'm always looking for games I can play with my 6 and 9 yo which will not make me want to claw out my eyes, and this is a good one.  I can't really imagine adults or adults and teens sitting down to play this without the presence of children, but to each his own. In my book, it's a good one to play WITH the kids.One of the things I like about this is that it is not a clone of any other game I know of.  It sort of reminds me of Karma (the card game) or even Solitaire (since cards can only be put on equal or lower cards), and reminded my son a bit of Ticket to Ride (probably because of the color cards and collection factor).  A little hand-management, a little risk-taking, a little strategy--it's a good game that I'm glad to add to our collection.  It's so easy to learn that a visiting friend could easily be brought into the game play, which is not always true for the more complicated games that seem so baffling to non gamers.  Mage Wars, for example, would not be good to play with a non-gamer guest; but this could.By the way, in response to the other reviewer who complained that the rules are unclear about whether other players get the Victory points on the piece left behind...of course they do.  If they didn't, it would make more sense for the ""discoverer"" of the VP token to simply take it until the end of the expedition.  It's true that the rules didn't explicitly say this (and they probably should), but context makes it clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4XIWWZQZJEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0JDVOO#wasThisHelpful","R3V4XIWWZQZJEW","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this style of cat scratcher, and so does my kitty.  My old one was a frayed mess, littering the floor with little bits of rope hair constantly. I'm glad for a new one, but be warned that these do have a lifespan, and they don't look new for very long.  Maybe a few months.  If you put it in a corner, you can rotate it to try to make it last longer, but ultimately your cat will do a number on it, and you'll have to figure out how to get rid of it if your town has pay-per-throw bags or something similar.  My last one lasted a couple years, but only because I've put up with it looking incredibly beat up and was willing to vacuum up all the rope threads regularly.  For my sanity I should have gotten rid of it after a year at most.  Now that you're warned about that, I can tell you that although the scratcher gets beat up, my curtains, walls, and furniture look scratch-free, and my cat's claws are in good shape.  Totally a good trade-off.  Because they call this a ""tall"" post I was expecting something huge, but it's not more than a yard high--which is fine, because only a monster cat would be able to stretch much higher than this to scratch anyway.  As long as you know about the life-span and don't expect this to be the last scratch post you ever buy, you'll be happy with this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YQQ0WSZM0HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO6MEXO#wasThisHelpful","R39YQQ0WSZM0HU","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is perfect! It has everything I could want, and many features it never occurred to me to want. The alarm starts very quietly and then gets louder, so if you wake up quickly you don't have to suffer the onslaught of a loud noise. The display is very easily dimmable, which I so appreciate because I hate bright alarm clocks in the bedroom.  There is a ""nap"" feature, where with the touch of a button you can take a nap of set lengths from just a few minutes to an hour and half.  You can change the length of the snooze alarm.  The charging docks, backup battery, easy-to-operate alarm setting, and manual backup time set (for if/when the auto-set feature fails, like it's failed on my last 6 auto-set clocks).  If only the auto-set feature lasts as long as the rest of the clock, it will be truly the most wonderful clock ever.  Time will tell. (Get it?)The one thing I can point to as a possible problem has to do with the charging cord. I've never seen an alarm clock that doesn't have the power cord permanently attached to the clock, so there is a possibility that an over-zealous snoozer could yank the clock out of its power charge cable.  Also, the end of the cord is not an ordinary 2 or 3 prong plug, but has a large transformer attached, that would need to be plugged into the bottom of the 2 outlets or you'd lose the outlet underneath the transformer. In my bedroom, the outlets next to the bed (where I would plug in an alarm clock) are half wired to the wall switch, (so you could turn out a bedside light at the wall), and it's no good to plug an alarm clock into the wall-switch outlet.  Luckily, in my case the wall-switch outlets are the top outlet of the 2, but if they were on the bottom, I'd lose that plug since I'd be forced to plug the alarm in the top outlet and it extends down far enough to cover the other plug.  So if that might apply to your situation, caveat emptor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30IJ2BT9AGT7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VY936OS#wasThisHelpful","R30IJ2BT9AGT7T","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, this book is a treat. It dwells quite a bit more in the ""real world"" than I was expecting, but those scenes were part of what gives the book its depth.  Maguire has quite a bit to say about the Victorian world, adolescence, class structure, etc, and he communicates this through the third-person omniscient structure of the narrative and the scenes involving the Real World folk.  I actually found myself wanting a pencil while reading this, so that I could underline or star various passages for further musing. Lewis Carroll had much to say, as well, but without the historical perspective that a modern author can overlay.  Maguire writes in the tradition of Carroll, with depth, humor, and imagination: I loved it.This is by no means a copycat book, but Maguire certainly does know his Alice. The scenes in Wonderland, especially, are often laugh-out-loud funny; far funnier, to me, than the original scenes, but perhaps that's because the original jokes are stale since I've heard them a million times.  These scenes take us back to Wonderland with a very different girl, a clever and prosaic one, who is much less apt to be befuddled by the Wonderland characters than to outsmart them.A caveat, though: this book is written at a very high level. It is not for children, but it is less the subject matter (although the philosophical musings would bore them silly) than the language.  Children are frequently taught to assess the reading level of a book using the ""five finger"" test:  read a random page of a book, and if you find five words you don't know on that page, the book is too hard for you.  I suspect that many adults would fail the ""five finger"" test for this book.  For example, page 7 includes the words distempered, ellipsis, vatic, apidistra, benighted, and kitted out, as well as slightly easier words epiphany, marmalade, and fray (commotion).  I literally just randomly picked a page toward the beginning of the book. The whole thing is written with an SAT vocabulary.  If you are not accustomed to reading ""high"" language, you might just find this book boring.I think it would be a failure as a read-aloud for younger children because you'd have to stop over and over to explain vocabulary (and concepts, on many of the more philosophical chapters that detail a character's thoughts and dreams), and I know a lot of parents would be taken aback to find the word ""rape"" used (hyperbolically) by one of the roses or the F-word slipped in with minimal disguise in another character's thoughts.So, it's not for children.  But for educated adults who will always have a soft spot for Alice, this book is a rare find: funny, thoughtful, and utterly respectful of its predecessor. I can't recommend it highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UP499JFRWE1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060548959#wasThisHelpful","R1UP499JFRWE1C","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My biggest complaint is that it's hard to get out of the can. I had envisioned that it would be so easy: pop of the top, dump out the food, repeat. But instead, it's a production that includes multiple kitchen tools (knife, spoon, scraper) and a minute per can. The food is sticky! Imagine emptying a jar of peanut butter, quickly.  OK, maybe it's not that bad, but anything that turns feeding the dog into a bigger chore is not a good thing in my book. If only they had made the can a little bigger and added just a little more broth (or water). It seems that it would have simplified feeding.Beyond that, I do wonder about the importance of a ""diet"" dog food.  If I control how much he eats, why can't I feed him a little less of whatever other food I choose?  Is this more for the owners, who can't bear to feed their pet so little? Calories in, calories out = weight control.  But whatever.Also, be sure you do the math to calculate how much per day it will cost you to feed your dog with this food, if money is an issue for you.  A 100-lb dog needs 6 cans of this a day for weight maintenance (4 for weight loss), so that cost adds up really fast.My dogs both approve heartily of this food and are going to be disappointed when it runs out.

"I'm not sure how you could improve on these binder tabs. They are the strongest dividers I've ever seen,and it's obvious that they will last through a lot of hard wear without falling out.  Yet they remain perfectly flexible, so there usefulness is not compromised. The window is not crystal clear, but translucent enough that you can really have a preview of whatever the first page is under the divider. To combine the translucency with the colored border is genius, because you get the best of both worlds.  The extra-large tabs at the sides allow for extra-long names if necessary, and the sheet of stickers for labeling contains enough for labeling both sides of the tabs once.  If you want to reuse the dividers for another project, you'll either have to cut your own labels from unshaped sticky paper or use Sharpie directly on the tabs.  Maybe this is a potential negative, but on the other hand you could just plan to use these for a project or filing system you plan to keep around for a while.

"Some water toys can keep a group of children entertained for hours on a summer day...but this is not one of them. It's a cute gimmick, but not much more.

"There's a reason there's a picture of a small dog on the can. I was shocked when I saw the feeding guide for my lab would require me to feed about 6 cans (but up to 7) every day. 3 cans in the morning, 3-4 in the evening. If I do the math, that's about $10-$12 per day to feed my dog. Yikes!  Over $4300 per year?  Maybe not.  Even a dog with no teeth could eat dry food that's been soaked in water, which I think I would do before shelling out this kind of money.But for a smaller dog, I can see using this product. The ingredients list is very high quality and almost perfect. ""Chicken Liver Flavor"" is the only dubious ingredient I can identify, and I don't see any other red flags like those identified by the people at the Dog Food Project. This food is basically just real foods fortified with vitamins and minerals (plus the flavoring, which undoubtedly has MSG).Oh, I should mention that both of my dogs were thrilled with this product. Even the cat tried to get in on the fun.  So I guess it tastes good.  However, full disclosure: my dogs eat poop, so I'm not sure they can be trusted on what tastes good.I know some people make food for their dog, and I'm sure that's an even healthier option (if done with care). But short of that, this seems like a great option...just very pricey if you have a big dog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VRXI6QAHATL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPZELHQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VRXI6QAHATL9","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author/illustrator is so talented, and it's really fun to see him apply his talents to a purely whimsical topic. The same kind of elaborate illustrations that are found in his other books are here, and it's all about ice cream. My 6 year old daughter loved finding the hidden ice-cream cones in the pictures and my nine year old son was fascinated with some of the ice-cream lore and history presented through the illustrations.  Even the page with the ice-cream math was a big hit, and my kids wouldn't let me continue the story until they had solved all 4 of the problems. (3 of them were solvable by my rising first-grader, but she needed help on the last one, which involved multiplying 6x2.)  The book reminds me of Tomie da Paola's Popcorn Book, which I read over and over as a child, and taught all kinds of tidbits and factoids about popcorn.  This does for ice cream what that did for popcorn, but with better illustrations. (with apologies to Mr da Paola.)

"This is just right for a night cream. The scent is lovely but not overpowering, and the cream is thick and substantial without feeling waxy or oily. It is definitely too much for a day cream, as my face feels heavy when I use it. But for a serious shot of moisturizing, this is a great product. This is best for dry to normal skin; oily skin would probably be overwhelmed with this product.  I'm not going to try to claim that it's going to stop my face from aging, but I do know that it is keeping my skin from looking dry and taut, and I do think that keeping one's face properly moisturized helps reduce wrinkles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M8UUWP362Q1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSHEN0M#wasThisHelpful","R1M8UUWP362Q1G","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The biggest problem for me is that it wears off very fast. It's horrible right at first, but after a few hours it's barely noticeable. For best results you would need to apply maybe twice a day. But, because it's actually a nail polish, you have all the hassle of applying new polish over old polish, with result that my nails actually look worse than ever. (No mean feat: as a lifelong biter my nails are not my best feature.)  Also it stings a lot on hangnails, one of my problem areas.Also, I do not think it is a matte finish. Maybe it's not as shiny as other polishes, but it definitely shines. I was hoping my teenaged son could use this product to help with his habit, but I think he would feel stupid with shiny nails. Plus, if your nails look crappy because of being gnawed on, the last thing you want to do is make them shiny and eye-catching. I can't imagine using this on an entire thumb for thumb-suckers.But all that said, it's not a terrible product. I think it can help, if applied religiously daily or twice a day. It's more of a reminder not to bite than an actual deterrent, once the initial bitterness has faded.  I will often bite without realizing it, so this helps with that. But if I'm determined to do so, once the initial moment is past, this is not going to stop me.  It's just not strong enough.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDP4GAOVKUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N14I4Y6#wasThisHelpful","R3CDP4GAOVKUR","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is why Provence, France, is famous for their soaps. What a lovely soap! It is perfect and hits all the right notes.The presentation is elegant, with a lovely wrapping and embossing on the soap itself.The color and striations on the soap are attractive. I think the light texture and visual interest are caused by shredded rose petals (although I can't be sure). They are not uniformly sized, which adds to the attractiveness of the bar.  There were faint knife scrape marks on one side of the bar, confirming its origin as touched by human hands, and not just cranked out in some factory.The feel of the soap is lush and smooth, not gritty. With use, the soap gently wears away to a slightly bumpy feel, and is not grainy or scratchy in any way.  The lather is substantial.The smell--ahh.  Just roses.  A strong, pure rose scent, unadulterated by notes of jasmine or other flowers. I love it.The bar is cured to a hard, silky touch, but not too soft: it holds its own with use and doesn't just melt away too quickly like I've seen some other premium soaps do.And, it's a purely vegetarian soap. No worries about how the animals were treated in making it.If I were to name any problems, I would point to the scary ingredient list, which has big, chemical-y sounding names.  I am not a chemist, so I don't know if those are just the official names for, I dunno, rose extract and lye (needed for soapmaking), but my guess is that if you want a purely natural soap, this one isn't going to fit the bill for you. There are a lot of ingredients, most of them unrecognizable to a layperson.But if you just love the experience of a beautiful soap and are not overly sensitive about what's in it, you will not be disappointed with this quality bar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16H9GZPVKCHZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVNYIFW#wasThisHelpful","R16H9GZPVKCHZI","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where to start?  First of all, the whole thing looks cheap. The bows are tiny, and everything just looks cheap too.  Mine came with no retail box or instructions, but if you hold the bow vertically, more often than not the darts clip the heel of your thumb as they whiz by.  Ouch! Not only does that mess up their aim, it really hurts. My son figured out way to hold the bow horizontally so it doesn't hurt, but it no longer has the ""archery"" look and feels unnatural.  The darts fall off the board after a few seconds, so you can't shoot all your arrows and then add up your points. Somehow I thought the dartboard itself would light up or something fancy, but no, it's just a little light you can turn on or off in the arrows.  It's not like the motion of being shot or landing activates the light (which would be cool).  You just flip the switch on each dart to make it glow or not. Big deal.Basically, this toy is not awful, but it would need to be in the range of $15-20 to accurately reflect its coolness.  We have a Zing Curve Bow and it is a much better product with a more appropriate price.  The Zing Curve Bow is maybe twice the size of the Zeon bows included in this set and shoots the arrows about 3x as far.  I realize they are different products, but this one is a disappointment, whereas the other is a huge hit in this house.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GFL1IUAU105C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T66JQH2#wasThisHelpful","R2GFL1IUAU105C","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I mean, this is a nice product, but it is so overpriced as to be laughable. With the same active ingredient as Clearasil, you're not going to do much better with this product at clearing your acne. I read once that doctors are more likely than other consumers to buy generic medicines, because they realize it's the drug, not the brand name and marketing costs, that does the job. If you buy this, you are not buying a more effective ingredient, you are buying expensive ads in fashion magazines, etc.  But maybe you don't care, and you don't want to have an embarrassing tube of Clearasil on your counter.  So, fine. This product smells nice, goes on smoothly, and works as well as expected.  It won't do miracles (for that you need to see a dermatologist), but I like it.  It comes out just a little at a time and feels more like a lotion than a medicinal cream. It is drying, so be careful where you use it.Bottom line:  If you don't need your money for other things and like the look of the bottle and the cachet of the brand name, then it will be a good purchase for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3995M9NFTLU3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7P7FO2#wasThisHelpful","R3995M9NFTLU3Q","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Only get this mattress if you truly like a firm sleeping surface. It is not for the faint of heart. My teenager joked that if I would like, he could get me a wood plank or stone slab to sleep on, since I liked this mattress so much.  All 5 of my children hate it (I asked them to try it so I could get a variety of opinions on it), and I suspect that most kids wouldn't like it. It's not bouncy or soft.  Each of them (and they range in age from 6 to 16) would give it one star.BUT. It allows just enough sinking in for the heavier parts of my (40-something, average-weight) body, and my legs and arms feel like they are floating. I feel that it allows my spine to stay essentially straight while I sleep on my side, since my hips sink in just a little bit more. I think I had overly high expectations for this mattress, because I still wake up with some discomfort in my back and need to stretch and loosen things up when I get up, but I do think it's better than it was on my old, softer mattress.I don't particularly love memory foam, but in this mattress, there's just a layer of memory foam on top of the springs, so I feel that it's not overkill.  I despise a full memory-foam mattress, but here it's ok.A great feature is that it reduces or eliminates the bounciness of having your partner shift position next to you, which is a big deal to me. I hate feeling bounced when someone turns over, and with this mattress, I can't feel it.One issue is that it is definitely thicker than other mattresses I've had, so I've been having some trouble keeping the sheet on. I did not use a mattress pad, but I imagine with a mattress pad, this would need some seriously specialized sheets with huge side pockets.  This is an issue I am working on.  If you have a very tall base for your mattress, you may find that your bed is higher than you are accustomed to.

"I've had 5 babies, and I've never tried Dreft until now. Frankly, I'm not that impressed. As far as I can tell, the only thing distinguishing it from any other mainstream laundry detergent is the fragrance---which is very powerful.  The bottle seems to claim that this detergent will help your baby smell like a baby, but trust me, your baby will smell like a baby regardless.  You also have to use a ton of this detergent for a full load of laundry. Perhaps this is a good thing if you're doing teeny tiny loads of just a few baby clothes, but if you're saving your sanity and washing the baby clothes with the rest of the laundry, you need to use a huge capful even for an HE load. It's like 3 times the amount of detergent I've been using recently in other brands. There's nothing alternative, natural, or gentle about this detergent; for that you'll need to look to a more expensive brand like Seventh Generation.  The ingredients are not listed on the bottle like they are for natural detergents, so I can't comment on that.  As far as stain removal, yes, it seems to do about as well as any other detergent, and clothes come out smelling very strong in the baby scent.  (Which is another negative to the detergent, because it almost forces you to wash baby clothes separately.  I didn't, though, and we all just wore baby scented clothes!)TL; DR:  meh.

"This is a beautiful, perfectly laid out calendar. I absolutely love the balance between the monthly calendar and the daily assignment calendar part. It will work perfectly as a planner for my homeschooling needs.  I can either see the entire month's activities at a glance or see a more detailed section of assignments by the day or week.  The simple but pretty motif of the birds and the tree is feminine and somehow makes it seem less dull. This is definitely a great planner.That said, is this really a Julian calendar?  Great Britain stopped using the Julian calendar in 1752, so presumably our country has not used it since it was founded. One of the last holdouts to the Julian Calendar was Greece, which used the Julian up to 1922. So are the writers of the ad copy just uninformed?  Because this looks like a regular calendar, not some strange thing.  If you're a geek like me and  worried about not buying this because it is Julian, rest assured that it looks plenty Gregorian (the usual calendar) to me.Ahh, further research has informed me that today, the phrase ""Julian dates"" means that they are numbered sequentially.  So today's date, May 31, is actually day 151 in Julian terms.  I have never heard of anyone using this, but if you do, this is the calendar for you.

"The one thing I wasn't expecting was how shimmery most of these colors are. That's not a bad thing, but it is different.  It makes them look less natural than matte colors. They're not kidding about the nudes being blushed: most of the colors, even the brownish ones, have a pink or reddish tint.  But it's a nice effect, and the colors blend well together.  The coloring goes well with my ""spring"" coloring (dark blond hair, blue eyes, fair skin with pink/blue undertones). They flow on smoothly, and stay on for hours; I would reapply every 8 hours or so. I would classify this as a younger palette, and I know my teen would be very happy with these colors.

"My son adores animals, watches documentaries about them all the time, and LOVES games. We have dozens of games, mostly Eurogames (like this one pretends to be). He (and I) hated this game.  It really couldn't be stupider. All the cards are simply fact sheets about tons of obscure animals, and each turn involves guessing the location found, tail length, weight, and/or length/height. You get points based on how close you were. There are limited guesses, and you lose guessing tokens if you get things wrong. Only one person can guess one area/weight/etc. at a time.  So if you KNOW where an animal lives, but the other player ""guessed"" there first, you have to settle with putting your token in a nearby zone to get half points. It's so, so boring.  We played two turns before he begged to stop playing.There is no strategy, no suspense, no real game play, just a sorry excuse for a game that tries to be educational.  But really, the knowledge it's trying to impart is so trivial that who cares, really?  If an eight-year-old child knows the range and other statistics for a Nyala are they more likely to get into Harvard?

The first one was exciting and intriguing, and it had such an exotic setting that it was extra interesting.  This one misses the mark. After 60 pages in I realized I couldn't care less about the characters and didn't really see where it was going. After 100 pages in, I realized I was approaching reading this book like a job instead of for pleasure.  Yulia seems weak and whiny in this one, the excitement of hidden KGB headquarters locations is replaced with boardrooms in Washington, D.C., and the descriptions of Yulia's mental pain from the scrubbers seems unending.Now, 100 pages in, a spy is on the loose (finally), there might be a mole in Yulia's unit, and guess what? I don't care.  The latest development is that Yulia might get to go to college!  Yippee! Maybe we'll get to listen in on her professors' lectures in the last 2/3 of the book.  I'm not going to force myself to finish this book. If a book can't grab me within 100 pages, something is wrong with the pacing.  This is not an English assignment, so I'm outta here.Not recommended. Read Sekret, then let your imagination fill in the rest of the story. It will probably be more exciting, and most certainly will move faster, than Skandal.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LOTKGSVIDR6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626720053#wasThisHelpful","R3LOTKGSVIDR6I","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is great, but I was surprised to see that the largest spatula is actually a stiff flipping kind of spatula, not a soft kind for scraping jars. You can't tell from the picture, but there's an angle from the flat part to the handle, like any other flipper.  Still, these are very nice. I like that they are one-piece, since my other spatulas are starting to get yucky from the place where the end slips onto the wooden handle. They have the right amount of ""give"" to effectively scrape jars, pans, etc, and they are heat-resistant so they can be used for cooking.  The color is strange and may not blend with many decors, but on the other hand, it does make them stand out in the drawer. A great tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PU5UV3HTEC5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7SDSGW#wasThisHelpful","R1PU5UV3HTEC5G","A1IA0O3OYQO9LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IA0O3OYQO9LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sharp knives are a joy to use and a must for slicing onions, carrots and other tricky/difficult vegetables with ease. They're also essential if we want to avoid bruising items like tomatoes and delicate herbs. Yet we've all known the frustration of reaching for our favorite knife, only to find it isn't up to the task at hand. This new 3-Stage knife sharpener can help with that, within limits.It includes coarse and medium sharpening stones and a ceramic wheel for final honing. It's also small enough to remain unobtrusively on the counter next to a knife block. There are no markings to indicate which stage is which, although that is easily discerned by passing a dull knife through each slot. The innermost slot (near the center of the device) is the first or coarse grinding wheel. the center slot is the medium wheel and the outer slot contains the ceramic honing wheel. Quick tip - once your knife is sharp, if you draw it 2-3 times through this slot before each it will keep your knives ready to go.It is also lightweight and easy to use. Hold it in your hand by the side without the slots, behind the black divider and using your free hand, set your knife in a slot and draw it through. I suggest angling your knife in the slot (letting it rest against the side of the slot) and alternating sides each time you pull the knife through. This will give you the best chance of matching the angles on each side.There are 2 major drawbacks to this particular sharpener and the reason I can only give it 3 stars. Nowhere does the maker tell us to what angle the sharpening discs are set. This is crucial for cooks who own both Japanese and European style blades, because the angles for those knives are quite different. Further, the slots do nothing to control or even suggest the angle at which the blade is inserted into the slot. Given these 2 limitations, it would be all too easy to create an unintended angle on a knife. For these reasons, I cannot recommend it to anyone but the most casual cooks. If you regularly straighten your blade edges know the angle to which they're ground, look elsewhere.However, if you are, like a great many cooks, one who buys inexpensive knives and never sharpens or properly steels them, this will be a nice step up, giving your knives a much longer useful life and can go a long way to saving you money over the long term. Having it next to your knife block will encourage you to use it to keep your edges straight and sharp.**The seller provided this item in exchange for my honest review.**","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZ642P1DSCMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAKPZQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1CZ642P1DSCMF","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice little cake decorating tool for the occasional baker, like me. It is easy to fill, easy to use, and works as advertised. It has 7 of the most commonly used decorating tips that will store right inside the unit, ensuring they don't get lost. Tips screw easily and securely onto the nozzle of the chamber, the cap clicks in place easily, too. My deviled egg filling flowed smoothly without applying undue pressure. The whole thing is easy to clean.That said, it has limitations. It holds only a small amount of icing. I used it to fill 6 deviled egg halves (3 eggs total). The filling filled it about æ full. This is not going to frost a dozen cupcakes without refilling. Still, it's easy enough to fill that this isn't a major problem, but is worth noting. Given it's small chamber size, I would have liked to see a narrow writing tip, which seems like a no-brainer in a set like this. That would increase it's usefulness to this casual, once in a while baker. It's other design flaw is at the business end, where the chamber narrows to a cone shape. The plunger cannot push all of the icing/filling out of the chamber, leaving a couple of teaspoons behind. Other models only leave frosting in the tip, this leaves some in the chamber itself.Again, these are minor irritations, but given the price of the set, I can't give it 5 stars. For occasional bakers, who don't always like to decorate their baked goods, this is a nice, space-saving, easy-to-use decorating set. Serious bakers will be frustrated by it.The seller provided a sample for me to test and review.

"The problem with hard plastic fashion cases is that they're often difficult to change out. Eventually, from repeated stress, the plastic weakens to such an extent that something breaks. But it's a fashion case, so changing it goes with the territory, right?GMYLE has taken another approach, adding a hinge with a buckle at the lower left corner of the case. This allows the case to be opened for easy removal or application. It's a bit tricky to get everything lined up if you're using the backing plate, but once you do, it all just snaps into place and the buckle holds securely. The decorative backing plate can be left off if you prefer a straight bumper case. This will also make it easier to attach and remove the case.I ordered the case in Metallic Champagne Gold and Dark grey and find the gold bumper a nice match to my gold iPhone 6. The backing plate in a dark grey scroll design offers some extra silicone-type grippiness in addition to being just plain elegant, a nice touch for any hard case.The seller provided a sample for review.

"This is the long-awaited companion to The Food Lab series of articles on Serious Eats. It is about 900 pages and contains 300 recipes. There are something like 1000 color photos. Much of the content is recycled from The Food Lab column, but it's organized in such a clear, common-sense fashion that I think it's worth your money and shelf space. Fans of the science presented by everyone from America's Test Kitchen to Harold McGee will enjoy it immensely.Pages are glossy white with clear, well-spaced type in a readable font, making it easy to use in the kitchen. it's bound in such a way that pages will lay flat when the book is opened. This is the way cookbooks should be presented, in my opinion.Part science tome, part cooking course and part recipe book, I think it's an excellent resource cookbook, the kind that builds confidence in new cooks, and perhaps teaches more experienced cooks a few new tricks. One place it especially shines is in the charts and technique discussions that are included within the relevant chapter, presented before the recipes. For example, in the discussion of eggs and omelets, we find advice on the best way to cut a bell pepper, a common add-in and the reason it's best to add salt before cooking eggs (and let them sit for 15 minutes!). Additionally, there's an entire series of photos showing the step-by-step of both American and French omelets along with charts of common omelet add-ins. Often, some of this information would either be missing entirely from the column, or we'd have to follow a link, taking us away from the main discussion. Some people will say ""C'mon, everybody knows how to slice a pepper!"" I presume that these cooks were born with the knowledge, and were slicing and dicing peppers before they could walk. For new cooks who aren't so genetically blessed and for those with less-than-stellar knife skills, it's a useful, practical demonstration. After watching Pepin and Child cook French omelets (high heat, 15 seconds), I've been struggling with them for some time, and look forward to giving Kenji's technique (low heat, then covered off the heat) a try.For pasta lovers (guilty!) Kenji gives us what he's calling the ""Five Italian Mother Sauces"" along with several variations on each. This section is reminiscent of Mark Bittman's How To Cook Everything. I'd compare The Food Lab to that epic volume as well as to Joy of Cooking. Although the latter books include thousands of recipes, they lack the technique illustrations Kenji offers and give us zero science. They're a set of instructions (recipes), while The Food Lab is a cooking course. They're also much harder to cook from, with ivory paper and small type that can be quite frustrating at times. I've often found myself squinting to read a recipe.For new cooks who want clear and concise instruction and for more experienced cooks who want to learn to get the same result, time after time, this is a great resource. It's also a must for anyone who wants to know WHY things should be done the way they are, complete with photos showing the differences in various amounts of an ingredient. For this science geek, I've been enjoying his column for several years and became seriously hooked when I read his column on the best way to boil eggs (steam them). My eggs have been consistently better and easier to peel ever since.As I mentioned above, some of the content is already available at Serious Eats, but much of it is new. And it's organization makes it, in my opinion, a terrific companion to or replacement for the Food Lab column.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192HAGQO97ZC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393081087#wasThisHelpful","R192HAGQO97ZC2","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the One Ring of hose nozzles. Legolas could have used the jet to blast Ringwraiths from the sky (no need to reload), Gandalf could have used it to knock the Balrog off the stone bridge in the Mines of Moria without needing to get near the beast, Frodo would have liked the mister to cool off on his sweaty climb up the slopes of Mt. Doom and best of all, it doesn't taste like fish (trust me), so Gollum wouldn't have been hanging around being such a general nuisance. Back in the Shire, Samwise might like the mister and soaker to keep the gardens at Bag End looking their best. Too bad Tolkien didn't know about it, it might not have taken him 4 books to tell his tale.The details:It's made of high quality materials with a soft molded ergonomic handle that fits well in the hand. It screws onto a hose easily and tightly, with not a single leak. The spray pattern dial is easy to move yet clicks into place. The handle also locks into place, greatly reducing hand stress while operating it.Here's how we've used it in some of the positions:Jet - cleaning cracks and seams in our concrete driveway and for cleaning our curbside trash bin. It has really high pressure to blast away dirt.Flat - to clean the stucco on the exterior walls of our house, to clean the driveway and for washing the car. Instead of just moving soap or dirt around as a jet-like directed spray does, it washes it off in sheets.Soaker - for getting water to the roots of plants. There's no more need to remove the nozzle, just select the soaker pattern, lock the handle into the open position and lay the nozzle in the bed. Try to remember to turn it off later. Setting a timer on your cell phone or in your kitchen will help with this. Not that I'd ever forget to turn the water off, but *he* might. Just saying, a timer is a good idea.Mister - for rinsing dirt off foliage. Turn the pressure at the hose bib to low and you'll be able to rinse even delicate leaves. Rinsing foliage allows more sunlight to penetrate to the leaf's photosynthetic factories (chloroplasts), increasing the plant's ability to turn sunlight into fuel for growth. It has the added benefit of making plants look better without a layer of dust muting the beauty of the leaves. Good for us, good for them.Shower - This one is good for general watering of plants and lawns, not too high pressure even with the hose bib faucet wide open.We haven't tried all of the spray patterns, but you're getting the idea. This a very versatile hose nozzle, performing more functions and performing them better than any other nozzle we've owned. And in some 35 years of home ownership in 8 homes across 4 states, we've purchased our share of hose nozzles. The Amzdeal is the best. That's just the plain truth. If only they'd introduced it in Tolkien's lifetime.The seller provided a sample for us to test and review.

"This is really nice spice grinder for herbs like thyme, oregano and rosemary, anything woody and dry. Made of excellent tough aircraft grade aluminum, it's teeth align perfectly and are plenty sharp enough to do the job but won't cut your fingers. Nice trick, that. It made quick work of thyme and oregano, although some of the rosemary leaves were left whole. It captures dust in a lower screen. All the parts are very easy to clean, and the grinder itself is simplicity to use with a few twists of the lid.It is somewhat limited, not suited to fragile herbs like parsley, cilantro and basil. It bruised the leaves and left me with some pretty ragged pieces. The holes could be just a little smaller for my taste, but overall, it does a good job on woody herbs.The seller provided a sample for test and review.

"If Wishes Were Husbands is a little bit modern-day fairy tale, a little bit comedy, and a little bit cautionary tale about single girls and tangled webs. Mostly though, it's a fun read with characters I'd like to share a drink with. I raced through it in a weekend, chuckling often, and just flat out enjoying the yarn. It's light, breezy and thoroughly enjoyable.Like all good fairy tales, it's got a damsel in distress, although her distress stems from being asked again and again (ad nauseum) when she's getting married. Her handsome prince shows up to rescue her (of course) and almost gets arrested for the effort. I know that's not how fairy tales are supposed to go, but this is a thoroughly modern fairy tale, deal with it. To say more would be to reveal too much, so I'll just recommend that if you enjoy modern romantic comedy and wish there were more magic in the world, If Wishes Were Husbands is right up your alley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MNLO83JH8DMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01491ZAGY#wasThisHelpful","R2MNLO83JH8DMT","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These molds work very well, turning out small tortilla bowls from 6-10 inch tortillas with ease and consistency. Within about 15 minutes at 375 degrees, I'm able to produce very good, crispy bowls from flour tortillas. Let them cool about 5 minutes. These molds produce better bowls than any of the kitchen hacks I've used in the past, like an inverted cupcake pan, or draping the tortillas over jars or bowls. They're also much easier to use. I get the best results when I preheat a baking sheet/baking stone as a base for the filled molds. This gives a crispier base.Using room temperature tortillas, the tortillas slip right into the molds perfectly. From the fridge, the tortillas should be warmed first. I use this fabulous tortilla warmer, which is superior to any other method I've used, by a wide margin. http://smile.amazon.com/MEXI-10004-Pepper-Tortilla-Warmer-12-Inch/dp/B00HWER1NG/ref=sr_1_3?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1442509307&sr=1-3&keywords=tortilla+warmerI think for parties or lunches or for child-size portions, these are great.

"I've long used a knife or a mini food processor to mince herbs. I was a little surprised to find that these scissor do an excellent job at some herb cutting tasks. Although they won't cut herbs like parsley, cilantro or basil into a fine mince, they do an excellent job at turning small amounts into usable size (chopped) for many recipes, like tomato-basil bruschetta topping. Although I'll continue to use a knife to scrape and mince large amounts of parsley or cilantro, when I want to chop a little cilantro to add to our tacos (for 2 people) these will be the quickest, easiest way to get it.So they're not perfect for every herb-cutting task, but they do very well for some, like prepping small amounts of chopped herbs or slicing basil into a chiffonade. Do I need them? No, I've got some sharp knives that will do the job. But are they an easy-to-use, handy addition to my cutlery? You bet.

"I'm a big fan of extra screen protection, because let's face it, the glass is usually what breaks in a bad fall. I used to suck so badly at applying the old 1st generation plastic sheets that I'd have to ask my guy at the AT&T store to do it for me. Well, this glass from LaoHe is so easy to apply that I was able to pop it right on.The full kit comes with the glass and two cleaning cloths, one wet and one dry. The glass is encased in a padded foam envelope. The written instructions on the back of the box are clear and easy to follow. Clean your phone then position the glass over speaker. Carefully lower the top of the glass, then align the bottom circular cutout with the Home button. Drop it into place and watch as all the air is magically sucked out from between your phone and the LaoHe protector.The best thing about this glass, aside from it's ease of installation, is how it looks and feels. Touch capacitance is not affected at all, nor is your phone's appearance. All edges are smooth, not at all sharp or dangerous. At the current price of $7.99, that's a whole lot of bang for very little buck. If you have horrible memories of the way screen protectors used to be, impossible to apply cleanly, always with bubbles and easily scratched, you owe it to yourself to try this one.

We paid about $79 for it.In summer, we steam corn in the husk for 3 minutes per ear and it's perfectly cooked.

"We drink a lot of wine in my home, and at one time had over 1000 bottles in our cellar. As you can imagine, we've used almost every variety of bottle opener there is, from a simple corkscrew to the most innovative CO2 pressure models. Now I readily admit that I have almost zero skills with a classic waiter's corkscrew. My favorite opener for years was the 2-prong Butler's Friend. It was almost foolproof, but it took some strength and skill to use well. Since the introduction of the first ""rabbit"" style openers, I've never gone back to the Butler's Friend. A few years ago we bought our first lever-pull opener, very similar to the Peak Reserve. I loved it and haven't used anything else since. It's simply the easiest style of opener to use, bar none.Loving my all-stainless lever-pull as I do, I was a little uncertain that I'd like the Peak Reserve opener more. After all, my original is all stainless and bullet-proof. After quickly and easily opening a bottle last night, I fell hard for the Peak Reserve and banished my old stainless love to the back of the drawer. This opener has an easy-to-hold sueded grip. In addition, both the squeeze lever and the pull lever are beautiful brushed stainless, giving a softer, more elegant look and better grip than my bright stainless opener. The squeeze lever is substantial and wider than my old model, with a flare that provides a nice surface for squeezing the lever. The pull lever, used to lift the cork cleanly from the bottle, is also wider and flatter than on my old model. The cork on last night's bottle came out quickly and cleanly, as expected with a good quality lever-pull opener.To complete the picture of a quality item, the Peak Reserve opener comes in a very handsome black case, nestled deep in black felted foam shaped to fit the opener and the included 4-wheel foil cutter. This is tailor-made for elegant gifting to your wine-loving friends and family. Note to Peak Reserve - please consider softer foam, the opener is held so tightly it's almost too hard to remove it from it's case.If you're one of those fortunate folks who can open a bottle with a waiter's corkscrew in 5 seconds flat, good for you, but you should still consider the Peak Reserve because it's easier to use and faster, too. For the other 90% of wine lovers, this was made with you in mind. It's faster and easier than any butterfly or rabbit opener you've ever used and it's more comfortable to hold than the extra-heavy all-stainless lever pulls. I highly recommend it.**Peak Reserve provided a sample opener to me with no obligation.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37K0M8TLC56YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z4D1P3Y#wasThisHelpful","R37K0M8TLC56YE","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was somewhat skeptical that this small battery pack would perform as well as the larger units I've tested before, but I needn't have worried, it performs every bit as well as it's much larger cousins. It charged in just a few hours, and then took my iPhone 6 from 6% power to full charge in less than 3 hours, using only about half it's charge, leaving enough power to do it all again before recharging the SuperPak.

At only about 1.5 inches wide by 3.5 inches long and .5 inches thick, it will fit into any pocket and will take up very minimal space in my luggage.

My white SuperPak is a dead match for my white iPhone and has a sueded finish that makes it easy on the eyes and easy to hang on to. One end has all the important bits, USB and mini-USB ports, along with the power button.To charge the battery, plug the USB connector into any charging device (I used a USB port on my MacBook Air) and plug the mini-USB connector into the battery. A series of 4 small lights will begin blinking to tell you it's charging and to monitor progress. When all 4 lights are solid, it's charged. To then charge your device, switch the USB connector to the battery pack and plug the mini-USB or Lightning tip into your device, push the round power button and watch the lights glow. That's it.

"I've been a loyal Wine Away customer for almost 15 years. We lived near one or the other of the California and Washington wine regions for many years and over those years amassed a collection of 1000 bottles. I've no idea how much we drank. We've had to clean up a LOT of red wine spills. Wine Away is my cleaner of choice. A few weeks ago when my son his dear wife were visiting, she carried a glass of red into their bedroom. He bumped her elbow, wine went flying, and our 1-yr-old light brown carpet resembled a Jackson Pollack painting. I handed them the Wine Away and set them to work. The carpet looked brand new when they were done, with not a trace of stain remaining.Wine Away is fantastic on nylon carpets (100% effective on my many spills), tile grout, synthetic fabrics and some cottons. It is not always completely effective on white cotton, but I've never had more than a light pink or blue stain remain and a bleach pen took that out.Bottom line, if you have red wine in the house, you should also have Wine Away on hand.

"Updated review: I initially left a glowing review, after my first use. The shampoo lathered well, the conditioner was easy to comb through in the shower and both rinsed out very easily. My hair was soft and easy to comb, not dry at all. I highly recommended this duo.  However, the 2nd and 3rd use were very different. My hair began to be more flyaway and prone to tangling. It was also more dry and brittle feeling. I shouldn't be surprised, as this is after all a clarifying shampoo and conditioner. But it is also advertised for all hair types.If you have dry hair, it's likely going to be fine for occasional use, if you feel you're getting some product buildup in your hair.

"This is one terrific little foil cutter. It ships in a very nice black gift box with a foam cradle to hold the cutter securely. The cutter itself has 4 sharp stainless steel cutting wheels and slips easily over any wine bottle. Last night we tested it on a 10-yr-old Andrew Murray Syrah (Santa Ynez) and found that it worked very well. Bottles from Andrew Murray are sort of an acid test for foil cutters because an extra ridge at the top of the neck, coupled with very thick pliable foil makes their bottles a challenge for ordinary cutters. We did need to give it 4-5 turns to cut completely through the foil, but this is nothing new for this label and more importantly, we did not need to apply much pressure on the cutter to do it. The thinner foils commonly found on most wine bottles will pose no challenges to this sharp, well designed cutter.As wine collectors, I can honestly say that we go through a lot of foil cutters and probably have at least 3 in our wine gadget drawer right now. This one is a fine addition and one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend or to give as a gift to friends and family.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V47I6GTPHEBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010G1CVLS#wasThisHelpful","R1V47I6GTPHEBE","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never replaced my own screen or digitizer, instead have always taken my phone to an authorized repair shop. Still, when DBPOWER offered to let me review this iPhone 6 screen digitizer, I had nothing to lose and perhaps much to learn.The digitizer appears to be identical to the original, although it's build quality may not be as high. Time will tell. Some of the tools are fairly cheaply made, and not up to making the replacement easier. The suggested video guide at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6O-bGY_1dM is very clear and easy to follow. I'd have preferred to see written instructions included with the kit. I was happy to see that the replacement glass is already attached to the digitizer, saving that extra (and for me, scary) step.I waffled a bit between 3 and 4 stars, but in the end, had to go with 4 because of the very clear video instructions, which made the process less daunting. Bottom line, if you're comfortable making your own repairs, this kit may be a good option for you. For dolts like me, given the cost of this kit, a reputable repair shop may be the best bet.**Sample provided for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MW10RUIJNY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFCOS3A#wasThisHelpful","R14MW10RUIJNY0","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this silicone ring to use as a second ring for my IP DUO-60 pressure cooker. I use the original ring for savory dishes, giving it a 24-hr vinegar soak about once a month. I use this ring for sweets like cheesecake and neutral foods like oatmeal when i want to make sure that no off odors get into the food. I don't mind swapping out the rings because it's so easy to do, taking about 30 seconds.Side note - I cooked 3 pounds of sliced russets for mashed potatoes a couple of nights ago using my 'savory food' ring and the ring emerged completely odor free while imparting no off odors to the potatoes.

"I've had my IP for 3 months. In that time I've used it to make ribs, steel cut oats, my very first ever baked cheesecake (no cracking!), pulled pork (BBQ and Mexican), chile Colorado (wondrous), risotto (yes I did) and beef tips in gravy (so good). That's not all I've made in it, but it's a small sampling.Other reviewers have gone into great detail about it's features and functions. I'm more into telling you how it fits into my lifestyle. I'm an early retiree, living in Tampa, FL with my husband. Our son, DIL and their 4 young wolves live on the next block and we're often together on the weekends and even some weeknights. I'm a fairly accomplished home cook and cook most things from scratch because they taste better and take only a little longer. I'm all about making the process easier, faster and better. I also HATE standing over a hot stove for a long time. My Instant Pot works well, whether cooking for 2 as I usually do, or feeding the entire wolf pack (that's 8 of us when we're all together).I don't like to use my oven unless absolutely necessary. By far my most used appliance is my Breville Smart Oven (the big one). It keeps my kitchen much cooler year 'round. I consider slow cookers too hot to use indoors in summer, as running on low all day my kitchen still gets warm, even with a ceiling fan. My Instant Pot is a slow cooker, too, and it doesn't heat up my kitchen at all. It's just better insulated, but I've found that meals are so good under pressure that there's no need to use the slow cooker function. I keep meaning to, but speed always seems to prevail. I love that I can make roasts and other long-cooking things that we used to reserve for cooler months.One of my concerns was the ability to cook smaller cuts of meat and smaller volumes of other foods than the recipes indicate. I was assured by my friends at Chowhound.com that this was simple. For meats, I use the IP's rack or my steamer insert to elevate the meat above the liquid when I feel it's warranted. For other items, like rice, a pot-in-pot works well, with a heat-proof container placed on the IP rack. I use the same 1 cup of liquid in the bottom of the pot no matter whether I'm cooking one pound of meat or 4 pounds. I pushed it once with almost 5 pounds of cut-up beef and it was still perfect.This being my first pressure cooker, I had no idea how to use one, and specifically, I'm pretty clueless about cooking times because they're all over the charts, with many cookbooks (I'm looking at you, Great Big Pressure Cooker Cookbook with your 10 minute risotto) being no help at all. Or others which suggest we Increase the stovetop time by 30% for every recipe? Who thought that was the right way to go? Is it any wonder people shy away from these marvelous appliances? My best results have come from the recipes on Barbara Schieving's website, Pressurecookingtoday.com, and from the the timing charts in the back of the IP manual. Those are adapted for the IP from Laura Pazzaglia's charts at Hippressurecooking.com, another very valuable resource for ePCs. I've got 3 cookbooks for the pressure cooker. My favorite (so far) is the ATK book, Pressure Cooker Perfection. This book gets slammed by ePC cooks in the reviews, but using the timing charts mentioned above and comparing recipes to similar ones on Barbara's or Laura's website, my results have been flawless. I simply use the ATK recipe and make a timing note right in the cookbook. I like it so much because it's got a lot of my kind of food, simple, everyday, but well-seasoned and made from fresh ingredients. I've followed many recipes from Barbara's website and the ATK book (timing adjusted) to the letter and find them to be spot-on to the flavor profiles I love. With these resources at my disposal, I've quickly gained confidence.All the things I've made in it?  Chile Colorado. I served it cubed the first night, then shredded the leftovers for burritos. Meyer Lemon Cheesecake, Creamy Parmesan Risotto, Lime Cilantro Rice, Pulled Pork, Baked Beans, Weeknight Pot Roast & Potatoes, White Rice (much faster than my rice cooker), Steel Cut Oats, Beef Tips, Pork Carnitas, Refried beans. I like to keep those on hand. I soak pintos overnight in the IP's pot, cook them with a quartered onion and mash them with butter or bacon grease, cumin and chili powder, right in the pot after reserving the liquid. They cost half as much as buying canned beans and taste worlds better. Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender in 30 minutes. It was easy to make a double batch for the wolfpack, chill them overnight and finish on the grill next day. Next week I'm making the classic Bolognese from the ATK book which is only one ingredient away from Marcella Hazan's famous all-day version of the sauce. Total time, 90 minutes instead of 4 hours.Best things about the Instant Pot, aside from how it makes food taste? It's effortless. Really, push Start and walk away. And the steel inner pot is wonderful. Most things I've made begin with the Saut√© setting before going under pressure. We get superior browning before deglazing the pan with liquid. Although the silicone gasket now reeks of chili it hasn't affected anything else. If anyone knows how to remove the smell from it, let me know. Silicone is stubborn that way. I have a 2nd gasket that I use for oatmeal, rice and cheesecake. The gasket is easy to remove and replace. The steel pot goes into the dishwasher. I'm considering getting a nonstick pot for rice and oats. This handy appliance has transformed my summertime cooking, allowing me to break away from our usual salads and grilled chicken rut. Can't wait to see what it does for stews and chilis in winter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RA0ESHR8OVVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLYWNYQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RA0ESHR8OVVO","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living on a large pond in southern Florida we're treated to near daily sightings of turtles, alligators, herons, egrets and more. In spring and fall when the weather is cool we also get fly-overs (drift-overs?) by hot air balloons. It's a spectacle right in our own backyard. We've got a very nice but large and clunky binoculars (for which we paid a small fortune back in the day) that have taken up permanent residence on our lanai. When ZhiZhu asked me to review their new scope, I was  happy to, but skeptical, given the price tag.Well, color me happy! This monocular scope from ZhiZhu Optics is every bit as good as our older, WAY more expensive lenses, offering crystal clear close-ups of all our favorite wildlife, including Huey and Dewey, our 2 resident big dumb ducks. Sadly, Louie was eaten by the 'gator last spring, right in front of our eyes. True tale. Anyway, this monocular is solidly built, no cheap plastic parts. At 9.1 ounces, it's lightweight without being flimsy, and the optics are clear and sharp. It's black rubbery casing has a matte finish that provides for a completely secure grip. The wrist strap adds another layer of security, making it suitable for use on our boat. It also has a soft padded nylon carrying case with a belt loop and a small cotton cleaning cloth. Being a monocular scope, it is so much more portable than our old binoculars with their large bulky case. I have to highly recommend it, but suggest that you toss the cotton cloth and use a microfiber cloth instead to make sure you don't scratch the lens. Lens caps would have been nice, but not completely necessary as too often they're just another loose item to lose.At just over $10? I was floored by the quality, I truly was. What a great gift for any outdoor lovers in your life.

"Extra power used to be thick, heavy and clunky. How times have changed. This Foxnovo Li polymer data bank is sleek slim and at just 8.1oz, not at all heavy. It takes a bit of time to reach it's full charge (using my MacBook Air) but it does carry a nice charge. It restored my iPhone 6 from 25 percent power to 100 percent power while only using about 25 percent of it's own power. Not bad at all.It ships in a nice plain but study box and is well-cushioned inside it. It also includes a wicked cool 1ft cord with charging heads for Lightning, 30-pin (old Apple), Micro-USB 2.0 and Micro-USB 3.0 tips. Add in the gray velveteen carrying pouch with outer pocket for the cable and you've got a very nice package. the pouch has a clear bead/satin ribbon loop closure that keeps the data bank perfectly secure. I wouldn't hesitate to give this as a gift.And lest I forget, it's aluminum paint job is a dead ringer for Apple's aluminum bodies. That's a very sexy thing to me, and the icing on the cake.

"This Foxnovo cable offers the best of many other cables all in one complete package. It's a bright lime green for easy visibility. It's flat cable guarantees tangle-free storage and use. It also has 2 charging tips; a Lightning tip for newer Apple devices and a Micro-USB tip for almost all the rest.This last feature is a real boon to people living in mixed marriages, as I am. My husband loves his Galaxy Note 4, I'm an Apple FanGirl. Our luggage has sometimes carried what looks like a bag of spaghetti. Foxnovo eliminates this with a cable that will charge all of our devices.Best of all, there's a tiny spring cable holding the Lightning tip to the Micro-USB tip, so neither becomes lost. This feature makes it even easier to carry this as our sole travel charger. I can see many uses for it. For the back seat of the car it can keep multiple kids happy. Around the house it saves checking the cable to see if it's got the right tip.Finally, at $12.99, it's a good value for an Apple MFi Certified cable. Trying it out several times over the weekend, it connected flawlessly every time. This is just about all you can ask from a cable.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZLCKREQ0PWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0GJADC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZLCKREQ0PWD","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't apply screen protectors. Seriously, ever since I got my first iPhone 3S I've been relying on the guys at the AT&T store to put them on for me. When they frayed or got scratched, I'd do without or go see my phone guys again. I've tried, really I have, many times. And I do ok, if you don't mind looking through aquarium glass covered with CSI fingerprint lifts. I suck at it, smudges and bubble city every time.But needing to write a completely honest review I decided to tackle the Korton Tempered Glass protector on my own. I carefully followed the clear instructions printed on the back of the package, washing my hands, being in a bright lit area. Dust-free isn't an option in my house, but I made sure the cat was nowhere in sight to shed on my iPhone 6. Korton provides everything you need except the soap and water for your hands. I wiped the iPhone down with the included wipe, then dried it really well with the Korton's microfiber cloth. Determined to keep it lint/dust free, I held it vertically while I peeled down the top inch of the film on the Korton glass protector, which I also kept vertical. Then I laid the phone down and carefully aligned the glass with the top speaker. After that, I slowly and carefully peeled down the film while continuing to hold the glass protector in place.I cannot BELIVE that I did this, but I did! With nary a bubble, stray lint fiber, smudge or cat hair in sight. Remember what your iPhone 6 looked like when you first opened the box it shipped in? That. Since I promised brutal honesty, I must admit that I went ever-so-slightly off kilter near the bottom of the phone, and the Korton protector is very, very slightly misaligned around my Home key, by maybe 1/32"", but not intruding on it's area at all. For this reason I highly recommend following the optional advice to secure the glass with tape at the top of the phone. But honestly? I don't know if that would have made a difference, because the misalignment is so little, but it wouldn't hurt. Anyway, I have full access to the Home key and NO, NADA, ZIP bubbles or dirt on my screen, with an actual second sheet of glass to protect my screen!! Yay, me!EDIT - After using it for a bit, I realized that this glass screen feels just like the Apple glass. Duh. What I mean is that it doesn't feel like a screen protector at all, but just like my phone.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GV239127I3TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VREJ6Y4#wasThisHelpful","R3GV239127I3TP","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These baking cups are wonderful, easy to use, clean and store. They're a little bit smaller than the usual paper liners, but by no means ""mini"". They will not fit into the holes in my mini cupcake pan. I think HomeFlav should change their listing to remove the word ""mini"" from the description. This would stop the confusion and also make sure there are no unhappy customers. If the description is changed, I'd give these 5 stars.Their best features are related to how well they work and how economical they are. To get the best results, they need to be greased the first few times they're used to sort of ""season"" them. After that, they should be pretty much good to go (I'll update this review the 4th time I use them to let you know for sure). They clean so easily with soap and water that's it's laughable. Part of this can be attributed to how nonstick they are. Sprayed with cooking spray, cupcakes slid right out of them, leaving nary a crumb behind.This crumb thing is another HUGE plus, as the cupcakes don't shed nearly as many crumbs into hands, onto clothing and floors. Using paper liners when my 4 grandsons are around, I've always felt like I needed to mop the floor afterwards. This 'no-mess' aspect is my husband's favorite thing about them.I wasn't sure how much I'd like reusable liners, what with the need to wash them and all. But these are so easy to clean that I don't feel like I'm doing any extra work at all. Wipe once with a soapy sponge or cloth, rinse and turn them upside down to dry. Boom. Done. They're the easiest part of doing the dishes. I'm not a frequent baker, but still, with the average box mix making 24 cupcakes, I can easily go through 4-5 sleeves of liners in a year. Side note - why do most grocery store liner packs come with 36 liners when the cake mixes next to them make 24? These are like hot dogs and hot dog buns. Anyway, at the current price of $6.79, these will be paid for before you know it.**Sample provided for review.**","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMQTUCRU3FN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DVBZCKI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMQTUCRU3FN5","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd never used meat claws to shred Barbecue before, always relying on a pair of dinner forks, because I don't have 2 meat forks and one dinner fork and one meat fork was ridiculous. Very advanced, I know. So when Kickty offered these to me for evaluation and review, I emailed back a ""Yes!"" before they could change their minds.Formed of hard shiny plastic, they're nicely finished, although with an open framework on the back (see photo). The back-side frame does have a bulge at the handle to make for a comfortable grip. But it won't matter, because you won't be using them long enough for grip comfort to become a factor. Really, it's perfectly comfortable.The business end (claws) measure 4.5"" wide and 2"" deep. Those 2"" teeth are pointy, too. Not like plastic fork pointy, but honestly out-your-eye-out pointed to rip through barbecued meats with ease. Which they do. A big step up from my wimpy dinner forks, these provide 12 claws spread across 4.5"" and bring to bear (yup, I went there) to so much meat-ripping power that my time to shred a 2lb hunk of pork butt was about 30 seconds, maybe. Could have been less.  There's also no hand strain involved. I'm a 61-yr-old female with weak wrists. I need both hands to lift my cast iron skillet. I ripped through last night's pork butt and went looking for more things to shred.One thing that I really liked about these was that the spread between claws allowed me to leave lots of little pieces of meat intact, rather than turning it all into true shreds. We like a little texture in our Barbecue. This feature will make these very useful for Carnitas, where you don't want shreds at all. I could have torn my roast apart into Carnitas pieces in about 5 seconds. Of course, it you want to, you can spend another 10 seconds or so and have fine shreds.I waited to get this review in, thinking I could try them as salad hands tonight. Well, that didn't pan out (burgers and dogs), but I promise to add that experience within the next week or so. I prefer multi-taskers, but given how often we shred meat for barbecue and tacos, I'm willing to give this uni-tasker a home. But I really hope they work for salads. How cool to only need one tool for barbecue and the coleslaw to go with it? That would be neat.So although I'm not a fan of uni-taskers and this isn't fully finished, I'm still giving it 5 stars because at the current price of $7.99, they're worth it.EDIT - Well, we finally made a big tossed green salad (romaine, iceberg, onion and tomato) and used our meat claws as salad hands. They worked really well, grabbing greens and tomatoes with ease. I was worried that when I dropped the portion onto a plate,half the greens would remain impaled on the Kickty's sharp claws. Not at all. Out of six passes, only one come up with impaled leaves, and only two pieces of iceberg. Not shabby, and it's nice to know  they can do double duty. Definitely worth 5 stars.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZK2Z9TYY1LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W555MYM#wasThisHelpful","R1VZK2Z9TYY1LQ","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of the 3 Ipow Universal  CD slot phone mounts I've tried, this is far and away my favorite. Hand's down, no question. My iPhone 6 is in a simple, minimalist faux leather/silicone case, keeping it's weight down. The magnets in this mount hold it very well. It also holds with ease my husband's Samsung Galaxy Note 4 in a heavier protective case.Before inserting it into your CD slot (you'll still be able to play CD's, by the way), affix the little rubber pads to the top of the center flange and the bottom of the outer flanges. Then screw the whole thing into your car's CD slot, tightening up the wing nut to secure it. Easy as pie.This phone mount ships with 2 magnetic plates that can be slipped into your phone case behind your phone or can be attached right to the back of your phone by removing the cover on the sticky tape backing. Either way, you've got a strong, secure grip for 2 phones. My husband and I chose to put the plates inside our cases. There's plenty of magnetic force to hold either phone tight to the mount. They're not going anywhere until we pull them off the round magnetic disk.What makes this our favorite of all the Ipow mounts is that we can slap our phones onto the holder and just as easily pull them off. Some mounts require 2 hands to both insert the phone into the mount and to remove it when you exit the car. This doesn't work for us, as whichever one of us is in the passenger seat will need to be able to grab the phone for one reason or another. Today I needed to enter some new items into my shopping list. When I was done, I simply placed the phone back on the magnet. This is by far the easiest to use car phone mount we've tried and we can't see using any other.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4B1K15L0FQDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZO04CQ#wasThisHelpful","R4B1K15L0FQDU","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another Ipow CD slot phone holder and like the others, it does it's job very well, holding any phone securely, with easy access to music and nav apps, and whatever else you need to access while on the road. This one is designed with extra security, in the form of the bottom support. It is ideal for large phablets and may even fit some smaller tablets. If your phone is heavy, this may be the ideal mount for you.Attach the little rubber strips to the top of the center wing and the bottom of the side wings to make sure it will stay securely in your CD slot. The beauty of these designs is that you can still play a CD while the mount is in place. Brilliant!For my uses, with shorter trips, mostly 40 minutes or less, it isn't the best design, given that removing my phone is a two-handed operation. I prefer more of a quick-release mount (like the Ipow Magnetic CD Slot Holder) that allows me to grab my phone and go. Also, when my husband and I are in the car together, we use my phone for music apps. Sometimes I need to grab my phone to do an internet search or some other task. I don't want to fiddle with buttons and clamps to get at my phone.However, if you don't need to remove your phone from the mount while you're in the car, this kind of mount provides the best level of security, short of leaving it in the glovebox.**Sample provided for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JFGD08JG6JPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZNTUH2#wasThisHelpful","R1JFGD08JG6JPM","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice CD Drive for devices that lack them, like my MacBook Air. I'll be comparing it to my Apple SuperDrive.The ZhiZhu is lightweight, portable and about the same size (closed) as my SuperDrive. It connected easily, by which I mean that I attached it's cable and plugged it into my Mac. That was it. It was able to properly read both a Disney DVD (Cinderella) and a Dimension Films release (The Others).  Playback was flawless, with no skipping. The unit's cable detaches at both ends, which I think is a nice feature. I suppose Apple's cable is fixed in order to prevent loss, but I worry about breaking it off, with it sticking out all the time, although it's held up for 4 years.I do have some construction concerns that would apply to frequent users. Primarily, the ZhiZhu drive lacks the finish and ruggedness of the SuperDrive. Unlike the Apple unit (made of rigid aluminum), it's case body is hard plastic. The instruction guide warns against placing objects on top of it because it can affect playback. To test this, I pushed on the top of the case and noticed that it does give to pressure. I've used the Apple drive as a coaster, placed a heavy textbook on it  and dropped it, all with no ill effects.The disk-handling mechanism is my other area of concern. The ZhiZhu's disc tray drawer appears a little flimsy, as does the ""Eject"" Button, which slides the disc tray in and out.  I question how long either would last under frequent use or less-than-ideal conditions. The SuperDrive has no sliding tray; the disc goes directly into the unit and a keyboard command ejects it. This unit requires more flat space when loading/unloading because of the sliding tray. Still, the SuperDrive is twice the price, and the ZhiZhu drive does perform just as well.If you plan to use it with your MB Air while traveling or you use a lot of discs, this may not be the best model for you. It probably makes more sense to purchase the Apple SuperDrive. If, on the other hand, you're like me and rarely have the need to read a disc (part of the reason I chose to save weight and purchase the Air), this is a great little device, costing half as much as an Apple SuperDrive, which makes it easy to recommend.**Product provided for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QY4V9NTE7ZFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q916K8U#wasThisHelpful","R2QY4V9NTE7ZFC","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using these strainers for a little while now, and have found them quite useful. The largest is ideal for sifting large amounts of flour, rinsing rice and so on.  The smallest one is very nice for dusting flour over chicken or fish (this is really superior to dreddging with no flour waste and no mess!), and for straining tea. I haven't yet found a use for the mid-size one. I thought it might work for straining bacon grease into a jar, but it's too shallow.Which brings me to the drawbacks. With the exception of the smallest one, all of these feel just a little shallow, lacking in volume. They're also very lightweight, which means they may fail under a heavy load. On my first use of the small one, while flouring some fish filets, the third time I tapped the side of it to bring out more flour, one of the handle welds gave out. The handle is only attached at one point. The strainer is still perfectly functional (for now) under a small weight, but if this happened to one of the larger ones, the handles could break off entirely.  I still lack confidence that the other weld won't eventually give way, but it's holding so far.At the price ($9.99), they're inexpensive and likely fine for light duty, like straining liquids. But if you want to strain a puree, you'll need something more heavy-duty to stand up to the pushing and scraping that needs to be done to extract all the liquid and leave only solids behind.**Sample provided for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XQV5DISKZBL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2D47YS#wasThisHelpful","R2XQV5DISKZBL0","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've previously had the pleasure of trying Joyal Beauty's Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C and liked it very much. I like this one better. It has a 2% higher concentration of Hyaluronic acid and does a better job (didn't think that was possible) of hydrating my dry skin. I live in Florida and find it tough to use a moisturizer in this climate. By mid-morning, even the lightest begin to float somewhat on my face, rather like body lotions do. If you've ever experienced this with lotion on your legs or arms, you'll know what I'm talking about. Moisturizers are supposed to disappear, not remain on the face all day. But I digress.With 5% hyaluronic acid, this serum has helped my skin retain more moisture, thus reducing the need for moisturizer. I can use much  less and get the same effect. In fact, on some days I've not used any moisturizer at all and felt no difference in my skin. It has remained soft, smooth to the touch, plump and MOIST all day. This is a real boon when it's 95 degrees with humidity levels to match.Another reason I prefer this serum is that it has, quite literally, no fragrance at all. Joyal's Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C has a slight fragrance from the Vitamin C. It's mild and not at all unpleasant, but I like 100% odor-free better. There's really nothing I don't like about this serum. It's one I'll happily continue to use.As with all of their products, Joyal Beauty is proud to tell us exactly what is in the bottle, making it easy for us to make our own decisions about what to buy. Have an allergy? Mine is roses. Many products contain Rosehips, which can trigger my allergy. It is often hidden (although not through deception or malice) in a catch-all phrase like ""Botanical Extracts"". Because Joyal lists all the ingredients on Amazon, I can check any product before I commit. This practice is priceless to anyone with allergies and another reason to trust Joyal Beauty.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDUD1C7D6WFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0088YE#wasThisHelpful","R1JDUD1C7D6WFZ","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had problems in the past using fruit acid exfoliators, as many of them, even in somewhat low concentrations, can irritate or outright burn my skin. I've had no problems at all with Joyal's Kojic Acid Leave-On Exfoliator. In fact, it has not caused any irritation at all, not even a mild tingle when I use it. I haven't noticed any change in wrinkles or fine lines, but that's not what I expect from exfoliation.What I have seen is clearer, brighter skin, with no dull areas at all. I don't think it clarifies quite as well as Joyal's Vitamin C serum, which I've also been honored to try, but for me, the exfoliation is the key, which leads to brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. I'll simply resume use of the Vitamin C serum now that I'm done testing this one.One thing I really like about Joyal Beauty is that they proudly tell us exactly what is in their products, without using made-up science-y sounding names to make us believe their product has a magical ingredient that no one else has. Every component is spelled out in clear, common terms. They trust that their customers can judge for themselves. And as with all the Joyal products I've tried, a little goes a long way.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDJZ1A0V5I8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ64AGI#wasThisHelpful","R2SDJZ1A0V5I8I","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very excited to get these labels. They're very attractive, working well in my contemporary kitchen, despite their slightly old-time flair. A real plus is that the labels are very flexible and stay put, but can also be removed without a lot of trouble. I couldn't ask for nicer labels.Although the look is very nice, I wouldn't consider these for containers that you'll want to erase and mark again for other contents. Although the finished look is striking, exactly like chalk on a blackboard, they're not the easiest thing to use. After priming the pen, I found that I either had to write on the label and let it dry (this takes much longer than a few minutes) of write on the jar, which doesn't look very nice.For jars that you'll use in the fridge, these aren't a good choice, because the ink wipes right off with the tiniest amount of moisture. I erased 2 labels simply by reaching in to remove them from fridge.  I'm going to look at Michael's or a similar shop for semi-permanent white markers. With one of these type markers, I should be able to use these for fridge storage quite easily.I'm really torn between a 3 and 4 star rating, but because of the wait time for the ink to dry, it's got to be 3. Again, for items that are dry, and won't be relabled very often, these are a fine choice.**Sample provided for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1776IN6F47EIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBOANAE#wasThisHelpful","R1776IN6F47EIX","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I walk for fitness, my daughter-in-law runs marathons. We both have long hair. We liked how this Wailea Fitness Head Band felt, smooth and sleek, and the amount of coverage it provides. Neither of us was thrilled with the color, which is sort of traffic-cone orange. Neither of use were big fans of the twist front, because we had to fiddle with it a little before putting it on. In use, the twist wasn't as attractive as I thought it would be. Both of us appreciated the width, which allowed us to bring it down on our foreheads without giving us that 80's roller-disco look.I had the same problem with it that I have with most headbands, it kept slipping off my fine hair. I had to constantly tug it back into place. My daughter-in-law has more hair than I do, a mane if we're being honest, and although it's bordering on fine, the headband stayed in place a little better for her. It performed it's primary job well for both of us, catching sweat, keeping us dry.On balance, at the price ($7.99) we can recommend it for women with medium to coarse hair, because it's wide enough to be worn down onto your forehead while still keeping your hair corralled. but we really hope Wailea Fitness changes the color and design.**Sample provided for review**","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KWVCB90AOYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y83QVCG#wasThisHelpful","R26KWVCB90AOYL","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've worn a FitBit since December. I've never lost a band, never had one fall off or come undone. I do change my band from time to time, if I want to match it to an outfit or just want a change. And of course I remove them weekly for charging. All of my current bands are FitBit brand.These Wailea Fitness bands are very similar in construction. Although the mold marks on the underside of the band aren't as nicely finished and the silicone isn't as smooth as the Fitbit bands, the Wailea bands are overall pretty much identical in thickness and shape. The metal clasps appear to be of the same heavy metal (steel, I think) as the Fitbit brand clasps.I should note that the black and camouflage bands are virtually the same length as my Fitbit bands, but the solid green one is almost ¬Ω"" shorter. I moved the clasp outward another 2 holes to get the same fit. If your wrists are large, this may be a problem. I'm a 5'9"" woman with a 7"" wrist. I wear my Fitbit loosely.Where I ran into problems was securing the bands on my wrist. Fitbit band holes have a slight bevel that makes it easier to align and push the clasp through the holes. The holes on the Wailea Fitness bands sit perfectly flush with the top of the band. I had a really hard time getting the clasp through the holes and had to enlist the aid of my husband. I hope that in time the holes will stretch a little, making it easier for me to secure the bands on my own.Despite these flaws, there is much to like about the Wailea Fitness bands: First is the value. They cost about 75% less than the ""real"" thing and are only slightly less well-made.Second, they come with a solidly-built metal clasp for each band. Fitbit 3-band sets come with a single clasp to share among the bands.Wailea Fitness has gone out of it's what to make sure you don't lose them. All 3 bands include a clear plastic slide that will pro-actively prevent them from falling off your wrist. Fitbit bands do not provide any additional protection from loss.Finally, the black band is absolutely unique with it's striking tumbling boxes diamond finish. I've never seen another band like it.Once you get them on your wrist, these sturdy, well-made bands aren't going anywhere until you remove them.**Sample provided for review**","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CSBQPG0FHJBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y83PBMC#wasThisHelpful","R2CSBQPG0FHJBQ","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pretty skeptical of new topical skin serums. After all, I'm 61, and even though I possess warm, somewhat naturally tan skin thanks to my Mongol ancestors, a lifetime of living near the beach has taken it's toll. Although I lack age spots, my skin is a little uneven with some redness, and I've got my share of wrinkles. I rarely bother with sunscreen, because I don't burn easily and my family is at minimal risk for skin cancer.So when I agreed to try Acetyl Organics ARGIRELINE Serum, I wasn't expecting much. I was wrong. The combination of Argireline and Hyaluronic acid, at maximum concentrations, is doing some very nice things for my skin. The Hyaluronic acid is doing a bang-up job of maximizing the moisture content in my face. My skin is much more plump and soft to the touch than before. The Argireline is magically easing wrinkles. They're not gone, oh no, but they are less prominent, softer, than they were. Vitamin C is also acting to brighten and even out my skin, reducing redness. I have pretty sensitive skin but experienced no tingling at all with this serum. It is also completely scent-free, a rarity in a market where most products carry some scent.I really like the dropper it comes with, it is very easy to measure out just a few drops with it. The dark glass bottle will help prevent sunlight from reducing the effectiveness of the serum, so I feel pretty comfortable keeping this on my counter where I'll remember to use it. If this works on my old, weathered skin, think what it can do for younger skin to help prevent damage. Give it a try, I think you'll like it.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14R9DQO7HB8GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1WCZ9G#wasThisHelpful","R14R9DQO7HB8GX","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me preface by saying that although I'm an accomplished cook, I hate the inherent uncertainty that goes along with poaching eggs. Will the yolks hold together? Will the whites shred? Did I manage to drain all the water off? So when ForPeak invited me to take their silicone egg cups out for a spin, I jumped at the chance.They're exactly as pictured, a lovely bright blue heavy silicone. There is nothing flimsy about them. Better, although they're perfectly rounded on the inside, they have a flat base on the bottom to hold them upright and stable on your counter, with zero worries about tipping over and dumping your raw egg onto the counter. They also take up a lot less room than your typical egg poaching pan in your cupboards. Mine store easily inside a gadget drawer. Costing about half as much as some other high quality egg cups, they represent a solid value.To use them, perfectly, from day one, follow these simple steps.1. Set water on to simmer. Don't boil it. Boiling water can splash into the cup, and you'll have to drain it out at the end. Bubbles should be breaking the surf, but they should be small, tiny ones. If the water is moving from the bubbles, turn it down a notch.2. Butter the cups. Sure you can use spray oil, but butter just plain tastes better. These are eggs, right? I used my favorite OXO pastry brush for this, brushing room temp butter into the cups. http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-Silicone-Basting-Pastry/dp/B000JPSI8C/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1434291833&sr=1-1&keywords=silicone+pastry+brush3. Fill the cups. Crack one egg into each cup, holding the egg low over the cup to prevent breaking the yolk. Be gentle.4. Lift the filled cups into the simmering water. You can do this by hand. Cover the pan.5. Set a timer for 3 minutes. Depending on how well done you want them, they'll take anywhere from 3-5 minutes.6. Use a spoon to remove the cups from the pan. I used my fingers and couldn't avoid getting a little water into the cup as it tipped when I grabbed it.7. Use a fork or spoon to release the egg from the cup.8. Break it open over your favorite breakfast hash, potatoes or bread and enjoy!That's it! I had no trouble at all with my very first attempt, although my egg was a little overdone, with a firmly set white. The yolk was a little too thick for my preference, but my husband though they were perfect.  They eggs were delicious served on top of beef hash for a rustic breakfast. A slice of cantaloupe brought some light sweet contrast. One of the best things is how easy these are to use, leaving you free to prepare the rest of your meal. It literally took me longer to type the steps than it did to perform them.Remember that poached eggs aren't just for breakfast. Try them over a Caesar or arugula salad. Over pasta with oil, anchovies and red peppers, on top of steamed asparagus, in soup, on top of mushroom polenta or risotto. Use them to make little individual layered ice cream cups, like vanilla with raspberry sorbet. Nestle that next to a slice of chocolate cake for an elegant dessert. Freeze herbs in water in them. I'm sure there are other things you can do with them, those are just the ones that quickly occurred to me.Yes, after only one use, I'm very impressed with these little blue wonders. I think every kitchen should have at least one pair of them. I'm contemplating ordering a few more, so I can use them for a small dinner party. I'm in danger of becoming a fangirl, I have to admit it. They were just so easy to use, and yielded such wonderful results. How many products carry zero learning curve? Try them for yourself and you might become a fan, too.**Sample provided for review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T95ZSFWCNG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X60BRLW#wasThisHelpful","R2T95ZSFWCNG7","A26XMCAS33TQF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26XMCAS33TQF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To say that my family was excited to test this Kindz Selfie Stick is an understatement. All 4 grandkids wanted to try it, but my daughter-in-law was most excited. So after charging it (very intuitive if you've ever charged anything) I handed the entire apparatus to her, without the instruction manual. She doesn't usually deal with electronics set-up, so I thought that if she could figure it out, anyone could. Well, color me impressed. Within about 2 minutes she had it paired to her Samsung Galaxy, had attached the phone in it's bracket to the stick and was ready to snap photos.In use, it was equally easy to use and allowed her and my grandsons to to take some impressive selfies.Build quality is quite solid, really strong, surprisingly so, considering the sub-$20 price tag. There are no flimsy components here. This is something that you can toss in a suitcase or stick in your back pocket or backpack without fear of it breaking.

I use it after showering and my skin gets very soft from the sloughing off of dead skin cells. It has another side for getting rid of cellulite.

"You want ENERGY? How soon do you need it?If you want it fast, take some of this fractionated coconut oil! Fractionated coconut oil is very high in medium chain triglycerides, the part of coconut oil that not only gives you quick energy, but also burns fat. Whenever I am lagging, I take a tablespoon of this and within an hour I have tons of energy to get stuff done, or do anything physical such as fast walking, yoga, or dancing.Coconut oil has a long shelf life, and fractionated oil is even more stable. Because of that, you can mix this stuff with essential oils and other ingredients to use it in making toothpaste, skin creams, shampoo, and other nontoxic personal care products. It canbe an ingredient in homemade remedies, since coconut oil is antiviral and antibacterial. It can even be used in sunscreens and cosmetics.Best of all, however, I like to use it instead of cream in my coffee. The fat in the oil helps prevent the insulin response, making it great for keeping fit and healthy.

"Chocolate is a super and longevity food, very high in nutrients. Yes, you heard that right: Some of the most long-lived people were chocoholics (including a French woman who lived to be 122, and a Mexican woman still alive at 125).As the author of a couple of diet books and a life-long health enthusiast and foodie, I can attest to the value of chocolate in one's diet. What most people don't realize, though, is that to get the maximum benefit from chocolate, it must be DARK (at least 70% cacao, which is low in sugar) and RAW. This is not only because milk chocolate is high in sugar (which, as we know, is toxic), but also because when any food is heated, many nutrients are destroyed.That makes the FineNaturals Ultra Dark Cocoa Powder superior. It is not only VERY dark, but also organic, raw, unprocessed and unsweetened.Chocolate is also a mood-enhancer, an aphrodisiac (why given at Valentine's Day). Just don't eat it at night as the theobromine (similar to caffeine) might keep you awake.Currently I am on a very low carb diet, and since this chocolate is nearly 100% fat (the GOOD kind of fat), I can eat it to my heart's content. For a quick treat, I mix by spoon a tablespoon of this chocolate with a bit of coconut oil and stevia or a teaspoon of raw honey.I live in Ecuador which is the source of much of the world's chocolate. Unfortunately, the best coffee and best chocolate is exported. So this chocolate actually tastes much better than the chocolate here!Full disclosure: I was given this in exchange for an honest review, and was very happy to get it!Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and several other books","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8DWQOTTQRCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOGWWE8#wasThisHelpful","R1D8DWQOTTQRCP","A15YB0DWQ815SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YB0DWQ815SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love ceramic knives, and this brand is as good as any out there! Ceramic knives are not porous so they don't transfer dirt or grime to the food. It is a clean cut, and this has been demoed by cutting apples with stainless steel vs. ceramic knives: the apples with the stainless steel often turn slightly brown on top after ten minutes or so. But not with the ceramic ones. I had heard that if you accidentally cut yourself with one, you will not bleed. I didn't want to test this, but I did accidentally cut myself and was amazed to find this is true! They do not rust and are very light in weight. They never need to be sharpened!

"Rose hip oil used as a facial moisturizer has anti-aging benefits due to the antioxidants and nutrients, which include essential fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C and B-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A.

"I've read hundreds of self help books in my life, and what I loved about this one is that it is an entirely new method I'd never heard of before.Have you ever heard a song that took you to a sad time in your past? You may LOVE the song, but it reminds you of something you'd rather forget, which ruins it for you. Well, author John Benz states that the same thing applies to many of your possessions. They even keep you stuck to an old identity. He recommends clearing the possessions, and tells you step by step how to do it. This leads to real empowerment and transformation.The author has worked with people and by their deciding which ones to let go of, they have changed their lives, even lost weight or made more money or attracted better relationships.If you are worried about the money, he points to how you can sell things on consignment and assures us, ""What you put into your Clearing, you will get back many times over.""But even more powerful is part 2 in which you learn to clear residual thoughts. He provides again the steps to enable you to confront people, forgive, and apologize. It's like he is holding your hand throughout the process with this book.I am inspired! I plan to use his method to clear with an individual I had a falling out with.Highly recommended if you want to go further in your life and reinvent yourself, freeing yourself from the past!

"HIGH ART AND WISDOM ROLLED INTO ONEI have been interested in Sikhism for a long time and have read several books on the subject.

It is beautifully written, the engrossing and enchanting fiction brings alive the history, the characters are real and you can identify with their conflicts. I found such a kinship with the central character, Mardana, and his follies, and his so many relevant questions, which are answered by Guru Nanak.

Wehen we are living out of line with what we're supposed to be doing, our bodies feel it.""The book includes 10 guidelines for eating awareness, an explanation for the three main body types (doshas) and their recommended diets and exercises, 12 guidelines for better sleep, a huge list of foods with their tastes (sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, astringent), 10 tips for a better spiritual life, 12 traits of healthy relationships, four rules for compassionate communication, and much much more.Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32RIQJVK4AGH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608683524#wasThisHelpful","R32RIQJVK4AGH4","A15YB0DWQ815SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YB0DWQ815SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hollywood really needs to make a comedy based on this book--something like the 1994 movie, On the Road to Wellville. Fat (especially saturated) became falsely vilified and it all began with one hardheaded man, Ancel Keys, Through a comedy of errors, everyone tried to fit the data to suit this theory,and when the government got on board, it became dogma. When a few voices cried that the emperor had no clothes, they were denied research grants. Food became politics. The whole situation got worse when saturated fats were replaced with toxic trans fats, and it would have been hilarious if so many senseless deaths hadn't followed.I knew about half the stuff in this book already from when I researched for my book Beyond Broccoli--nonetheless this was a very informative and entertaining read, full of surprises even for me.

"I am a health/diet author and educator. When people ask me what one simple thing they could do to be healthier, I never hesitate to reply, ‚ÄúGo gluten-free!‚Äù The simple fact is that humans are not granivores, and since the onset of agriculture, have lost six inches of height, on average, due to phytates of grains robbing our minerals. What‚Äôs worse, the human brain has shrunk 10%. I believe this is mostly due to consuming grains.Things are worse today: with wheat especially. Wheat has been so hybrid in the last 100 years that the body doesn‚Äôt recognize it as food. You may think that you are not wheat sensitive, but everyone is to some degree: especially since wheat in the USA is sprayed with the very toxic pesticide, Roundup Ready!This is a great e-book to have for fast, healthful and tasty gluten-free recipes. The recipes include breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts.The recipes include color photos to inspire you to make the dish. Best of all, each recipe has the prep time, the number of servings, and nutritional data per serving (ie: number of calories, carbs, protein, and fat grams).Some of the recipes you find include rice noodles with sun-dried tomatoes, basil & parmesian; gluten free strawberry shortcake muffins; tomatoes stuffed with brown rice, mint and feta, and plenty more.

"This book was a real labor of love to help people, inspired by the author's having lost his wife to cancer. Says Dr. Westman: ""I have the nagging feeling that, if I had known in 2011 about the complementary therapies for conventional cancer treatment described in Chapter 11, Nancy would be living today.""The book opens with conventional cancer treatment, and why the alleged ""war on cancer"" failed, and all the toxicity from conventional treatment and even the diagnostic procedures (such as mammograms and MRIs, which can actually CAUSE cancer!) It's all just a big money machine, (and finding the ""cure"" was never intended in my observation).In this book you will also learn the types of cancer, the stages of cancer, the history of cancer, and the culture of cancer. You will also learn about the various theories of what causes cancer.I found most interesting the suppressed information of Otto Warburg, who proved that cancer depends on an acidic environment, as well as glucose. Truly a diet rich in greens (alkaline) and very very low in carbs (ketogenic) is the route I would surely take if I got the disease that has killed most my family. Warburg concluded: ""... the primary cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen in normal body cells by a fermentation of sugar.""The author states: ""It turns out that dramatically reducing the blood glucose that cancer cells so heavily rely upon both starved them and forces the body to generate new fuels from fat called ketones--a fuel source that cancer cells are unable to use ..."" So, cut the carbs and starve the cancer cells! How simple is that?  Cancer is NOT the body's deficiency of chemo chemicals!This book is a great overview for those facing which direction to go with cancer treatment. I also like how each chapter is summarized at the end, so you don't have to read everything. Since it is obvious that the drug companies lost their ""war on cancer"" (though gained enormously in profits), I would go with the nutritional route.Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LGJSHR4EVKH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480813087#wasThisHelpful","R3LGJSHR4EVKH3","A15YB0DWQ815SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YB0DWQ815SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this book and couldn't put it down. While I was writing Beyond Broccoli, I was in ketosis most the time. My brain was sooooo sharp that I was reading faster, and my mind could easily understand complex studies that I cited. The book's name means ""clarity on the topic of keto"" but it has a double entendre. It can also mean that your brain becomes VERY CLEAR when fed ketones! Unfortunately, I fell for the propoganda that this diet was meant to be only temporary.Now I have been on it again for about 6 weeks. I got some really good tips from the book that I hadn't known about, such as restricting protein. Another obstacle was coffee, which stimulates insulin. But now we have ""bullet proof coffee"" with butter or coconut or MCT oil. This prevents the insulin response!My energy is soaring, and my sleep is better than it has been in five years! I am sleeping deeper than ever. I was not overweight, but I have lost most my belly fat. For me, this is a DIET FOR LIFE. I am so excited about it, I got several of my friends to do it.

"As the author of a couple of diet books and a life-long health enthusiast and foodie, I can attest to the  value of chocolate in one's diet. Yes, you heard that right: Chocolate is a super food, very high in nutrients. Some of the most long-lived people were chocoholics (including a French woman who lived to be 122, and a Mexican woman still alive at 125).What most people don't realize, though, is that to get the maximum benefit from chocolate, it must be DARK (at least 70% cacao, which is low in sugar) and RAW. This is not only because milk chocolate is high in sugar (which, as we know, is toxic), but also because when any food is heated, many nutrients are destroyed. That makes the Joyfuel cacao superior.Chocolate is also a mood-enhancer, an aphrodisiac (why given at Valentine's Day). Just don't eat it at night as the theobromine (similar to caffeine) might keep you awake. I use these nibs in recipes such as trail mix, chocolate chip ice cream, raw cookies, and more.Currently I am on a ketogenic diet, and since the nibs are 100% fat (the GOOD kind of fat), I can eat them to my heart's content.I live in Ecuador which is the source of much of the world's chocolate. Unfortunately, the best coffee and best chocolate is exported. So these nibs actually taste much better than the nibs here!Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli does raw food classes and health coaching.

"The author is on a mission to wake everyone up about our Higher Selves. Note: that is only one of the 51 names he cites for our intuition, our inner guidance, that still small voice.He found that every culture and language describes this sixth sense. The author prefers the term ""second side.""He opens the book with three stunning examples of people whose lives were saved by following their intuitive guidance. One was a woman who, upon sensing that a man about to board her plane had very strong vibes, postponed her flight. It turned out that she dodged one of the 9-11 planes that was hijacked!This book is similar to Brain Weiss's classic, Through Time into Healing, in that he hypnotizes a woman and discovers an incredible esoteric secret--the inner guide we all have. He decided to contact his inner guid---and his life changed radically.What I found different from many intuition self-help books is that he personalizes the source of intuition. He encourages even giving a name to your Higher Self and engaging in dialogue with him/her/it. I have to say, I have tried this method many times while reading the book. I tend to misplace things, or not recall where I put them, and when I call upon this guidance, I usually find it within minutes!I like how the author explains how the second side works. It ""isn't pushy or intrusive, and it doesn't take the lead in decision-making unless you initiate it first. Like a wise and faithful friend, our second side waits for a request for help."" One exception, he claims, is a life-threatening situation, in which the second side gets bold (since keeping us alive is its main job). Most people, he says, don't ask questions, and when they do, they don't wait for the answers, not believing they have them inside. We are also very condescending towards children, who are much more in touch with their inner voice. He gives the startling example of a 16-year-old who invented something scientists had been trying to do for years.The books provides easy-to-do exercises to get in contact with your second side, including the pendulum method. Throughout the book he touts the benefits of doing so (including getting great advice, developing creativity, and finding the inner genius). He gives many examples from other people and himself as well. He even claims that being in touch with this higher guidance can be an all-the-time occurrence.Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli does raw food classes and health coaching.

"I have a whole shelf of recovery books, and I can say this one definitely deserves five stars. It's revolutionary in several ways: the author challenges the concept that one should always identify as being an addict; he provides ways an atheist can deal with step 2 (believing in a greater power);  he feels that the 12 steps are a great spiritual path even for nonaddicts; and he goes  beyond simple recovery into finding  total freedom from desire for substances or any addictions--especially after he discovered kundalini yoga and meditation. I love his emphasis on nutrition and how he calls sugar the ""gateway drug."" He also discusses cleansing or detoxing the body with herbs and juices, which I believe are important for everyone's well being. He claims that the drugs we are really looking for are the ""the infinite pharmacy within,"" referring to our endocrine system's workings to make us feel good.I have highlighted and underlined something on nearly every page of this book. The author includes his entire story--his childhood dysfunctional family and being a teen addict in New York City. Later he became a Deadhead (fan of the Grateful Dead) and had some spiritual insights.  After recovery, even when free from pot, liquor, and cocaine, he went on to have ""the frequency of addiction"" with sex and gambling. He even experienced the horror of having his sponsor relapse!This book is filled with so many original quotes that I can list only  my favorites here:  * A mother's food habits (and drug and alcohol consumption) will shape the future preferences of her child.  * Personal experience trumps all other information.  * I was not trying to have an experience; I was trying to recreate an experience. That is exactly what an addict seeks to do.  * I like to pray even though I don't know exactly what I'm praying to.  * Our suffering comes from an insistence that things be other than what they are. This is avoidable.  * I certainly have not given up getting high. I've had a massive overhaul in my methods of doing so... I have redefined, for myself, what it is to get ""high""...

"Dark chocolate is one of the foods with the highest (if not the highest) antioxidant level. It is the one sweet treat I indulge in almost daily. Some of the longest lived people on the planet were lovers of dark chocolate. (My criteria for ""dark"" is that it must be at least 70% cacao, or chocolate, and the higher the cacao, the lower the sugar.)

"This money belt is very practical when traveling. It is RFID-proof s that thieves can't steal your credit card info. It has two main pockets for passports, cash, credit cards, etc. The larger pocket has additional pockets inside, so things can be very organized. The back side even has a pocket. Best of all, it has ventilation so the money belt doesn't cause excessive sweating -- an issue I've had with other money belts.I travel a lot through South America. In third world countries, pickpocketing is an issue. Sometimes a person watches people at ATM machines and go for the easy target.

"When asked to review the Jolly Chef's high quality cheesecloth, I jumped at the chance.According to wiki, ""Cheesecloth is available in at least seven different grades, from open to extra-fine weave. Grades are distinguished by the number of threads per inch in each direction."" The grades vary from level 10 to level 90. So if you are straining something, this higher grade will do the job better than the lower grades.I make fermented foods so that my gut bacteria is 80% ""good bacteria."" This is for optimal immune system as well as weight control. Using this high grade cheesecloth helps me in making raw apple cider vinegar and kiefer.What I also enjoy about this cheesecloth is that it is unbleached --- no toxic bleaches are seeping into my food. It is also cotton, so no synthetic material contaminates my food.

"‚ÄúRadiant Rodney‚Äù strikes again with a fourth book, gracing us this time with brief essays downloaded from Source. These contemplations (generally about two-thirds a page each) can be read in any order, and include topics such as creativity, presence, thinking, intuition, emotions, nonattachment, genius, and even insomnia (which the author ‚Äúsuffers‚Äù from). They are intelligently and eloquently written, provoking pause, as usual for his writings.In spiritual circles there is a debate about desires: Do they continue after awakening? Do they ALL cause suffering, or only the ones that stem from lack or fear? Are desires ‚Äúbad‚Äù? Do they keep us from awakening? But aren‚Äôt desires what make the world go ‚Äòround?  I love how Rodney answers this question in one powerful sentence: ‚ÄúWith self-knowledge, you continue to have desires and inclinations‚Äîyou just are no longer attached to them.‚Äù Later in the book he confesses to have only two desires left: ‚ÄúApart from sex and Publix‚Äôs Black and White cookies, there are no real desires here.‚ÄùOver and over again in various creative ways, this master points us to the simplicity of the ultimate truth: that who we are is simply presence, awareness, eternal and unchanging. ‚ÄúThere is no awakening, no enlightenment, or no liberation. You are what you are and have always been, which is perpetual awareness.‚ÄùThank you, Rodney, for your eloquent simplicity.

"Do you believe in a benevolent God/Universe/Source? Many people CLAIM they do, yet they still cling to the fear-based concepts of most religions, like ‚Äúman is a sinner in need of a savior‚Äù or ‚Äúhellfire and brimstone for eternity.‚Äù If you can read this book with an open mind, your fears will be dissolved and you can finally trust the Universe again, seeing the method behind the madness and logic behind the insanity of this planet.The book is well-written, upbeat, and often humorous (as in, ‚ÄúLeave the past for your biographers‚Äù). Each chapter ends with a fictitious letter written in cursive from someone who has passed. (I especially liked the one that begins, ‚ÄúLordy, I‚Äôve given up trying to talk‚Äîyou just keep ignoring me. So I‚Äôve decided to write.‚Äù)The book is filled with answers to questions that it took me literally four decades to figure out on my own. I would say I resonate with at least 99% of it: questions such as, why do we reincarnate if heaven is so great? How can reincarnation be true if there are so many alive today (ie: where‚Äôd the ‚Äúnew‚Äù souls come from?) How do we manifest? Do we ever reincarnate backwards in time? Do pets have life after death? Why does life seem so unfair?It is filled with author-original one-liners, such as:‚Ä¢ Withdraw the blame and forgiveness becomes a moot point.‚Ä¢ Everyone eventually learns whatever they came to learn and returns to love.‚Ä¢ Thinking the loss of a loved one was unfortunate, ill timed, sad, or an accident is to miss the gift.‚Ä¢ The only thing that people who succeed have in common is that they dreamed of their success.‚Ä¢ You are the face of God as it‚Äôs never before been seen.‚Ä¢ Your challenges are temporary while their lessons are eternal.Highly recommended, especially for the spiritual newbie or intermediate seeker!Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor, Beyond Broccoli, Healing a Midlife Crisis on El Camino de Santiago, and Expats in Cuenca.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B5Y6YLMC5TNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945562#wasThisHelpful","R2B5Y6YLMC5TNU","A15YB0DWQ815SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YB0DWQ815SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But love is love, and when you lose what you love more than anything else in the world, that loss is devastating,‚Äù states the author. She was so upset for months that she couldn‚Äôt even watch Lifetime for Women movies‚Äîthat made me laugh, as I just love those movies myself.But the author‚Äôs conviction that her beloved Bao, a Shih Tzu, would come back to her was strong. She even told people about it. ‚ÄúMy certainty that Bao was coming back to me wasn‚Äôt a delusion or a defense mechanism. It was as real as I am.‚Äù I love how the author cites Ian Stevenson, an MD who devoted his life to proving reincarnation, using the scientific method. She gives a few examples of his work in which children recall vivid details of a former life, and have them verified. I agree with the author that animals also reincarnate. Why would it be a privilege only for one species? She cites the tradition that ‚ÄúShih Tzus in particular have a tradition of returning to live out a second life with a beloved owner.‚ÄùThe book is very well written and includes an 8-week program of simple things you can do/feel/visualize in order to encourage your own pet to come back to you.Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & PlanetandBeyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't WorkandExpats in Cuenca, Ecuador: The Magic & the MadnessandHealing a Midlife Crisis on El Camino de SantiagoandThe Quilotoa Loop: Ecuador‚Äôs Hidden Treasure","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJEHGLD67U53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497532876#wasThisHelpful","R2BJEHGLD67U53","A15YB0DWQ815SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YB0DWQ815SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The bands' length can't be adjusted, only the number of bands in use.  So this means the range of resistance is only limited ot that which is available at the fix distance between the handles.  While this may be perfectly fine for folks who are 6' and taller, for persons of shorter height, we don't get as large a range of resistance.Anyway just something to consider.  Overall though, it's a very well constructed product and it has an innovative mechanism for configuring how many bands you want to use.  It is  very easy and quick to change the configuration.  You just push up on band and unlatch both sides of the holes and then draw the band out..  To install it's the reverse.The amount of resistance offered with all three bands is incredible.  For a small person, one or two bands is more than enough for a good work out. If you are very muscular, 3 bands willl give you a very good workout.  You won't be disappoointed if your a large person.

"I'm really liking Painter.  As a long time Photoshop user, I am actually quite impressed with Corel Painter.  I have used earlier versions eons ago, and have found it met only a niche market for digital painters.  Having gone back to it after so many years, I am very impressed at the massively expanded feature set.With Painter, I have been able to do everything I have been doing on Photoshop, however I admit I have not used Photoshop to it's fullest extent, and I am doubtful any user out there users every feature Photoshop has to offer.  But I would not go as far as call Photoshop a be-all-end-all solution.  Painter as many great digital painting features that Photoshop doesn't have, but it also has an extensive featureset for photomanipulation.I wont' go into too much detail as there are plenty of reviews here that do so, so I won't repeat them.  I will say that if you're like me, a person who primarily used Photoshop's most standard features for photo-retouching, Painter is perfectly great application for it as well.  It took very little time to acclimate myself to the basic navigation and brush controls.Don't get me wrong-- I still think Photoshop is never going to stop being the industry standard for recompositing, photography, and graphic design work, but Painter puts up a very good ""fight"" and I would bet you most seasoned photographers and graphic designers not looking for a very specific exclusive Photoshop-only feature will be perfectly comfortable with Painter.But what Painter excels at is what it has always been designed for--digital painting.  While I understand many digital painters do use Photoshop, I think it has more to do with market dominance than them actually having tried Painter and preferring Photoshop for that specific application.  If you are a digital artist, I highly recommend you give Painter a try.  You might never go back to Photoshop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MS4HIZ1XNTW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C648Y#wasThisHelpful","R2MS4HIZ1XNTW0","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You don't know what you're missing until you start using the good stuff.  After just a few times using this vise, I realize how much time I wasted fiddling with the simple harbor freight drill press vise to get it in the exact position, and then locking it down with the bighorn vise clamp.  Jeez. This vise has made positioning my holes laughably simple.  Kind of want to kick myself for not doing a bit more research into what options there are.Given the sheer versatility of this vise, there is no reason anyone should ever settle for a fixed drill press vise.  If  you can't afford spending a few more dollars for this, just save up and get it.  This will pay for itself with the time and frustration you'll save repositioning that fixed drill press vise.  The x & y axis knobs are so nice.  The vise worked perfectly out of the box.  A great, high quality vise.  I have a couple of other YOST vises, and they are both excellent quality as well.

" 1:19 MinsI have a Apple silicone case installed on my iPhone 6S Plus and had no issues using this product with that  case.This will work with any iPhone case that has exposed bottom around the charge port that is at least 1 inch across.  The plug on the dock sits on a hinge which can tilt forward if needed to accommodate cases with different thicknesses.  The catch is if your case is thick, it might not slide right in. You'll have to use a finger to pull the plug forward, or tilt your device forward to line up the port with the plug, for it to go in.  In any case it's not a huge issue, and for a large majority of the folks which use thin cases, it's a non-issue.My biggest issue with this dock is that the cord is fixed permanently onto the dock.  If the cable is damaged, the entire dock has to be replaced.  I would have preferred it to accept any cable--that way you can use the exact length you need.  It's kind of silly they did that because Belkin makes a great line of MFi certified cables for the iPhone/iPad in different lengths and yet you can't use them with their own product..Anyway, overall, it's a nice looking stand and charging dock, and as long as you find a means to tuck away the excess cord, it'll look great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGA12LZ3ODH2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01645FHFC#wasThisHelpful","RGA12LZ3ODH2K","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit. I was turned off by the size of this thing.  About twice the large and 4 times heavier as my home made dust collector using an $80 Bostitch 8 gal shop vac paired with a 5 Gal bucket w/ woodcraft dust collection lid. Fortunately the footprint was the same, given this vertical setup over the side-by-side setup I had.  My DIY worked okay but now unjust laugh at it being so piddly underpowered by comparison to this Delta dust collector.I have been using this for an entire month now and I have completely ditched my DIY setup.  The Delta is such a pleasure to use. At first it felt like a luxury item in my workshop, as I was still convinced I would have gotten by just fine with my homemade setup.  But boy did it open my eyes.  Seriously effective dust collection left virtually no dust behind in and around my shopfox belt sander.  The power really does add up to exponentially better performance.  I am convinced now that it is not a luxury as it has become an essential part of my workshop equipment.Yes, the thing is very loud (87db to my iphone measurement), but not nearly as loud as the equipment I am using it with so its kind of a moot point.  I can see it being annoying but if you have smart switches on your power tools it is a non issue.  I have yet to fill the dust bag so I can't speak to how easy or mess free it will be.  But I promise to update my review once I do.  For now, I'm really loving this thing.The frame is very well built, with expert welds.  Not a single rattle or squeek to be heard.  Thanks to the wheels I was able to easily roll it around my workshop as I repeatedly changed where to best put it.Anyway I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone that wants to step up to a legit powerful dust collection system, but this is is just as much a recommendation for those folks building out their workshop.  Save yourself the trouble and get the real deal, guys. I should have gotten this thing YEARS ago.  Would have saved me many hours of sweeping and wiping my equipment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSC8XDHH7683/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146RKJRQ#wasThisHelpful","ROSC8XDHH7683","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think it would have easily handled 6lbs of meat.  The interface was intuitive and easy to use. I had no issues programming it.  The machine dried my jerky very quickly, in just under 4 hours.  The trays were surprisingly well constructed with clean welds and smoothly grinded edges, so the lack of sharp edges spared my sponges and steel wool pads when I cleaned them.  The bottom tray is a drip tray however I can swap it out with the extra drying tray provided.My jerky turned out perfect and was just awesome.  If I knew how easy it was to make beef jerky, I would have done this a long long time ago and not spend so much money on it!

"I bought this for my espresso machine to ensure I use water with the proper TDS levels for the machine to operate correctly.  It turns out the sweet ""bite"" I get from my current filtration system was gone.  I can only describe the water as now being a bit flatter, more mellow, or neutral tasting.  I guess maybe that's what ""good"" water is supposed to taste like?  I didnt' like it much.  I gradually used less and less and realize my RO water worked perfectly fine in my espresso machine without any additive.  The electronic sensor doesn't need much mineral content at all (my RO filter's TDS is 20).But over all it's not a bad product. It didn't make the water taste bad. It does alter the flavor though, for better or worse will be entirely up to you.Instructions say 2-3 drops per glass of water, so to refill my espresso machines water reservoir, I needed about about 12-14 drops of this stuff.

"I have 6 espresso machines that run off a single GFCI breaker connected to a standard unswitched.  For some reason even though I never use more than 1 machine at a time, my GFCI breaker frequently trips, regardless of the machine I'm using.  I don't know why and have not narrowed down exactly which machine  was the culprit.  I did not want to buy a separate GFCI breaker for each machine as those things aren't cheap (at least not the good ones), and furthermore it would take multiple outlets to get them all plugged in (they aren't exactly small, they usually take up 2-3 spots on a single outlet).  So this was the perfect solution.  I now run all 6 machines on this, each with their own switch. So I just switch on the one I need and it is the only one being protected by the GFCI while the rest are essentially disconnected.  So if the GFCI does trip, I'll know exactly which machine caused it, but so far the GFCI no longer trips on ANY of the machines.  If any expert out there wants to unravel this mystery for me I'd love to understand this better.Anyway, no more ruined espresso shots by tripping the GFCI during the middle of pulling a shot.  I love this thing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU71WZ7UZBNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HTQAK8#wasThisHelpful","RJU71WZ7UZBNB","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:44 Mins I chose this toy for a 4 year old (my niece) and while she loves it, I noticed she had a difficult time trying to get it to talk. Pushing didn't do it, but wrapping both her arms around and giving it a good strong squeeze finally got it to talk.  It's not a big deal as I'm sure she'll get stronger, but she is most certainly in the lower half of her growth percentile (I think? I don't have kids).It's a super cute and cuddly toy, with lots of fun details. The quality was well beyond most plush toys I have seen.  Anyway given the sound device is at the very center of the torso (the thickest part of the body), it can require a good amount of force to reach it through the batting material.  There was no way she could push on the torso to activate it.  Even for an adult it was noticeable. Also, when activating, the ""tears"" are candy-shaped glitter that shimmer inside the water-filled eyes.  The sound button is integrated with a pump bulb which forces a jet of water to agitate the ""candy"" in the eyes. The problem with this, though, is that unless the doll is squeezed hard and fast, the tears stay at the bottom of the eyes. I hope you can see what I mean in the video. It really does take some effort, and I think most kids ages 4 and 5 might not have enough strength to squeeze the doll with both hands.  And hugging it will prevent them from seeing the eyes, so it's a bit of a design flaw I think.As for the speech, they are cute phrases from the movie and not annoying loud like many toys (parents can be thankful of that!).  But unfortunately there aren't that many phrases--I think 5 or 6 different sayings/sound effects as far as I could tell.  Still it's fun for the kid and that's what matters.Anyway, overall a great gift for any kid who loves playing with plush dolls.  But again, just be aware that children in the lower (smaller) percentile might struggle to make Bing Bong talk. This was really the only real issue that you might have with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K02HAY0FXIXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE8YF9G#wasThisHelpful","R3K02HAY0FXIXH","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:40 Mins Not much to say that the video hasn't shown already.  The glaze is really nice.This stoneware tray is perfect for hors d'oeuvres but is also suitable for entrees as well.  Did I mention how much I like the glaze?  Anyway the video doesn't show how heavy it is. It's thick and feels quite heavy, not the typical lightweight ceramic that is so prone to chipping and breaking.  The glaze is very thick which is going to add to it's resilience.  It weighs 2lbs 1.6oz.One thing I should mention-- while the p[ackaging was really great (as you saw in the video), the label was secured directly onto the tray with thick globs of rubber cement.  They didn't come off cleanly and will require you to use a solvent to remove completely (ie Goo-Gone). Gorham--if you're listening-- it's not necessary.  I would have easily seen the label if you just included it by laying it on top of the plate.Anyway I hope the video was helpful.If you want to see the details high resolution, go here:http://youtu.be/_7U_n3VKw58","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VY4R6UNQBWL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKJ67S#wasThisHelpful","R2VY4R6UNQBWL9","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a relative beginner, I have started out my welding using a very cheap auto-darkening helmet (by Northern Tools).  I thought, ""helmets are helmets"", but having the opportunity to use a much higher-end helmet such as this one, I must say I am extremely impressed.  Not a single adjustment was needed during an entire session in the workshop.  I showed the helmet to some fellow artists and they all wanted to try it.  The helmets provided by the workshop weren't even auto-darkening, so I brought both helmets to loan my other one to one of the other students.Long story short, everyone took note of the brand and told me they were going to get one too.Here are some impressions I had while using the helmet:Pros:- Light yet high quality construction.- Excellent fit and comfort even after long session.- Separate modes for Grinding and Welding- Adaptive darkening offered superb clarity in all light levels at all times.- Wide viewing angleCons:- Costs several times more than other variable auto-darkening helmets.- Digital controls had a slight learning curve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8RLD64OWG4EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KW1GY4I#wasThisHelpful","R8RLD64OWG4EL","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:36 Mins I intend to give you a long-term report but I hope my video is at least helpful.  For now, here are some thoughts on the collar thus far:The collar feels about as heavy as most collars of this type, but still very light that doesn't cause any problems for the dog.  My dog is perfectly used to wearing them and this collar seemed uneventful for him.  The interface is quite easy to use (I figured it out without even havign to read the manual, although I did to ensure I understood exactly how it functions).  There are 0-9 modes.. 0 mode is training mode, and the other levels are the strength of the static.  Training mode is used when you are acclimating your dog to wearing the new device.  It only beeps and vibrates, in case the dog triggers it by accident.  Having lots of experience with collars, I've found that most of the time, it takes just beeping to train the dog.  But over time they get conditioned and will 'test' the device, when stronger correction might be needed. That's where the other modes, 1 thru 9 comes in. The higher the mode the stronger the shock. 1 is mild and 9 is described int he manual as ""super strong"".Unlike other collars that increase the correction strength, this one does not. This is actually a good thing.  I've owned past collars where the false positives cause the correction to be much stronger than it should, which punish the dog for no reason.  I much rather would have more control over the exact strength of the correction.  Lastly, there is a ""Free bark"" duration. It allows the dog to bark, and only after a certain time will kick in. This is the preferred logic. You never should try to shut your dog up completely (that would be cruel in my opinion).  But you do want to keep them from barking incessantly.Anyway I really like this collar, it feels well made and I look forward to giving you guys long term assessments every few months.UPDATE 10/20/2015:  So it's been a couple of months and Freddie and as expected Freddie is fully conditioned now to not bark when the collar is on.  In fact most of the time, I don't even need to turn it on.  As soon as I put it on he stops barking. Period  When my neighbors dogs act up, Freddie normally he barks like crazy at the door, but now the most he does is whine, which is still annoying but better than barking.  To stop his whining, I come over and console him, and move him away from the door where he hears the other dogs. Once he is reassured, he calms down and relaxes, but it takes effort.  But that's part of being a good owner.  I can't expect Freddie to improve if I don't also.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HKPTYTZCICMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9HL97O#wasThisHelpful","R2HKPTYTZCICMJ","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's amazing how good this mouse is for only $10.  It track really well, and shuts off to conserve battery. So far it does not look like it's going to run out of juice any time soon, even though I've used it approximately 14 hours a day for over a week.  The button feel good with a precise click. No gummy feel like most cheap mice.There are no soft-touch paints used on this mouse,  so you can be certain in a few years it won't look like crud.  The button above the scroll wheel changes the DPI and it is plenty fast. There are I believe four or five modes;  I use the second one from the lowest  and it covers my entire screen within a 1-1.5"" left-right tracking range.  The two plastic foot pads on the underside have alot of surface area and offer really smooth tracking on my laminate office cubical desk without any need for a mouse pad.Just overall an excellent mouse.

"UPDATE:  I marked this one star so I can capture your attention as a public notice to a hazard I (and a few other reviewers) have identified with this mat.I did not notice this before because this was in my garage however I decided to move it to my kitchen.  A few times my wife complained how slippery it was on her bare feet and I thought nothing of it, until I slipped on it and nearly hit busted my back.  Lesson: LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE! LOLThere is somethign about the surface of this mat that makes the bottom of your feet really slippery. An oil or something.  I first tried to remove it with an alcohol and soap water solution but it didn't go away once it dried.  Then used a bar of soap (Zest) on it  because I know that always leaves your skin kind of tacky.  After it dried it was a little better but within minutes it was back to being really slick.  I'm extremely disappointed in this.  While I still think it's usable so long as you wear shoes, it is quite dangerous to use with with your bare feet, especially if your feet are particularly dry.I honestly hope no one gets hurt slipping on this mat. So I just want to warn you guys of this if you're going to use it in the kitchen with bare feet to take caution.----------------------Amazingly this mat made big difference.  I am flat-footed and this mat has been a godsend folks like me.I found this mat to allow me to stand longer than my existing mats.  The mat is thicker and the upper layer is also firmer.  This extra weight and thickness of the material cups my feet better and allows me to stand longer while working at the bench.  Before I found myself shifting my feet around quite a bit because my previous mat would simply flatten as soon as I put all my weight down.  Memory foam feels good good but simply doesn't give me the support I need when standing for any significant amount of time.Anyway I also love that it is tapered to a fine edge, which seems keeps me from having to lift the mat when I'm sweeping up in the shop for debris that gets trapped underneath my previous mats.Overall, I'd say for what it is, it is quite excellent in both form and function.  I intend to buy more of them, one for each workstation I have in my workshop.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLWFHVNS18IJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PQXJUA#wasThisHelpful","RJLWFHVNS18IJ","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like everything about this hub. It has ample amounts of ports for my device-heavy needs.  And all seem to be properly detected without issue on my computer (running Windows 8.1).The only issue I discovered was when I was coping files to multiple hard disks simultaneously. One device shut disconnected automatically, leaving a file corrupted on the disk.  I realize then that the power supply provided was only 2.5Amps, which is very little considering how many devices this thing is capable of.  This is a big caveat for folks who intend to use this for doing things like testing (I'm a tester by trade) many devices, or are a hardcore power user that needs access to all of their devices constantly and/or multiple devices simultaneously.Anyway I hope I can find an after market power supply to meet my needs but that should not have been the case.

"I gave this to my little niece for her birthday yesterday and she spent the entire afternoon  playing with it. She absolutely loves it.  She loves to sing and the songs are great.  By the end of the evening she had memorized several of the songs!  What an amazing 4 year old!The product is really cute, and well thought out. the buttons are very bright and easy to press.  The volume wasn't too loud so the rest of the adults had no problem socializing at the party while the songs played literally every few minutes.  There are quite a good amount of songs in this toy, which kept her playing with it the entire afternoon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBGL38YSTJRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1O76G#wasThisHelpful","R1YBGL38YSTJRE","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've gone through many FoodSaver bag sizes, and this size is by far the most common size I reach for.  Typically I'll buy a pack of four steaks at Costco, and when I get home I use two of them and put the other two in one of these bag for the freezer.It's perfect for two small steaks or 1 very large (24oz) steak.Never had a problem with genuine FoodSaver brand bags.

"I really want to love this mouse.  Here's why:1. Even for my small hands, its profile follows the curvature of my hands quite readily.2. Lots of genuinely usable buttons.  Too many gaming mice have buttons just for the sake of having buttons however I find they are poorly laid out. The button layout on this mouse was well thought out.  Even with my small hands I had no issues accessing them.3. Design. It looks spectacular.  One of the better looking gaming mice, IMO, with the ultra cool matte black, vibrant red accents, and RBG lighting.4. DPI indicator lets you quickly know exactly which setting you're on so when you're selecting it there's no guessing like on many other mice, where it's a trial and error just to find out if you're at the lowest or highest setting.  Here you have explicit LEDs for each level of DPI.5. VERY fast mouse.  The polling rate is great and immediately noticeable as soon as I watched the cursor move across my screen.  It's so smooth, like it's rendering at 120hz6. Very cool looking, high quality braided cord.  And even better red/black color combo coincidently matched my favorite pair of Vans sneakers.7.  Instead of soft touch coating, they use a grippy texture coating for the matte black paint.So, why the low score?  What gives?!!The two issues I have with it are entirely tactile issues.First of all it feels REALLLLY cheap.  I know it's only a $45 mouse but that doesn't change this fact or how I feels in my hand, or how I feel about it. There is a hollowness about it that can only be experienced. I will try my best to explain it. It feels like cheap plastic and just looking at the red plastic you can tell it's cheap.  And every time you pick it up and set it down, there's a vibration it produces as if the internals weren't secured very well to the casing. In fact every time I pick it up and I set it down I feel the vibration of the internals reverberate through every fingertip.  Tactile sensation is extremely important with an input device, and any really good gaming mouse *just has to* feel solid.  This one doesn't, not by a long shot.  It's true what they say, you get what you pay for.But even worse, was that despite the grippy texture, the shape of the mouse makes it rather difficult to pick up without really having to squeeze the sides.  A good gaming mouse needs to be sculpted in a manner that not only feels natural, but can be gently lifted with little effort.  If you look at the front or rear profile straight-on, you will see that it see that all of the slopes with exception to the button yoke around the thumb, are sloped outward towards the table, so lifting the mouse requires some effort.  Picking any object up without some form of an under-curve means it requires you to lift up entirely with your grip rather than some of the weight resting on your hand. mice have an inward curve for this reason.  Having to actually grip the mouse to lift it is probably something I might get used to over time, but right now I feel my ring and pinky fingers sliding up on the mouse as I lift it. This has greatly impacted my performance in nearly every single game that requires rapid mouse movements which defeats the purpose of buying a gaming mouse by making me a worse player than I was.  My plan to correct this is to use Sugru to create a small ridge or overhang, if you will, along the the outermost finger contour so it 'hooks' onto my fingers, so I can lift it effortlessly.While I don't want to pay $90 for gaming mouse, the reality is you get what you pay for.  I own an Roccat Tyon gaming mouse and is as solid as ti gets, in quality (hardware AND software), features, and performance. A truly astounding piece of tech.  I cheaped out and bought this one to use for work, not really wanting to spend another $90 for the Tyon for just occasional gaming, but I realize there's really no other way around it. If you want good quality you gotta pay for it.  It is heads and shoulders above any mouse I've used, including the legendary Razer Death Adder which itself is a truly spectacular mouse, in terms of ergonomics and performance. It's the mouse I would definitely get if I wanted just a basic gaming mouse.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IEZKNCET5RR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB7L4SW#wasThisHelpful","R2IEZKNCET5RR1","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:35 Mins The biggest draw for me was the sound output as the majority of HDMI to VGA adapters available didn't support sound..  Unfortunately the only one other I was able to found (and bought) did not work well. It was a LinkS-Active adapter; while it only cost me 9 bucks the video annoyingly kept re-syncing.  It's true what they say--you get what you pay for!Anyway I bought this so I could repurpose my old VGA projector to stream Netflix in my upstairs bedroom.  It worked great!  Before I did this, I conducted tested with my old Dell VGA monitor, as you will see (or saw) in my video review.The only problem I ran into was trying to use this on my JVC TV that had a VGA port.  It didnt' work as the resolution was not supported. So it turns out that whatever video source you intend to use should also be supported by the monitor you are using.. Not all VGA displays support HD resolutions (apparently my TV didn't).  I'm not sure how common that is, but it's a caveat you should keep in mind.  This device will not scale the video signal for you. It is sends the complete HDMI source as it is designed.Anyway I hope this review was helpful!

"So, the last time I reviewed one of these was for a Norelco 9300 system (you can check out that review here: http://amzn.to/1KD6gXQ).  That one seemed to not work too well.  Strangely with all of the advances I found myself not getting a really clean shave, at least not without standing there for what seemed to be an eternity.Well along comes this Remington WetTech Rotary. Wow. What a big difference from the Norelco .  It shaved about twice as fast.  While the shave was still no where in the ball park of efficiency of a classic foil shaver (I still use my Panasonic classic shaver, over 10 years now!), it faired considerably better than the insanely expensive Norelco (MSRP@$250).  It taught me that in the world of shaving, the more bells and whistles, it seems, the worse the shaver actually is!Anyway, while my go-to shaver will still be my 10-year-old classic single foil shaver, this one is going into my gym bag, as I will use taking my sweet time in the shower after work.A week of shaving is not enough for me to give a truly accurate assessment of this razor, especially because any time you switch to a new shaver your skin needs to adjust..  So to be fair I won't give this razor a bad rating however I am required to rate this razor with a shorter timeframe than I actually need.  So I give it a four stars to start, and in about 3 months, I will provide an update on my real-world experience with this razor and update my rating if needed.From my purely empirical observations, the razor is well built, and is still running strong after an entire week. I had not recharged it since my first use, so it's really good to have high capacity razor.Keep in mind though that this battery WILL NOT LAST given it is lithium ion.  Most people don't know this but Lithium battery chemistry (all lithium batteries such as LiFeP04, LiMnO2, Li-Ag2CrO4, etc etc), while they have incredible retention, losing only 1-2% per year of inactivity,  have a limitation in that they will naturally start to degrade after 18-24 months, regardless of use, so after a few years, the battery is toast and will need replacing, whereas NiCd batteries willl remain usable so long as they are used regularly and drained completely once or twice a year).  My classic shaver is a Panasonic ES3041 and as you might have guessed, runs on nickel-cadnium battery.  So if longevity is something you care about you might consider a model with a replaceable battery (or one that runs on NiCd). These types of devices do one thing and that never changes, so you don't want to buy another one for as long as possible as the cost of electric razors has increased 5x over the last 10 years.  (My Panasonic ES3041 cost me $40 in 2005,  but the lithium version of it, ES3041K today costs $200).Anyway enough rationalization about the battery.  Moving on, it is pretty heavy but comfortable and not too heavy.  The pop-up trimmer could be a little wider. Lastly the thing, given the design of these types of disc blade razors, is very loud by comparison.I will update my  review in a few months, so check back at the end of the year if you're interested.I hope this helped.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXNC3U6PBMHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8FED5K#wasThisHelpful","R1SXNC3U6PBMHS","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is nothing special about this sleeve case.  Just a neoprene sleeve and zipper.  But it doesn't need to be special.  It works exactly as you expect it would.As for construction, it's good.  no open seams inside. My Surface pro fits perfectly inside and the thickness of the neoprene is more than enough to prevent its precious lightweight cargo from damage.It could have been a bit more snug but I think the reason they made it a little looser is for eased of opening and to minimize rubbing of the inner plate of the zipper against the device.But is it worth the $29.99 asking price? Hell no. This thing probably cost less than $1 to manufacture in China.  There are a thousand knockoffs exactly like it. In fact I would not call them knockoffs because this is probably the same item except with a brand label.If the price doesn't bother you, it's a perfectly good sleeve.

"Awesome grinder.  The burrs are ceramic white and very sharp.  While I have several travel grinders (OE Lido 2, Porlex, Hario Mini Mill), I think this compares very favorably to the Porlex. In fact the grounds are excellent. I think this would easily replace my Porlex for several reasons- first adjustment was much easier to dial in the grind than on my porlex. Second, the cap is not super tight, it was actually quite easy to remove yet tapered in a way that kept it confidently secured (on both ends).  I really do appreciate the clear window on the side.  The window isn't a necessity but a nice to have-something I appreciate greatly having used the window-less porlex.I made several pour overs at work this past week and I can say without doubt this performs just as well as any of my other grinders, Lido 2 included.Anyway for the price I think you will be quite pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AV2D80700VP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R2AV2D80700VP4","A9X2MLWQOALBW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9X2MLWQOALBW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ed and Emily were teenage sweethearts but when he wanted her to leave small hometown with him eight years ago and she wouldn't he left and never looked back.  Ed's never forgotten her though and now he's back and will do whatever it takes to get another chance with her.  There is a little problem though.  She's with someone else and is pregnant.

"Absolutely fantastic!!  I didn't think I could love characters more than Drew and Anna from book 1 in this series (The Hook Up) but was I wrong.  Gray Grayson is perfection.  Sexy, sweet, loving.  I could go on and on.  Gray and Ivy's story is filled with fun witty banter, sexy times, and just a slight bit of angst.  Ivy's put Gray firmly in the friend zone but he has no intention of stay there.  Will she be able to resist him?? Hell no!!

"This book completely blew me away! It is one of those that you consume in one sitting. There's no way your putting it down!! Fantastic writing made this fast paced story feel incredibly real. Cora's determination, dedication, and unflappable belief in her brother was amazing. Someone like her is who you want on your side. Always. From the moment Leo sees Cora he's a goner, but when he really gets to know her he knows he will never meet any else like her. The way they investigate and unravel the truth was fantastic. And now the long arduous wait for Beau's story *sigh* ok not that long but still....A great romantic suspense read that I recommend to everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DEAPYOZMUC2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWEMHFG#wasThisHelpful","R1DEAPYOZMUC2Z","A3GWE80SUGORJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GWE80SUGORJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loved this story! While it may be the typical brother's best friend trope with a twist, the excellent storytelling of the author and the great characters she created made this book a notch above the others. I could feel the conflict Andrew had between going for happiness with Jenna and the fear of losing the only family he really has. Jenna and Andrew's chemistry could be felt through the pages. There simply was no denying it and the family's reaction was perfect.

Celeste has always been happy living in the background but when her children's book character really takes off she is the spotlight whether she wants it or not. When Flynn Delaney (Celeste's teenage crush) comes back to town with his young daughter Celeste is immediately drawn to both of them. Could there be another holiday romance brewing???

Fifteen years of hard work have gotten Erik and Beryl exactly what they'd hoped for. They just always thought they would do it together but a decision all those years ago to put career ahead of love has kept them apart.

"A Love to Last is the first book in what promises to be a great new series. Set in small town Prophecy, Texas it's filled with fun, quirky characters all of which are counting on the new Prophecy bootmaker to help save the town. Delaney Shields is back in Prophecy for a quick visit with Whit Maddox then she's on her way to an around the world trip she's been planning forever. The last person she wants to see is Cal Maddox, Whit's son and the only man who has owned her heart. Cal's roots are deep in Texas soil though and no way can Delaney stay in one place for long. When Whit implies that Delaney is the next Prophecy bootmaker, all she can think about is getting out of town. NOW! A sense of duty and a strong desire for Cal has her sticking around for a while. But for how long???This is a fantastic small town romance with just a bit of magic tossed in! Great writing and characters make this one you want to read.

"I must say that until reading this book I had never heard of live action role playing (LARP). I can't say I completely understand the appeal but I at least understand the concept now, so for me this one was a bit educational! On top of learning something new, I got a fun, sexy romance with a ton of suspense and action thrown in. There's great chemistry between Carlos and Miko which has the pages sizzling! Even if your as naive as I was about the LARP world, you will still enjoy this one.

How would it feel to walk onto the set of a reality dating show you agreed to do for charity and see the one man who completely broke your heart standing there as the bachelor??

But when the producer guarantees her double the prize money win or lose, she's determined to exact a little revenge and get herself kicked off the show. Things don't work out quite as planned though....This fun, light read had me laughing out loud at Rochelle's antics. She and Grant were great together and made the book very entertaining.

"This is a cute sweet read that has a couple of science nerds that are deeply attracted to each other. However, because of their personal baggage and job situation they try fighting the attraction with everything they've got. In the end though, the heart wants what the heart wants.While there is nothing really wrong with this story, it just didn't have the tug on the heartstrings I've come to expect from one of Ophelia London's books. It left me wanting just a bit more from the story. I was impressed with the way the author talked about one of the characters dealing with depression and the overall hope that chocolate could potentially help with that issue.Again, it didn't completely work for me but for anyone who enjoys sweet reads this may be perfect for you!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VPA95UTYPPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166RDA7K#wasThisHelpful","R33VPA95UTYPPA","A3GWE80SUGORJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GWE80SUGORJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An excellent read. I definitely would consider this more a romance than a romantic suspense. While it does have a suspense element to it and the ending of the book is exciting, there's not a lot of suspense or action in the middle of the story. It's a good opposites attract story Mary Alice is a pre-school teacher living a very conservative, protected life. Bridger is an undercover cop and works his way into her life to keep an eye on her neighbor. While they are very different there is still a spark of awareness and the more time they spend together the hotter the flame. One problem!

"Can I please please please give this book more than 5 stars???? I read a lot of books every year and enjoy the vast majority. Every once in a while, I read a book that really gets in my heart and doesn't let go. This is one of those books. While I normally fall in love with the hero in the romances I read, and trust me I am crushing hard on Curran, I must say it was Tess that completely stole my heart in this one. With the life she has endured, you couldn't blame her if she were bitter, nasty, and broken. Yet she is kind, loving, and strong. It seems that they were brought together at the exact time they needed to help the other heal.This is a fantastic story that is definitely on my top 5 this year and going on my re-read shelf!!And the truly wonderful part?

"I'm really torn writing this review. I want to be fair to the author. The writing is very well done. There's great character development, nice pace to the story, and sadly I must admit the story itself is something that occurs all the time so it's definitely real. In addition to that, it definitely evoked a ton of emotions. So for all that, kudos to the author. Very well done.The story itself, however, I hated. While infidelity may occur all the time, it obviously is a real hot button for me. I tried to like these characters but in my opinion, Doug is a pig and deserves whatever heartbreak he gets. Marci I just wanted to take by the shoulders and shake. HARD! Jake, the only main character I really liked, I just wanted to give a big hug to and tell him to move on. This story for me just didn't give me the escape I look for while reading a great book. Quite frankly it just made me mad. The author did wrap the story up nicely and give me the HEA I crave but it still wasn't enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTC9XPH7X0YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1E166U#wasThisHelpful","R1PTC9XPH7X0YI","A3GWE80SUGORJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GWE80SUGORJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Each stands alone. The characters are great and the pace is perfect. Definitely a must read. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11D3DHJG2GQL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122U5A82#wasThisHelpful","R11D3DHJG2GQL0","A3GWE80SUGORJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GWE80SUGORJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A hilarious look at a young woman's journey to find satisfying sexual experience. This author's sense of humor is outrageously funny. In this her second book, Ellie is now out of school, working an unpaid internship, and sharing a flat with three of her friends. I really enjoyed her in Virgin but I found her slightly annoying in this book. While I didn't personally care for this story overall, it was extremely funny.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4JO8D9I15DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02F3Y#wasThisHelpful","RU4JO8D9I15DV","A3GWE80SUGORJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GWE80SUGORJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After spending three years in prison for a crime she wasn't guilty of you would expect Lacey to be bitter and angry but she isn't.  Well maybe a little angry but she puts it behind her.

Set in a quaint little town, the author's very descriptive writing style made to town come to life in my mind. The characters are all a bit wacky, a lot lovable, and definitely entertaining.Libby Joseph is a romance writer who has been living in White Cliff Bay for months while writing her latest book. She believes that to write about a place you really need to live there a while. While living there she has meet a lot of great people who are now truly her friends. Her best friend would be George, her zany next door neighbor. George is head over heels for Libby but lacks the confidence to ask her for more. Libby is always encouraging him to date so he convinces her to ""pretend"" date him so he can learn exactly how to do it!

"FROSH is a unique, fun look at the lives of four young people as they make their way through their first year of college. It's unique because it is written from the POV of all 4 main characters.  There's Ellie - the good girl.  Always tries to do the right thing although she may want something else entirely.  Then we have Grant the jock.  Not your typical jock though.  He's smart, determined, and not as committed to the game as some the others.  My personal fav Charlie is the geeky science guy, thrown into the frat house for his GPA and tutoring. Lastly and my least favorite, there's Devon.  The rich mean girl with a bit of a wild streak.  Or is there more to Devon then she let's people see??I really liked this one.  I found the author's writing style very enjoyable and considering this is her debut novel, I'm expecting great things in the future.  While the 4 person POV was a bit confusing in the beginning, once I got all the characters straight it worked out great!This is one I definitely recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVSYOANKT2HAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ILLTQQ#wasThisHelpful","RVSYOANKT2HAR","A3GWE80SUGORJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GWE80SUGORJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very enjoyable book filled with some of the best sounding food around, some very likable characters, some not so likable characters, and a great deal of humor. Kelly seems to have everything, a great job, a committed boyfriend, and a well planned out life. It's all just a bit....boring! When her mother passes away and leaves her a letter telling her that she needs to shake up her life a bit and a phone call comes about an amazing ghost writing opportunity in London, she takes it as a sign that she needs to go for it. This will send her on a journey that will test her patience, culinary skills, and her heart.I thought this one was very well done. While I sometimes questioned Kelly's choices, in the end she found her strength and did what was right for her. I would recommend this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27TFD0ZFUV61L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE7O82Q#wasThisHelpful","R27TFD0ZFUV61L","A3GWE80SUGORJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GWE80SUGORJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sounds crazy since it's a story filled with strip bars, murder, and the mob but the characters involved are fun and light and the humor the author writes into the story keep it very interesting.Cassidy Jones is a cop looking to move up in her career. When the opportunity to work undercover comes up, she grabs at the chance. She working as a stripper while investigating a murder that occurred at the club. She expects to find a slimy old guy as the owner, not the over the top hot Lorenzo Polonco. Since she's never been one to push her libido aside, this could be a problem! As they get closer she knows she has to find a way to solve the case and keep Lorenzo. Easier said than done!This is a great read.

"Holly and Roth are best of friends. They tell each other everything, hang out together, and agree that when it comes to relationships, it's not for either of them. Tired of all the fix-ups by well meaning family members, they agree to be each others plus one. No strings, no attachments, perfect! Until that one night....I really loved this story. Loved the interaction between Holly and Roth. The humor and closeness between the two was very believable. The evolution of their relationship was very interesting and probably more typical than we would all like to think. When communication shuts down and you start running scared nothing good can come of it.

"Be prepared... Much of this film is brutal to watch.  Although I admire his desire to 'tell' the story of his illness, this is in your face, close up, no holds barred brutal detail of parts of his treatment.  I had to turn away from the screen in a number of scenes.  Some of the scenes are haunting.Having said that, the film provides an interesting look at journalism and a larger than life personality over the years.  There's great archival footage.  I wish I could see the film again, edited to just the scenes which focus on his career, the man, and changes in the industry. As it is, I cannot see it again.If you are prepared for the stark reality of what you will see, I think you will enjoy the film.  I saw it early, and I wish I had known what to expect.

"I saw the show three times.... It was terrific, and I couldn't wait to see the film.  I was disappointed.The show has  magic.  The movie lost that magic. I mentioned to someone:  ""the show was music, music, story, music.  The movie was story, story, s...t...o...r...y, music.""  It was boring!  At least 30 minutes of the film could have been cut.  Parts simply dragged.I doubt the film will play much better if you haven't seen the show.

"Latest update:I was sitting at my desk today, and saw lots of pink flakes on the desk.  I couldn't figure out what it was until I picked up this mug.  The paint is literally FALLING OFF the bottom.  I've had the mug for about 3 weeks, used it for that length of time, and only put the bottom in the dishwasher once (top shelf).  Otherwise, I hand wash it.  Simply not acceptable.  I have mugs from Starbucks that last for years without the paint peeling.I purchased 2 more of these, since I liked the mug.  Unfortunately, the new ones are going back.I hope this helps.  (Original review, and first update follow.)*********************************Nice travel mug...It works as advertised.  Nice size, and keeps beverages hot/cold.  One downside:  small amounts of coffee settle in the drink hole in the lid.  Often, it splashes when you close the lid.  Also, the lid is tough to seat when you put it on.Otherwise, fine, and the color is beautiful. It doesn't leak.Hand wash, or the color will deteriorate.Enjoy!****** update in response to others' comments about preferring the AutoSeal by Contigo:  (Here's why I don't prefer it.)... I have multiple Contigo models, also.  I don't like the auto seal, since too much gets trapped in the ""middle space"" (in the lid.... you know what I'm talking about if you have them).  Since I drink coffee with cream, it's too easy for bacteria to brew if lids are difficult to clean.With this one, I open the lid, and put the lid in the top shelf of the dishwasher, and there's no problem with getting it clean.  It feels much safer from a bacteria standpoint.  It's much easier to clean.***************","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4V3TUHRVHRPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR77HBS#wasThisHelpful","R4V3TUHRVHRPP","A2E9C2SELN8Q68","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9C2SELN8Q68?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This actually works, and you can fill with a lot of stuffing (which surprised me).  The device is very well designed, and easy to use once you figure out which part is which.I was very surprised at the size of the indentation for filling.  I put in:  a slice and a half of cooked bacon, some sliced peppers, and small chunks of cheddar cheese.  DELICIOUS!  No leakage on my George Foreman grill.  Worked great.They are big burgers, so you might end up sharing.Here's what I did:  1/3 lb meat in the press, press to make the fill hole, stuff, switch the parts per the booklet, half of a 1/3 lb of meat on top, and press again. (Use small size chop for the filling)After I popped the burger out, I smoothed the seal with my fingers.  I cooked longer than usual, and used a meat thermometer to check that the meat was cooked through.  You'll get 2 half pound burgers from one pound.Enjoy!  It's a great tool, at a great price.

"completely addictive...and beautiful!  If you plug it in, you can hear the tinkling sound that you hear when snorkeling.  It's very relaxing.... great to plug in while working on your computer.This is a stunning game.  You build a reef including coral, living plants, ornamental rocks and plants, and most of the things produce (algae or sand dollars).  In addition, there are rare fish which produce pearls.  You have to keep them fed!The reef is beautiful, fish are cute and have personalities.  It's also educational.  You have to keep the reef healthy.  Some days there is homework, there are embedded games, and locked chests with mystery surprises inside.Really fun, interesting, and nice to look at.  One head's up:  the in app purchases can add up.  **** UPDATED **** REALLY add up!  In order to keep up with the fish feeding requirements (I can't believe I'm writing this!), you have to spend money.  I've ended up with over 400,000 sand dollars which are useless (except to add more stuff to an already overflowing reef), and not enough algae to feed the fish.  (Some fish require 20,000 algae to feed them every few days!)

I kept going, since I had borrowed it from the Kindle library, and wanted to give it a fair chance.

It is a remarkable combination of grit and touching tenderness, with constant tension between the two.If you are interested at all in writing, the writing around his relationship with a woman in a wheelchair is stunning from a number of perspectives:  the pure writing, what it says about Rain's personality, the guts and depth of character to interact with a paraplegic in such an open, caring way, and the cost of the life he's choosing to lead pitted against his relationship with this woman.

It's about moms and daughters, husbands and wives (and exes), fathers and sons, and is woven in a way that it doesn't feel contrived.  It's interesting to contemplate how a person's insertion into others' lives can change the dynamic for a family.  Also, the assumptions one can make that may have no basis in reality, yet can destroy relationships.The film is set in ""unadorned"" Paris, the acting is lovely, and the subtitles don't feel intrusive.

Each instance of the app is unique to the specific device, so it gives you different playing platforms (in other words, not in one account, since I'm playing as ""Guest"" and the app doesn't know it's me across devices).  Here's the thing:  the app crashes, or in other cases doesn't credit purchases.  I've had to call Amazon more than once, to get credits for items I've purchased from within the app.  Also, it tells me ""BINGO has stopped.

Go in and out of the app a bunch of times, and see what happens.  Redownload as a very last resort.  On the iPad:  try closing and reopening the app (without deleting it).

As I begin to work on parts of the projects, I can move the cards to 'Doing' (in process) or 'Done'. (You can change those titles, but I like them.)  You can color code cards by labels, create checklists on each card, assign due dates, share boards and cards with team members, etc.If you love white boards, you'll love this app.I was using another system which was so complex that it devolved into a simple to do list which was not helping me with larger, long term projects.

"Time has perhaps taken a tiny tick off the perfection of this for me (the ending is a bit abrupt, etc.), but basically this is still one of the best, most beautiful, most emotional, and most entertaining ‚Äòfamily‚Äô films ever made.Eschewing dialogue for large blocks of time, and then only using words sparingly, this is truly a story told in pictures; breathtaking wide shots (often tracking so fast, but so smoothly that it seems impossible) and intimate close-ups revealing subtle details of emotion.  The sequence with boy and horse making friends while trapped on an island is justifiably what people remember most, but there‚Äôs lots that‚Äôs great here, including what was probably the best performance of Mickey Rooney‚Äôs long career.And the Criterion transfer finally does justice for what was one of the best looking films of all time.  The DVDs were all downright awful.  The US version wasn't even widescreen enhanced. The 1st long awaited blu-ray was certainly a huge step up, but Criterion have really nailed it here, making this what is likely to be the definitive version for quite some time.

"A tremendously funny comedy, with Judd Apatow doing a very good job with Amy Schumer‚Äôs script ‚Äì the first time he hasn‚Äôt written one of his own films.  But Apatow and Schumer are a very good match, seeming to share senses of humor and senses of humanity, managing to mix up hysterical, low brow humor (the funniest throwing up moment since Monty Python‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Meaning of Life‚Äù), with heart and wit.  And, Apatow has managed to get some terrific performances from pro athletes, starting with LeBron James.  James‚Äô role isn‚Äôt just a cute 2 minute cameo, it‚Äôs a real , juicy supporting role, and he carries it off with aplomb.Indeed, in another trademark for an Apatow film, this is full of terrific performances, starting with Schumer‚Äôs bawdy, crazy, sexy, sharp and wildly neurotic and vulnerable Amy at the film‚Äôs center.  Bill Hader is also a delightful surprise as a sensitive, funny leading man (and how nice to have an onscreen couple who are attractive, but also look like real people ‚Äì imperfect bodies, faces that don‚Äôt come off a modeling floor.  Score one for the great majority of us).  And Tilda Swinton, Ezra Miller and a lot of other talented folk seem to be having a blast in supporting roles.The film isn‚Äôt perfect.  There are a few times when it‚Äôs humor crosses the line into forced (Marv Alpert ‚Äòsports casting‚Äô an emotional intervention seems to come from another movie ‚Äì specifically Woody Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄòBananas‚Äô, where that kind of Marx Brothers surrealistic absurdism made more sense when Howard Cosell did it).  There are certainly no surprises at all in where the story ends up going (a moment of doubt somewhere in the two hours would have been nice).  And if one looks too close, the morality is pretty surprisingly conventional ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt quite seem the feminist embrace of a woman being free to live a crazy, sexy life without it being a sign of an emotional problem one might have hoped for from Schumer.

"Unique, deeply disturbing pitch black combination of ‚ÄòLast House on the Left‚Äô type horror, darkly funny political satire, and fury at the sickness of one‚Äôs own society.  The film was said by it‚Äôs director to have been explicitly made to combat the growing nostalgia, fueled by Putin, for Soviet era Russia.Based on true events that occurred in 1984,  as the Soviet Union sank ever deeper into the Afghanistan quagmire (‚ÄòCargo 200‚Äô is the code names for bodies being brought back from the war),  this depiction of a ‚ÄòDeliverance‚Äô type grotesque family who sell illegal booze to finance their fantasy of one day creating a utopia in the middle of nowhere, and the complete psychopath of a police captain ‚Äòfriend‚Äô who protects, but ultimately turns on them, and ends up committing murder, along with rape, torture and kidnapping of a young girl who happens by ‚Äì all while being paid by the government.The slow build is handled pretty brilliantly, and we‚Äôre surprised over and over at exactly who turns out to do what ‚Äì although the feeling of doom hovers over the film from it‚Äôs first moments.  By the end of the film, the depravity is so insane, and depicted in such a matter-of-fact way, that the only reaction one can have is to laugh a terribly disturbed, uncomfortable laugh.  It‚Äôs as if Balabanov took torture porn, but turned it into pitch black comedy performance art by having it comment on the world in a bigger way (but isn‚Äôt that really what all the truly great horror films do?)Major plot questions are left unanswered, but that doesn‚Äôt feel like sloppy film-making, but rather an intentional (if frustrating) method of making us ponder what we‚Äôve just witnessed, instead of being able to walk away and forget.  Some of the acting is awkward, but there are images I that will stick with me a long time, and I have the feeling the film might grow even deeper on repeated viewings.  It isn‚Äôt often you read various critics comparing a film to both the Coen bothers and ‚ÄòSaw‚Äô, or a critic saying ‚Äòit made me want to puke, and I mean that as a high complement‚Äô, but it‚Äôs that much a one-of-a-kind film.  The cinematography is also ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô in its almost loving framing of ugliness, both human and industrial.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGB9YTC1N6OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WQNOFI#wasThisHelpful","R1IGB9YTC1N6OE","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intelligent, mostly well acted filming of the stage play, as 6 people exonerated from death row tell their true stories, mostly as monologues, against a black background.A powerful argument against the death penalty, it feels a bit stuck between embracing it's theatricality of approach, and trying to work as a more cinematic piece both in the way its shot, the occasional awkward `flashbacks' and in the `size' of the performances, which range from understated and small to quite theatrical and presentational.But whatever questions one might have about the stylistic choices, there's no question that these are powerful, important true stories in that every rarer thing, a dramatized American film that head on addresses an issue with passion and intelligence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1V3XZR83H5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2KTHTM#wasThisHelpful","R2K1V3XZR83H5T","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Actually, far from a great film in terms of technique - arbitrarily cross cutting between Lily Tomlin on stage, without costumes or sets (and oddly, also without an audience, but with over the top sound effects) and her playing the same characters in costumes and on sets (some naturalistic, some stylized).For me it was a clunky and distracting approach.However, the writing is so great and Tomlin's performance as her different characters is so memorable, so funny and so touching, that even a damaged version of this amazing one- woman show is better than none, by a long shot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFY3ZPRRKS4ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004120U6W#wasThisHelpful","RFY3ZPRRKS4ZE","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stunningly beautiful and powerful images highlight this examination of how mankind re-shapes water and how it flows ‚Äì for good and ill, more often ill - and in turn how the water re-shapes civilization and human behavior.There's no real story, just a series of visits to locations around the world where water powerfully interacts with humanity, like the pilgrimage of 30 million people to bathe in the Ganges river.Without narration and a specific focus the film could be accused of being too diffuse. But for me the raw power of the images ‚Äì Burtynsky is one of our greatest still photographers who has spent much of his career creating huge images of humans and nature clashing and interacting - give the piece a poetic, if not literal, power and solidity. The film manages to be a wake-up call about our use and abuse of water while rarely giving in to traditional lecturing. It trusts us to look into its images and interpret for ourselves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167CBWB9WR5J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K72L226#wasThisHelpful","R167CBWB9WR5J6","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Goodbye Solo' manages the near impossible feat of taking an over sentimental, almost sappy set up (a sweet young African cab driver trying to save a depressed white old man he often drives), and turns it into something delicate, touching, complex and open-ended.The acting is terrific (non-pros?) and, much like Bahrani's excellent earlier film ""Man Push Cart"", he's melded a neo-realist approach to the drama and acting with a beautifully controlled use of the camera to create beautiful images that tell a story, while working on a tiny budget.A couple of the smaller roles are weakly acted, and that hurts a bit, but doesn't keep this from being a special film. Well worth seeking out.A side note; if you are at all impressed by director Bahrani's work, I'd strongly suggest you search out his wonderful short film ""Plastic Bag"" which is viewable on YouTube, and other sites on the web (a quick Google will find it). He teamed up with the great Werner Herzog (who narrates) totell the first person story of the life of an unwanted plastic bag in a film that is visually beautiful, very funny, and very sad. One of the best, non-preachy films on ecology I've ever seen, it feels like this generation's answer to the classic short ""The Red Balloon""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B17Y138F1TN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053CBA5E#wasThisHelpful","R2B17Y138F1TN1","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fascinating, sometimes maddening mix of wonderful and silly, intelligent and dumb, insightful and obvious.At it's best it's the 'Wire' of science fiction, challenging 'Battlestar Galactica' for intelligence and emotional depth. At it's worst, it's like an OK episode of 'Lost in Space'.Generally far more intelligent than most TV sci-fi (or recent sci-fi films for that matter), with stories based more on ideas than laserbattles. In that, it's a little reminiscent of the original 'Star Trek' series.The most interesting thing; this was an early case of a series having a pre-planned multi-year arc, so throughout there are sometimes intentionally confusing or mysterious details that return to be finally explained as having great importance a season or two or three later.On the other hand, because this preceded the acceptance of truly serial cable shows, each episode is more self contained than more recent shows in a sometimes annoyingly neat way.The show is also full of allusions; Shakespeare, the Bible, Buddhism, King Arthur, the Koran. Certainly the writing is grounded in pretty heady stuff. Of course, sometimes it's dealt with in a pretty heavy handed way.The setting is a space station that's sort of an intergalactic United Nations. In season 1, some of the acting is so stiff, that it brings the series down. Also, the effects, production design, etc. all reflect a budget that's clearly way too low, giving it all an amateurish air. None-the-less, I found myself caught up in a number of the episodes, both emotionally and intellectually. One even brought tears to my eyes. And the layering in of deep mysteries to be only slowly solved gives it a sense of deeper meaning and arc.Season 2 brought in some stronger cast, and somewhat better effects. The stories in season 2 continued to be a mix, mostly quite good, a few great, and some subplots that were to be honest, dopey. But overall it remained pretty riveting, with lots of interesting allusions to historyand philosophy.  And it was great to see characters that seriously evolve as the show goes on.Season 3 was a roller coaster of good and bad episodes, with the best --suddenly making sense of obscure things from season 1 -- simplybrilliant, and other episodes just acting as filler.  And that may be the series' biggest problem. If this show could have been 12 episodesa year instead of 22, as is the case with most current serialized series, there would be a lot fewer episodes that felt lacking in substance, as if the show were just marking time.Season 4 pulled off the neat trick of having the series feel like it answered it's whole core question that gave it a reason for being, only to replace it with new story lines just as rich and strong. Again, it was episode to episode how interesting and germane the stories were.One running problem of the series, the villains tended to be a little 'Snidely Whiplash', complete with black costumes and deep scary voices.It got a little better as the series went along, but I wish the 'bad guys' were a little less cartoony.Season 5 also bumps up and down, but in the end I was quite moved by it all, and will miss this series, with it's willingness to allow tragedyto befall characters we like, and a sense of the complexities of politics and life.I personally didn't find the 'films' as strong as the regular episodes, but they do provide some good back-story and character information.I wish the was even more consistently great, but - in the end - it was more than good enough to be among the very best sci-fi series ever made.P.S. To echo what others have written here, be careful with the special features.  They sometimes have a nasty habit of acting as spoilers and giving away plot twists to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5JH9YUIWHPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQAQF1A#wasThisHelpful","R1J5JH9YUIWHPC","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a powerful and moving film, and well worth seeing, but unless you need a PAL/region 2 version, the newer Olive Films blu-ray and DVD are far better.  At least they present the film in the correct 1:85 widescreen aspect ratio, and not the 4:3 version offered in this German edition.  The picture and sound in the newer US release are stronger on all counts.I'm giving this 5 star film, 4 stars for the underwhelming presentation.As for the film itself: Given the weak reviews, I was shocked at how moving and poetic this portrait of street bums in the 30s was.  Streep and Nicholson are both magnificent, but the whole supporting cast is good.  It has flaws ‚Äì it‚Äôs a little overlong, there the occasional heavy handed moment.

"While many like Hector Babenco's brilliant, raw 'Pixote' better, I find his deeply emotional portrait of two lost souls surviving together in a South American prison cell even more riveting.The two towering performances - William Hurt's feminine gay storyteller, and Raul Julia's angry but frail (emotionally and physically) leftist are by far the best work either has done on film.The intricacies of their slowly evolving relationship are complex, powerfully moving, and sometimes disturbing,And while probably 60% of the film takes place in one room, the film never feels like a play. It's always cinematic.A special film that holds up to repeated viewings.The blu-ray is definitely a step up from the DVD, but if you only have access to a PAL DVD player, this is certainly better than nothing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CONLUPET9ZS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Z7SG7E#wasThisHelpful","R3CONLUPET9ZS7","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A sweet and entertaining film about the 35 year history of a lovable punk band.  And if that sounds full of contradictions, welcome to the odd world of The Mekons, who started in the late 1970s as art student punks who knew almost nothing about music, only to slowly integrate folk music, American country and western and other influences in with their slowly but steadily growing musicianship, and their passionate politics.They‚Äôve never gotten rich or famous, but they have put out a treasure trove of recordings full of love of music and crazily mixed up musical ideas.  These are people who are in it for the joy of playing, touring, and communicating with their passionate if limited audience, not money or adoration.  And if they‚Äôre well into middle age and still traveling around in a shabby van, that doesn‚Äôt seem to stop them from enjoying the adventure and still loving the music.  In fact, the film makes the argument that the lack of ‚Äò success‚Äô and its trappings may be what has kept them together and kept them going:  Friends making music for friends.They‚Äôre also an intelligent, articulate, funny and likable lot, full of self-deprecating humor about themselves and their accomplishments in a way we rarely think of rock musicians.  I didn‚Äôt really know the Mekons before seeing this film.  Now I like them and want to really get to know their music.  That‚Äôs a pretty good endorsement of a rock-documentary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B7SXHWELPF2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6RJ17C#wasThisHelpful","R1B7SXHWELPF2X","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Inevitably any collection of shorts, animated or otherwise will always be a bit of a mixed bag, and this set of 16 animated films, almost all under 10 minutes, is no exception.  But series curators Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeld have made some great choices, and even the least of these films, if less than stellar, show imagination and creativity.  None of them are familiar or by-the-numbers.  And the best are freakin‚Äô brilliant.Leading the pack is Hertzfeld‚Äôs own ‚ÄúEverything Will Be OK‚Äù, the longest film in the program.  In 17 minutes of mostly simple stick-figure animation, Hertzfeld takes the black comedy of death, and the sadness and lack of meaning of our day to day lives to make a film that will make you laugh, think, and even be moved.  There are more ideas, laughs and emotion in this quarter of an hour than in the vast majority of full length features.But there are plenty of highlights here, from the surreal fable ‚ÄòRabbit‚Äô that opens the program, eerily stealing imagery from ‚ÄòDick and Jane‚Äô readers to comment on greed, to the wonderfully goofy and funny abstractions of early computer games of ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù that ends it.  If you like creative and varied animation, this is well worth getting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TYHRYG7N1GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012Z36DU#wasThisHelpful","R7TYHRYG7N1GW","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A tale of passions and art thwarted and brought to life, with lovely photography, and solid performances.The charming story of two spinster sisters in a dour, religious Danish town who take in a French political refugee. After years of working for these women, with gratitude and gentleness, but little expressed emotion, the woman (Stephane Audran) uses lottery money she wins not to return to France, or to start her own life, but to create a feast, bringing back her own lost artistry as one of France's great chefs.In spite of their promise not to get swept up in the food, the locals slowly succumb to it's sublime mix of the sacred and the sensual.All of this is sweet, interesting, entertaining and well told, but for me there's also something a tiny bit thin about it. It feels like a short story stretched to feature length (which it is), and I didn't find it quite as moving emotionally as I wished. Many like it more than me, but to me it's a lovely, well-told, worthwhile film, but not quite a great one.As should be no surprise, the Criterion transfer looks great, and helps bring out the little details that are so important to the film's style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSSFKZDUBHZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEIOH9G#wasThisHelpful","R3QSSFKZDUBHZL","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fried Green TomatoesVery well acted comedy/drama about the friendship (and unspoken love) between two young women in the 1920's south.  Jessica Tandy, Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson are all terrific, and the story is sweet and entertaining.But there's something just a bit dishonest (or skittish) in the film's resolute refusal to deal with it's own homoerotic inferences, and a few too many times I could feel the film's conscious intent to push my emotional buttons in the dramatic sections.That said, still well worth seeing for the strong acting, and warm sense of time and place.Coal Miner's Daughter:An interesting and well acted mainstream bio-pic.Sissy Spacek is amazing as Loretta Lynn - all the more so for doing her own singing (as did Beverly D'Angelo as Patsy Cline). Tommy Lee Jones shows more sweet charm than he's almost ever been allowed to since.But in the end, it is indeed a Hollywood bio-pic, without any great overriding themes or ideas, except to tell the story of a fascinating woman's life one episode at a time.A solid, engrossing film, but not quite a great one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15HBUV8VCSDAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFEYJ80#wasThisHelpful","R15HBUV8VCSDAY","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The film covers the years that follow as thefather refuses to ever give up on his daughter, no matter what she hasdone, and what his loyalty costs him.This could have been sappy or melodramatic, but the acting is allbeautifully understated and real, and the background of the rise offascism and the ravages of WWII in Italy gives a larger context to thequestions of guilt, innocence, forgiveness and loyalty.A quiet film, but a strikingly memorable one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2CX5E29DY8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026QDMJ2#wasThisHelpful","R3B2CX5E29DY8G","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roger Avery approaches the material with a funny light, high energy touch, not asking us to take Brett Easton Ellis's nihilism too seriously.Consequently, a film where every character is deeply flawed and narcissistic is never boring, and often full of a visceral energy.  It even has moments where it becomes quite moving.  And most of the showy style tricks work with the excesses of the story.OK, sometimes the style is self-concious, and some elements are too familiar and on the nose (Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz as boozy moms who choose not to see how screwed up their kids are, the extra shallow treatment of the gay character. etc).While I understand how some could be repulsed, personally I think this deserved better than it got from most critics.  I enjoyed watching it, was never bored, and even made to think.A fun soundtrack and Tomandandy score too.You may love it, you may hate it, but it's inventive enough that it's worth deciding for yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROI2LA6F4B804/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OBZRJA#wasThisHelpful","ROI2LA6F4B804","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One‚Äôs reaction to this will depend totally on your reaction  to Amos‚Äô music.  I find her songs lyrically rich and musically powerful, so I really enjoyed this collection of 21 videos.The videos themselves are not generally as inventive and cinematic as those done for, say, Peter Gabriel, and indeed often seem less powerful or emotional than the songs they are visualizing.  None-the-less, I had enough of what I call ‚Äòshiver moments‚Äô ‚Äì where image and music fuse in just the right way that I can feel a palpable physical reaction ‚Äì that my overall reaction to the set was positive.I also really enjoyed Amos‚Äô commentary.  She was very articulate about what the videos meant to her thematically, and in a number of cases I found myself appreciating the videos far more after hearing her explanations.  Of course one can see that in a weakness in any art form ‚Äì we shouldn‚Äôt have to have them explained ‚Äì but, really, who cares if the ultimate effect is strong?  Certainly the video for ‚Äò1000 Oceans‚Äô took on an entirely new meaning for me after hearing the background to the concept, and went from being ‚Äòinteresting‚Äô to extraordinarily moving.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TJ2CVF7LVXSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CR7R9S#wasThisHelpful","R3TJ2CVF7LVXSQ","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well acted, especially by Jean Gabin, and there's no denying Bridget Bardot's sex appeal, although it could be argued a more gifted actress might have made both the character and the whole film deeper.A middle aged attorney (Gabin) falls for a sexy young client (Bardot) after she bungles a stick up. They carry on an open affair with her, as Gabin's wife keeps waiting for him to come home, and as Bardot keeps vacillating between her older, stable lover, and her hot, volatile young boyfriend.Never boring, but stays pretty much on the surface most of the time, with an oddly light tone. However, the ending twist is quite moving, and gives the whole film a deeper resonance than it would have otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14G977XYAIYAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005NFSA#wasThisHelpful","R14G977XYAIYAE","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This classic French film by Claude Autant-Lara has been impossible to find with English subtitles for years, so I was thrilled to finally see this version show up.  The film is a very involving melodrama about 17 year old boy having an affair with a woman in her late 20s during WW I, while her husband is away fighting the war.  The strong and relatively restrained lead performances, some inventive visual and audio techniques, and much more libertarian and realistic attitudes towards sex and passion then most films of its day out-weigh the slightly inevitable feeling to the story.  Well worth seeing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166J28AIHGL7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VKTO8A#wasThisHelpful","R166J28AIHGL7X","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting, sometimes touching movie, with a truly great performance by Max Von Sydow.  The film itself is overlong, and a bit too crowed with sub-plots that never get fully developed.  On the other hand, the intricate, specific details of the sad, Dickensian world of this Danish farm in the late 19th century feel real, harsh, and often fascinating.  The young boy playing Pelle is good, but perhaps not as great as the role calls for.  But Von Sydow is so subtle, so heartbreaking, so complex that he almost lifts this into 5 star territory just by himself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3315KPMO2S2C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPQAOIM#wasThisHelpful","R3315KPMO2S2C4","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very odd, surreal and often charming and funny, this is intentionally low tech animation of a high order,  A series of absurd, barely connected story-lines shapes this visit to a high energy stop-motion animation world, where the characters all move around just fine, thank you, regardless of the fact that they mostly have plastic bases to which their feet are welded.There‚Äôs something of old, silent film slapstick here, along with a Monty Python sense of the humor of weirdness.  On the other hand, I found it a bit hit and miss.  There were certainly many sections that I found entertaining and wonderful, but there were some lulls as well.  Some who are familiar with the film‚Äôs origins (a series of 5-10 minute shorts made for Belgian TV) felt it played better in smaller doses, and I can see that.

"A very strange. surreal, intelligent, sometimes brilliant, sometimes dull film.  The story of WW I, through British eyes, told mainly as a kind of dance hall vaudeville, intercut with far more realistic scenes of war, and laden with musical numbers that pre-figure Dennis Potter's astounding use of music of a period to comment on the action and themes in bitterly ironic ways.At times, this works amazingly well (a powerful scene of Maggie Smith‚Äôs music hall chanteuse calling boys up on stage to head off to their death) but at other times the ironies are too leaden, or go on too long.  Indeed, for me the film as a whole is overlong --  at 2 and a half hours, it feels like it could have lost 30 minutes and been a lot sharper and more powerful.  Yet, when it works it‚Äôs very good  Certainly it‚Äôs heart and head are both in the right place, even if it doesn't always live up to its very lofty ambitions.  Well worth seeing if you have any interest in Attenborough, the period, or stylistically bold and challenging films.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCJW51MM0FOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HWZ4I4#wasThisHelpful","RJCJW51MM0FOF","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fascinating 5 hour plus, 3 part film about Carlos the Jackal (although he never called himself that) the headline grabbing terrorist of the 70s and 80s.

"The story of a man (a very good performance by Charles Berling) over a 30 year period, starting at the beginning of the 20th century. It explores what matters to him -- the women in his life, his morality, and later his porcelain factory. It poses some important questions; how does one balance morality, passion and being an artist? And when is the pursuit of perfection a vice or a virtue?There are flaws; some interesting plot lines are simply dropped, and other less interesting ones get more time than they need. Isabelle Huppert, while always good is surprisingly a bit one-note, and Emmanuelle Beart can't really pull off being an old lady.But this film ultimately felt like more than the sum of its parts. By the end I felt moved and thoughtful, and it's 3 hour length, while deliberate, was never boring.Critics were very divided - some coldly dismissed it as dull and seemed angry at Assayas for betraying his earlier hipper, more energetic films (I'm just impressed by his range), while others, like me, were really taken in by the Dickensian sweep.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQ2W7C9GH0MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005A7FA#wasThisHelpful","R2RQ2W7C9GH0MI","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A pretty wonderful film of the great George Bernard Shaw play.Both Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller are terrific in the leads, and this production brings out both the fun and wit of Shaw's words, without losing the sharp, complex, and sometimes paradoxical political and social observations underneath the playful exterior.Dated in style, yes, and it could be argued Hiller is a bit older than ideal for the character's innocence. And some of the supporting performances are too stagy (although some are very good indeed).But overall this is a lot of fun, and quite thought provoking, with a nicely ambiguous ending.If you have a DVD player, it's worth getting the excellent Janus 'Essential Art House' DVD - which is the same terrific transfer as the Criterion (which owns both labels) but with fewer extras for much less money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MJBRBV8EJKDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P8VMZ4#wasThisHelpful","R3MJBRBV8EJKDL","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The look is like much later film noir, but often better (including a little Scorsese-esque fast push in), and the editing (and story structure) is very brave; from the flashback structure of the whole story, to the super fast cutting in two sequences (including the insertion on a single red frame) that makes most modern editing look safe and dull by comparison.Well worth a look for the beautiful, ahead-of-it's-time techniques alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVIG96QF2O8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DWAFPA#wasThisHelpful","R2JVIG96QF2O8M","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Coming Home especially is weak in comparison to the recent blu-ray release, with sound that is really low quality (a big problem for a film that uses music as such a key part of it's style).If you can afford it, get these classics separately on blu-ray.  If makes a much better viewing experience, and one you'll be more likely to return to.

A delicious, heartbreaking comedy that's not afraid of emotion and sadness, about the love affair between a death obsessed 19 year old, and a life obsessed 80 year old.Amazing performances by Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon, not to mention the whole supporting cast.Beautifully shot, and with transcendent use of Cat Steven's songs as score.A film I simply never tire of seeing again.IF you have a region free set up and can play blu-rays locked into region B, this is a good alternative to the Criterion release.  I found the transfer just about identical, as did most of the professional review sites - and a couple felt this might have a slight technical edge.  The biggest difference are in the extras.  The Criterion probably is a bit stronger with cut together stand alone audio comments from the now sadly gone director Hal Ashby and screenwriter Colin Higgins, along with a new on camera interview with Yusuf/Cat Stevens.  This UK Masters of Cinema release lacks those, but adds a 30 minute piece by film critic David Cairns that's pretty interesting.

By focusing each episode on an individual character, the inherent one-joke nature of each separate character became a bit more clear and frustrating.  This seemed to work better as an ensemble piece, with just enough of each version of each character's very different insanity every episode.  Still better than almost all TV comedy, and if you're a fan you'll want to have the whole four series.  But for me the 4th 'revival' season showed just how hard it is to re-capture lightening in a bottle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD8L9WLNIK0BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQYUWSG#wasThisHelpful","RD8L9WLNIK0BE","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While this still can be very funny at moments, I felt like a little something has been lost in the years between the first 3 seasons and this.To me, for the first time the series felt like it was working a bit too hard for it‚Äôs weird and wacky outrageousness, and it's brilliant self-knowing 'meta' quality now feels a bit pat.I think it may have been a major mistake to center each episode around 1 character.  These characters are wonderful, but too one note to stay with any single one for too long.  What worked so brilliantly in the original was the balance between this gallery of loonies, and that‚Äôs diminished in this new format.  Also, while the actors are as terrific as ever, the character of Michael is now more of an out-and-out jerk, and George Michael is getting there, instead of being ""nice guys with an edge"".  So there's a bit less of that human presence at the center of the show to keep the empathy up.All that said, when it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs still very funny, and if I had never seen the original seasons, this would still blow away most TV comedy, but this does show just how hard it is to re-capture lightening in a bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGDGAN9E9V3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICR6SBI#wasThisHelpful","R1MGDGAN9E9V3L","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes melodramatic, but intelligent and very well acted early 1960s U.S. TV series, that obviously served as the inspirationfor ""Law & Order"".Like ""L & O"" this is divided into 2 parts; ""Arrest"" where cop Ben Gazzara tracks down the person seemingly guilty of thatweek's crime and ""Trial"" where Chuck Connors defends them.Having the 2nd half be from the defense point-of-view, not the prosecutor's makes the show different than ""Law and Order"",and arguably more interesting. It makes blatant how much of the legal system exists in shades of grey.It's not surprising that Ben Gazzara is very, very good as cop Nick Anderson, making him more complex and interesting thanyour basic TV detective of the era. What caught me off-guard was that Connors as successful attorney John Egan, just aboutmatches him. Unlike Gazzara, Connors was never taken that seriously as an actor,. But he shows a lot here as a top notch,somewhat cynical lawyer. Beyond the two leads, the guest casts were often very strong as well.It's partly because these were 90 minutes episodes on TV, so each show runs about 75 minutes of screen time, as opposed to thestandard TV drama that runs an hour, which means about 45-60 minutes of actual story. With the extra time, the writers fleshedout the characters, both regulars and guests, much more fully than on most non-serialized dramas.So even if there are plot or logic holes (like charging a man with 1st degree murder, instead of a much more logical 2nd degree ormanslaughter, so the trial can be about the issue of ""intent"" ) it feels more like you're watching a solid, well acted B-film eachepisode, instead of an early TV series. And the series has a nice mix of dark edginess and humanism.Yes, the score can be painfully over-the-top, and some of the resolutions are too neat, but I'd still say this holds up favorably to alot of the modern U.S. character cop and/or lawyer shows of today.Sadly, the quality of the transfers leaves a lot to be desired. I read elsewhere they were transferred from old 16 mm prints, andthey do look it: washed out, full of print damage, missing opening credits. But it's nowhere near fatal to enjoying thisunusually intelligent slice of early TV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDXI2R7M5X58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014FAINO#wasThisHelpful","R2LDXI2R7M5X58","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Odd, unique, beautifully photographed character study/love story.Two eccentrics, one the rich owner of a glass-works (Cate Blanchette),and one an emotionally damaged and physically fragile young minister (Ralph Fiennes) are united in friendship, and eventually romance by their obsession with gambling.Blanchette is luminous and wonderful. Fiennes pushes at times, going right up to the edge and occasionally over it with his tics and quirks, but he's ultimately very deeply effecting.A strange mix of tones, comic, romantic; it behaves both like an epic and a parody of one.

"Inspiring on a story level, if less so on a film-making level.Two working class British activists are sued by McDonald's for a pamphlet they put out accusing McDonalds of making unhealthy foods, exploiting its workers, etc. Under the archaic British libel laws, all the burden of proof is on the defendants, and somehow these two plucky, broke (if occasionally annoyingly naÔve) nobodies fight McDonalds to a stalemate in court, while costing McDonald's millions in legal fees, and causing them an absolute PR disaster.While the story is terrific, the re-enactments, especially of the courtroom scenes are awkward, and the over simplistic idealism of some of the couples' political theory (`why can't McDonald's simply give half of it's profits to their workers?') can be a bit much to take.Still, it's good to see something that makes you realize the little guy can win now and again.

"A young man, somewhat lost, comes from Argentina to Madrid to be with his distanced, emotionally detached filmmaker father. But he ends up spending almost as much time with his dad's sexy, druggie younger mistress, (an incandescent performance by Cecilia Roth) and his dad's hedonistic, bi-sexual actor best friend.Entertaining and moving at times, the central character (the filmmaker-father) is so removed, and so hurtful it becomes hard to understand why the others continue to put up with him. It also gets a bit repetitive, as it becomes obvious that each time the father starts to open up, he'll just close down again. And it can feel very wordy.It reminded me of a pretty good Woody Allen drama. If it had more humor it might have made it even better.

"Beautifully shot by Vittorio Storaro, this is a stylish and fun Hitchcock-like thriller. (To me it feels more Hitchcock than gaillo). But I can't put this in prime Hitchcock territory, since the underlying themes are more heavy handed, and yet shallower, and less care is taken with character, acting and storytelling than by Hitchcock.There are some terrific set pieces, and lots of tension. but also logic holes big enough to drive fleets of trucks through, and acting that ranges from lifeless to over the top, and all the performances are dubbed (even the US actors post synced their voices).Historically important and clearly influential on many later directors and films (from DePalma to 'The Shining' to John Carpenter), I still can't quite see this as the masterpiece a number of critics make it out to be.

"A smashing debut from Amir Lily Amirpour.  Shot on a shoe-string in gorgeous black and white, this is funny, dead-pan, creepy, punky, sweet, sly, smart, violent, sexy, mysterious, loaded with style, and the most off-beat celebration of feminism and girl-power I may have ever seen on screen.  Great use of music too.It's a vampire story set in an alternate universe that looks like barren, poor, poverty stricken post-industrial America, but where everyone speaks Farsi, and our anti-heroine wears a chador while skateboarding through the night.  While there are a lot of genres being toyed with here (spegetti westerns come strongly to mind more than once), at heart it's an odd, sort-of love story between a feminist avenger vampire and a lost young guy who is burned out with caring for his heroin-addict father (a much older parent drug addict is only one of the many clich√© breaking elements of the story).Clearly touched by David Lynch and echoing early Jim Jarmusch (though in an interview on the disc Amirpour says with charming and very funny candor that she‚Äôs not a fan of Jarmusch), this is really exciting new cinema that may have been inspired by forerunners, but has a voice all it‚Äôs own.  For a while, I‚Äôve felt I never really needed to see another vampire film.  How many variations can there be?  Well, this proved me dead wrong.  I can‚Äôt wait for her next film!The Kino collector's edition blu-ray has a ton of terrific extras (including an entire graphic novel by Amirpour) and it looked amazing on my home screen.  Professional video review sites were split between those who flat-out loved the image, and those who see flaws.

"The last part of Andersson‚Äôs brilliant, loose ‚Äòtrilogy about being a human being‚Äô (‚ÄúSongs from the Second Floor‚Äù was the 1st part. ‚ÄúYou, The Living‚Äù the 2nd).  Although there's no need to have seen the earlier films to appreciate this one, since there's no overlap of character or even story, just style, mood and theme.This film re-visits Andersson's unique, hysterically funny and sometimes tragic world view, and his unique style.  Andersson‚Äôs camera never moves, never cuts within a scene.  He finds a great frame, and the image sits there while his sad-sack characters, usually wearing ultra-pale make up likepsychotic clowns, or silent movie comics, go through whatever bizarre silliness Andersson has devised.  The locations are never real, but are always elaborate, and frequently amazing sets, adding to the comic-nightmare feel.There are a few characters who reappear through the film, like the two desperate novelty salesmen peddling vampire fangs and a hideous ‚ÄòUncle One-Tooth‚Äô mask ‚Äòthey have great faith in‚Äô, giving off a distinctly ‚ÄòWaiting for Godot‚Äô vibe.  But there‚Äôs nothing like an overall story.  Just a series of blackly comic vignettes, that slowly add up in a generally thematic way.Andersson has a magical ability to be ‚ÄòMonty Python‚Äô level funny (or, perhaps given his slower pace ‚ÄòMonty Python‚Äô on downers), until suddenly it isn‚Äôt funny ‚Äì for a moment, or a scene ‚Äì and you realize how sad it is underneath, as Andersson shows us the cruelty that humans are capable of, especially those with money or power, and the desperation that most of the rest of us live with, before going back to his grandly comic surreal hijinks.No one else makes films like these, nor should anyone try.  This is a one-of-a-kind artist, and we should just feel lucky to have his cockeyed brilliance, holding up a funhouse mirror to ourselves and our society.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WUONA2QNK78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKBV95I#wasThisHelpful","R27WUONA2QNK78","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Powered by two towering performances by Juliette Bincoche and Kristen Stewart, Assayas tells the story of a complex and fragile relationship between an ‚Äòolder‚Äô (as in late 40s) actress and movie star. and her young assistant.  But instead of getting an art film variation on ‚ÄúAll About Eve‚Äù (and there are echoes of that classic) we get something much richer, more subtle and enigmatic about aging, art, acting, identity, youth and the complexity of relationships between women, and between employer and employee.  (It‚Äôs also all spectacularly well photographed).Maria (Binoche) is a respected and admired film star going to a festival to honor the writer-director who launched her career years earlier, casting her in a piece examining the relationship between an aggressive young woman and an older female boss who falls for her.  But the mentor dies before the festival can start, and the shaken Maria is talked into returning to the seminal project of her career, but now in a London stage production where she will play the older woman, not the younger.  This triggers all sorts of complex fears and emotions, so Maria retreats to the incredibly beautiful mountain home of her now dead mentor, bringing her young assistant Valentine (Stewart) with her to help her study and analyze the role.  In the process the two women grow closer, and share much about themselves and their world views, each challenging, supporting and at times frightening or enraging the other.The film boldly embraces the meta nature of the tale ‚Äì the relationship in the film in many ways ‚Äì but far from all ‚Äì mirroring the key relationship in the play.  While rooted in naturalism, there is a spooky sense of ambiguity always creeping around the edges of the film, the sense that anything could happen, and in the end, nothing is tied together with a neat bow.  Thankfully! There are still questions and mysteries to be pondered.The film did have a few miss-steps for me on a first viewing, some late turns that felt more forced than much of what preceded it, but with a film this rich I‚Äôm very open to the possibility I will love it even more, and those 'problems' will bother me less a second time around.  That's happened to me before with Assayas, as with Bergman and other film makers who deal as much with the mystery of human behavior as with the mechanics of plot.  And the tremendously dense work between Bincoche and Stewart is wonderful.  There is a sense of freedom in the performances, a wonderful immediacy as the two bounce off each other like ping-pong balls, that gives a sense that much of what we're seeing is semi-improvised (though I highly doubt that was actually the case).  Seeing that loose, playful, alive style in a film that on a larger level is much more formal in it‚Äôs structure and ideas creates a wonderful friction that also gives the film a terrific sense of life.  And life - and the way we change as we move through is - is ultimately what the film is all about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Y4XICSGCX0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQT3UMI#wasThisHelpful","R17Y4XICSGCX0E","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn‚Äôt quite as blown away by this as I was by Akin‚Äôs amazing debut film ‚ÄúAfter the Triumph of Your Birth‚Äù, but I still quite liked it.  It stayed with me in the days after I saw it, and I look forward to seeing it again.  Akin has a great eye for images, a good touch with actors, a strong ear for music (in collaboration with his wildly talented wife, singer/songwriter Maria McKee), and - most important - a unique voice as a film-maker.  We‚Äôve all seen too many coming-of-age films, but this one feels different, fresh, poetic, oddball and honest enough that it rarely feels like ‚Äòwe‚Äôve been here before‚Äô.A very bright 12 year old girl (Moriah Blonna) lives with her charming, often sweet and funny, but also self-involved and self-destructive surf-bum dad (Tom Donne) on the edge of the human sideshow that is Venice beach.  The key woman in their lives ‚Äì his wife, her mother ‚Äì died 2 years ago, leaving a gaping hole that she‚Äôs too young to fully grapple with, and he‚Äôs too damaged to really repair.  So he hides behind booze and women, and she prowls the beach and has visions of her mother, in search of answers and meaning, trying to figure out how to grow up without any truly functional parents. But if that sounds depressing, know that the film keeps alive a rueful sense of humor and an off beat sense of poetry - visual and structural - amidst the emotional challenges.The story is essentially a series of set pieces, and some work better than others.  There are moments that feel too self-conscious, or heavy handed.  But for every one of those, there are several lovely poetic moments where Akin captures the ephemeral simultaneous wonder and terror of growing up in a crazy, beautiful but difficult world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L0GWIEG5WEBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAVQN7C#wasThisHelpful","R2L0GWIEG5WEBZ","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strong HBO film based on a Walter Mosley book, featuring a great central performance by Lawrence Fishburne.While it has a some Hollywood moments and touches, this is mostly pretty uncompromised stuff.  An ex-con with an angry temper tries to find meaning for his life in the tough streets of South Central Los Angeles.Uplifting, but not in a trite, easy, or morally simple way.Very different, and more gritty than most of the (often very good) fiction director Michael Apted has done before.

"Terrifically acted by an amazing cast - Laurence Olivier, Alan Bates, Malcolm McDowell, and Helen Mirren - this is a fun, creepy and disturbing adaptation of the Harold Pinter play.Not really opened up for TV (it was made for the BBC), more a photographed play. But the writing and acting are so delicious that the rough edged style doesn't matter, as we slowly piece together what did or didn't go on between McDowell and Mirren when they happened to meet at an hotel out of town, and the repercussions on their relationships at home; McDowell with Olivier, Mirren with Bates.A must for any fan of Pinter's or the cast.Note: This edition is a region 2 disc from the U.K., so you will need a region free player to be able to watch it.  There was a region 1 (US) DVD of this released, as part of 'The Laurence Olivier Collection' with both this play and Olivier as 'Big Daddy' in 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' that can play on regular U.S. players.  It can, however, be very hard to find as a separate disc, and not part of the big box set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKDABNF9VRWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QXZ81Q#wasThisHelpful","R3RKDABNF9VRWZ","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It may well be my failing, but I continue to struggle with Antonioni. I appreciate the genius of his photography and framing, and his bravery; L‚ÄôEclisse ends with a poetic 5 minute wordless montage unconnected to the characters that elevates the film to another level.  But the ideas continue to feel heavy handed and overstated, the lack of plot substituted for by repeated, if deserved, blasts at our (then) modern world; capitalism, racism, colonialism, and the ennui and alienation of a young upper-class generation that doesn‚Äôt seem to know what to do to help themselves much less the world around them, including being unable to truly love deeply.  These are valuable and important statements, but next to the subtle poetry of the photography they (to me) feel ham-fisted and very repetitive.  I feel like I ‚Äòget‚Äô what Anotononi is saying here very quickly, and then it starts to become a slide-show of amazing images.Less mysterious, less surreal than L‚ÄôAventura, so there‚Äôs less a sense that one is missing layers.  A woman leaves her fianc√©, falls for a shallow young stockbroker, and we see that everyone cares more about money and ‚Äòthings‚Äô than human relationships.  The scenes in the stock exchange are amazingly shot, and every frame uses architecture and framing to underline the themes of alienation and the emptiness of modern life.  Monica Vitti and Alain Delon make the two leads more human and real than earlier Antonioni leads.  But a number of scenes just feel clunky.  That said, the experimental last five minutes, which puts the themes in a wider, more global context, is very moving and special.I'm in a minority in having these reservations, so take them with a grain of salt.  The majority of critics and film-lovers feel this is a masterpiece, though it‚Äôs far more divided than the near universal embrace of L‚ÄôAventura.Criterion's blu-ray is a clear step up from their quite good older DVD.  A gorgeous transfer","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2H6UMJCHTMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2PQZRQ#wasThisHelpful","RT2H6UMJCHTMK","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Challenging, complex and emotionally subtle, this grew considerably for me on 2nd viewing.  Indeed, I felt perhaps the most ‚Äòinside‚Äô an Antonioni film I ever had.  For one of the first times, I felt the film-maker speak to my head and heart simultaneously.  Thus I found it more accessible (not necessarily ‚Äòbetter‚Äô, but more emotional as an experience), than the other Antonioni  films it‚Äôs often paired with in the so-called ‚Äòalienation trilogy‚Äô: L‚ÄôAvventura and L‚ÄôEclisse.One thing it has over L‚ÄôAvventura for me, is a whole other level of performances (from Marcello Mastroianni, Jeanne Moreau, and Monica Vitti) that deeply illuminate, rather than just one-dimensionally sketch the pain of the loss or absence of a sense of reason for being.It‚Äôs a powerful, if quiet portrait of a bourgeois marriage crumbling, watched during one afternoon and night as the couple visit a dying friend in the hospital, attend a book signing for the husband‚Äôs new novel, stop at a nightclub where they barely react to an erotic floor show, and then head to a party for a rich industrialist to celebrate the first win by his new racehorse,.  He no longer even identifies with his own writing, feeling it‚Äôs just a product, like that made by the industrialist.  He‚Äôs even lost his sense of lust.  She no longer feels love for him, and seems locked in depression. It‚Äôs a tough movie to take, grim, mostly humorless (with moments of the black humor of self-loathing) feeling at times almost as numb as its leads, but that is indeed the point.  The images (of course) are striking and memorable, as are the performances, both capturing the strong, tangible sense sad gloom that hovers over this world of bereft people who seem on the surface to have it all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H0AQTWGIAUGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZP1C3Q#wasThisHelpful","R3H0AQTWGIAUGF","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A film I need to see again, and wouldn't be surprised to love more on repeated viewings. I appreciate Antonioni's magnificent framing and images, his bravery with unconventional plotting; (e.g. having his true 'main character' disappear 10 minutes in). It's legendarily slow pace didn't bother me at all, but I did find the insights into the characters, how empty and desperate they are somewhat repetitive over time. I'll admit to moments of feeling 'yeah, I got it already'.Antonioni brilliantly uses lonely landscapes to show how isolated these people are. But some of the performances didn't thrill me (there's a key difference between playing a shallow character and being a shallow actor, and it sometimes seems confused here).It stayed a very intellectual experience - an essay about the lack of humanity in the upper classes beautifully illustrated. But it seemed so removed and exaggerated, even from my own comfy existence, that I found I wasn't moved on a deeper level.That said, all these same criticisms could be aimed at 'Barry Lyndon', a film I have come to love deeply on repeated viewings.

"I quite like ""Sauna"" and would love to see it in blu-ray, but doing some research on line seems to indicate that this German release does not have English subtitles, only German.  So, buyer beware.Strikingly beautiful Finnish art house 'horror' film about guilt, religion, sin and punishment, set in the 16th century, at the end of the Russian/Swedish war.It's full of atmosphere, symbolism, and unanswered questions. Two Swedish brothers/soldiers -- one intellectual, the other violent and borderline mad -- come to a strange town where they are confronted with eerie reminders of their sins, and of those they have killed in war.Slow paced, but not boring. However, the underlying ideas do get stretched a bit thin over time, and the occasional turn to horror clich√©s was a little disappointing given the generally high level of intelligence and originality.Mention also must be made of the arresting performance by Ville Virtanen as the violent Eerik, recalling Max Von Sydow in his prime.Interesting enough that I would give it another look now that I understand what its getting at, and gorgeous enough that I'll stillenjoy it, even if I'm once again left with mixed feelings about some of the content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SOUOQZF1BMJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8G444S#wasThisHelpful","R1SOUOQZF1BMJK","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps the most emotional of Angelopoulos' films so far. While it occasionally flirts with melodrama, it's ultimately heartbreaking while losing none of the film-maker's usual formal rigor and visual beauty. A couple try to find a way to stay together in the face of wars, both civil and international, as well as fighting small town prejudice and rejection. Not an easy film, and some of the history may be confusing unless you happen to be up on the history of Greece in the 20th century (I'll admit I'm not), but very worth the time and effort.As with most of Angelopoulos' films, the edition you want to find is the Greek 'New Star' release (it has english subtitles).

"Note: This review is for ""Eternity And a Day"" by the great Greek film-maker Theo Angelopoulos.  That's the film pictured here (look closely at the image).  I have no idea why Amazon has this listed as directed by Ole Bornedal. So, buyer beware something is off - the picture or the listing.The most Bergmanesque of Angolopoulos's films. Simpler and less epic than most of his work, with fewer of his trademark breathtaking images and grand themes. Yet this story of a dying writer spending his last day before entering the hospital -- never to leave -- has a deeply elegiac melancholy, and his attempts to find meaning by saving an Albanian street urchin are often moving, if occasionally sappy. The same is true of Bruno Ganz' (unfortunately dubbed) relationship with his wife and family, told mainly in flashback. Much is moving, some is hokey and forced. But Ageloupolus' use of images to make film a poetic medium is always worth watching, even when flawed.The Greek 'New Star' disc, only available a short while, was supervised by Angelopoulos, and is an improvement over the other available discs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19V9G2P27GLRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWGU68G#wasThisHelpful","R19V9G2P27GLRQ","AKS9SJTHTU0OM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKS9SJTHTU0OM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I seem to have the same reaction to each of Angelopoulos' films; flawed genius. But in each film, what feels flawed and what feels masterful is different.Mild spoilers ahead...In this story of a 12 year old girl and her younger brother on a fruitless journey for their non- existent father in Germany what works is the ultimate emotional impact of the piece (it left me in tears), and (as always) the sheer poetic power of some of Angelopoulos' images.On the other hand, a key supporting character (the youthful actor Oresteis) is thinly written and exists basically as an overly-convenient plot point. Some of the dialogue and ideas feel heavy handed, and some images are lifted from other director's films. And the references to his own earlier film 'The Traveling Players' are an interesting, brave style choice, but also a bit distracting and intellectual. The young girl's acting is mostly terrific, but the young boy feels fake at times, which doesn't help.There are scenes I'll never forget. Maybe the most disturbing (yet completely hidden) rape scene I've ever seen. But other scenes feel awkward or forced.This is the kind of film that may grow on revisiting, and I certainly plan to see it again.If possible, get your hands on this now out-of-print 'New Star' DVD.

"This book is a tough read; I‚Äôm not going to lie. I spend a lot of time with textbooks and I have struggled a bit with it over time.  The main issue is that the religions are presented within one chapter, then the corresponding psychological theories are presented in the following chapter with theorists.  If these things were presented side by side, the format might be a bit easier to handle/read.  Otherwise, it is akin to reading a philosophy textbook where you have to keep stopping and drawing parallels with the information, taking good notes, and graphing on one‚Äôs own.  The content is great, but just know that it is on a big higher of a reading level. Chances are you‚Äôre reading this for class, so it is probably better to get the non-Kindle version so that you can annotate it as you read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEWKFZ0B1AES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RIU45I#wasThisHelpful","R3AEWKFZ0B1AES","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this scale.  I have a Weight Watchers scale as well that cost a lot more than this scale.  I went ahead and weighed and measured a number of items side by side with this scale and found that it was almost spot on in terms of the accuracy of the weight.  This is a really easy scale to open, use, and figure out the functions.  Sometimes I can struggle with figuring out scales and gadgets, but this one was very intuitive to me to use.  That‚Äôs a huge plus.Another reviewer mentioned it, and I will mention it again, the only issue with the scale is going to be the surface/counter space it takes up.  The Weight Watchers scale I have has a bit less of a surface area, but this one is a bit bigger, as a result, you do have to be mindful of where to store it.  As Angela C mentioned in her review, it‚Äôs a lot easier to just put it on top of the fridge because you do not want to store anything on it or put it on its side.To wrap-up; it‚Äôs a really good and high quality scale.  Thinking about what this scale does in comparison to a scale that cost twice as much as it, I can‚Äôt complain.

Okay, now that that‚Äôs out of the way, this is an excellent product that I‚Äôm pretty in love with; it meets all the needs that I have with regards to providing the USB charging ports.  That‚Äôs really useful, and, honestly it‚Äôs the main function that a lot of the plugs are used for in my class room; charging cell phones.  So, this product gives space to do both of those things.  Man, but the AC ports, those are so annoying.  Figure that you can only use about half of them at any given time because of the spacing of the plugs.

"I received this transmitter in exchange for an unbiased review.  I admit, when I got it, I kind of stared at it for a bit trying to figure out how to use it.  However, when I broke it open and realized its functionality, I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly.  I‚Äôve mostly played with it using my cell phone and Amazon player to a Bose speaker I have.I also use Dragon Speak a lot and have a pair of Bluetooth microphones that I use with it.  I‚Äôve used it and have found that the distance for the microphones has increased significantly, as well as the distance to hear the microphones with audio playback.  However, there is degradation in the quality of how Dragon Speak reads my voice and there a lot more errors in the typing.

"I like door stoppers, I have a dog who acts like a teenager and slams doors.  I‚Äôve used a variety of door stoppers and often just go with the cheap rubber.  Sometimes my dog will eat those, so having this level of quality in a door stopper is both foreign and nice to me. This is a really solid door stop and does a great job of holding its location and works especially well for solid doors or those that may have a large rise.There‚Äôs just things that I don‚Äôt really get though‚Ä¶.mostly about the design.  The rubber portion is not adhered to the door stop itself, so it can easily become askew; mind arrived this way and I was able to push the rubber back into place, but if you‚Äôre someone who is bothered by unequal lines or the potential for them to get off, that is something to mention.  They especially go askew when you‚Äôre trying to un-prop it with your foot.  The other aspect is that the mental thing is kind of sharp; it‚Äôs the half-moon on the edge.  I bent mine up so it doesn‚Äôt just out as much as it does in the pictures, but rather faces straight up.  It‚Äôs handy in that you don‚Äôt have to bend down as far to get out the door stop, but at the same time, if you‚Äôre barefoot and not noticing it, it can whack/cut you pretty good ÔÉü personal experience.  There was blood.  It would be super, as a future improvement, possibly to put some rubber on that portion.It‚Äôs a really high quality door stopper and it is best for an office environment.

"I have fat hands and my hands fit in these without a problem.  ÔÉüif you‚Äôre like me and you care about that, I just wanted to give you that little bit in the review.  If you don‚Äôt have larger hands, these are still pretty functional because they won‚Äôt slide right off your hands. Oh wait, I actually just read information on these; they actually are designed not slip off your hands.  Humm, I could see that functionality.I‚Äôve enjoyed these gloves a whole lot.  I admit, I was a big skeptical about using them.  I first ran hot water and tried to determine if I could feel the ‚Äúheat‚Äù on my hands before braving an oven.  I realized that I was only feeling the pressure and not the heat itself, so moved onto the oven items.  I was really surprised, nothing.  I took out a tray of cookies and felt no heat on my hand; that‚Äôs pretty nice.  I mean, these do exactly what they say they are going to do.The only thing that should be noted is that they do not ‚Äúdisperse‚Äù heat.  So, when I went to take off the gloves, right after taking out the cookies, my gloves were very hot to the touch.

"I‚Äôve been very happy with this item.  Every time I travel, I tend to stay in at least one hotel that does not have enough outlets for my computer, monitor, and cell phone (yes, I travel with a monitor).  I also travel with a keyboard and mouse that all need to be charged on occasion.  This is actually a product that resolves that issue for me.As other people have noted, the winding of the cord seems a bit off, in some ways it makes seem as though it is more bulky than it needs to be.  However, I have found that when it is wrapped, it stores easily enough without issue.  There is also the element of the charging speeds associated with it, as they are a bit slower.  I have found it useful because I tend to leave the items aforementioned overnight.Here‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs the price.

"These have been a really good value; they‚Äôre relatively inexpensive and they provide a decent amount of light.  I will be forthright, if they are in an area that you frequent a lot and the pattern might annoy you, well then, look at the pictures and determine if the light spread/pattern is one that you are comfortable with; I have some moments where it really bothers me.  When these arrived, we put them out for a day, but it was overcast, so the use at night was minimal.  The next day there was more sunshine, so it worked pretty well.  I‚Äôve had these for a few weeks and I‚Äôve noticed that they are not as bright and the charge does not last as long.  My guess is because of the winter months and shorter days, but at the same time, I feel if it is getting direct sunlight, even for six hours it should be doing well enough.  I have found, compared to our other solar lights, the charge isn‚Äôt as long in general for dispersing light out.

"What‚Äôs really neat about this product is that it gives you things that you may not think about needing or thinking about with regards to the GoPro.

"I admit, I haven‚Äôt really watched a lot of stuff with Leah Remini, I‚Äôm familiar with her from King of Queens, but that is about it.  My mother has indicated that she has been on a lot of the talk shows lately talking about this book.  I picked it up mostly for the insight into Scientology.  I was not disappointed, but in the process of learning a bit more about scientology, there were some really interesting insights into her childhood, as well as her experiences getting into show businesses.This is a very quick read and it starts off right away by jumping into the issue of Scientology, so, if that is the reason why you are picking up the book, I recommend it for that aspect.  I think that it is also useful to get the perspective of someone who is brought into Scientology through their family and it discusses how the appeal of the organization somewhat lured her mother into the organization and kept her persisting in it as an adult.  It‚Äôs actually a really good insight/manual into understanding psychological aspect of cults, even if it is unintentional, it provides a personal aspect to one‚Äôs reflection on the process.It actually kind of highlights an abusive relationship with the organization, one in which a person stays even when it‚Äôs clear it might not be the healthiest relationship.  Think riding a boat to the middle of nowhere and getting dumped in the water.  However, these things are told in personal narratives, which Leah at no point is trying to label or, but just tell a story.  At the same time, there are a lot of rewards that are highlighted for being a member of Scientology, especially in terms of networking within the Hollywood circles.It is also interesting to see how the fall-out and consequences for breaking with the church comes to light, in particular, Leah outlines her own humanity, pointing out areas in her life where she has messed up at the very start of the book, essentially expected to get sued by Scientology.  In reading about the processes of other people and herself, there seems to be a strong leaning towards lawsuits by Scientology (which, many are aware of).  Leah mostly keeps the story within the framework of her time directly in Scientology, with the final 10% (Kindle version) highlighting her time outside of the church and just how emotionally and socially devastating it was to her initially.Great read.  Especially for those who are interested in Scientology.  I think that the detail and first person account does a good job of at least tying it down to one person and their personal experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C5A52TTYA1WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BCX0JY#wasThisHelpful","R3C5A52TTYA1WZ","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As of right now it has been in heavy use for the last two weeks and has held up very well.The only complaint that emerges is based on how the jump is being used.  The foam handles are really nice, especially if you‚Äôre working out and generate a huge sweat.  However, they clearly need to be kept for personal use, as they are porous and hard to clean.  The foam has held up well with the heavy use, but it also shows wear, so it is something that clearly does have a life expectancy on it.  It can also capture a sweat smell over time as well.The rope itself is nice because it does not scuff or mark up the polished floor, which some ropes do.  The cord itself also is not that hurtful if you miss the jump and end up whacking yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31PLDRWND85DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147WO3M2#wasThisHelpful","R31PLDRWND85DF","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I became a fan of RFID blocking sleeves after my sister had her credit card information stole multiple times while traveling to London.  It seemed that her cards were picked up in Heathrow pretty much as soon as she landed and by the time she‚Äôd check into the hotel there would already be charges on her card.I started getting in the habit of using RFID blocking because I had had a lot of my cards switched over to RFID/chips lately due to security elements with my cards.  I also have a card with an RFID that I use for access to my building at work.  I have had these card holders for about three weeks now and I‚Äôve been really satisfied.  First off, I have kept one in my flip wallet, which is relatively thin, and have had no problems with the durability of the RFID blocking card so far.  It has proven very durable, even after I have sat on it and pulled it in and out multiple times.  I guess my only argument might be a more neutral appearance in some of the covers.I have an access card for my office that requires the reader to use RFID to open the door.  I went through all the sleeves that were given me and tried to see if it blocked the signal.  Sure enough, it did.  In my mind, that‚Äôs proof positive it works.  Without the sleeve, the RFID can read on the door scanner through my wallet (meaning I fold it in and it‚Äôs on the other side and inside of it).  It was nice to see that the sleeve was able to block this signal, even though it is able to make short work of going through about an inch of wallet.I was given a coupon in exchange for an unbiased review for these products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6U5JYNM4PEU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R7K4CO#wasThisHelpful","R6U5JYNM4PEU9","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these and played with them, I admit, I‚Äôm pretty impressed.  I don‚Äôt really go camping, but I was offered some of these in exchange for an unbiased review.  They‚Äôre really light and thin, initially giving the perception that they are not durable at all.  However, we took out one (by we I mean me and a few teachers, one of whom is responsible for the outdoor club).  After playing with them and being unable to tear them, we finally were able to break through after holding it taunt and using a car key.  Admit it, that‚Äôs a pretty good threshold for this type of product and we were intentionally trying to get it through.The item comes with a bag, so theoretically you can re-use them, but they‚Äôll neve return to their once happy home of the plastic holding bag.

"So, I got this a while ago, it was given to me in exchange for an unbiased review.  I wanted to wait and see how it worked out before saying anything about it.  We have hard water at our home and it causes a lot of calcium build-up on our showerheads, making it so that we need to soak them at least once a month, or replace them all together.  In the case of this shower head, that never became an issue.  I could see the calcium build up, but it continued being a working showerhead even with those elements.I admit, when I first got this product I was a little disappointed.  It seemed to me pretty light weight and I was worried about its quality since the feel didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúelegant.‚Äù I realized that once I installed it, it was just as functional as my last shower head, and held up well to being smacked against the tiles in the shower a few times.

"This is a good tape, I‚Äôm a teacher and I work in a climate that is very humid.  I gave it three stars for a few reasons.  The first is that it held up well, for a little bit, but over time, it lost its hold in the humid climate.  Those work along the Gulf Coast know what I‚Äôm talking about, the special answer outside of push pins still hasn‚Äôt come yet.  The portion of the tape that did adhere to the wall stayed on that wall, and never wanted to come down.  I finally had to pull in a flat head screwdriver to get it off.  In my mind, this is a good quality when both sides are adhering, but not a good quality when it is on the wall.I think that I have to put into perspective that this tape lasted MUCH longer than anything I normally put up on the walls, it really took a really humid day and about two weeks into using it for it to finally give up on me.  Short term projects, this would be great.

I almost fell out of my chair when I realized how much I was getting charged for one band.  Feelily has been offering some pretty cool designs for a fraction of the price.  This was no different.

"I got these blades earlier in the week; I was offered a coupon in exchange for an unbiased review.  These came right before it stormed a lot in Houston, so it was actually perfect timing because I was able to go through and trip up some branches that broken and some that were hanging low because of the moisture.Overall these are a nice set of pruning shears.  I found that they were pretty rugged in going through and cutting quite a bit in one day, I can‚Äôt say that I saw diminished quality, even after using them for a number of hours and then returning to them later in the day.These are just straight forward pruning shears.  There are no special bells and whistles associated with them.  It should be noted that the 6.7 inches is referring to the length of the entire product, the blade itself is probably 3 inches or so, which may minimize the overall use of them outside of straight pruning and minimal advancement to some of the thicker branches.  When I was getting into the body of my Ruby Reds I found that it was a bit harder to get the shear through some of the inner stalks.  However, the shortness of this product gives the person who is clipping more control over the product, which I did like in being a bit more precise, especially as I was reaching in with the product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7SOAY4M0GEYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGEAO2S#wasThisHelpful","R7SOAY4M0GEYB","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôm in love with this item.  Sometimes I‚Äôm asked to review items for a free sample that are crap, on the rare occasion I get something that is really high quality, I want to praise it as much as possible, and this is one of those times.  I have a medium sized Webber grill that I have been bad about taking care of it, I was actually debating about whether or not to get a new one instead of dealing with the mess that was on the grill of the grill.  Then this arrived, and well, it was magic.  MAGIC.  No, really, I‚Äôm not exaggerating.  This is a heavy duty brush that is wonderful getting your grill clean, especially if you‚Äôve been bad about TLC.  About a month ago I had soaked my grill in some rust/lime away solution and it had no impact.  I used this once and I found that my grill looks stainless again.I started the grill and let it heat up, with the flame pretty high, I went ahead and used this brush because it‚Äôs long enough to reach the grill without burning off my hand or losing my knuckle hair.  Right away I saw a difference, this thing is heavy duty, and there was no melted plastic from the handle, the brush kept its form throughout.  At one point I stopped cleaning, walked away with the brush and realized that it was steaming; it was because I had had it on the heat for so long.  It still worked great and kept its form (I‚Äôm probably not supposed to do that, but whatever).I also looked at it closely afterwards (when it cooled off) and none of the bristles were out of whack.  I mean, I was really scrubbing away.  I found that it actually worked great in getting the grease, rust, and grime off of all sides of the grill grate.  I could use it in any direction without hassle and the brush is firm and big enough not to get stuck while cleaning and pull up the grill.The bag that it comes in is nice, I caution though, you put it in brush side first.  If you‚Äôre an idiot like me and put it in with the brush side up (facing opening), it‚Äôs a pain to get out of the bag.  Also, it‚Äôs sharp.  I poked myself a lot on it, trying to get it out of the bag, so much so, I drew blood.  However, that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an idiot.  If the bag was maybe a smidgen wider it would have helped me out.This also comes with a little plastic brush, but‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt hold any BBQ sauce on it really and it‚Äôs more of a throw-in, added bonus thing.  The brush, by itself, is pretty epic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JBXR7GYNPFE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BGJ9PQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JBXR7GYNPFE7","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first received this product, I kind of thought that they were gaudy; that was just when I took it out of the package and then left them on the counter.  One thing I did notice is that the petals on the leaves were soft, like really soft, almost like a suede to touch.  I would always rub the petals every time I walked by them on the counter.  Prior to being able to try the lights out, I had a friend who asked me if she could have them, she had some grandchildren who loved things like the lights.  Sure enough, I gave them to her with the directive to report back.I received a lot of pictures, A LOT, but I don‚Äôt want to post without her permission.  Essentially, the kids fell in love with them and have them over their bed.  In the pictures they look really nice and when illuminated give off a really nice glow.

"I was really excited to receive this item, I‚Äôm one of those people that absolutely LOVES duffle bags.  I opened it up and thought to myself that the material seemed a bit flimsy; kind of the duffle bags/backpacks I remembered as a kid that often tore easily without any books in the backpack.  When I was un-packing the bag, unfolding it out of the container, I right away noticed that there was light coming in from one of the corners.  I played around with it a bit and had some textbooks I was going to put in it, but then realized that that would not be a good fit, rather it is a larger size and with the durability in question, I would use it later for some towels that I had.  I proceeded to wrap back up the pouch, and as I was trying to put it back together and zip it back together, I immediately noticed that the zipper was small, but worse yet, the zipper to make it back into a pouch broke immediately.  I didn‚Äôt even do anything with the product and it was already broken; so much for that function.  I can still use it as a duffle bag for some towels, and I can write back after I do that, but the whole purpose of its novelty broke very easily without much/any force.Disclaimer; I was provided a product coupon for an unbiased review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UNAKXTRKMKD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BHSJ4O#wasThisHelpful","R1UNAKXTRKMKD3","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I discovered UAG cases after I got a Note Edge 4 because UAG was the only company that was selling for that particular design.  I just traded in my Note Edge and walked out with a Note 5.  Once again, UAG has risen to the top in terms of the case that I love to use.I wrote a review about the Note Edge Case and it got me on their sample list, so, I actually received this case free from UAG in exchange for a review.  I mention this (well, to be honest), but also because I do A LOT of Amazon reviews.  The #1 thing I‚Äôm asked to always review are cell phone cases.  As soon as I get done looking and playing with those cases for a few hours or a few days, I always go back to the UAG case, I just feel safer using it because of how sturdy it is and I‚Äôve seen it hold up already, like other times, I‚Äôve dropped my phone and accidently boot kicked it into a wall; no problems, phone held up great, no scratches or anything.The other thing that I love about this case is that it doesn‚Äôt change it shape in the heat.  I‚Äôm in Texas, where it gets REALLY hot in my car.  I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of cell phone cases will slip their shape in the heat, but this one never does.  It stays firmly on my cell and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it coming off.  I‚Äôve been using the UAG case since the Note 5 came out and even when left in my car, no problems.The heat also leads to the other wonderful problem of me constantly sweating, so the grips on the case are a nice touch without me dropping the phone with my sweaty hands.  It‚Äôs a small thing, but you don‚Äôt think about it until you‚Äôre messing around with other cell phone cases.  All and all, a great product that I really recommend.Oh, I don‚Äôt keep my phones in my pocket, I put them on my waist, using my shorts or pants to hold up my phone.  I mention this because it‚Äôs one of the reasons why I drop kick my phones a fair bit. It‚Äôs not something to be proud of, but I‚Äôd been asked that once before‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why I come back to the UAG case because I feel a lot more secure knowing my case is going to help me out in this situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A18H0DSBU7PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ERMDSO#wasThisHelpful","R3A18H0DSBU7PT","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this item for my wife, so the best I can do is communicate what I was told by the group of friends who were watching her wear it and put it on.  The feel of this item is really nice, another reviewer mentioned that it is almost like scuba material, and that would be the best way to describe it.  This has a really nice advantage of actually allowing you to move around without cutting into yourself or losing your breath.  When my wife was wearing it, should could move around fairly easy.  In addition, she kept wearing it for a while, which to me meant that she was doing okay in it, even though it was put on her pretty tight.  I was offered the product to try it out for a review, so I didn‚Äôt really think that size was that important, but I guess I found out I had ordered a size a bit too small.  We managed to shove her into it, but again, even with it fairly tight on her, once in, she was moving around very comfortable.I was told the following: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a 5‚Äô3, size A.  These make my breasts huge, and it fits my waist well.‚ÄùFrom my perspective it did a great job of rounding out her figure, and we actually used this to fit her into a steampunk outfit from this same company that I had also ordered a bit small for her.  One of our friends who was with us while this was being tried on actually fell in love with it and just ordered her own, which I think is pretty telling to the product.Oh! I forgot an important thing I was supposed to pass along as well, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs well made, it doesn‚Äôt lose its shape when only hooking a few of the hooks.‚Äù  This statement was made to me in excitement when my wife was putting it on and only did a top few hooks.  Prior to getting the bottom hooks throughout, she was really surprised that the two hooks at the top held up the entire time without stretching or bending; until she was able to get the hooks to catch.

Although I would have loved to post pictures of her with this on her, she wouldn‚Äôt let me, but there‚Äôs some pretty awesome things to say about this item.  It‚Äôs really high quality; we were able to get it on and it fit a bit small, but it allowed for her adjust the size a fair bit.  This is what I was told to write from my wife:‚ÄúI have a very short torso and this fit perfectly.

"I wanted to love these, you really have no idea how badly I just wanted them to work.  We have two rugs in our house, on the tile floor, both of which we ourselves and the dogs go surfing across the kitchen floor because of their inability to stay in one place.  As another reviewer noted, there was some difficulty in understanding the instructions.Initially we adhered these to the floor and there was no issue, the carpets stuck and we thought that all of our problems/troubles were over in the world.  Then after a few hours, they ceased to hold the carpet anymore.  The adhesive portion worked well and stuck to the floor, but it just didn‚Äôt hold the carpets anymore.  What we realized, so it could entirely be our issue, is that these attracted dog hair, lots and lots of dog hair, so that when our carpets, which had dog hair, were placed on these, it made is so that it was difficult to maintain a bond because they then sucked up all the dog hair.I do also have to push back about not leaving a sticky residue.  Perhaps we installed it incorrectly, but all of them left a stick residue on our floor.  We were able to get it up, we have a Bissel steam mop, so going over it a few times with that got it up, but there was certainly some marks left behind, but again, they came up with cleaning, but it wasn‚Äôt a fell swoop and it was gone clean-up.One thing that was kind of neat though is that they would go back to their shape if you pulled them up or the carpet pulled them in a different direction.  So, our carpet was moving around, but you can see how it would hold down corners very well because if for some reason it was bunched up, or a corner folded over on its self, then it resume its original shape.Overall, they make sense and I can see them working.  However, not if you have dogs that shed a lot (we have three shedders).  Since we had dog hair already on the carpets, that‚Äôs my guess as to why it probably did not work as well as it could have.  Also, it did leave some residue on our tile where we adhered it.  I was able to get it up, but it required some persistence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJ4D7G482PJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5HQJPU#wasThisHelpful","R2KJ4D7G482PJF","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôm always amazed how I can go on Amazon and find a T.V. mount for 1/3 the price that I can find them at the hardware store or Best Buy.  I‚Äôve bought many T.V. mounts from Amazon and have found most, including this one, a steal and just as high quality as anything I would find at the big box stores.I received this particular item in exchange for an unbiased review, but I do tell people when its crap.

I installed it on studs, so it‚Äôs secure to the wall and has held up my 46‚Äô Vizio very nicely.  The only complaint, more so thing to be mindful regarding, is that it is often hard to take a T.V. off a T.V. mount like this, just because of the minimal distance from the wall.

The main distinction between the Breast Cancer Research version and the Pink Coral is that the Pink Coral has some rubber along the bottom that makes it a bit smoother when one puts it down on a counter or glass table top.

"I received this bottle a few days ago and I have been playing around with it; I admit, I was initially scared of it because of the fancy packaging and the fact that it said ‚Äúfragile on it.‚Äù However, it is wrapped very well and it‚Äôs just a reminder not to launch the product across the counter.

"I‚Äôve been playing with these cords for the past week.  I love them.  They sync with my phone perfectly fine and I have a Galaxy Note Edge 4.  The only thing to be mindful is that they are USB 2, so sometimes, if you‚Äôre using a USB 3, it‚Äôll work; but it‚Äôs not on all USB 3‚Äôs, I‚Äôve been using it with my ANKER extension port and haven‚Äôt had problems, but then moved it over to my actual computer and the 3.0 didn‚Äôt work, whereas the 2.0 did.As people have said, the cord is thicker than most people receive.  I don‚Äôt know, I just like that.  Don‚Äôt we always want things that just seem sturdier? Maybe it‚Äôs just me.  The length is long, 6.6 foot; which is pretty long compared to most cell phone charger cords, but again, that is something that I really like about these cords.  I use it by my bed, which has an outlet a ways away and this way I can pick up my phone and look at it without pulling over half the nightstand or unplugging my phone.  I am also able to run it to rear of my computer and again, not have to worry about having it in just the right position in just the right moment so I don‚Äôt unplug it.It‚Äôs work fine on my Logitech mouse charging it, my Logitech headphones, as well as my Kindle Paperwhite, and keyboard.  If you‚Äôre looking for a good length cord, this is a great option, and it‚Äôs so cheap.  You get three of these cords.I was offered a coupon in exchange for an unbiased review, and well, I lucked out. They‚Äôre pretty snazzy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BD9KKTV3NEDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVEARLO#wasThisHelpful","R3BD9KKTV3NEDK","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent.  I love cords. I love monitors.  This blends the best of both words for me.  I have two 24 inch monitors that are using all the HDMI ports on my computer.  I sometimes like to feed my computer monitor to my television, but I hate the hassle of having to hook or unhook my stuff  every time that I want to do it.  I was offered a coupon to get this item discounted to review it, and I admit, every now and then I get really excited because it‚Äôs a product that I badly want; this was one of them.  As soon as I got this I hooked it up to split my right monitor to my big screen TV. There was no issue, it was easy to figure out and to split it. In the past I‚Äôve used devices like this, I‚Äôve tended to get noticeable lag.  I was able to stream and not have any issues with lag, which is a big deal to me because it‚Äôs so annoying.  I was also able to extend my display, so I was able to make the big screen an extension of the screen.  I‚Äôm able to play a lot of the movies that Google ChromCast blocks by just playing it in my browser, or on the screen like normal.  I certainly recommend.  The only thing I would note is that there is a needed separate power outlet for this, which at first it was a little murky about where to put it, meaning I don‚Äôt always have the open power outlets by where my cords are, but, I was able to position it by re-arranging some items and it worked great.  Again, I don‚Äôt have any complaints.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2071ZKCJG164X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151FY08G#wasThisHelpful","R2071ZKCJG164X","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit, I get a lot of stuff through Amazon to review, and sometimes is not always the best quality. I was offered a sample product to give an unbiased review for the business card holder.  I will admit, I‚Äôm very happy that I agreed to this review.  It really is one of the items that has come to me and is of a much higher quality than a lot of the other cheap products.  I‚Äôm looking at the price right now, and it‚Äôs really cheap for what you get. It‚Äôs a high quality metal business card holder.I took it to the engraver and they were able to engrave it without a problem and no residual or negative effects were made on the case. This is actually a really nice idea for gifts, especially if you‚Äôre looking for something that is for a new graduate or new professional. When I was at the engraver‚Äôs I saw comparable products for $20 or $30.  Considering the engraving cost me $10, I still came out way ahead.I know that there is some feedback that individuals do not like the pouch that comes with, I actually really like it.  It allows you clean off smudges and fingerprints that may get on the cardholder. If I‚Äôm taking this with me to an event or an outing, it‚Äôs an easy way to clean it off in between taking out the business card holder.  I recommend this, without any hesistation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B46W24CKP399/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9RI3EQ#wasThisHelpful","R1B46W24CKP399","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the garden seat towards the end of the summer, and I‚Äôm really disappointed that it arrived at that time; it would have made my life a great dealer easier throughout the summer when I was working in my backyard.  I spent a lot of time bending over and just kneeling in the dirt; whereas the moment the kneeler arrived; I realized it would have saved me a lot of soreness and pain.  I‚Äôm also in a very humid climate, which is very hot, so I sweat a lot.  A LOT.  What‚Äôs nice about the gardener kneeling pad & cushion is that it keeps my knees from becoming covered in dirty and grass, and ants‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm very familiar with the ants as well.  I‚Äôve used the kneeler a fair bit already and have found that is very comfortable for long-term use, as well as accommodates my movement very well.  When used as a kneeler the pad also allows for support in getting off the ground and pushing myself up off the ground.I have also used it as a seat; it is very comfortable as well.  I have a set of 6 Ruby Reds and Azalea‚Äôs that are young and I have been pruning by hand to shape them a good distance apart from one another and the house.  Sitting on the seat, with the distance provided, was a good height for managing the bushes.  I can remain seated for a much longer period of time and have research about the height of the bushes.  I tend to use the kneeler more for pulling out grass in my river rock bed of bushes in my back yard; again, it‚Äôs a game changes because I‚Äôm able to get at the rocks without having to lean on the brick or gingerly place my knees in the rock bed.I really, really, love this product.  I was offered a free product in exchange for a review, and I‚Äôm not going to lie, this is one of those times where I‚Äôve gotten a product that is highly functional and has held up very well.  I‚Äôm a heavy set person as well, I have wide hips and some girth, I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the kneeler/chair either.  I highly recommend it, or, even for those who might need a gift for an older avid garner, this is very helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2Y96GWJLEFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KJPXI0#wasThisHelpful","R3P2Y96GWJLEFP","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, the book is exactly what you think it‚Äôs going to be, and, it‚Äôs still good.  It‚Äôs actually, really good, with a high readability and passes the time quickly.I will be upfront; I‚Äôve never seen a Nicholas Sparks movie, nor read a Nicholas Sparks book before; I‚Äôve been doing my best to read a variety of books this year and changed genres.  This was a pleasant read, quick, and moved fairly fast.  I‚Äôm not much of a romance type of person, but even as someone who‚Äôs not into guys, the main protagonist Colin, was kind of dreamy.  No, really, he actually was really dreamy.  As a bad boy, MMA fighter, turned good, I thought that the character was a bit over played out in the initial chapters, but as it progressed, I found that he maintained likability and still kept my attention.A piece of me wanted to dislike the whole story; knowing that it was hitting on many of the romantic elements that I had stereotyped all of Nicholas Sparks books to be, but‚Ä¶it was good.  Really good.  Even the stereotypical family friend, with a fianc√©, who embraces the bad boy, who said bad boy has a soft spot for, and vows that now harm will come to them, even they were perfectly written, well developed, and offered humor to the story in very genuine and sweet ways.  I laughed out loud at them‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt do that, but they were so cute and added a dimension to the character of Colin.The female protagonist is well developed with some levels of depth that creates a significant amount of buy-in from the reader.  I found myself rooting for her, and was happy with all of her resolutions that occurred in ways that support her character and kept rather true to who she was throughout the book.  Maria has some fleeting encounters with sexual harassment, which comes up right away in the story.  Sparks actually does a good job of mirroring oft-occurring responses, and does so in a really good way that stays away from self-blame, but also frames the emotional discomfort that (unfortunately) many women have felt in some work situations.Maria‚Äôs story is one that plays into the ‚Äúthriller‚Äù aspect of the story, but, the book isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúthriller,‚Äù it‚Äôs more like, a plot dimension with some action? I mean, it‚Äôs not really a thriller, there is foreshadowing very early on that gives background context to Maria‚Äôs past employment as a city prosecutor and some disgruntled individuals due to her work.  I‚Äôm not really giving anything away, but the reader gets a ‚Äúpool‚Äù of two/three individuals who are affiliated with the same case.  Since the case is so far removed and buy-in to the persons affiliated with the case is minimal, in my opinion, it was more so a matter of, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶it‚Äôs one of them‚Äù without really needing a distinction of who it was; as they all were a blur associated with the same issue.  However, the thriller aspects lets us spend more time with Colin making himself a bit dreamier and developing as a person.If I had only one piece of criticism; Colin is an MMA fighter, and it‚Äôs initially very central to his figure.  However, I actually watch and follow a lot of MMA, and there is a disconnect between some of the training components and what Colin is doing.  I had given up some hope that Nicholas Sparks really knew anything about MMA, but then he made a comment about an amateur fight sometimes getting a bit more brawl-like, which made me happy, as it‚Äôs true, but the relationships between fights and coaches and even training partners are really strong; so that aspect maybe a bit under played.  Again, that‚Äôs just me, having that familiarity.  I still liked it a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3U4BZGS3NFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455520616#wasThisHelpful","R3F3U4BZGS3NFY","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Uh, this product is kind of amazing, for a number of reasons.  Let me get the disclaimer our of the way, I agreed the review the product in exchange for an unbiased review.  There, it‚Äôs done.  So, I work at a school, I‚Äôm a teacher, and I know that we have a badminton club.  I agreed to review these because I knew that I‚Äôd be the hero of the badminton club, at least for maybe a day or two.  Surprisingly, it‚Äôs lasted almost a week.The first thing to note is that it‚Äôs real feathers.  Or at least, synthetic looking feathers, but apparently, that‚Äôs really important.  I may have zones out for a bit of the talk, but the sponsor of the badminton club gave me a lecture on that.  So, check on that area of excitement.When I came back to the badminton club and asked how the shuttlecocks were doing, they were super excited and explained to me that they had been playing with them non-stop for the last two weeks.  They practice after school (they‚Äôre legit ya‚Äôll).  They were still holding up great, and they loved them for accuracy.  I mentioned that they were LED‚Ä¶and after the blank stares there was perfuse excitement and then they lit them on up.So, apparently the weight difference is negligible with the LED and they have held up really well.

"I read this book; one thing that I agree with 100% is that there are a lot of elements/questions that come up when someone starts a business.  I run my own company and found myself exploring things that I thought I‚Äôd never have to deal with, especially small random things.Pro‚Äôs:I like the concept of the book, it‚Äôs good for someone who has minimal experience, comfort finding things for themselves on the web.There are lists of things that someone who is in a business or too busy to look around and stumble across may absolutely love.It‚Äôs broken up into logical sections so there is some level of ease in finding elements for the book.Con‚Äôs:Typically only one or two suggestions on options; they are more generic, often focus on Google products; which isn‚Äôt bad, but tends to be the easiest that a person can find on their own.Just lists a site, with a link, so you‚Äôre able to go their easily, but it would be nice if there was maybe a heads up if it is a pay site, or if you have to pay for the service that is being offered.It‚Äôd also be nice if there maybe a pro/con or ranking of the different items on the sites that are under specific topics.If you‚Äôre a novice person on the web, this is a great book, it has a lot of things that you may not have thought about before.  If you have a bit of familiarity that is a little bit stronger, you might want to get the book while it‚Äôs free or discounted (depending on the Amazon plan), but if it‚Äôs a little bit steeper in price, you may want to forgo it for something more comprehensive or your own Googling skills.

"I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review.  I had never used a magnetic car mount and I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how this was going to work.

I found that it installed really easy in my car, it did what it was supposed to in terms of adhering to the vent, and was relatively easy to take the piece in and out.  I actually ended up using it quite a bit as a phone stand; I know that it mentions it briefly in the advertisement, but it really was a good quality for that particular purpose.In terms of the phone itself, I found that it did not stay up on the dash when I drove.  I have a Note Edge 4 and a UAG case.  I admit, I‚Äôm happy I have the UAG case, or else I might have been a bit sadder when it went flying off of the magnetic mount.  The case and the phone that I have are larger, so it‚Äôs more a phablet size, with the case being one of the more durable kinds.  It just wouldn‚Äôt handle that size and weight.  However, it did hold it a few seconds before flying off, so my guess is that with a minimal case and a slightly lighter phone, it might be a good bet.I do recommend the stand portion of the device, that was kind of handy and with the pad inside the phone, it‚Äôs a mount that I can keep in my office to watch shows on my phone without remembering the extra piece.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7FGMDZPUTGEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU3W43G#wasThisHelpful","R7FGMDZPUTGEE","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I didn‚Äôt read the tag to see if it was washable, but after washing it, it dried easily and then I wore it again. There were no issues associated with wearing it after that.  I like the option of being able to wash my money belts because they tend to get sweaty and kind of nasty.The other thing that I like about this money belt is that it is strong enough to stay up around my waste when I‚Äôm wearing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JJIVWF62T3R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KFAMBW#wasThisHelpful","R3JJIVWF62T3R5","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôm a huge Rick Riordan fan and I‚Äôve been waiting for this book for a while, those who have been waiting as well won‚Äôt be disappointed.  I‚Äôm personally impressed; I know that the structure of the story is going to be similar to others of Riordan, but even with the structure similar, it‚Äôs still a page turner, but this time in the context of Norse mythology.  It initially appears to be a long book, but, it is an easy read that goes fast; I didn‚Äôt want to put it down and read it in one night.For those who are not familiar with Rick Riordan‚Äôs writings, this is a perfectly fine book to jump into Riordan‚Äôs fantasy world, there is no benefit gained in having read his other books that deal with heroes from Greek, Roman, or Egyptian mythology.  The characters stand alone in their identities and are all affiliated with Norse mythology.  The protagonist, Magnus, is quickly discovered in the story to have a background not quite like others, more so in his parenting and lineage; his father is a Norse god.  As a result of this lineage, there are obligations that Magnus is thrust with, and the story is a modern day interaction of Magnus through components of Norse mythology, ranging from characters to weaponry of the ancient belief system.  The story is told with humor, but also does a great job in outlining and establishing some of the belief systems of Norse mythology, such as the pantheon of the gods and goddesses.The characters have a different personality, much like those we meet out of Camp Jupiter vs. Camp Half Blood.  The story takes place in Norse mythology, which I personally do not have as strong of a familiarity with, and allowed for a new sense of novelty in the story that has the format of hero discovered, hero goes to ‚Äúcamp,‚Äù and hero goes on quest. The introduction of the new characters was nice and it created a sense of anticipation about who maybe a bit more friendly than others.  Overall, the relationship with the gods themselves is a bit more casual, even if the society itself is more regimented.A discussion board commenter alluded to the possibility of a relationship between these books and that with Camp Half-Blood, from the start of the book there is a pleasant surprise in that Magnus does have a cousin who attends Camp Half-Blood, but rather than long-term interaction with him/her, there is just a brief reference too at both the beginning and the end of the story.It‚Äôs a hard story to talk about because of the potential to give so much away about who is related to who, and familiarity with some of the Norse gods would reveal some of the plot elements.  However, a unique aspect of the Norse mythology is that the fates of the gods are much clearer, with a level of clarity and absolutism in the roles that each one knows that he/she plays, even in the final battle (Ragnok ÔÉü which isn‚Äôt the final battle in this book).Know that the structure is similar to the books in the past, the characters who are introduced throughout this book are unique in their own ways, especially Magnus‚Äôs new companions and, I especially enjoyed the history and sense of honor associated with the Valkyrie corps, especially Samirah al-Abbas, who identifies from a Muslim family.Anyway, enjoy a way!  I have some Norse mythology to learn about now that I‚Äôm curious.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZY1JZ43MTPY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O87NWBK#wasThisHelpful","RZY1JZ43MTPY7","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes; this tape has been amazing.  It's held up wonderfully, even with above-average use.I used this product to wrap a cardboard cutout of the Tardis (Doctor Who's traveling device.)  The cardboard cutout is about six feet tall and four feet wide and this essentially was the lamination.  In addition, I used this tape to make a handle for said Tardis, so that the cutout could easily be carried (The Tardis is my bathroom hall pass, I'm a teacher).  The students have to carry all six feet of the Tardis down the hall, carrying it with the handles that I made for it (they're plastic planting sticks), which are also taped onto the cardboard cutout.  I was really surprised that the tape has held up so well; it's getting used about 10-11 times a day, in a high humidity region, so it is supporting a lot of weight without give on a daily basis; with the weight often changing direction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S1GWKR7EMCT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J07BRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2S1GWKR7EMCT3","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product arrived on a day that I and three other friends were hanging out.  Initially, we were a bit confused by how to put it on, but we all took turns wearing it.  None of us were pregnant, nor have any of us been pregnant, and I want to be up front about that so I‚Äôm not lying.  However, I felt that it could be a bit beneficial to talk about it in a few other ways.  It was really easy to use and put on, the compression, by itself, is really comfortable.  It‚Äôs not something that sucks in one part of the gut, but rather, the way that it is designed, with the wrap-around and the support, it‚Äôs kind of soothing.  It was something that we talked about as we took turns wearing it.  The fabric has enough give so it was not uncomfortable to sit down in.  I actually spend a lot of time in a chair during the day, just doing work, and on the internet.  I wore this for a day while hanging out and found that it helped sooth my back; it didn‚Äôt ache as much after hanging out in the chair for a while.  I know that it‚Äôs not designed to be a back support, but at the same time, it has some really useful purposes outside of being a compression for post-pregnancy.I was offered a discount coupon for an unbiased review of this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18QIXFMDLZQ9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFEA416#wasThisHelpful","R18QIXFMDLZQ9T","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was offered a coupon to provide an unbiased review of this product.  Here‚Äôs the deal, I really don‚Äôt have a need for a finger pulse oximeter.  It‚Äôs just that it was the timing was wonderful, so I said that I would review it.  Our family friend just recently had open heart surgery, my mother was staying with her, and one of the expectations with a surgery like that is that you take a person‚Äôs pulse so many times during the day.  Initially, my mom, who is not a trained nurse or has any medical training, was trying to take her friends pulse.  Then I was offered a coupon and realized that this would be amazing.You know what, it is.  Taking the pulse now is ease.  The device was also really easy to use, so much so that my 70+ old mother was able to operate it; this coming from a woman who has aversion to all types of technology.  If you‚Äôre in need of a product that takes pulse, I‚Äôd recommend this, mainly because of the ease associated with it.

"The leash came very nicely packaged in a high quality cardboard box with a pull out drawer.  Included with the box is a small cloth bag for the leash itself.  This would make for a pretty gift for your favorite dog owner.  The leash itself is short ‚Äì about four feet long ‚Äì which make it ideal for walking a dog in an urban setting.  Overall the construction is excellent with a swiveling D-ring hook which latches firmly into place and a wide, padded handle that fits comfortably in the hand, especially when the dog is pulling on the leash.  There is a second, unpadded handle towards the base of the leash.  This second handle is useful either when sitting with the dog, and the owner could use it to maintain control of the dog closer to its body.  It also would be useful when heeling with a taller dog on the leash, and using the second handle to keep the dog physically closer to the owner's body.My only complaint has to do with the length of the leash.  I prefer a six foot leash because it gives more lead for the dogs (both beagles) to sniff during our walks.

"I admit; I don‚Äôt really know how to write a review about marbles.  I‚Äôm not a marble expert, I can just tell you what happened with my experience with the marbles.  There‚Äôs a large marble, which I believe is called the ‚Äúshooter‚Äù and it‚Äôs fairly durable.  By ‚Äúfairly‚Äù durable, that would mean chunking it at the cement multiple times while playing aggressive adult marbles who may have been slightly intoxicated.Anyway, the marbles are a pretty color, they are not really what is shown in the pictures though.  They are more of a foggy color, with a heavy emphasis on green/teal. I did get three marbles that had crack on them, but none of my marbles developed cracks or chips while playing with them.  So, I‚Äôm not sure if it is a production issue or a shipping issue.  The marbles come in a plastic bag, that is within a pseudo velvet bag, which is nice because they won‚Äôt fly all over the place once opened.In terms of other commenters mentioning the uniformity of the marbles being off; this is correct.  So, be mindful of what you are using them for.  If you‚Äôre putting them in a vase; cool, no foul.  If you‚Äôre non-professional adults who just like to play sometimes, they aren‚Äôt that bad because the variation can offer some different challenges to the game.  If you‚Äôre a pro, or play a lot, then you might want to focus on a different set.

"Jenny Lawson is back in another spectacular book in which she chronicles her life, but this time through the lens of someone who struggles with anxiety.  Well; she did that last time, but this time, it is an underlying theme/focus of her writing, and I might add, it‚Äôs quite spectacular.I actually do not read Lawson‚Äôs blog, my partner is unabashedly committed, and I just realized that we will probably end up with three copies of this book; the kindle version I just read, the hard copy my wife probably ordered and didn‚Äôt tell me about, and a third copy my wife will probably buy at the book signing.  I admit, I‚Äôm comfortable in the knowledge of having a few extra copies of this book; it‚Äôs one of those books I want to shove in the face of others and say, ‚ÄúI think that this is a great way to understand anxiety and depression.‚ÄùI discovered Lawson‚Äôs books while driving with my partner and we listened to the audio book.  Later on a few friends mentioned that the audio book was probably a better option at the time because it was a lot easier to follow Ms. Lawson‚Äôs stream of conscious thoughts in an audio form rather than a written form.  In reading this book, and comparing it to ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Pretend This Never Happened,‚Äù I found that the format is much easier to read and easier to follow for those who are not as familiar with her style found on her blog.  Lawson‚Äôs thought are still spectacularly entertaining, insightful, and seemingly random (I too sometimes refer to time as ‚ÄúBefore Kirk Cameron Went Crazy‚Äù or BKCWC, but apparently Advanced Placement won‚Äôt accept that response for my students.)The tone of this book starts of different than her other writings, at first it seemed a bit dark, but it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, Lawson does this wonderful job of taking the reader through understanding some elements of depression and anxiety.  I don‚Äôt struggle with depression and anxiety, but the way in which Lawson presents the topic is one in which it builds compassion and an open dialogue.  I admit, my comment about ‚Äúit starts off dark,‚Äù is a bit misleading, Lawson clearly outlines; I have depression and anxiety and here is a bit of the journey I have been on with it (that may involve two Rory‚Äôs who are stuft raccoon's).To some people, this may scare them away, but, in the case of Lawson she speaks frankly about the situation while doing it in the context of hilarity.  I guess what I‚Äôm saying is, she talked about depression and it didn‚Äôt scare me away, but actually gave me some really awesome insight that will hopefully make me a better and more compassionate person to others.  I think that one of the reasons why Lawson‚Äôs blog is so popular, and other writings, has to do with the sense of fellowship that others may feel with her experience, even if it is standing in line at the pharmacy or talking to a shrink.  ‚Ä¶granted, Lawson does it in the context of some pretty awesome stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MY8SMVALKODY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V37BC4C#wasThisHelpful","R1MY8SMVALKODY","A2CLFYJB0P0F6M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CLFYJB0P0F6M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those that aren't sure who Felicia Day is, she is an actress, an author, an entrepreneur, an innovator and a gamer.  She has in her resume, among many things, the experience of revolutionizing the internet in some ways - namely the creation of her web series, The Guild, that was posted for everyone to watch for free on YouTube back in 2007 (and later expanded to other media such as Xbox and DVD).  This web series, based (whether loosely or not) on many of her experiences both in real life and through online video game playing, launched her self-made career and popularity.  Since then she has done so many things that I won't list here because I think her story is worth reading or listening to (honestly it's my opinion that you should get the audio book since she reads it herself).  Felicia details her life from childhood to current, describing her home schooled upbringing in just the right amount of detail to give you a good understanding of why she is who she is today.She didn't get to where she is easily - while I've been a fan of her work prior to this book, I now have a much better understanding of the many struggles she's had to go through.  I listened to this book with smiles, laughter, tears and pride for her accomplishments.  Through it all, she doesn't harp on the problems she had or the troubles that people have given her - instead she borderlines on a helpful attitude and gives advice on how to push through problems and adversity.There is one chapter near the end of the book where she discusses online harassment and threats that she's experienced - in particular related to Gamergate over the last couple of years.  I found this to be the bravest of her chapters, because even my bringing it up here in this review could potentially incite negative responses toward myself, such is that topic's volatile nature.  Felicia Day's story isn't just about a female gamer who made it in the online world, it's about a person who - through damn hard work and determination - succeeded in her wildest dreams.From social awkwardness, through depression, through adversity and onward to success - Felicia Day's book is worth a read by anyone.

"Just wanted to write a quick review about this thing answering some questions that I had about it myself but didn't see in the top 10 reviews or so, plus I wanted to throw in some other points.1) This does NOT light your fire.  You still need to light your wood or charcoal through your normal means.  This just helps it to get it to its ""ready state"" a lot faster.2) This does NOT blow hot air at all.  In fact it was a hot day today and I even caught myself using it as a little portable fan twice.3) This DOES blow a focused stream of air that can be felt by the hand around 2 feet or so away from it.  It focuses air blowing on the coals so that they get hotter faster and in turn light up the other coals around them faster.4)  EDITED (based on product videos and manufacturer comments on this review):  You can put the tip pretty close to the coals as they first heat up, but you should pull back of course as the heat increases and spreads.5)  You need to supply the 3 AAA batteries for this unit.6)  It makes noise but it's not super loud.  I'd say a little quieter than some blow driers on low.7)  It does help, but I wouldn't call this a must have.

"The game is fun, but set up is a BEAR.  There are so many cards (various decks), pieces, etc. that after playing twice I've got one friend that's given up mainly for that reason.  We're going to still be playing it, just without him.  Until you're very familiar with the game, plan on up to 30 minutes of set up time just to get the various decks understood and in place (some you won't use depending on which ""bad guy"" you choose to fight), and you've got to set up a special deck for the bad guys (based off of card types in one of their assigned decks).It's fun once you get going but there are so many parts and pieces to remember during game play that you have to be a pretty dedicated player (all of you do really) if you're going to get to the point where you can get a game over and done with in under 3 hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16EMOW891LBSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616617667#wasThisHelpful","R16EMOW891LBSE","A1KY25HG3D9NWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY25HG3D9NWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading many reviews of different streaming media players (amazon's, apple's, this one, etc.) I went with the Roku for many reasons but here's the reasons I like it so much:1)  SUPER fast, no wait between menus, loading movies, etc. ‚Äì it all happens immediately at the touch of a button.  a.  Also super fast is the FF/Rewind/etc. ‚Äì on both the PS4 and the Blu-ray player, rewinding was a pain in the butt and it would sometimes skip so far back or forward we‚Äôd just end up watching the same stuff for another 5 minutes to get to where we wanted instead of keeping on trying to get the spot right.2)  The menus between apps/channels all work the same.  Netflix has the same basic menu format as Amazon Prime, for example.  It‚Äôs really quick to move through menus.3)  Lots of channel choices/apps.  You can add/remove them from your main menu as you wish (there‚Äôs one that has to be there, some movie rent/buy place that clearly they have a contract with but I don‚Äôt care).4)  They even have games.  For example, Tetris.  There was a free trial where you could just play the game for one level and it costs $4.99 to buy it permanently.  It was perfect, classic Tetris played the way it‚Äôs supposed to be played.  I saw a few other games you could buy but can‚Äôt recall what they were exactly.5)  Awesome remote!  a.  Very simple, not a crazy amount of buttons, small but fits in your hand well.  Has direct buttons for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and RDIO or whatever it‚Äôs called (a music channel/app).  b.  Takes 2-AA batteries‚Ä¶and not only did they include them but they‚Äôre Duracell, not some crappy off-brand that won‚Äôt last.  c.  WI-FI!  It‚Äôs not a radio remote, it connects and pairs automatically with your Roku via Wi-Fi ‚Äì I tested it out in other rooms, fully covered, etc ‚Äì and it works perfectly every time no matter what.  This was a problem for me with other remotes because sometimes I sit in my desk in one room and watch the TV from there while I‚Äôm on the computer or something.  Sometimes I have to get up with those remotes and go into the living room because something is interfering with the signal.  d.  Voice searching ‚Äì yep, the remote apparently has an open mic for when you are on a search screen.  Works great, tested it with DJ several times and it‚Äôs spot on.  e.  Phone Apps ‚Äì free Roku app that lets me control the Roku, and has a full keyboard piece for searching stuff so you don‚Äôt have to type everything in (not that this really is generally necessary after setup (using it for passwords was helpful) because it already has the voice feature).  f.  Phone/Tablet Mirroring ‚Äì I think this can work with laptops too, but you can take whatever you have on your screen (if you have the app of course) and show it up on the TV.  Dj and I watched a couple movies from his phone (like from the renaissance faire last year) and it looked amazing on the screen!  g.  Headphone Jack ‚Äì it comes with headphones or you can use your own ‚Äì so you can listen to everything without having the external sound up.  Pretty cool.  h.  Price Scans ‚Äì so if you search for a movie to buy or rent, for example, it will show you how much it costs on any of the channels you have loaded.  You may find Insurrection for $4.99 to rent on Hulu, but Amazon has it for $2.99, so you can make a choice as to which service you get your movie from.6)  It‚Äôs tiny‚Ä¶.literally hockey puck sized, a little thicker.If I had anything to complain about it would be:1)  Didn't come with an HDMI cable‚Ä¶but I got a great one from Amazon for under $102)  During initial set up you are required to either put in a credit card or link to your paypal account.  I‚Äôd rather not have done that and had to put it in at some time later.  It doesn't cost anything to use it unless you are buying/renting movies, adding games, whatever.  But it still makes you do that first before you can use it.  a.  You can program it also to require a PIN to be put in before anything can be bought, which is nice.3)  It does get pretty warm ‚Äì but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone complaining that they overheat.  I‚Äôll have to monitor closer going forward.Overall I love this thing and will be using it a LOT in the future.  It doesn't replace cable for most folks (especially those that want to watch sports, etc.) but it's a great buy.  Probably my favorite feature is the remote and how well it works from any angle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5CAVAZ14CFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJ3IULO#wasThisHelpful","R2V5CAVAZ14CFU","A1KY25HG3D9NWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY25HG3D9NWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Plant arrived very well packed with a heating pack since it's February.  My first impression was that it was huge compared to what I expected to get - My Venus Fly Trap has 13 ""traps"" on it - I assumed it would only have a few.  I followed the instructions given and I've been moving the plant to a window during the day (where it is a little colder) and into the living room during the evening (so it can stay warm).  It started getting lighter in color within the first day or two and I started worrying, so I emailed the seller - at 9AM EST on a Friday - he got back to me within minutes and asked if I could take a picture of the plant for him.  I did and he responded that it looks great, the lighter color is natural for the plant and that I did a good job of setting it up.  I was shocked to hear back so quickly and that he was willing to review my particular plant's condition for me.Very highly recommended seller and product both.

"If all you are worried about with these shoes is comfort, especially because you have flat feet like me - they are fantastic.  They are very comfortable and I wear them to work every day for the most part.Unfortunately after a few months the bottom layer is pealing from the front - I have super glued them once already and it's doing it again now.  They are still comfortable though, but if this continues I won't wear them to work any more because it looks...cheap and sloppy.Overall the look of them isn't very dressy - they really do look just like you see in the pictures.  They're more like a sneaker than anything but it works for business casual.

"Overall a great product, would order again maybe yearly.  I like that there are several separate steps to the program, it's not just ""drink this every day for a week"" or ""take these pills for 2 weeks' or whatever.  It gradually moves you through the system over time.I coupled this with a vegetarian (I'm normally a carnivore....) diet including lots of home-made vegetarian broth to drink and lost an average of a pound per day through the system for the first 9 days then just 1 more pound for the last 5.  10 pounds in 2 weeks, pretty darn happy about that but it does show that I should do a cleanse more than once every few years.  I'll do this one once/year and another one 6 months later probably, to mix it up.  I've kept all but 1 pound of the lost weight off.Another thing, the purging with this cleansing system wasn't bad whatsoever.  Sometimes you end up with a cleanse that makes you run to the bathroom all the time, this one is pretty gentle by comparison.last note, the pills will probably make you burp a lot like they did for me, especially for the first 30 minutes or so after you take them.

"I bought this for my son to use with his graduation present - an Alienware 18. Exactly what this bag was made for although of course you could use it for many other purposes as well. I had high hopes that it would have a lot of room and organization options, that it wasn't made cheaply, that the level of protection provided for a $4,000 laptop would be very good and that the weight distribution for the 13 pound laptop would make it easy to carry.Much to my surprise, they nailed it on all accounts!My son carries the huge laptop and the very heavy and large power pack along with his iPad, a Wacom drawing tablet, some books and several smaller items like a headset, a wireless mouse and more with ease. If you have the bag on the floor and pick it up using the top handle it feels very heavy and not like something you'd want to carry around on your back - but the weight distribution is wonderful and the straps are superb. Upon placing it over one shoulder it's shocking how much lighter it feels (still clearly heavy but not nearly as bad as you'd expect) but if you put it over both shoulders you seriously can hardly tell there's much weight to it at all.The front of the pack, the part that looks to be molded and has the alienware logo on it, is not solid. It's firm and will protect it a bit but it isn't a hard plastic at all. You can push it in, bend it, etc - but that's not where the laptop goes anyway. It goes in the back and is very well padded on all sides and the bottom as well. There is a lot of room for other items as well, lots of little pockets for supplies, pens and more all over the place. The straps are thick and cushioned very well and curve to fit you better.Overall a great buy - I've spent $250 in the past on a Mono backpack that wasn't as good as this one.

"I'm on a real tea kick right now and purchased these to go along with various infusers that I have.  They work perfectly every time and each one has a distinct different flavor that is very enjoyable.Organic English Breakfast:  This is a black tea and is pretty robust.  Not super strong but it does make a heavier tea than the others.  This tea has very thick leaves and is fine for your larger mesh infusers.Organic Green Tropics:  Let me say this - I am not and never have been a big fan of green tea.  Hot or cold.  But this is fantastic - the other enhancers with the tea really make a wonderfully flavored beverage.  Standard infusers are fine with this medium sized tea.Organic Serenity:  This is your red rooibos tea and I believe is the only one that could be considered an actual ""herbal tea"".  The particles on this one tend to be pretty small so you'll need a finer mesh infuser to use with it.Tropical White:  Probably my favorite, although with this selection I go back and forth depending on the day.  This tea is lighter (as a white tea will be) but very aromatic and flavorful.  Standard infusers are fine with this medium sized tea.Each tea comes in its own can, labeled and with a different color on top to easily identify them during your morning haze.  You can probably get 2 cups from each standard infusion if you wanted, but I generally like a more stout tea and allow mine to steep longer.  The ""25 servings per can"" is certainly possible unless you use more than the standard 1-teaspoon per 8 oz cup.I highly recommend this tea sampler, and this company's products based off of this purchase.

"The first day I used it, no problem.  Starting the second day and every time since, this thing leaks.  The bottom piece screws on sideways most of the time so you have to remove it and keep trying over and over until you get lucky and it screws flat.  Even then, it will stay sealed only until you open the top.  Once that pressure leaves it, the tea flows from the bottom.  This happens with or without the infuser being in place and the seals are not broken, the threads all seem fine, there doesn't appear to be any damage at all with this product.  Everything looks like it is built as designed, but the seal on it is not good at all.Cannot recommend this product, will only give it 1 star because it's useless to me.UPDATE / CHANGES TO REVIEW:The manufacturer contacted me based on my review above, asking for an opportunity to send me a replacement bottle and in hopes of changing my review.  Well it worked - the new one works much better and so far no leaks at all.  There is a significant difference between the bottom ""cap"" from the old one to the new one - where the old one was clearly looser and the new one fits very snug.  The threads seem to be the same but the seal on it is larger and fits much better.  Not sure if this is a change in their design or if the first one I got was faulty.The mesh on the infuser is great, and the infuser can be removed.  I have used this for very fine grade tea and haven't seen any escape to the liquid yet.  However, the bottle is still glass so you have to be very careful with it, and it's not double-walled so even with the sleeve that comes with it you will find it quite hot to hold unless you are holding it by the tag at the top of the sleeve.  You have to be careful with this for the heat and for the breakage potential.Due to the customer service of the manufacturer and how well this second product works, I've changed my review from 1- to 4- star.-D","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOFUNVUY4JGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DAPNZVI#wasThisHelpful","R3FOFUNVUY4JGI","A1KY25HG3D9NWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY25HG3D9NWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you know how to play Solitaire it's pretty easy to pick up on this game.  We played with 3 people so left one colored deck out of it.  Everyone's deck is the same other than the colors on the back.You play solitaire yourself, but with 3 piles.  Plus you have one part of the rest of your deck face up to draw from, and you can flip the others (which you keep in your hand) 3 at a time to draw from (again, just like solitaire).  As you get 1's, you place them in the middle and everyone can draw from the top of any of their sources to place on any of the piles in the middle.The piles in the middle build from 1-up and always have to be the same color.  The 3 piles you are building on in front of you go from the top down and alternate colors.Very fast paced game, if you aren't quick or don't like fast paced card games like this then you may not like it much.  It's a great game overall though.-D","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17PYBOOOCWIOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BBU0KS#wasThisHelpful","R17PYBOOOCWIOZ","A1KY25HG3D9NWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY25HG3D9NWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fast....because I left them on the coffee table overnight!  Gone by morning of course.Before it got to that point, though, I had wrapped a few of these in a little paper for my dog and my girlfriend's dog - both went nuts for them and a couple more as treats through the night.

"NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!Lots of bad reviews and quite a few 5-star reviews as well here.  Overall I feel it was as good as I expected it to be - and that it was time to end the series anyway.  Most of my reviews for the other seasons were 5-stars, this is a fantastic series!There are some fantastic, very memorable scenes in this season, and some that you will feel you they could have done without - but honestly it's like that every season.  Season 2 was probably my overall favorite, Dokes and his interactions with Dexter really made it great.  This season focuses more on winding everything down with the story lines, filling some holes in the history of Dexter and how things came to be with him, and of course building up to the ending.  The problem I think most folks have is that it had a slower feel to it because of all the holes they were trying to fill for those of us who really wanted to understand Dexter more.  Some of the folks that I talked to who were disappointed were hoping for huge fireworks of slaughter with Dexter laying person after person on his table every episode - it wasn't like that (and I don't consider that a spoiler, more of a warning to the folks who are hoping for it).  Character development did seem loose at times - but again, this is the final season - developing characters wasn't much on their minds, it was about closure.This wasn't my favorite season, but it wasn't my least favorite either.  And I loved every season!  Go into this seasons looking for drama, story telling and closure and you'll be very happy.-D","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB6K6IZT0WIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DXPC1U6#wasThisHelpful","R2GB6K6IZT0WIU","A1KY25HG3D9NWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY25HG3D9NWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This leaves you very confident that the tip won't just pop off in use.  This also means you can use the tips (and coupler) on other bags.-The bag is washable (see below though) and replaceable if needed.-Very inexpensive set for light use or for starters/children.The not-so-good (Or, the reasons why this set is so inexpensive):-The bag stains if you use chocolate, food coloring, or probably any other color than white.-The coupler is a bit cheap feeling, it works OK but there are better options for people who would be using a decorating set a lot, or folks who use very heavy icing in their decorating.For the price, you can't beat it.

"Overall I like this calendar a lot. If I could, I would change the way the graphics for the calendar/date boxes are skewed.  I'd rather have them straight up and down, as I like to make notes on them throughout the year.  I can still do this of course, but because of the angles and the ""depth"" of them are set in the layout, the boxes for the days that come later in the month are significantly larger than the ones early in the month.  Plus they're angled as well, which just kind of screws with your eyes a little.Not the best calendar they've had for BBT (I've been getting these for years) but it's still overall good.  I like that they have cartoon superhero outfits for each of the main characters, and that the whole calendar has a comic book feel to it.Just a little disappointed as well that Stewart (the comic book store owner) isn't represented anywhere in this comic book adaptation of the calendar....would have been a nice shout-out to a great supporting character!-D","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDSV8F58R5X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423819594#wasThisHelpful","R2PDSV8F58R5X7","A1KY25HG3D9NWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY25HG3D9NWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are rings that you can put on your finger. One review complained that they were ""sideways"" - the reason for this is so you put it on your finger and put your finger under your nose to make it look like you have a mustache. Have you seen anyone (or pictures of someone) draw a mustache on their finger and put it under their nose as a joke? This is like that. Having them sideways is a plus! :)I actually used these the same way as described - to put onto cupcakes because a friend was having a ""wig"" party and I told her if I have to wear a wig you have to wear a mustache.They are cheap plastic, but really do you need anything made of super high quality materials for something like this?

"Great stylist overall.My son is an artist and has several programs on his iPad to draw with.  He's been looking for a good stylus for a while and I think he finally found it in the Mobius Pro Stylus.  His last stylus was an  Adonit Jot Pro and after a few days it just stopped working - plus the disks are too much of a pain to deal with because they come off too easily.  I returned that and got him this one and he loves it.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the tip is a little long which feels just a little bit ""off"".  Still works well but the actual way it feels while drawing takes a moment to get used to.  I think it's great that it comes with its own case AND 2 replacement tips (so you get 3 total).  Not sure exactly how long this will last until one of the replacements is necessary but so far so good after a couple of weeks there appears to be no wear on it.Great product and much better than the Adonit disk-using stylus pens for sure.-D","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341XS4BXH7M6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090SL0BQ#wasThisHelpful","R341XS4BXH7M6S","A1KY25HG3D9NWB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KY25HG3D9NWB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son is an artist and has several programs on his iPad for his creations.  He has tried several different stylus pens and at first he thought this one would be the best.  It worked great - then suddenly, for no apparent reason, it stopped working at all.  This doesn't even make sense because it's not like it's battery run where it can just ""Die"".  We even bought extra disks for it but none of them helped either.Even outside of the problem above (which caused us to return the product - thank you Amazon for making it so easy to do that!!) this pen can be a pain because of those disks.  They are small and clear so hard to find if you drop them - and more importantly they don't even stay on the pen very well.  You'd think they would clip on tightly but they barely grasp the end of the pen enough to stay on - shaking the pen will drop it.  This also causes you to need a case to carry it in because you can't just clip it to your iPad case or put it in your pocket without a solid chance of losing the disk.I do not recommend this pen for anyone.

"Purchased this to replace a ThinkSport bottle that has the paint pealing so badly I don't want to be seen with it.  So far this one seems to be holding up - it's been washed in the dishwasher several times but usually with a brush by hand.  The only ""wear"" I see is that the ""h"" in ""hydration"" has started to come off.  Looks like the whole decal will eventually - but as long as the black base doesn't peel off like the ThinkSport bottle did, I'm fine with that.This is the 3rd type of 25-oz bottle I've owned - and this one definitely holds a little more liquid than the others.  I don't have an easy way to measure the exact amount, but when I pour one of the others (full) in to this one there's a good amount of space left for more liquid.The spout is perfect for drinking from, and the ""screens"" on the inside snap in very well (the ThinkSport bottle's work fine but don't snap in as tightly as this one).  There are also 2 screens, one with larger holes than the other so you have a choice.I use this for my coffee every morning - it keeps the liquid at a great temperature as long as I want it to - but it's usually gone before 10:00 AM (about 2.5 hours after I make the coffee).  It's usually open that whole time as well so it's REALLY good at keeping liquids at temperature then.Good bottle, I do recommend it - I just hope the outside doesn't strip away.  Only time will tell.UPDATE:  After about 3 months of use every single work day (Mon-Fri) plus some weekend days here and there, I've decided to upgrade my review from 4- to 5-stars.  I had been worried that the color would fade or peel away and it hasn't.  The ""Pure Hydration"" logo has mostly been rubbed off but the black underneath has no problem.  I don't have any fear any more that the outside paint job will strip away like the ThinkSport bottles did but as I can see a little wear on the very bottom of the bottle I can tell that it's just not painted the same way as those other bottles were, thus no stripping.  I beat this thing up going from my counter to my car to my desk to my backpack to the dishwasher or sink - and it works great.  The strap is still in perfect conditions, no fear there either at all.

"Green Toys have been a kid favorite in our house for the past couple of years.  This little dump truck is just as well made as all of our bigger Green Toys trucks.  The colors are fun and bright.  This truck is about half the size of the big dump truck and is nearly identical to it with the exception of the cab roof which is missing on this smaller one.  There is a little construction worker bear that comes with this truck which little ones can easily pop in and out of the driver's seat.  On some of our bigger trucks the wheels don't move as smoothly as I'd like them to, but this little truck doesn't seem to have any issues like that.  It was able to roll easily on a vinyl floor.  One of the things I like best about this toy is that it is made in the USA out of recycled plastic.  So it's domestically made and it's green.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8S8Y8XKMI39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TL8UHHS#wasThisHelpful","R3T8S8Y8XKMI39","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This power pack is a lot bulkier than others that we have, but it also has the ability to charge more devices than the little compact stick ones.  It took several hours to charge it using my laptop.  The cord it comes with for charging is no more than three inches long which I found rather annoying.  The powerpack has a flashlight feature that while it's not the most powerful light, it's good enough to give you some light in a situation where you don't have it.  Overall, it's good to have on hand for situations where you need to boost your phone or iPad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A108B9Q8G415/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBAE3SA#wasThisHelpful","R3A108B9Q8G415","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had another Scotch Laminator that was nice, but paled in comparison to other laminators that I have reviewed since then, so my expectations for this machine were on the low side.  When I opened the box the first thing I noticed about this laminator was that it reminded me of the compact Swingline laminator that I really like.  I'd say size wise they're about the same, but this one has an area where you can wind up the cord and store it.  The cord storage feature alone makes me like it better for when I have to transport it for teaching CCD.  The laminator heats up within a couple of minutes and produces nice results.  I was really expecting the not crystal clear results that I was used to with my other Scotch laminator, but I was surprised at how nicely this machine performed.  The results were as good at the Swingline laminator and really not far off from the Fellowes laminators I have previously reviewed.  The other feature I needed to test out was the release lever.  Several laminators I have don't release easily which is a big problem if you wind up with a jam or a positioning issue.  So I was really happy to see that pulling the laminating sheet out of the machine once I slid over the release lever was a snap.  I think it's the easiest release I've encountered so far.The bottom line is this is a really good compact machine for a decent price.  It's easily portable and won't take up a lot of a space on a desktop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R326J8NTS4CS95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI7MI96#wasThisHelpful","R326J8NTS4CS95","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My three year old daughter loves Star Wars, Chewy in particular, so this Millennium Falcon set from Playskool is just perfect for her or any little Star Wars fan.  There are a few pieces that you have to snap on to the Millennium Falcon but that assembly is a snap.  The play set comes with three figures Chewbacca, Han Solo and R2-D2.  They're chunky little plastic figures that will be easy for small hands to manipulate.  The figures can be stored in the Falcon while it's not being played with and it has a carrying handle that makes it ideal for transporting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYC9LYUOCI4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5MVOX0#wasThisHelpful","R1AYC9LYUOCI4K","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this hide and seek mobile.  The little animals are cute and the option to allow the petals to rotate for hide and seek adds interest.  There is a good variety of music and sounds with the music box portion of the mobile.  The volume control is located on the front of the unit so an older baby who likes to play with buttons can adjust the volume which could be problematic if your child decides it's music time at 3AM and turns up the volume.  Of course, you can stop that by just shutting off the unit, but that only works if your child doesn't use this to fall asleep to music.  What I like least about this mobile is you cannot shut off the music just by hitting one of the buttons.  Our 14 year old Tiny Love mobile operates like that and getting used to this one not operating like that is taking me a bit of time.  I do like that it has a light option. The music box can detach from the crib bracket for playing outside of the crib.  If you have a curious toddler, he or she may be able to detach the music box by himself.  My son figured out how to take it off and play with it after the first couple of days.  Overall, this is a nice mobile.  It's easy to set up and attach.  The music is nice and the overall look of the mobile is cheerful and gender neutral.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U22TI2W4FC1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYHKW5M#wasThisHelpful","R1U22TI2W4FC1C","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even at louder volumes it still performs pretty well.  Connecting it to an iPhone using bluetooth was very easy; it took very little time to pair.  My only real gripe about this speaker is it didn't actually come with an AC adapter to plug it into the wall to charge it.

"This Christmas (Santa) themed railway crossing is a cute addition to the train set of your favorite Thomas fan.  The little tower has lights and makes bell sounds when you raise or lower the arms.  The roof and the tops of the rail signal and arms are painted to look like they have freshly fallen snow on them.  The quality is just what I would expect from the Thomas Wooden railway line.  I was a bit skeptical at first when I saw the Fisher Price name on this.  The Thomas trains that we've accumulated in the past 7-10 years were all made by Learning Curve so I wasn't sure if the quality that we came to know and love when our older children were into these trains would be the same, but I was delighted to find out that everything seems just as good as it was back then.

"The first thing I noticed about this light was it's substantial weight.  It's solid and I would hope that's a sign of its quality.  The charger for the batteries for this light seems to be of average quality.  It flashes red while charging and turns to solid green when charging is complete.  Opening the light to add the batteries was a bit more challenging.  With no instructions, I wasn't sure where I was supposed to be attempting to unscrew the light, so it took a bit of trial and error before I finally found the right spot.  Quite frankly, I'm a little annoyed that this didn't come with any instructions.  For something as important as a diving light wouldn't you want some instructions so you make sure you have everything right?This throws a lot of light.

"This is a nicely sized versatile play gym.  You can set it up so it's a cozy four sided play area for a newborn or you can open up all the sides for an older baby so he or she can move around and explore.  The toys can be attached to the arches, the tummy time pillow or the play mat itself.  These included rattles and toys for this play gym are decent quality.  I particularly like the teething leaves, the giraffe and the monkey rattle.  The light up elephant that plays music is cute.  The elephant can also be attached to a car seat, although I'm not a fan of the idea of attaching a hard plastic toy on the handle of the infant carrier.  Overall this is a good and versatile baby activity gym.  It's a much better quality than the Fisher Price Moonlight gym I also reviewed recently.  The Sunny Safari theme is gender neutral so it's a good pick for first time moms who hope to use it for more than one child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17UWG9FI0MYWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAUF0PK#wasThisHelpful","R17UWG9FI0MYWH","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time I'm writing this review this play gym is listed at $69.99.  That said, it's priced to be within a few dollars of a Skip Hop or Tiny Love play gym, but the quality of the mat and toys included with this Fisher Price set don't necessarily stack up.  The round play mat really isn't ""large,"" in fact, it's kind of small compared to my Tiny Love activity gyms and even the ones I have or have had from Bright Starts and Skip Hop.  The toys it comes with are ok, but they're not anything spectacular.  I much prefer the quality of the rattles and toys that you find in an Infantino, Skip Hop or Tiny Love gym.  I will say that the little tummy pillow is one of the nicest one's I've seen with a play gym, but in my experience I've always found these items to be useless.  My children have always wiggled off of those things preferring to just do tummy time on the floor without something to prop them up.The music on the toy is something I could do without.  It's just a very cartoony kind of sound.Overall, it's a cute, but small play gym.  The toys are ok, but nothing spectacular.  There are baby activity gyms out there that have more to offer by way of size, and nicer toys for the same price or less.  Unless you're really sold on the meadow theme or the color scheme, I'd check out other play gyms before setting my heart on this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R321J5OM872LH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8VQ46Q#wasThisHelpful","R321J5OM872LH6","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not overly impressed with this crib toy.  The daytime side has some buttons and gadgets for baby to press and hear sounds, but there's no option to have songs play for more than a few seconds so this won't do much to entertain a very young baby who can't yet manipulate the toy.  The fabric has a bit of texture to it, so it will not be the easiest to surface wash which is a big problem if you have a baby with reflux since this will wind up covered in spit up.  The night time side features soothing music and lights to help your little one drift off to sleep.  What I like best about this toy is the ability to use it either on a crib or a play yard.  Attaching it to the pack and play was an easy process.Like another reviewer, I also found the battery installation to be a bit odd. You need to slide one battery to the left, another to the right and then pop on in the middle.  I suspect they could have engineered the battery compartment so installation would be a bit easier.  I wouldn't want to be navigating the battery compartment while sleep deprived.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MP9OTYKENHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONIR7Y2#wasThisHelpful","R4MP9OTYKENHS","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This two point plumb laser is a nice compact size and is easy enough to lug around.

"This Cuisipro Fine Rasp Grater is good sturdy construction.  It has a nice weight to it, but if you'll be using it for more than a short period of time, it will likely become tiresome to hold.  It is designed in such a way that you can lay it across a mixing bowl and it stays pretty stable while in use.  The teeth on this thing are super sharp.  That's great for grating up things quickly and effortlessly, but it also means you can slice through your fingers easily, too.  Thus far, our fingers have stayed safe, but I suspect it's only a matter of time before one of us makes the mistake of grating a finger.  Even the teeth on this grater are serrated, so I'd caution you to be careful while using this, especially if you are accident prone like myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VTCXZIOJAAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8BP7FA#wasThisHelpful","R33VTCXZIOJAAJ","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The keyboard is pretty small, so if you have bigger hands or are just used to using a larger keyboard, this keyboard may take a little getting used to.  It's about the size of a tablet, so you can easily slip this into a purse and take it with you.  The keyboard comes with a little stand that you can prop up a phone or tablet in.

"This is a fun apron!  I don't usually wear aprons when cooking and baking, but my kids do.  While this apron is intended for adults, it does fit kids.  The apron has one of those continuous strings that runs through tubes so you can easily adjust it to fit a child.  It fits my petite ten year old quite well.  My three and a half year old was able to wear it by me just folding under a few inch section of the mid section of the apron.  She was quite pleased to run around the kitchen while I decorated a cake pretending to be Elsa.  The apron seems to be of decent quality.  It's not super heavy weight but it's thick enough to protect your clothing from small splashes.  My only gripe with this apron has to do with the continuous string tube design.

"Most new moms-to-be register for a few different bottle types.  This Avent infant starter set will give you a nice variety of what the Avent Classic+ line of products has to offer.  The set includes three 4oz bottles with stage 1 newborn nipples, two 9oz bottles with stage 2 slow flow nipples. Using the included soft spout sippy insert and trainer handles, you can easily convert a 4oz bottle into a training sippy cup.  The starter set also includes a powdered formula/snack dispenser with removable divider, a newborn pacifier and a bottle brush.  The bottles in this set and the pacifiers are all blue, so if you want some color instead of the plain old clear bottles, these are nice.  It's a pretty blue, so you could really use these bottles for a boy or a girl, although I'm sure most would probably opt to use them for a boy.I've used Avent bottles for all four of my children, although my youngest baby isn't exactly be biggest fan of them and seems to perfer the Medela bottles over Avent.  The Classic+ bottles have one less piece to clean than the previous version of the Avent Classic bottle (In the 13 1/2 years that we've been using Avent bottles, they've come out with a few different versions.).  The Classic+ reminds me of the original Avent bottle minus the BPA.  The skirt of the nipple on the Classic+ is different from the old Classic design.  Avent says you can use the older style nipples with this bottle, but they recommend the Classic+ for this bottle.  The bottle brush that is included with this set is one of the best.  I tried many bottle brushes with my older children and this was my favorite hands down.  The pacifier is one that my children never particularly liked (our preference is Mam).  While my children never took to the Avent pacifiers, I did like that they come with a nice snap on cover to keep the nipple clean while it's in your diaper bag or purse.  It's a nice touch.  The soft silicone sippy spout is good for a baby who is just starting out with a cup, but I have found that over time,  the spout will begin leak.  The spout is essentially a flattened out nipple with a slit instead of holes so liquids will flow quickly through it.  The trainer handles are another accessory that never particularly impressed me.  My children never cared to use them, and I saw them as just another part to wash.  The handles make slipping the cup into a diaper bag bottle pouch difficult or near impossible.Overall, this set is pretty decent and would make a nice shower gift.  It's priced nicely for all that it includes.  This set will get you started with some of the essentials.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLH0IJADRCU25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF8AYMQ#wasThisHelpful","RLH0IJADRCU25","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When it comes to disposable training pants, Pull-Ups have always been my preference.  The Cool and Learn Pull-Ups are designed to give your child a cold and wet sensation when they don't make it to the potty in time.  It's essentially a potty training alert for your child.  The Pull-ups come in fun Disney character designs like Mickey, Tow Mater and Jake that little guys will like.

"When it comes to disposable training pants, Pull-Ups have always been my preference.  The Cool and Learn Pull-Ups are designed to give your child a cold and wet sensation when they don't make it to the potty in time.  It's essentially a potty training alert for your child.  The Pull-ups come in fun Disney character designs like Mickey, Tow Mater and Jake that little guys will like.

"Just like the regular pull ups, the night time pull ups feature fun Disney characters that little boys will like, only the night time ones glow in the dark.  If your child is wearing PJ pants over the pull up he's likely not going to see the glow in the dark design.  But I suppose there are kids who think it's pretty cool that the pull ups glow. The night time pull ups are more absorbent than the regular day time ones, so they're ideal if you have a heavy wetter.  I like that they have velcro sides so they can be easily taken off if you have a #2 incident.  Other brands, like the Pampers Easy Ups don't have velcro sides and I've found the design to be really awful since you have to tear the sides apart to get it off in the event of a #2.  Huggies has the better design.  I also find that these don't bunch up like the Easy Ups do.  These pull ups fit very true to size.  If you have a child in the 3T size range, the 2T/3T ones will be a bit more of a snug fit on the hips vs. the 3T/4T ones which will be a bit easier for your little one to pull up and down on his own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12AY1EOX6J861/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX1KQS8#wasThisHelpful","R12AY1EOX6J861","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son didn't like any of the Avent bottle nipples, but since all of our other kids started out using Avent sippy cups, we figured we'd give this trainer cup a shot.  I was expecting the spout on this one to be the same as the spout on the Avent classic+ trainer cup, but the shape is actually a bit different.  I think this one is a better shape for transitioning the baby to a regular hard spout sippy cup.  The handles on this cup are nicer than the handles on the Avent Classic+ trainer.  The downside to the natural trainer cup is the handles are not detachable (even though the description says they are).  Because the handles can't be removed, putting this cup in a bottle pouch in your diaper bag and even most stroller cup holders is going to be a challenge if not altogether impossible.  The cup is compatible with the My Penguin sippy cups so you can swap the pieces.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FAUOLUCUVS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF844GI#wasThisHelpful","R36FAUOLUCUVS1","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried other Seventh Generations diapers in the past with one of my older children and while I thought they were ok, I didn't think they were great.  The Touch of Cloth Diapers are a lot nicer than the other ones that had the crinkly tea stained colored outside.  I really like that the touch of cloth diapers are completely off white and have absolutely no designs on them.  The loud cartoon designs are what I like the least about the Pampers that we usually buy for our baby.  At first, I thought that the diaper might not offer as good of a fit as the Pampers Cruisers and Swaddlers we've been using, but I was surprised at how these fit our son much better.  We were already finding that the size 3 Pampers weren't fitting him as well as we would like at just 20lbs, so we had just bumped him up to size 4.  The size 3 Seventh Generation seem like they have a more generous fit than the Pampers and he looks like he will easily be able to remain in size 3 for at least a few more months.We haven't experienced any leaks with these diapers since we started using them.  They were even great for overnight.I really like these diapers and I also like that they're a bit more environmentally friendly than the disposables we typically use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10HJFQY2WNBTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOCKTUQ#wasThisHelpful","R10HJFQY2WNBTI","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The powdered formula dispenser is useful for more than just formula.  It doubles as a nice snack dispenser, too.  The three section insert is removable so you can fill the cup up with just one type of snack, or you can leave the divided insert in the cup and have three different snacks in there.  Items like Cheerios, Gerber puffs, and Goldfish crackers will all easily dispense from the snap shut opening on the lid.  I prefer this container for dispensing snacks over the snack trap cups because my little ones always figure out how to get all the contents to spill out of those snack trap containers after the first day or two of using it.  With this container, the opening is so small that even if your child turns it over with the lid open, you won't have all of the snack on the floor like you will with those other snack containers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZVQXZQ1X37PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF84ANA#wasThisHelpful","RZVQXZQ1X37PO","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of the different Avent gift sets that are available, I think this is the one that gives you the best value and variety.  The set has everything you find in the newborn starter set, plus the microwave steam sterilizer.  I have had one of these steam sterilizers with all four of my kids.  While I know there are plenty of people who will say you don't ""need"" a bottle sterilizer, it is nice to have.  It's quicker than boiling the bottles, pacifiers and pump parts in a pot of water, so for me, the convenience factor of the sterilizer makes it an essential item.This Avent infant starter set will give you a nice variety of what the Avent Classic+ line of products has to offer.  The set includes three 4oz bottles with stage 1 newborn nipples, two 9oz bottles with stage 2 slow flow nipples. Using the included soft spout sippy insert and trainer handles, you can easily convert a 4oz bottle into a training sippy cup.  The starter set also includes a powdered formula dispenser with removable divider, a newborn pacifier and a bottle brush.I've used Avent bottles for all four of my children, although my youngest baby isn't exactly the biggest fan of them and seems to prefer the Medela bottles over Avent.  The Classic+ bottles have one less piece to clean than the previous version of the Avent Classic bottle (In the 13 1/2 years that we've been using Avent bottles, they've come out with a few different versions.).  The Classic+ reminds me of the original Avent bottle minus the BPA.  The skirt of the nipple on the Classic+ is different from the old Classic design.  Avent says you can use the older style nipples with this bottle, but they recommend the Classic+ for this bottle.  The bottle brush that is included with this set is one of the best.  I tried many bottle brushes with my older children and this was my favorite hands down.  The pacifier is one that my children never particularly liked (our preference is Mam).  While my children never took to the Avent pacifiers, I did like that they come with a nice snap on cover to keep the nipple clean while it's in your diaper bag or purse.  It's a nice touch.  The soft silicone sippy spout is good for a baby who is just starting out with a cup, but I have found that the spout will leak.  It's essentially a flattened out nipple with a slit instead of holes so liquids will flow quickly through this spout.  The trainer handles are another accessory that never particularly impressed me.  My children never cared to use them, and I saw them as just another part to wash.  The handles make slipping the cup into a diaper bag bottle pouch difficult or near impossible.The powdered formula dispenser is useful for more than just formula.

"These cups are cute, but they're not the easiest cups to drink from.  If the cup has less than three ounces of liquid in it, the baby has to tilt his head back pretty far to get anything out of it.  The cup has soft grip handles which feel a lot nicer than the handles on the Avent soft spout trainer cups.  A drawback to this cup is the handles can't be removed.  Because of the handles, you can't fit this cup in a bottle pocket in a diaper bag.  The cup comes with a snap on lid to keep the spout clean.  I would be hesitant to use this cup with milk because of the deep tiny crevices in the lid around the spout.

"These breast milk storage cups are pretty nice.  They have twist on lids and can hold up to six ounces of breastmilk.  The set comes with two adaptors so you can hook it up to an Avent pump, or if you're using another brand of pump, you can use the Avent pump adaptor and hook that up to the adaptor for the storage container. I found doing that to be overkill since you wind up with a bunch of extra pieces to wash.  So I just pour out the standard bottle I use with my pump into the storage container.  If you use Avent bottles, you can use the adaptor and feed your child using either the classic or natural bottle tops.  So this storage system is pretty convenient if you use Avent bottles.  These containers are also nice for storing home made baby foods.  The screw on tops mean they won't pop open in transit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3J3501651DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF841GQ#wasThisHelpful","R2R3J3501651DX","AQYYUN3T7B0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQYYUN3T7B0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When it comes to laminating, this one does a nice job.

The release for jammed sheets is very difficult.  I had a hard time getting a laminating sheet to release once the lever was depressed.  So if you're trying to reposition something, expect that the laminating sheet is going to get messed up.

"I got this computer for word processing and page layout, so I can't speak to using it for gaming or heavy graphics work (but you would probably want a faster computer for that). For text work, it is sufficient, but has a few foibles.- Screen.  The screen is just under 8.5"" by 15"", which supports having two almost-full-sized  pages side-by-side. (Two full sized 8.5x11 pages would need 8.5x22, but some of that is margin).  The screen is nice and sharp for text work. I've also watched a few SD videos, and those were ok, but don't expect to get anywhere near the claimed six-hour battery life if you're using this as a media machine (the battery is swappable however, which is a very nice feature).- Noise.  If you put the machine up to your ear you can hear the ocean. Or maybe Xiamen. (but seriously...) The fan isn't silent, but mostly just sounds like a gentle whooshing.  The noise is louder when the machine is warmer, which is to be expected, but the laptop doesn't heat up as much as I expected it to - maybe because the components aren't as tightly packed as in my smaller machine.- Keyboard.  The keyboard is a mixed blessing. On the one hand (literally), the keys have good key travel and a nice click-tactile feel (and they're full sized!).  On the other hand, there is a distracting metallic rattle while you type.  I've seen this on other machines, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's a poor quality keyboard (maybe just metal switches instead of plastic), but it's distracting. The keyboard surface also has a bit of flex to it.- Touchpad.  The touchpad is again a mixed blessing. The left and right button areas also have a nice tactile click to them, and I have no complaints about the pad itself. The laptop surface on either side of the touch pad, however, has the slightly tacky rubberized coating you sometimes find in electronics. AND, inasmuch as the machine is running Windows 8.1 (at the moment), this means a side-swipe onto the touchpad starts on a surface that's rubberized and tacky.  I HATE this. Will Windows 10 be better?  Unlikely.  Did Dell do this intentionally, as a little rumble-strip for your fingers?  Maybe. But I'm going to put some duct tape next to the touch pad.So, this is a good computer, especially for the price. But not a great one.

"I've been using the same Miele canister vacuum for almost 20 years, and buying bags for it from Amazon almost as long. As such, I was happy to get this Dyson to compare. I found the Dyson cordless to have some major advantages over the Miele, but also enough disadvantages that I can't recommend buying it as your only vacuum.Pros:- Cordless. My Miele neatly retracts its cord, but it's still tethered. You can take the Dyson cordless out to the car, or up to the attic, or wherever, and use it with a wand or without. The Dyson is much more versatile than a canister, and has much better reach than a dustbuster.- Great on stairs. The floor tool picks up dust all the way to the edges and back of the treads (though you'll need to swap to a smaller tool to get between any balusters). And, as noted, it's cordless.- No bags. The dust goes into a clear cylinder right below the handle, so you can admire your progress, and that dust container empties from the bottom when you hold it over a trash can (but more on that below).- Attachments. There are about a dozen different attachments and accessories available from Amazon and from Dyson-dot-com.Cons:- Cordless. This is really a mixed blessing. The vacuum needs 3.5 hours of charge to give you at best 20 minutes of vacuuming time (less if you use the floor tool, or ""Max"" suction). There is no way to swap out batteries, and no easy way to use the Dyson while plugged in.- Loud. Is it really that much louder than my Miele, or is it just that the motor is roughly two feet from my ear, instead of on the floor?  Doesn't matter - it's loud.- Not so great on furniture. There is an optional crevasse tool (aka couch tool) and a mattress tool available. But remember, when you're using those, there will be a whole vacuum body between you and what you're cleaning - not just a hose.- Dusty. The clear dust-catching cylinder leaks a tiny bit from the bottom, and some of the exhaust from the vacuum is basically pointed right at your face. If you have asthma or dust allergies, consider this before buying. The system also releases some dust when emptying - Dyson suggests putting the whole assembly in a clear plastic bag to empty it if you have dust issues. So much for not using a bag.- Unattached filter cone. The washable filter cone sits in the top of the vacuum body, but has nothing to attach it in place. When I first unpacked the vacuum I thought it must be missing some sort of cap to hold that in, but no, the instructions just say to not turn the vacuum upside down or the filter cone will fall out (along with a lot of dust). Mmm k.- No kick stand.  OK, vacuums don't typically have a kick stand. But there's no way to set this down except in its docking station or horizontally on the floor (or on the couch I guess, just don't accidentally turn it over). I'm thinking of sewing it a shoulder strap.- Lame docking station. Unlike most vacuum docking stations I've seen (two connection points, and the vacuum gently snaps in), the Dyson docking station has an elaborate spring system to hold the vacuum, and a pin-style power connector that has to be attached to the station when you first install it. (Don't screw this up, or you'll have to pry things apart again with a screwdriver).  The docking station has places for two attachments (three if you leave one attached to the vacuum body), but there's no place to store other attachments if you buy them, and you can't store two wide attachments next to each other. To remove the vacuum from the docking station with the wand and floor tool still attached, you'll need about two feet of clearance in front of the docking station for everything to swing forward - something to consider if you were going to put this in a closet.- Itchy trigger. There is no on/off switch, just a trigger. You have to hold the trigger down to run the machine, which is ok, since you didn't want to use up your 20 minutes accidentally anyway, and the trigger is really easy to pull. However, the manual has all sorts of warnings about not pressing the trigger while emptying the machine or trying to clear a blockage, and, while there's no way to lock the trigger on, there's also no way to lock the trigger OFF. It's *really* easy to accidentally press this.Meh:- I confess that Dyson has that panache thing going. They have cool ads, and the box comes with a little booklet titled ""The Story of Dyson,"" and they're basically Apple for vacuums. (The folks at Gizmodo love the new ""Fluffy"" version of this device. http://gizmodo.com/stop-swiffering-1715262802  However, the folks at Gizmodo are getting paid). Whether all this really matters is up to you. Personally, I'm sticking with my Miele.

The pans are made in China).These pans are made from a nice heavy-gauge carbon steel (about the same weight as Granite Ware Better Browning pans), and have a fully rolled rim to add additional stability. The coating does have some thin spots where the black undercoat can be barely made out (not unusual with this kind of spray-on manufacturing), but I don't think it will effect the non-stick performance. I'm more concerned that the pans aren't dishwasher safe, something that isn't mentioned at all in the product description.The box comes with a list of tips and warnings that will be familiar to anyone who uses nonstick (no metal utensils, don't use cooking spray, etc.). One of those warnings is to not have pets or small children in the vicinity when baking - is this general advice, or are there potentially harmful fumes associated with these pans if they overheat, like there is with Teflon?  A call to the Customer Service number referred me to the Meyer website, potsandpans.com, where my research was inconclusive - http://meyer.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/kw/fumes/search/1Cake pans are vastly easier to work with if they are non-stick, and I am happy to have these.

"Anyone who uses an ultrasonic humidifier knows the glug-glug-glug.  You fill the reservoir in the sink (or shower, if your sink is too small), you turn the reservoir upside down, and the water glugs into base.  Every once in a while you get another glug, to let you know your humidifier is working.This device is glug-free.  No reservoir - the ultrasonic module floats in its bowl (or any water-filled vessel), the bowl gets filled and re-filled from the top, and, as the water level goes down, so does the ultrasonic module.  The device can be completely taken apart for cleaning, and almost everything (except the actual electronics) is washable. Why didn't someone think of this sooner?!I only have two beefs - first, while the instructions warn you to not run the module unless it's in water, there's no alarm or auto-shutoff. I usually sleep with the humidifier on if I need one, so I'm going to have to get a really big bucket to put it in.  Second, the optional control module (included, but only necessary if you want to adjust the mist volume) is nicely designed to match the form factor of the device, but the cone at the top is smooth not knurled in any way, which makes it much harder to grip and twist. The mark to indicate the setting is also very faint, and hard to see in dimmer light.  So, four stars.(Vital statistics - the cord is about 4.5 feet from the plug-in power supply to the control module, and about another five feet from the control module to the device. The device itself is very light weight, and about 8.5"" in diameter and 9"" tall with the nozzle. Both the power supply and the control module have a bright green LED power light).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXL1DOMLWO0IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQHABI2#wasThisHelpful","RXL1DOMLWO0IN","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already get Big Tree coconut nectar at my local health food store, which also stocks Coconut Secret (both are also sold by Amazon). I expected I would be doing a comparison.  Not so.  This coconut palm syrup is bona fide SYRUP.  Not quite as thick as honey, more like agave nectar, but definitely not the thin (though equally delicious) coconut nectar I'm used to getting.The syrup is very like agave nectar in taste as well, with a slight caramel finish that's heavier than brown sugar, but not as fruity as maple. There is only one ""darkness"" available, which is somewhere between amber and blonde coconut nectars. The syrup will be excellent in tea where you might use honey (or in baking banana bread), but it's probably a bit much for plain coffee (though if you're one of those types who drinks hazelnut vanilla swill, go for it).The bottle is PETE, with a flip cap. There is no indication of country of origin on the bottle or website (http://wholesomesweet.com/product/organic-coconut-palm-syrup/).

"Step 1: clean your window thoroughly to remove any dirt or dust particles.Step 2: clean the room thoroughly to remove any dirt or dust particles.Step 3: you just got more dust on the window.

Go back to Step 1.Step 6: with two hands, hold the top corners of the film steady on the window. With your third hand, squeegee out any air bubbles. If the squeegee doesn't work, you didn't use enough water. Go back to Step 4.  If the film is sliding down the window, you used too much water.

The film does cut down glare and heat transfer (and is way cheaper than getting new low-e windows). And, oh joy, it comes with a squeegee and cutter knife (but not with the eye protection, hand protection, lint-free cloth, scotch tape, and tape measure also required). But, if you've ever tried to put on a screen protector, you know that every little bit of dust and bubble is going to show, and you need to be obsessive about controlling that. Now imagine doing this on a roughly 3x5 foot surface. With a film that's very, very thin and clingy. Vertically.If you can get this to look good it will work well. If you were planning on installing this in the rec room, with the shag carpet, the beanbag chairs, and the poodle, forget it.(Pro tip - if you do decide to install this, run an air filter for 24 hours ahead of time, then turn it off when you are about to do the actual install.

"I have a mixed marriage - I'm PC, and hubby is Mac. So my first question when receiving this keyboard was if it worked across platforms.  Mostly it does.I was able to connect the Keys-To-Go to an iPhone 5, iPhone 6, Dell Venue tablet, HTC1 M8, and original (first generation) iPad. The alphanumeric keys worked flawlessly, and the Function, Command/Windows, Control, and Alt/Option keys worked mostly as expected for each respective OS. There is no Menu key, Esc key, or PageUp/PageDn/Home/End (on the actual Keys-To-Go Keyboard for Android and Windows those last four are mapped to the arrow keys - on the Apple version the left and right arrow are used for Select Word).The keyboard also includes iOS specific hotkeys and those got some odd responses. The complete list of hotkeys are - Home, Switch applications, Search, Switch language, Virtual keyboard (why?), Screen shot, Previous track, Play/Pause, Next track, Mute, Volume down, Volume up. All hotkeys worked as expected on the iPhone 5 and 6, though the antique iPad didn't give me screen shot. However, when I tried listening to Amazon streaming music on the Android phone, for example, volume and pause worked ok but not mute. Other stuff was similarly variable. Some of this is due to cross-platform issues, some is due to the individual program.The keyboard can only speak to one device at a time, but swapping it between devices is pretty easy -  just turn on Bluetooth on the device you want to connect to, press the Bluetooth button on the keyboard until the indicator light does fast blue flash, and then add the keyboard when it shows up on the other device's Bluetooth list (depending on settings you may also have to enter a passcode on the keyboard as a security measure). A few times I have had problem with pairing - per the Logitech knowledge base (http://support.logitech.com/product/keys-to-go-ipad), that can usually be fixed by ""forgetting"" the Keys-to-Go on the other device and then re-finding it, but sometimes I've had to turn everything off and on again and start over. With the Dell in particular, the pair process has timed out, which is irritating (I blame Dell).WRT to ergonomics, the keyboard does manage to be click-tactile in a very thin and slight squishy package, which is impressive. There is a bit of flex to the keyboard itself, so it's hard to type well on your lap with it without some harder backing surface. The key pitch (center-to-center) for the letter keys is less than 3/4 inch, so no this is not a full-sized keyboard. There is also only one Ctrl key (on the left), and for some reason it's really easy to hit Caps Lock accidentally. So the keyboard is not ergonomically perfect. Still pretty good, however.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T37PKENLMJXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0I71S4#wasThisHelpful","R3T37PKENLMJXU","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must confess - I didn't get these for incontinence. I got them because the first few days of my period are so heavy I have to get up in the middle of the night to change the ""overnight"" pad, or risk waking up in a puddle.  Inasmuch as I have also done patient care for non-ambulatory patients, however, I have a good sense of what works for adult diapers. These briefs are definitely not diapers, but are a step up from piddle pads, and much more convenient (if the wearer is dressing themself). As the manufacturer says, ""moderate"" protection.FIT and FEEL - The ""fabric"" has a slightly waxy, crepe-papery feel, way better than a plastic backing, but not quite as breathable as cotton underwear. A bit of powder would go a long way on a hot day to make that better. The waistband stretches from 24 inches (completely unstretched) to more than 40 inches (though that would fit like a Speedo). Because of that range of sizes, there is some fabric bunching, especially around the leg holes - not too bulky, but you probably couldn't wear these invisibly under yoga pants (despite the promo picture with the nice towels in the background). I wish there were four sizes instead of two.ABSORBENCY - Like the description says, these are ""moderate."" The pad is quite thin, though wider than a napkin or piddle pad, and extends to the middle of the pubic bone in front, but not quite to the bottom of the tail bone in back. The fabric of the brief itself will stop some leaks, even beyond the edges of the pad, but I wouldn't use these for someone who was fully incontinent, and they're not meant for fecal incontinence.DISCRETION - There are many nice little touches that help maintain wearer privacy. For example, the cardboard box these come in has a large ""D"" on it, but nowhere says ""Depends,"" and inside the box the briefs themselves are packed in two plastic packs of 30 each that are roughly 12"" x 12"" by 5"" - just the right size to slip into a dresser or vanity drawer.  The fabric makes a tiny bit of crinkly noise when you walk, but you would have to be in a totally silent space to really hear it.SEAM - Nothing is perfect. My one real complaint about these is the thick horizontal seam that runs across the middle of the back (you can see it in the picture with the brief inside out).  I'm moderately sensitive to seams in odd places, and can mostly ignore it.  Some people are *very* sensitive to seams in odd places, and, if that person were also non-verbal, they might wind up digging in their pants to get at it, which would result in an unpleasant interaction between the wearer and their caregiver. If this is an issue for your situation, it should be considered before buying.For my own purposes these are working well - the included pad acts as a literal backup to the overnite pad (though I wish it were about three inches longer in back), and the disposable brief lets me avoid the little pile of ""to be soaked"" underwear in the bathroom.  Hopefully my description will be of help in other situations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJE3AS4AVHEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U16LTP8#wasThisHelpful","REJE3AS4AVHEP","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note - this review is for the Fine Rasp version).  I've been a Microplane fan since way back, but I'm always happy to get another kitchen gadget, so I was thrilled to find this. As the title says, it's a good grater, but has a few foibles you should be aware of before purchasing.Pros:- Sharp!  Definitely not the dollar store version where they punch a bunch of holes in metal and hope for the best.  The teeth on this thing are actually teeth-shaped, with a sculpted blade on the end that will make short work of even fibrous stuff like ginger and coconut.- Solid.  The handle feels like solid metal, perhaps even a bit too heavy, and is knurled for a better grip (no plastic grip that will eventually break down, and I'm looking at you Oxo).  The side-rails supporting the grating surface are robust, and not going to bend any time soon.- Big. The whole device is thirteen inches long, with about six of that being useful grating surface. The rail on the end will stabilize the grater on a bowl or cutting board. All good.- V-shaped hole arrangement.  Not just a gimmick - this really does seem to make it easier to keep stuff in the middle of the grater.- Comes with a blade cover that can be reversed and used for measuring. A nice touch, though it only works on dry stuff like hard cheese, and is pointless on veggies (see picture).Cons:- Heavy.  Robust is good, but the grater is almost too heavy.  Great if you want stability, but you really need to rest it on a surface to grate, not just hold it up in your hand.- No shuttle. The downside of ""Sharp!"" is that it also applies to fingers as well as carrots. The demo video shows the cook wearing cut-proof glove, but a shuttle to hold the food and protect the fingers would be a whole lot easier.- Slightly confusing cover. The cover looks like it slides on over the end, but if you try to do that it goes almost all the way on and then hangs up on the end rail.  It actually snaps on from the front. Ok.- No hanging loop. A personal preference, YMMV.- Spot welded grating plate. The grating plate is not wrapped around the supports (which would make this much more expensive to manufacture), or embedded in plastic (which does create longevity issues, and I'm looking at you Microplane), but rather folded and spot welded to the inside of the support rails. This creates a pretty substantial crud trap on the backside of the grater (see picture).  In gadgets, as in life, all creation involves compromise.- The grater is, of course, made in China.Overall, I think this is a good mid-range, mid-price gadget.  I'll probably stick with my Microplane, mostly because of the shuttle issue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ENTZ8VTWD10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8BP7FA#wasThisHelpful","R31ENTZ8VTWD10","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a Honeywell HEPA air purifier for years (the Honeywell Long-Life Pure HEPA QuietCare Air Purifier, 17000). Inasmuch as it sounds like a jet engine, and looks like an orthopedic shoe, however, and inasmuch as the filters and pre-filters (purchased separately) aren't cheap (even on Amazon), I was thrilled to get this Frigidaire to compare.  I guess I got a bad one.The general whooshing noise is definitely quieter on the Frigidare as compared to the Honeywell, and, on the ""quiet"" setting is barely noticeable.  There is another noise, however, kind of a high-pitched whine, that is quite noticeable and annoying.  It's actually worse on the quiet setting, since there is no whoosh to drown it out. Turning on and off the ionization and UV didn't change this, nor did opening the device and re-seating the paper filter insert.  Nothing appears to be loose. It just whines. Did I get a bad one, or is my hearing just more sensitive?WRT to other operations, the Honeywell pushes the air out almost straight up, and sucks it in from the side. The Frigidaire pulls air in one side and pushes it out the other - hard enough that you could use it for a room fan. My general sense (given allergies and asthma) is that the Honeywell does a better job of clearing pollen and dust, but the Honeywell doesn't have the UV or ionization features, so wouldn't work as well on smaller particles. The replacement filters are also much more expensive, compared to the Frigidaire - Genuine Frigidaire 68661 Allergen and Foam Air Cleaner Filters for FRAP18K5OB and FRAP22D7OB, 1 Allergen and 1 Pre-Filter.

"My phone lives in the left side pocket of my cargo pants.  But, when I get into my car, it launches itself out of the left side pocket, and plays hide and seek on the floor of the car. As such, I was delighted to get this clip to review.The clip is actually a threefer - it works as a belt clip, with a slot that's about two inches long and a quarter inch wide, in which case you twist the phone 90 degrees to get it to release from the clip; it works as a pocket clip, since the outside of the clip opens up, in which case you pry open the very stiff clip but leave it attached to the phone; and it also works as a kickstand, propping up the phone in landscape mode, which makes up for the fact that the anchor glued to the back of your phone case means the phone will no longer lay flat.  So far so good.Nothing is perfect, however, The quick-release mechanism consists of a hard plastic square that glues to the back of your phone case (in my case, an Otterbox Commuter), and a magnetic/mechanical socket for that plastic square on the back of the clip. Good in that the clip can be attached to the phone in any of the four orientations, and can be removed with a simple twist. Bad in that this assembly sits above the surface of the phone case, which creates a second slot that catches on your belt or pocket or whatever, which then forces you to use two hands when clipping on your phone - one to hold the phone, and one to guide the fabric or belt (See picture. Orange not included).Nothing is perfect, and holding the pocket fabric while I'm attaching the phone is still better than going phone-fishing under the carseat.

"I'm allergic to honey, so I'm always looking for other similar things to use as an alternative.

"When I get a migraine, I really just want everything to shut up and go away.  I was hoping this pillow would help - gentle calming aroma, a nice cool surface, a wide shape and dark fabric that helps shut out the light, and relatively heavy stuffing that keeps it all in place.

"We're a hummus, tzatziki, and pimiento cheese eating household, so when I saw this newly released on Amazon I jumped on it. A month later it self-destructed (stalled, grinding/slipping gear noise, actual *smoke* wafting from the motor housing). I bought another one.The chopper has to be coddled:- Big chunks won't chop efficiently. My pimiento cheese recipe calls for an eight ounce brick of cheddar, and I cut that into half-inch chunks before putting it in the chopper. For tzatziki the cucumber gets cored, and then cut into quarters. I have managed to get it to chop bigger pieces, but it's not worth the time you spend scraping stuff down (see second item).- You have to scrape stuff down. The above-mentioned cheese chunks get put in the bowl with two ounces of cream cheese, and two ounces of mayo. The resulting mash really likes sticking to the clear plastic shield/lid of the chopper, or to the side of the bowl above the blades. So, after about ten seconds of processing I open the bowl and scrape the chunks back down (takes about four iterations before the cheese is chopped enough to stay put at the bottom of the bowl). The cukes have a similar problem, and so would any wet-ish vegetable.- You can't process tiny amounts. Some of the recipes in the included pamphlet call for chopping one clove of garlic. Forget it. The tips of the blades are about a quarter-inch away from the inside of the glass bowl, and the clove will get cut into roughly eight pieces, all of which will then stick to the sides. Much better to use a garlic press right into the bowl with the other ingredients. (See photo for how the blades look in the bowl).- You can't process huge amounts either.  Three cups is about max for pastes, less for liquids.- You can't process for more than about thirty seconds at a time. If you hold down one of the buttons the machine will process continuously, but the motor gets hot, and needs to rest and cool down (which is fine, since you're going to be scraping the sides down anyway).- The ""safety"" feature is just a cutoff in the blade assembly that keeps it from rotating unless the blade shaft is being pressed down. Putting the entire chopper together will do that, but if you leave the shield off the blades will move anyway, and, if you were so inclined, you could get the blades to rotate by just pressing up on the bottom of the shaft with your hand (DO NOT try this at home).- Not a coddle issue, but, while the bowls and lids look just like the Pyrex four-cup equivalents, they are B&D branded and apparently made in China. :-(So, why am I buying another one? Because the bowls, blade, shield, and gasket, basically everything that touches the food, can go right in the dishwasher, and the bowls come with lids and can go right in the fridge.  Also, I vastly prefer processing food in glass (though of course the blade assembly has a plastic shaft, but at least it's not polycarbonate). I sincerely hope Black & Decker will continue this line with a bigger bowl and a more powerful motor. For now, this is filling the spot in my batterie de kitchenette between the immersion blender and the mandoline, and it will stay there.-----------------------------------Pimiento cheese recipe: eight ounce brick of supermarket cheddar (chunked), two ounces of cream cheese, two ounces of mayo, teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, shake of paprika, shake of cayenne (to taste), four whole pimiento peppers (from the jar).

Add the pimientos and pulse a few times until they shred.Tzatziki: Two regular cucumbers (seeded and peeled, cut into quarters), clove of garlic (pressed), juice of a half a large lemon (or a very small one), two cups of Greek yogurt, salt to taste. Pulse the cukes, lemon juice, and pressed garlic until it looks grated, Take the lid off the chopper and mix in yogurt and salt by hand (don't process the yogurt, or you will have delicious cucumber soup).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWKQXGMKIEBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK13Y#wasThisHelpful","R2DWKQXGMKIEBB","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The purple jars are very rich and pretty, almost an amethyst color. The other two colors are lighter. The green is not quite Coke-bottle color, more Mountain Dew. The blue is almost an electric blue - not what I would expect to see in a vintage jar.In shape and form these jars are about the same as regular Ball mason jars - they hold a pint, they have the Ball logo on one side (the blue one says ""perfect mason,"" the green and purple say ""perfection,"" and ""improved"" respectively""), and they have ounce and milliliter measuring marks (on two sides for the blue, and one side for the green and purple). The fourth side says  ""1913-1915/100 years of American heritage/Made in USA."" The jars come with canning lids and rings, and will take Ball storage caps. The plastic caps from most pint and quart sized glass mayonnaise jars also fit.We use Ball jars for drinking glasses (hot and cold) as well as storage, and I've bought a six pack every time a new color came out. They definitely add a bit of elegance to the iced tea.

"PC-based graphic artists have been hit with two frustrations in recent years - Adobe's heinous new pricing scheme, and Microsoft's slightly less heinous reworking of MS Paint. I had high hopes that this program would help address the first issue. No such luck. But it's an awesome Paint program.WRT Photoshop - the program claims Photoshop compatibility, and this is true, inasmuch as it can open .psd files. It even preserves layers. What it doesn't do is bring in anything path- or object-based -- no splines, no fills, no reshaping, no manipulations that aren't bitmap/pixel rendering. If you thought the price for this as a Photoshop replacement was too good to be true, you were right.WRT Paint - this does everything you ever wanted from that toy. Layers (as mentioned above), a much less useless zoom feature, all sorts of fun brushes and effects (with stylus pressure support), pixel-based transforms, and even a better-designed color mixer. Sweet.Once I stopped expecting too much from it, the program was a lot of fun to play with, with a few annoyances. First annoyance -- the help function takes you to the help files for Painter itself, not Essentials. So, you will read about this cool feature, and then, at the bottom of the page, be presented with an apologetic ""Some features described in the Help are available only in Corel Painter 2015, and are not included in Painter Essentials 5. For more information about Corel Painter 2015, visit http://www.painterartist.com/""  (which is a store link). Essentials is the teaser for the more expensive program (which does support paths), and Corel makes no attempt to hide this. Second, as with all Corel's graphics programs, this software can only be installed once. Were you planning on changing machines any time soon?  Well, unless the first machine fails catastrophically, you can't take this with you.Given the relatively low price of this package, I would still recommend it to budding artists and fingerpainting kids of all ages. It's not a professional tool, however, and doesn't really claim to be.(Note - if you're looking for a real artist tool in this price range, check out Autodesk's Sketchbook Pro. That has a much steeper learning curve, and is still bitmap-based, but does a much better job of emulating a real drawing board workflow.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQIYX1HWCCTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMQLNJK#wasThisHelpful","R3UQIYX1HWCCTS","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the same Cuisinart blender for a couple of decades, because it has a glass jar, and because it lets you select the speed with a slider instead of buttons. Needless to say, I was ecstatic to get this modern equivalent to compare. I am now less ecstatic.Form Factor:- The machine is about eighteen inches high, so it will fit neatly under your upper kitchen cabinets.- The non-glass parts appear to be ABS plastic, or silicone. Both are relatively innocuous plastics (unlike PVC or polycarbonate).- The glass ""goblet"" is a heavy beast, actually heavier than the base, which makes the blender a bit top heavy. OTOH the goblet also has a wide bottom and is stable standing on its own, which is a feature.- The goblet can be dishwasher-ed, but according to the instructions the blade assembly has to be hand washed (bummer).- There is a stirring wand that fits into the hole in the lid (usually covered by the fill cap), so that, when you're making soups or smoothies, you can stir up the blender contents while the blender is running.  I would have liked to see a holder for this on the side or back of the machine, but no such luck.Ergonomics:- Knob. When I saw the picture of the machine I was worried that the pulse function was a big button in the middle of the knob (which, given my shiny granite counters, would have left me chasing the machine all over the kitchen).  Not so. The knob gets turned counter-clockwise to pulse, and clockwise to select either ""on"" (which activates the program buttons), or, past that, to select a range from min to max. Nicely done. HOWEVER - the labels for these settings are not incised in any way, they're simply printed onto the rim of the knob, right where your fingers are going to grip the knob to turn it. It's not clear how long those labels are going to last.- Buttons. Once the knob is set to ""on,"" the six program buttons light up. Once a button is pushed, that button will remain lit while the program runs its course, and the others will temporarily darken - all will turn back on again once the program is done. Since the programs stop and re-start the motor, I strongly suggest you train yourself to check the button lights to see if a program is done, not just listen to the motor noise and look at the goblet contents, lest you open the goblet prematurely and be rudely surprised.Usage:- Leakage. The motor is powerful enough to torque the machine sideways when starting up, which I thought was pretty cool, until, after about 20 minutes of putting the blender through its paces, I noticed my counter (and floor) filling with water. The motor is also powerful enough to loosen the blade assembly from the bottom of the goblet - if you are going to do several blends one after the other, I suggest you stop periodically to retighten everything. There is what appears to be a vent hole on the lower back of the base, which, it turns out, is actually a drain for the goblet socket. (Much better to have liquid pouring out the bottom of the base than potentially running into the motor). There does not appear to be any way to get into that channel to clean it, if your leak involves something other than water. I fear for what the starting jerk is going to do to the plastic chassis in the long run.- Capacity. The promo picture for this blender shows it full of neatly cracked ice. Which I'm assuming the photographer got from the ice machine down the hallway. According to the included instructions, the machine's ""max. recommend capacity"" for crushing ice is 200 grams, or seven ounces. This will get you one margarita. The capacity is the same for grinding nuts, spices, and coffee beans, and slightly higher (250 grams/nine ounces) for chopping vegetables. Only cold liquids can be blended at the full (more than 1.5 quart) capacity of the machine.  As a side note, the instructions are kind enough to translate the Metric grams into ounces for us Americans, but those ounces refer to weight not volume.- Performance. Other reviewers have already sung the praises of the blender when making cream soups and smoothies. Since the machine will also grind spices and coffee beans, I tried it out with some dry rice on that setting to see if I could get a coarse rice meal to make idli. The result was excellent - coarser than rice flour, but a bit finer than commercial cream of rice cereal, and very consistent. Trying to crack rice to make jook was less wonderful, inasmuch as I used the pulse function, and got lots of whole grains mixed in with the pieces. In both cases, the seven ounce limit means the process will be a tad frustrating.If this were a hundred dollar blender, I would have no qualms about giving it five stars.  For this price, however, given the machine's limitations, I can't recommend it to someone looking for a versatile kitchen appliance. If all you wanted was a really pretty smoothie maker, go for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4MOWANDK8US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOAEH8E#wasThisHelpful","R2R4MOWANDK8US","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not unusual for an anthology to span a writer's career.  Somewhat more unusual for it to start in high school. This one does, and, as the author himself admits, the early stuff is terrible. (I'm not complaining mind you - the first couple of stories are actually charming, in a teenaged author kind of way).Each story in this collection starts with a bit of commentary: sometimes a self-critique, sometimes a note about the real-world inspiration for the piece, sometimes a bit of context. Budding writers will enjoy reading about someone else's underpinnings, and misgivings. Authors are people too.The timeline of the stories runs from 1963 to 2009.

"We have a complicated shower - there's an Aquasana water filter attached to the showerhead, a handshower with a hose, and a border on the (fake, acrylic) tiles that sticks out a bit from the wall.  In addition, there is a Very Tall Person using the shower who really wants his shelves and such to be a bit higher than typical.  So, I was a bit concerned that this Oxo Shower Shelf wouldn't fit.It fits beautifully. There's plenty of clearance for the filter. The wire support doesn't interfere with the hose (though the filter pushes the clamp forward a bit, which also helps). And the whole thing sits a little bit away from the wall, due to the thickness of the suction cups, which is just enough to clear the tile border.The designers didn't build in any height adjustment. What we did (which seems to be working) is to snap off the hook/clamp that's supposed to be at the top, to attach to your showerhead pipe, and move it to the wire on the side. This gave us a couple of inches, though it does mean the shelf is a tad off-center.I do wish there was a real way to adjust the height, or even other versions of the shelf for higher or lower placements. So 4.5 stars.

"I adore my Kyocera Vertical Peeler, but it only has a blade on one side (Your kitchen will need a left-handed cook for carrots, and a right-handed cook for potatoes). So I was thrilled to discover that Kyocera had added this gadget to its line.Unfortunately, the peeler is a disappointment. First, because the peels themselves are quite thick, which is great for rutabagas and celery root, where you want to take off a lot of skin, but terrible for carrots and potatoes, where you wind up with half your vegetable in the sink strainer. Second, because the handle is weirdly uncomfortable. The notch for your forefinger is just a bit too far away from the blade, and the handle is at an odd angle, which makes peeling round things held in the other hand feel just a bit awkward.I adore the Kyocera blades, and I really hope they'll come out with a two-side version of the old peeler. I use this one for thick-skinned veggies, but I wouldn't buy it again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CPY65ENKLA93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLYHIHM#wasThisHelpful","R2CPY65ENKLA93","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I already have a Zojirushi Electric Skillet (purchased from Amazon about a year ago), but it's not big enough for potlucks or holidays, so I was glad to get this De'Longhi to compare.  The De'Longhi is nice and big, but has some foibles.PROS:- BIG. The inside is 3 inches deep, 11.5 inches wide, and 15 inches long (measured at the widest part of the interior, since the sides are bowed out a bit). So not only does it hold a lot of food for stews and sautes, you'll have no trouble using it as a griddle. (The exterior length is 19.5, which fits nicely front to back on a countertop).- Dial. The thermostat has a real dial you can turn, not electronic pushbuttons like some other similar models, with a red light that goes on when the skillet is heating. (However, see below under CONS).- Pretty fast. Four quarts of water fill the skillet to about halfway up, and it took just a hair over ten minutes to get that to a simmer (one bubble every few seconds, tap cold water, lid on), and just over 18 minutes to a full boil (constant bubbles).  When I turned the temperature down the water came off boil almost instantly.  There is only one heating loop, which is where the bubbles appeared first, but the pan metal is thick so the diffusion is pretty good.- Accurate.  I brought the pan to full boil with the knob set to the highest setting (400), and when I turned the knob down the thermostat light went off at about 220.- The handles can be used when the controls are in place.  It's an odd complaint, I know, but some similar skillets have a thermostat that is so close to the handle that you can't use the handle when the skillet is plugged in.CONS:- Watch your fingers. The insides of the handles don't fully cover the sides of the pot, and the sides of the pot get quite hot.  If you have long fingers it's a little too easy to accidentally touch hot metal (the instructions say to be very careful when moving a pot that's plugged in, or to avoid doing so at all, but even after the pot is unplugged the contents and surface will be hot for quite a while).- Misleading light. The thermostat light turns off when the skillet is above the set temperature (because the heating coil is not on), and turns back on again when the skillet has dropped below the set temperature (because the heating coil went on again automatically). The lowest temperature setting is ""warm,"" not ""off"" - to turn the skillet fully off you have to unplug it. Inasmuch as having the light off doesn't signify that the skillet is turned off, and inasmuch as turning the dial all the way down sets the temperature to ""warm"" not ""off"" (which will turn the light and the heating coil off, but only temporarily), this might be a hazard for people unfamiliar with this kind of equipment.- Plastic inside the lid. Some people prefer not to have plastic touching their hot food, but the handle for this lid has a plastic base on the inside of the lid, right where steam will rise and condense. I think this is to support the vent built into the handle, but I would rather lose the vent and the plastic (the lid lets out more steam around the edges than from the vent anyway).- Non-magnetic cord. The cord for the skillet is detachable, but it goes deeply into the pan body when it is attached. Thus, if the skillet is plugged in and the cord is accidentally caught, or if a kid reaches up and pulls on the cord, the skillet could potentially be dragged off a table or countertop. The Zojirushi has a magnetic cord base, which will detach if the cord is yanked. Much safer if there are little ones running around.Overall, I think this is a good skillet, but not a great one.  It will be an excellent warmer for potlucks, but I'll probably keep using the Zojirushi for stewing and sauteing at home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OPI7XAVTRIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VRIU78#wasThisHelpful","R24OPI7XAVTRIV","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was concerned, when I saw the picture of this device, that it would be a little tippy, and that it would interfere with the speakers on the iPhone. In fact, the designers did the right thing - the inside of the slot has a little raised bit that the phone rests on, so the speakers aren't blocked at all (it even has a bit of wiggle for strain relief on the connectors), and the charger is nice and hefty.My iPhone has a thin silicone skin, which fits fine in the charger, but something thick like an Otterbox clearly wouldn't fit.  My only beef is that I can't plug in headphones while the phone is charging, though apparently some other Belkin chargers do support this (I would settle for a notch so I could plug in an angle connector - since the inside of the charger has rubber cushioning, I'm tempted to cut one).UPDATE: My previous phone had an Otterbox case, and I felt naked without one, so I decided to take the plunge and see if I could get it to work. I bought an Otterbox Commuter (not the thicker Defender), and carefully cut off the tab that covers the charging port. I then carefully pared down the base of the connector inside the dock (basically just changed the rounded ends to pointed ends). It works! The slot of the dock is wide enough to fit the Commuter, and since there's a bit of play it the connector you can get it to mate properly. If you have a steady hand, and are willing to take an x-acto knife to sixty bucks worth of electronics accessories, you can in fact get this stand to work with an Otterbox.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BUK378YKRBW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJI4U#wasThisHelpful","R3BUK378YKRBW7","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a long-time Prismacolor user (with occasional forays into Crayola pencils), I was happy to get these to review. They are actually made by the folks who make Derwent pencils, a well-known drawing pencil brand in its own right.On a scale of soft-and-waxy to hard-and-chalky (with Prismacolor Scholars being at the far end of wax, regular Prismacolors not far behind, Crayola somewhere in the middle, and Prismacolor Verithins being at the far end of hard) the Mead/Derwent pencils are somewhere between Crayola and Verithin.  This will work well for a drawing technique that involves laying down many light layers, either of the same or mixed colors, and also makes for a nice precise edge.  Getting solid coverage with one hard stroke is easier with a softer pencil, however, as is blending in general. (Depending on the tooth of your paper, you may wind up with a nice pointillism effect here).  Derwent makes a blender, which I don't have, but my Prismacolor blender did smooth the laydown on these somewhat, though not as well as it would have with the Prismacolors or P Scholars. (Pro-tip - you can blend regular, non-twistable, non-erasable, Crayola pencils with the sharp back edge of the pencil itself. You can't do that with these).My biggest beef with this set, however, is the included colors, which are: Cadmium Yellow, Orange, Red, Purple, Ultramarine, Light Blue, Light Green, Dark Green, Yellow Ochre, Terracotta, Burnt Umber, and Black. There is no White, which substantially diminishes what colors you can blend, as well as the ability to make highlights. The Red also is a wimpy salmon-like color, not what any other set I've ever had would call red. Crayola has a better color range for a lower price, if somewhat less panache (and Prismacolor has a better color range for a higher price ...).If you really want this set, check the price on Amazon for the Derwent equivalent - Derwent Academy Colored Pencils, 12 Pack - which appears from the Amazon listing to have white instead of Yellow Ochre, and Pink instead of Purple (though I've seen 12-packs at other stores that had the same colors as the Mead set). But I wouldn't recommend this set when there are other, better, collections.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMVTG78F254P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBAD8LI#wasThisHelpful","R2LMVTG78F254P","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inasmuch as the Brother machine I have for general use is (literally) a lightweight, I was thrilled to get this Singer for heavier duty projects. It has a notable amount of power and speed, but does have some foibles that should be considered.FORM FACTOR: The machine is QUITE heavy (almost 32 pounds). This is a feature, inasmuch as it won't jump around at high speeds or when dealing with tough fabrics, but I wouldn't buy it to transport to your weekly quilting class. While the chassis is metal, the knobs are plastic or plastic-covered. (The reverse lever is plastic over a metal base - I anticipate having to eventually replace the plastic part, but the lever is usable without it). There is a longer arm than the typical home machine, which gives you a nice large throat, and a fair amount of surface area. Because of the front-loading bobbin and extended size, however, the machine can't be recessed into a standard sewing table, and it won't fit in a standard carry case.STITCHING/SPEED: As other reviewers have noted, the machine stitches very fast and very evenly, and with a fair amount of power. (I went through four layers of medium weight nylon backpack webbing with no problem). I was concerned, given the emphasis on speed, that the machine wouldn't be able to also run slowly for doing fine work.  In fact, there are three speed settings, and the pedal is also a speed controller (unlike some cheaper machines, where the pedal is only an on-off). At the slowest setting, with a light touch on the pedal, the machine is slow enough to count the stitches.THREADING AND TENSION: I had no problems threading the machine, using only the included Quick Start guide, the threading instructions on the machine itself, and a degree in mechanical engineering. The threading is very fussy compared to other machines I've used, however, with much poking of thread through tiny holes, not just around wires. A handheld needle threader will be of help here, unless you have a very steady hand. Setting the tension is a pain, involving two different knobs for the top thread, a screwdriver for the bobbin tension, and another knob for the presser foot tension. I never did get the tension right for sewing sheers. On the other hand, unlike some cheaper machines, you can in fact set the bobbin thread tension.BOBBIN: The bobbin is front-loaded/vertical, not drop-in/horizontal, which some quilters insist gives you better tension control (not quite to the level of a religious argument in crafting circles). This will make it easier to change bobbins while there is still a work piece in the machine. Unfortunately, this also means there isn't the convenient clear window and clear plastic bobbin that lets you know how much bobbin thread is left, and the machine itself has no warning light or beep. To exacerbate the problem, the bobbin itself is L-class (5/16"" thick, 3/4"" diameter), not M-class (3/8"" thick, 1"" diameter). Typical for home machines, but it doesn't hold nearly as much thread.The bobbin winder is usable while the machine is still top-threaded, thanks to the machine's two spool holders. It is operated by a button on the front of the machine, though the Quick Start guide indicates it is operated by stepping on the pedal (true for every other Singer machine I've ever used, but not this one). There is a guide on the machine itself showing you how to use the bobbin winder, but no guide on how to insert the bobbin and case, though the Quick Start guide does cover this, as does the documentation booklet.EMBROIDERY: While the machine only does straight stitches, there is a zero-length stitch setting for free-form work. When I first tried this I embroidered a nice bird's nest. However, with the correct presser foot and cover plate, and much fussing with tension, I got fine stitches and a good amount of control. Some machines let you drop the feed dogs for embroidery - this one only has a plate to raise the fabric above them. Ok. There is a very nice spring-loaded embroidery foot included. There is no hoop included, but I would recommend getting this if you are going to do anything beyond basic mending.KNEE LIFTER/CUTTER/NEEDLE THREADER:  A knee lifter is the mark of a real quilting machine, and I have no complaints about this one. It is removable if you want to get close in for fine work. The needle threader was difficult to use at first, until I figured out that I had to press my thumb to the bottom of the front tab to hold the thread in place. The cutter is push-button and spring operated, and cuts with a resounding thunk, but doesn't leave quite enough bobbin thread to pull up easily (the most annoying thing about this machine). My Brother just has what is essentially a seam ripper glued to the side of the machine, but I vastly prefer that for cutting threads.DOCUMENTATION: The machine comes with onboard diagrams for threading and bobbin winding (as noted above), though I wish these were in black, not medium grey. The Quick Start guide covers the above plus inserting the bobbin case and bringing up thread, using diagrams almost entirely. The included manual covers the same, plus how to use the various presser feet, with verbal explanations. There is a link to Singer's Youtube channel if you want videos on general sewing, but there is nothing specifically for the Singer S16 as yet. (A general search for ""Singer S16"" only brings up a third-party video, with a link to this Amazon page - the video is clearly click-bait).PACKAGING: The machine comes packed in Styrofoam, and there is a vinyl cover included. Given that it won't fit in a standard home machine case (sometimes called a universal, or free-arm case), and given how not-green Styrofoam and vinyl are, I *really* wish it had just shipped in a hard-sided case. I'm sure people who are investing in a machine this costly would be happy to add another 25 dollars to protect their investment.ETC: Oddly, there is no walking foot included. There is also no ability to set needle position, though the fabric guide addresses seam positioning.Overall, this is a good, but not perfect, machine for quilters who are ready to move up to the next level of investment, and it will also be useful for other applications that need a heavy-duty but not full-time machine. It is definitely not for beginners.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRLZYIIZVCPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAYDYE0#wasThisHelpful","R2NRLZYIIZVCPI","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got my new HTC One M8 I immediately bought a Class 4 chip to put in it for music MP3s (from another manufacturer, whose name is French for ""without disk""). When I tried to save video MP4s, however, the phone complained.This chip works with no complaints for videos taken using my HTC, including fast and slow motion, high def, and ""zoe"". Transferring a five minute video from the chip to my laptop using the adapter takes about 30 seconds (26 fps, 20040 total kbps, file size about 720 Meg), which is about half the 48MB/s the device claims.

"I was a little concerned that the clamp on this tripod wouldn't be able to handle my (ginormous) HTC One M8, but it fits beautifully, and is a substantial advantage when using the phone in both stereo and camera mode. The tripod also works well with my Lumix DMC-SZ1 (an actual camera). Nothing is perfect, however.The tripod is actually three devices:* Bendy legs, which work like giant twist-ties to wrap around chair arms, bannisters, or anything else of similar diameter, and which are stiff enough to stand alone, with nice non-skid feet and little ball joints at the tops for more flexibility. There is also a large locking ball joint above the legs so you can orient your device in portrait or landscape mode.* A clamp to hold your phone, with rubbery jaws that open up to more than 3.25 inches, and another lockable ball joint at back to provide more tiltablity.* A mounting bolt and platform to attach the clamp to the legs, or to attach a camera to the legs directly. The bolt screws into the tripod socket on the bottom of your camera, or into a similar socket on the clamp. As with a full-sized professional tripod, there is a quick-release plate holding the bolt, with a tightening screw that holds the plate onto the platform. And herein lies the problem: The tightening screw is the (literally) weakest link. Not because it doesn't hold, but because it's tiny, cheap, plastic, and really hard to grip. On a full-sized tripod these are usually made of metal, with some kind of handle, and ideally spring-loaded. It looks like the designers just copied the bigger version, without thinking about size and ergonomics.  It's also not clear to me why the clamp assembly doesn't have its own plate built in.I still use and enjoy the tripod (it's a perfect accessory for the HTC). I really hope the designers will add a grippy metal screw to the next iteration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W2XLNWUJZ9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I58VB3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2W2XLNWUJZ9H","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monster has something of a ""reputation"" in the audio marketplace, so I wasn't sure how much I would really like these earbuds (excuse me, ""In Ear Monitors""). I found the sound to be really good for the price, but I don't think the earbuds are particularly comfortable.NOISE ISOLATION/COMFORT - as the package notes, these buds have ""partial"" noise isolation, which means they block out some sound but not all.  (if you want more isolation, get the iSport Victory buds instead). The speaker part sits very loosely in the ear, not as an earplug - the buds are held onto your outer ear by the little stub thingy, which you have to press down, put the buds in place, and then let up. I didn't find this to be particularly comfortable, inasmuch as the fit has to be fairly precise, and I apparently wear a small-and-a-half. There's also a little hard tab in the silicone that was pressing in a bad place on one of my ears, but not the other. YMMV. (And as a Bose user, I originally put the buds on backwards - once I figured out they were Andorian not Vulcan that was OK). If you have sweaty ears, or intend to wear these in a high-motion workout like jogging, they probably won't stay in.CORDS/MICROPHONE - The cord is 47"" long, flat, and with an angled plug. It is still possible to tangle the cord, but the shape does help somewhat. The microphone is just a mic, no controls. Will it let you answer a call hands-free?  The package insert says you should go to the website to download the instructions but the manuals aren't there yet - I'll update.SOUND - I found the sound on these to be very good, not only for voice-range music like ballad and country (typical for buds), but also for things like classical and disco. My Bose SIE earbuds have a richer bass (imaging, not just volume), and the the Monster buds also have some foreground/background compression compared to the Bose, but considering the difference in price the response is quite respectable. The imaging is better at higher volumes, so will likely improve at the lower as the buds break in. I would note that most of my music is at 256k, on an iPhone, and that my definition of ""high"" volume is in the middle of the volume slider.EXTRAS - The buds come with three sizes of eargels (typical) and a little - but overengineered - drawstring bag. They are packed in a nice, solid- but overengineered - cardboard box (dig out the magnets before recycling this) with a recyclable plastic insert. According to the promo insert, the eargels are supposedly antimicrobial and washable. I assume you'd have to take them off the speaker part before washing, but I'm still waiting for the manual.Overall, these have a nice sound at a reasonable price, if they work for you. I'll be sticking with my old Bose MIE earbuds, however.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMTXXC1MO1IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H39MYXM#wasThisHelpful","R1VMTXXC1MO1IL","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any student of Architecture or Interior Design is probably familiar with Francis Ching's work. This book is a re-working of his classic Building Construction Illustrated, with the focus shifted to the EU. There is also a small final chapter on building construction in the Middle East.A lot of the text in the book is taken wholesale from the original American version - a paragraph-by-paragraph comparison of the first few chapters gave me more than 90% overlap, and the ending chapters covering HVAC and materials appear to be almost identical. There are some differences in naming - ""Wood"" is called ""Timber,"" ""Gypsum board is called ""Plasterboard,"" measurements are in metrics, and so on. Much of the difference in actual content, however, arises from new green and sustainable building technology.In Chapter 1, ""The Building Site,"" 32 sections have the same title. The EU version adds: ""BREEAM,"" ""Carbon Reduction Strategies,"" ""The Passive House Standard,"" and (oddly) ""Drawing Conventions."" The US version adds: ""The 2030 Challenge,"" ""Regulatory Factors,"" and ""Zoning Ordinances,"" as well as three sections that are addressed elsewhere in the EU book: ""Slope Protection,"" ""Retaining Walls,"" and ""Site Description.""  In Chapter 5, on ""Wall Systems,"" the EU version has sections on Hemp and Straw Bale construction, while the US version covers Glass Block and Structural Clay tile. In Chapter 6, ""Roof Systems,"" the EU version has a section on GluLam beam roofs not in the US version. Chapter 9, on ""Special Construction,"" adds a section on prefab Pod Systems. And so on.Is it worth buying this book just for the divergent sections?  That question is up to the reader. Certainly the new information is interesting. I do wish the publisher had taken sustainability into account, however, and just published the upgrade.(I also wish the publisher had used a more readable font, as many other reviewers of this round of Ching's books have noted).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYCTR1QFEZTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119953170#wasThisHelpful","R2CYCTR1QFEZTY","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm always on the lookout for excellent earbuds, so I was happy to get these to compare to the others in the household. I found them to be much superior to the cheapo ones that came with our various phones, and about on-par with various other mid-priced earbuds, but not as responsive as my Bose MIE or Polk AM4110-A buds.- EAR PIECES - The bases of the earpieces are relatively tiny and gumdrop shaped. The ear gels are three sizes of silicone bulbs (plus one foam set), and the middle size made a solid seal with my ear canal (too solid - the day I wore these with a clogged eustachian tube I wound up in horrible pain from the pressure waves). The gels wouldn't stay in your ear during any kind of exercise, though the foam might.- CORDS - the cords on the Denon are almost 55 inches long, compared to roughly 45 for the Polk and the Bose, and quite thick and stiff (more al-dente spaghetti than capellini). This would definitely help with tangle-resistance. There is an adapter included for Sony phones, which I didn't test. There is no slider. The jack is at a 90 degree angle, not straight.- CONTROLS - The controls and mic are high up on the left side, which is not what I'm used to but not a dealbreaker. There is only one button, which on my iPhone 5 gives me pause with one click, forward a track with two, and back a track with three. On my HTC One I only get pause and play. (This is typical functionality for one-button controls).- CASE - There is a very nice little zippered case included.- SOUND - The buds sound spectacular on voice-based mid-range music like opera and ballad, but don't have quite the same level of imaging for classical and instrumental music as the Bose or the Polk. I was originally underwhelmed by the bass and high-end response, but after giving them some break-in time, and switching to the small size gels, I'm revising my opinion. There is a downloadable Denon music app that I didn't test, so I may still not be giving these their full workout. As the ""Studio"" denotes, the buds are designed for a flat response across the audio spectrum.So, if you're looking for a tangle-resistant set of earbuds for sedentary use, and don't listen to complex music, and can find these on sale, go for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UA6GNBFGQ7G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPNPYU0#wasThisHelpful","R1UA6GNBFGQ7G9","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a science nerd from way back, the recent uptick in interest in all things technical warms my heart. This book largely fans those flames, with a few caveats for non-scientific readers.The book starts with classical mechanics, but covers a wide range of topics - matter and energy, atoms and solar systems, particles and waves (with some discussion of dual-nature implications). The writing is mostly accessible, with some topic headings that were clearly intended to appeal to a lay audience - ""What does your blood pressure mean?,"" ""What makes an atomic bomb work?"" (Don't get your hopes up - the book won't help you build one.). There are lots of real-world examples used throughout, including everything from curve balls to x-rays.Lay audience notwithstanding, however, the explanations in the text refer to things like polar coordinates and partial differentials, with the assumption that the reader knows what those are, and the formulas use Greek letters freely (for readers who aren't up on their rho's and tau's, it will be helpful to print out a Greek alphabet for reference while reading, if only so you know how to pronounce the equations). As a visual thinker, I do wish there had been more diagrams, or even a video. (Maybe a companion guide viewable on a 3D device?).Looking at the book with an editor's eye, I was sad to find some typos of the type that a spell-check program would miss (including a figure reference in Chapter 4 that I'm pretty sure was off), and some odd sequencing of topics - in particular, the text discusses quantum mechanics before optics and atoms, which, among other things, meant that diffraction gratings were referred to before they were introduced. There is an index, which helps somewhat, but I wish there had also been a glossary. The chapter on quantum mechanics is one of the harder ones, and I also wound up completely confused at one point while reading it, until I realized that the ""K"" I was reading in the current equation meant ""kinetic energy,"" while the previous ""K"" had meant ""Kelvin."" It helps to take frequent contemplation and comprehension breaks.Foibles notwithstanding, I found this to be an interesting and valuable work, and a bit of a brain workout (NTTAWWT).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171Z26F1KPE56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466560177#wasThisHelpful","R171Z26F1KPE56","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who's been following the software market knows that Adobe shot itself in the foot with its new rent-to-not-own software pricing scheme. And anyone who's evaluated this Corel suite knows that Corel has set out to eat Adobe's lunch. Not only does the software take in Adobe files, CorelDraw offers a ""workspace"" that emulates the look and feel of Illustrator, and Photopaint offers a similar workspace for Photoshop, as well as some recently added path-friendly capabilities. Searching for Adobe on the Corel site turns up much advice on how to handle the transition.So, how well does the Corel suite really handle Adobe files?* ILLUSTRATOR TO CorelDRAW *I prepared a file in Illustrator (CS5) with two art boards, two main layers, and eight sub-layers (some were created on the fly as I added text). Into this project I placed a daring spline-defined squiggle, some gradient-filled shapes, and text in both Arial italic (which both programs offer), and Accent SF, which is only available in Adobe programs. I saved the file as an Illustrator file (.ai).Upon first opening the file in CorelDraw, I was informed that Accent SF was unavailable, and offered the option of replacing all instances with another font (one was suggested), either this one time, or in general. All text remained editable, as did the shapes and the squiggle, including re-splining. All good. (The Corel site offers more complete information about what kinds of effects are brought forward, and what isn't).While the content translation was good, however, the workspace translation was not. The art boards were transformed into pages, which in Corel are tabbed, not side-by-side, and the main layers were retained, but not the sublayers. Most people won't care. Wizard-level Illustrator users will be frustrated. (Using the Adobe-style workspace doesn't really help, though ""page sorter view"" will show you all your pages).* PHOTOSHOP TO PHOTOPAINT *To test the Photoshop/Photopaint transition, I prepared an eight-layer drawing in Photoshop from my CS5 package, in 32-bit RGB (Corel offers 24 and 48 bit), including one weird spline-based curve, and using some hard-to-replicate glows and shading, and some text again in Arial and Accent SF.  I rasterized and smudged some of the text in one layer just to be ornery, and stretched the text in another. Then I saved the file in native (.psd) Photoshop mode.Opening the file in Photopaint, I was delighted to see a very accurate rendering of the original, somewhat brighter, and now in 48-bit (one of the choices for color here is ""Adobe RGB."" Bravo). Corel's ""What the font"" feature even managed to identify the Accent SF font, with a little help from an online database. Editing the text was another story. Maybe because Photopaint opened the file as the background? Corel's Help file counseled me to use ""Import"" instead. Ok. Nope. I still got only one Photopaint ""object"" (what Photoshop calls a ""layer,"" according to Photopaint Help, though there isn't really a 1:1 correlation here). Using the magic wand mask tool let me (tediously) separate the graphics into separate layers/objects, but (maddeningly) left some drop shadows behind, and the text was still unrecognized. Yet, the Photopaint help file says that Adobe text is imported as a text object, and therefore editable? Well, I did visually alter some of the text, and Corel doesn't like that. Maybe if I saved each text layer as its own file? I give up.* OTHER TRANSLATIONS *Just for grins, I opened the Photoshop file in CorelDraw, which produced an error message suggesting I use ""Import"" instead. Kudos to Corel. Importing, however, produced the same problems (no separate layers/objects, so no ability to select or edit text), as well as some awful distortions. Opening the Illustrator file in Paintshop Pro (X5) gave me a nice rendering, and I could then use the magic wand tool to salvage the graphics, though the text was a lost cause. Unfortunately, Paintshop Pro isn't part of this package. (Further online research indicates the best option may in fact be Corel Painter, which I unfortunately don't own).* CONCLUSION *Overall, I think this Corel suite will be useful for general users who don't want to (repeatedly) shell out absurd amounts of money for Adobe software. Real high-end graphic artists who want to continue to be able to access their own work, done in Adobe, are between a rock and a hard place. Adobe is in the process of alienating the entire industry, and Corel doesn't quite cut it (yet...).","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AERD8HWU83B5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFDZBC#wasThisHelpful","R1AERD8HWU83B5","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's telling that the Getting Started guide for the HTC M8 has a section titled ""Your first week with your new phone."" Because I've had this device for way more than a week, and I'm still finding features. Some highlights:* USER INTERFACE/CUSTOMIZATION - The phone has a free 6-month screen-replacement warranty, which is a good thing, since the first time it vibrated in my hand I almost dropped it. Vibrate is used as tactile feedback for input, which I personally hate, but this can be turned off, as can the ""Blinkfeed"" news and social media app which is the default homescreen (HTC is quite proud of Blinkfeed. YMMV.). Coming from an iPhone background, I found many small delights, like the fact that the analog clock icon not only keeps time, but can be made double-sized to make it more readable. Widget management is in general remarkable. The phone also comes pre-installed with many Google apps, but, like Internet Explorer on Windows, it's easy to download more palatable options.* MUSIC - The audio on the M8 doesn't so much raise the bar as launch it into low-earth orbit. Coming from an iPhone background, as noted, I was thrilled by the two user-facing speakers, and amazed at the sheer volume they could produce from such a tiny box, with relatively minimal distortion (also relatively minimal bass response, but nothing is perfect). The speaker sound is notably better if the phone is on an slightly absorptive surface (a wooden desktop or book, for example, instead of granite countertop). Populating the phone with my music involved copying MP3 files onto a microSD chip (using my laptop, via micro/mini SD adapter), and then putting the chip into the phone. No synch, no iTunes, no translation, and trivially upgradable. I'm not the type to profess romantic attachment for inanimate objects, but I am sorely tempted.* Harman/Kardon Music - This edition phone adds some additional music features, namely two filters (Clari-Fi, which enhances low bit rate mp3s, and LiveStage, which supposedly creates a more life-like experience when using headphones). A set of Harman/Kardon headphones is included. The phone also has the ability to play non-lossy formats like FLAC (and if you've ever priced a FLAC-dedicated player, you understand the value here). I did find that the filters made a difference when listening to most audio, though ""difference"" isn't necessarily ""better' (LiveStage makes stuff louder and brighter, which isn't always what I prefer). Since I typically use Bose MIE earbuds I took this opportunity to compare them to the HK buds, and found what I usually find when comparing Bose and Harman/Kardon, namely that HK enhances the midrange and foreground, and lets the ends of both the pitch and volume spectrums fall back. This means that the Bose renders things like the glockenspiel in Danse Macabre or the bass line in Desert Rose with much more clarity and better imaging than the HK (the HK buds pretty much ignore deep bass). In Harman/Kardon's defense, this also means that dialog and speech will be more comprehensible. So, Bose for classical music, and HK for videos. (The HK are also earplug style buds, though that's not sufficient to explain the differences in rendering)* WATCHING VIDEO - The crystal clarity of the screen and user-facing speakers make watching video a pleasure. My pleasure was dampened slightly by the fact that the device doesn't support Amazon streaming video, or perhaps vice versa (Jeff, can you get on that? Thanks). The volume rockers are on on the right of the phone in portrait mode, which means when they are on the top of the device in landscape mode they are backwards - left is up and right is down. A minor annoyance. More of an issue is that the default is for the volume buttons to pop the phone into camera mode when the phone is in landscape mode, which is not what I want when watching YouTube. Fortunately you can turn that off.* CAMERA - For basic camera work, the phone rivals my Lumix (an actual camera). There are two lenses on the back of the device (thus providing parallax and the potential to focus after the shot), along with a dual flash, and one user-facing lens for selfies. I was particularly delighted to find a picture-in-picture mode, where you can put a selfie in a lower corner of the larger shot. This phone supposedly sacrificed some pixel density in favor of low-light capability, but most people won't miss it (I'm guessing one of the use cases was ""nightclub""). The phone can in fact save pictures and video (and ""Zoe"" video) to the removable chip, and warned me that my music chip wasn't fast enough for optimal video. Nice.* PHOTO FIXING - Once you've taken the shot, the phone offers after-effects, for example different decorative frames, filters like tints and black and white, and an itty-bitty paint program with cut-and-paste, straighten/tilt, and a handful of brushes and colors to use to draw on the photo. I was surprised, given the brushes, that there was no function to place and enter text. Right now the photo manipulation is a nice social media toy, but there are users out there (insurance investigators, architects, etc.) who would happily embrace the ability to label photos as a serious work tool.* GAMING - Not since my old Game Boy Advance has a handheld gaming device felt so big and comfortable. My only beef is that the power button is a bit too easy to accidentally push if you put a little too much english on an angry bird, and that the edges of the enormous screen are a little too easy to accidentally activate. Both of these issues can be fixed with a nice case (I personally prefer the Otterbox Commuter).So, what can't it do?* Well ... erm ... uh... It's not so great as a PHONE. Not because of the audio or microphone (which is actually a bit too sensitive), or the contact management (which will import your iPhone data, along with anything else it can get its little electronic hands on), but because of the form factor. First, the device is huge, almost 3""x6"" (see my picture above), smooth, and thin. As such, it's really uncomfortable to hold to your ear receiver-style, and hard to pick up from a smooth surface, which confounds the ergonomic niceties like automatically decreasing the ringer volume when the phone is moved, or muting the ringer when the phone is flipped from face up to face down (a great idea, BTW, but not useful if I have to fumble to pick the phone up in the first place). Second, the headphone jack is on the bottom (and the HK buds have a straight plug, unlike the Bose). Which means you can't use the device in standard cellphone position - held in the hand, hand resting on table or desk or stomach. (Autorotate is three-way, not four). You also can't have headphones attached when the phone is in a charging stand, which in my case seriously interferes with using the phone for Skype. The iPhone 5 also has this non-feature, so there must be some kind of rationale for it, but I can't image what.So, this is a great player, gaming device, and camera. But (sorry folks) only an OK phone.(Oh, and for those who care, the packaging is mostly pressed paper, and there is an envelope included to send your old phone back to Sprint for recycling. All good.).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIZRP89Q0WYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JX4MD3G#wasThisHelpful","R3EIZRP89Q0WYQ","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the title of the review says, this stylus is great for device cases that have an included pen/stylus loop - the thick part is about half an inch wide, the thin part is about a quarter of an inch wide, and the stylus will slip right in.The molded-in clip works on manilla folders, but not on any clothing I've tried it on (too tight), and is pretty much redundant. A hole for a cord would have been better, and you can in fact put a cord through the top of the clip. The stylus body is just a hair under 4.5 inches long, which may be too short depending on your hand size.Also, for some reason my Kindle doesn't like it. The stylus works great on my phone (HTC M8) and on my partner's iPhone, but for the Kindle you really have  to mash the tip down to get it to register. This isn't a screen protector issue - the phone has one, the Kindle doesn't. Maybe it's just the relatively small diameter of the tip? The tip is also pure rubber, not the nylon composite of the more expensive styluses, so does catch a bit if you swipe with it.So, the stylus is a nice mid-range tool, if it works for your device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGOUAT7AELZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRL7424#wasThisHelpful","R3BGOUAT7AELZN","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given that this case is built like a snow tire, I expected it to provide the best protection for my new HTC One M8.  After trying it out, however, I've switched to the Otterbox Commuter. Two major issues -- First, the screen cover is a hard sheet of plastic that's part of the case, not the typical screen protector film. Since it doesn't adhere to the screen, rather sits slightly above it, every interaction with the phone feels like a little double tap - first to touch the protector, and then to press it down a fraction of a millimeter to touch the screen. This is driving me nuts.- Second, there's no protection for the lenses. The thickness of the case puts the lenses down in a little well, which helps for some kinds of impact, but the Defender case snaps into an included belt holster, which holds the phone with the screen inward and the lenses outward. Are you kidding?The Otterbox Commuter series doesn't protect the lenses either, but that case is slim enough to put into a pocket, and doesn't have the screen issue. I'm keeping the Commuter.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35BB1WKC5349Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IL7BFFI#wasThisHelpful","R35BB1WKC5349Y","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adore my new HTC One M8, but it has three problems - one, it has a bit too much screen glare, two, the excitingly smooth and rounded body is a pain to pick up from a horizontal surface, and, three, it costs more than my laptop.  This case addresses all three issues.The case is three parts:- Screen protector - Comes with a tiny microfiber cleaning cloth, and an itty-bitty smoothing card (a credit card would be too big). I used some canned air to further de-lint my screen, which helped a lot with the install. I do wish the positioning tabs were clear, not opaque. I wound up with a bubble right under where the second tab was attached.- Soft silicone case - Has some nice structural re-enforcement at the corners, which is good, and puts the power-button in a little well, which keeps it from being accidentally pressed when you're playing Angry Birds, which is also good. Also has a flap to cover the power and headphone jack, which I'm thinking of cutting off, since it's interfering with using a charging stand.- Hard shell over-case. This snaps over the soft case. I had a little trouble getting it to seat properly, until I gave a firm yank on the above-mentioned flap, at which point everything snapped into place.Overall, the case makes it much easier to grip and pick up the phone, in addition to making me much less afraid of dropping it. I should note that the case doesn't cover the lenses or the speakers, so it doesn't provide 100% protection. For my purposes I'm happy with it, and in fact I prefer it to the Otterbox Defender series case, which I have also reviewed.(Aside to Otterbox: everybody who reviews charging stands complains that they don't work with Otterboxes, and vice versa. Just sell the damn charging stands already.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q48RXLV4ISOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IL7BG98#wasThisHelpful","R3Q48RXLV4ISOQ","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inasmuch as we live in earthquake country, I'm always looking for good flashlights. This one will be joining the hang-them-on-the-bedroom-doorknobs collection.FORM FACTOR:  The device is quite small actually, not as tiny as my Maglight Solitare, but it won't be a burden to tuck it into a backpack or purse. The case is metal, with much ergonomic knurling. The belt clip is removable, but pretty well finished, so it shouldn't catch on stuff. The button switch is recessed.  I was miffed that my flashlight had a hole for a lanyard, but no actual cord included, until I opened it to put in the battery. The cord, spare o-rings, and spare switch cover are tucked inside. (Fortunately I have small fingers). I appreciate the spare o-rings, but there are no instructions on how to change the switch cover, and no obvious way to do this.BATTERY: The device takes one AA battery, which, according to the package insert, will give you 1.5 hours on bright mode, and notably longer in the dimmer light modes. (See below).LIGHT MODES: The light beam isn't focusable, like my Maglight, but there are five light modes available - High (the insert says you'll get 1.5 hours from a fresh battery), medium (2 hours per battery), and low (12 hours per battery), as well as strobe and ""SOS"". Switching between modes involves turning the flashlight on and off, and waiting three seconds to ""memorize"" your choice. Ok. In theory there's a manual flash function for ""momentary"" operation, but all I ever got it to do was change modes, so, despite the military styling, this may not be the best choice for Morse code.Overall, I like the flashlight, though I wish there were a better way to change modes (chips are cheap, switches are expensive, I get it). Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21500S3RDLL75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1G4Q7S#wasThisHelpful","R21500S3RDLL75","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a Fujitsu Lifebook since the iPad was just a gleam in Steve Jobs' eyes, so I knew when that died (the Lifebook, not Steve) that I would be looking for another convertible tablet. This one has the same multi-use advantage as my old Fujitsu, and the same slightly smaller pitch keyboard, in a lighter, cooler, and slightly more violent package.Pros:- Nice click-tactile keyboard. Not quite as much key-travel as my old (and THICK) Lifebook, but not the mushy mess of chicklets that some notebooks offer.- The trackpad has buttons. For some reason, hardware vendors think that supporting multi-finger gestures on touchscreens and trackpads means you don't need buttons on the trackpads anymore. I was raised on mice. When I'm selecting or moving things, I want buttons.- Surprising good audio. When I was looking at notebooks in the store, I knew this one had a nice clear display for video. I didn't expect that the audio would be quite so good. The speakers are on the bottom of the machine, which means that in tent mode they are roughly vertical and behind the screen - great for movies. Also great for firing up Amazon Cloud drive (or your favorite online player). The sound is notably better if you give the notebook some acoustic assistance by putting it in a bookshelf or in a similar stable (ideally wooden) box.Cons:- The edges of the notebook, where the black plastic of the case transitions to the silver of the keyboard area, are SHARP.  When I'm typing with my wrists resting on the lower corners of the machine, to either side of the touchpad, I actually wind up with red indentations in my skin. I'm seriously considering duct tape.- Out of the box, the touch screen is actually a little too sensitive. I kept having things read as a double-click when all I wanted to do was a little drag. Some of this can be mitigated by adjusting the settings, and I did a lot of that in the first few weeks of use, and not just to get rid of the goddamn ""Charms"".  (But don't blame Lenovo for Microsoft's mistakes).- Takes a while to come out of hibernate or sleep. The processor for this notebook isn't the fastest, and one of the ways this manifests is when you try to awaken the machine from suspend mode. The screen stays dark for a few moments, and there's the urge to assume the machine is hung and restart. Just wait.- The power button is really easy to accidentally push, inasmuch as it's at the front of the right edge in laptop mode, right where your hand falls when you pick up the machine to move it. Part of this is the constraints of tablet design, but I really wish it had been closer to the hinge. (Or even on the other side, next to the power cord).- Speaking of the power cord, I really wish the connector was angled. I like to type crosslegged, with the notebook on my lap, but with this machine this position puts unreasonable stress on the cord. So, no doing yoga when you are using the Yoga. (I would totally buy an angle adapter if if were available).- The machine is very quiet, but not totally silent, inasmuch as there is a bit of hiss from the internal mechanics.Foibles aside, I think this is an excellent notebook, especially at this price point.  I hope the ergonomic stuff will be fixed in the next iteration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TYI99EKPEQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQEA8UE#wasThisHelpful","R33TYI99EKPEQ7","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With all the other reviewers singing the praises of these zipper bags, I actually thought Amazon might have sent me the wrong box. I find the bags useful, but I have some notable quibbles.Pros:- No pesky slider to get in the way of fully filling the bag (also, Con: No slider).- The stippling on the bag keeps the plastic film from clinging to the contents, which helps with produce storage.Cons:- No slider (as noted above).- The plastic of the bag is tinted blue, which makes some food less than appetizing (minor), but also confounds the blue-and-yellow-make-green trick. From the yellow side, the zipper pretty much always looks green.- The plastic is not really so thick. It has a stipple pattern embossed into in, which may make it feel thicker, but it's not nearly as thick as the Ziploc freezer bags I'm used to using.- The stipple pattern weakens the bag. Since I now have a lot of these, I tested half a dozen by filling them with between two and three quarts of water, and dropping them into my acrylic shower stall from about five feet up (freezer height). Five broke along the line of the stipple pattern (the sixth landed perfectly on edge and the zipper opened). In contrast, a similar Ziploc combo bag, bought at Costco in the four-pack, had to be dropped several times before it broke.I think these bags will be useful for produce, since they open wide and don't cling, but I won't be buying them for freezer use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC63PAB4E3IHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JC9TJSO#wasThisHelpful","RC63PAB4E3IHV","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had an itty-bitty Maglight on my keychain for years before it died, so I had high hopes for this as a replacement.  It's a  useful flashlight, but not suitable on a keychain.Pros:- BRIGHT. As in ""I can't believe this tiny thing is lighting up my bedroom.""- Convertible. The flashlight throws a good beam. Deploying the lantern is just a matter of pulling out the ring around the bulb guard to expose clear plastic, and then putting the flashlight face down.  Putting it face down on a white surface is notably better than on a dark one.- Pretty well made. The flashlight body is machined aluminum, not plastic. The on/off button is nicely recessed to avoid accidently turning it on in a pocketbook or backpack.Cons:- As noted, the flashlight is almost an inch in diameter, and 2.5 inches long. Way too big for a keychain.- Lousy caribeener. I've seen the same clip on dime store keychains. Worse is the split ring that attaches the clip, which is just a loop of wire. I replaced both with a large paper clip. (The hole for the ring is unfortunately too small to put in something better).- Button batteries.  Not impossible to find when they need replacing (thank you Amazon), but not rechargable and not recyclable. The flashlight body is big enough to hold AAAs. What gives?Overall, I consider this a good light but not a great one. I probably wouldn't get another one. (For keychain purposes, I recommend the new LED version of the Maglight - Maglite Solitaire Led 1AAA - Black Han - SJ3A016.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIXUFK1J46TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN1LOPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IIXUFK1J46TX","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came to this book by way of ""Unorthodox,"" another story of a young woman from an ultra-orthodox Jewish background who broke free to join the secular world. The author of that work dared to wear jeans and go to college, in a community where doing so was tantamount to checking yourself into a mental hospital, or having sex with random strangers in bars.The author of this work, did, in fact, check herself into a mental hospital, and have sex with random strangers in bars. (But at least she was still modestly dressed...). I'm a hard person to shock, but I'm frankly astonished she is still alive.The book is an extraordinary glimpse into a life and lifestyle most Americans can't begin to comprehend. And of how that lifestyle implodes at the hint of even the slightest transgression (as a side note, readers from individualistic cultures may gain a better understanding of Islamic ""honor killings""). The author matter-of-factly recounts her downward spiral and the men associated with it, from self-serving sleazebags, to Rastafarian drug dealers, to kinky professors. Having hit bottom, she decides her social redemption will lie in getting into Harvard (where, presumably, there are no self-serving sleazebags or Rastafarian drug dealers or kinky professors).My only complaint about this book is that the individual events are not explored more deeply. I understand that there is a lot of ground to cover, but it feels like the author is treating us to a slideshow instead of a walk-through. Compared to the other book noted above, however, this work is clearly by a more mature author (in all senses of the word), one who doesn't fall quite as much into the common trap of dutifully recounting the latest social psych theories instead of the appropriate b'rucha. She has owned her past, has placed it into a real social context, and has moved on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROH92WGOO2SFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553809X#wasThisHelpful","ROH92WGOO2SFA","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Post-apocalyptic novels are nothing new in science fiction, and this one falls true to classic forms - enclaves of civilization, lawless outlands, a society built on the potsherds and ruins of the previous one. But the ruins are ours, the apocalyptic event wasn't a nuke or a plague, just an economic fizzle, and the enclaves of civilization are (more or less) Chinese. The result is not unlike Mad Max meets the Joy Luck Club.Into this society, as a farmer/fish wrangler, is born Fan, our heroine. And also her boyfriend, Reg, who up and disappears one day, whereupon she sets out into the badlands and 1% enclaves to find him, whereupon hangs the (intricate but not convoluted) plot.The world-buildng is fantastic (in both senses of the word). The writing is lyrical, bordering on poetic. Though, lyrical not being the easiest form to parse, the reader sometimes forgoes enpassent simplicity in favor of ultimate linguistic satisfaction. (And if you didn't like the previous sentence, you won't like the book).I found it very satisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R189UOLUQWQ2TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594486107#wasThisHelpful","R189UOLUQWQ2TI","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Standard grab bars look too institutional, so Moen and some other companies have started making designer versions. But, since I didn't really want a grab bar with a Victorian look, I found these.

I was concerned about the corners (like some other reviewers), but there is a bit of a radius, so they're not really that sharp.I was also concerned about where the bar was made, inasmuch as Moen sources a lot of things in China - my package had no indication of origin.

"I've always thought the colored stripes on toothbrushes were like the colored stripes on running shoe soles - mostly about marketing, not engineering.  I have to admit, however, that the different types of bristles on this toothbrush really do make a difference.  I can feel the pointy white bristles going between my teeth as I brush, while the blue are polishing the tooth surface. Some further observations:POLISHING - the compact tuft of blue bristles does an excellent job of polishing buccal (that is to say, cheek) and chewing surfaces on my teeth. For lingual (tongue) surfaces, however, I'm not getting as good a result as my old basic Colgate toothbrush (also soft and compact head). I brush the lingual surfaces with the brush held vertically, so this may be part of the problem - the tuft isn't being positioned quite right.GUMS - the longer white bristles have a nice point on them, and do slip between and around my teeth and stimulate the gums. Nicely done.HANDLE - the base of the handle is a tad over half an inch wide, which means I had to whittle it down a bit to fit in my toothbrush holder.  The thumb grip is much wider, which prevents the toothbrush from falling fully in (a good thing - I hate when a toothbrush head rests on the icky holder top).TONGUE AND CHEEK SCRAPER - I'm one of those few Americans who actually uses a tongue scraper (I prefer the Oolitt), so I was looking forward to trying this.  The touted built-in scraper is actually a bit of rough patch on the back of the brush head (a lot like sharkskin). It does nicely on cheeks, but when scraping the tongue it loosens crud but does not collect it, which makes for a slightly icky result.  I also gag on the brush bristles if i try to scrape too far back.  I'll stick with the separate tongue scraper.Overall, the brush is good but not perfect.  As with all personal hygiene products, YMMV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PSUT6MF1LTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELI7SBG#wasThisHelpful","R19PSUT6MF1LTK","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cats are in at the moment, and so is Buddhism, so of course a combination of the two would be a natural.In this charming work, we are introduced to some further basic precepts of Buddhism (and life in general) via HHC, his holiness the Dalai Lama's cat. Not from the teaching throne (teaching litter box?) but rather through overheard conversations and general knowledge and feline introspection.There is a well-created if slightly fictionalized setting, and plot, and characters. None too complex. But also much to meditate upon.In addition to Eastern philosophy, HHC's perambulations also bring her conveniently into contact with discussions of modern social psychology experiments. Unfortunately, the validity of some of those experiment's findings has been subsequently challenged.  The notion that new discoveries in western science support ancient Buddhist beliefs is also in at the moment, and I wouldn't want to throw the kitten out with the bathwater, but I do wish the author had run the book past a professor or two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217MHJLTLBJSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401943276#wasThisHelpful","R217MHJLTLBJSB","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must confess, I haven't read the Faith Club book. So, my disappointment with this this work may be my own fault - maybe I just didn't do enough research.I was expecting this book to be about what it is like to be an observant Muslim living the American lifestyle - juggling Friday night mosque with Saturday morning little league, working during Ramadan, the momentous day when the author's daughter started covering her hair, perhaps some Iftar recipes, and so on.  Not so. The author does not wear a headscarf, and is more of what a completely different tradition would refer to as a ""solo practitioner.""  And, as she herself notes (repeatedly), her kids have been to more bar mitzvahs than events at the mosque.So I guess I'm one of those clueless Americans that the author is trying to educate - not all Moslems wear headscarves, much like not all Moslems are terrorists.Unfortunately, the ""not all Moslems are terrorists"" meme isn't just a recurring theme, it's a literary club that the reader is bashed with throughout the length of the book.  I do sympathize with the author's need to do so - while the defining watershed events for the Jewish community and the Gay community were differently horrific (to provide two examples, among many), neither of those quite galvanized the American psyche as much as the events of 2001. (I personally had to take a break at the end of Chapter 2 to have a little flashback. Caveat lector.)Its good to know that there is a feminist movement within Islam, and that not all Moslems are Wahbists, and that the Imam who wanted to build the ""ground zero mosque"" was simply being clueless.  But I would have been happier to see these things in the context of everyday life, which here only shows up when the author is recounting how her children grew out of not wanting to be Moslem. There is no doubt that the author writes with passion, but she keeps coming back to 9-11 like a tongue comes back to a missing tooth, which makes the whole book read like a loyalty oath.Given the subject matter I hate to criticize, but potential readers should be aware of what they're getting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM48QEF1ALCHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230341845#wasThisHelpful","RM48QEF1ALCHC","A1B6SIX2I161O9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6SIX2I161O9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will admit, we finally got this up and running, and it's faster than the old Synology box. Some foibles along the way:- You absolutely *must* install the firmware upgrade (as noted by other reviewers).- Give up on using it with an XP system. We have both Windows 8 and an older XP computer in the household. The installation went fine on the Win 8, with multiple failures on the XP, and the error message to install Buffalo NAS Navigator first (but I already did...). Perhaps a greater wizard could solve this.- There is no easy graceful shutdown.  The other box (Synology DS209) has a pushbutton shutdown that will check mirroring on the two disks. It's possible to do this with the Buffalo, but it's not a single-step operation. Perhaps an artifact of the more configurable RAID arrays, perhaps just a cost-cutting measure.- Oh, and some of the interaction screens in the English install are in Japanese (see my photo above).

"For the first couple of chapters of this book, I was worried it was going to develop into a ""Teachings of Don Juan"" or ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"" type exposition. It didn't, thankfully.The oppressed people/golden child/old ways trope at the center of the story is a common one (biblical even).  But, while there are spiritual events here, the author intentionally keeps the story line remarkably matter-of-fact and grounded in the modern era.  And the plot lines (including one notable event I won't spoil) do acknowledge the Colgate Wisdom Tooth problem (if you have to ask, you wouldn't understand).No cigar store Indians here, just real people. I would be happier if there were fewer generalizations about white folks, however, and less of a different kind of preaching (getting almost as odious, in its own way, as the CWT problem).

"In function, this juice box is pretty typical - it charges fully from my usb wall adapter in about five hours, will just barely charge my iPhone twice, has a button to push to see how much charge is left, and gets nice and warm when it's charging the iPad (I'm getting less than a 25% charge for that). The only notable issues are that it's not particularly good at holding a charge (one week lost a full pip), and that the charging lights will continue to flash as long as it's plugged in, even after the charge is full (once you uplug it and push the button it will indicate a full charge).I selected this battery because of the form factor - the USB in and out are on the device itself, with no need to mess with cords (though a short cord is included, presumably for outlet convenience). And, joy of joy, the end caps screw off and are supposedly replaceable with other tips. So, I can get a USB-OTG tip for my camera and powermat case, and fully ditch the cords, right?  Nope.

"Our family has been Primal, Paleo plus dairy, for two years. Life changing. From sick and obese to thriving, healthy in body and mind. It is completely based on evolutionary biology. It is the best nutrition science in the world. Not a 'convert' yet? I suggest Primal Blueprint by Mark Sisson.One of the awesome things is how great food tastes and yes nourishes you. Shouldn't food do both? And yes leave you full. This book stands out because it is autoimmune aware and recipes follow that protocol with variations if you aren't.I also like that many recipes use the same ingredients in different ways. So if you buy plantains for instance, half a dozen recipes. I think most of the recipes are very mainstream. Confused by some of the other reviews. But when you are ready to try the sardine one is maybe my favorite. Complex flavors yet most recipes simple to prepare.

"The  Koss Portapro is my favorite sub $100 headphones ever. A true classic that is hard to be even after decades. Koss just got it right. At first I wasn't so sure they had anything right about the SP540. It was an on-ear headphone which I prefer but it felt odd, too light, too loose, too dis-connected to my head. It also did not sound particularly good at first. Worse than my Portapros.So why five stars? Things changed. And after a short time I started to thoroughly enjoy almost everything about the SP540. Most important the sound. I don't think break in periods last as long as some folks do, But these definitely needed some break in. They were flat, and dull and muted at first. But then after a couple of hours they started to sound, good, full, balanced, rich. They are very well balanced to me: mids, lows, highs, voice, just very pleasing.Then I noticed that I started to really like them on the ear. The lightness and looseness makes for an enjoyable extended listening period. They also have a good balance of decent passive noise cancellation but you can also hear just a bit. Good for a work environment. Also very little sound leakage.The cord is not very long but this makes for good sport and commute use. It is detachable so if you needed a longer cord at work you could use one. All in all one of the better if not best sub $200 headphones I have used lately. Definitely recommended.

"Use the cap and you should be alright. Most mandolin slicers are very sharp. And this is a good thing. As long as you are careful. Definitely use the supplied spiked holder when using this slicer. Nice touches like a box to hold the removable blades. Easy to use almost right out of the box and this can be a huge time saver.We basically eat meat and veggies now.

The interface was better for me, more intuitive, more features that I liked and it seemed to not slow the computer down as much.While I still like the Norton interface better, this McAfee has the best interface and best for me seems to slow the system down less than previous versions.

"Very useful, creative, well-researched book. America's Test Kitchen makes some of my most helpful and used books. Why? They test. This book is one of the most useful because we want home cooked meals and with little ones and two jobs we need to plan ahead.The book starts going over storage containers, wraps, kitchen discoveries, prep time savers, storage 101. This is clear, concise, good pictures.Then on to the recipes. Something for everyone. We are grain free, low sugar. But still many roasts, stews, vegetarian items, and sauces. I particularly liked the sauces as they do freeze well. Onion braised beef brisket, with a four substitution was great. Lots of different chilis. This book will be useful for years. We won't dent the recipes in one year.

"Overall I am pleased with this unit, but it does have some design flaws. First it is very lightweight, well constructed, and easy to change the filters. Online it seems replacement filters cost around $80 for the set. This is fairly average I'd say with the rated life of 2 years. I don't know if this is how long I will get though.It is also Energy Star rated. Do not underestimate how important this is.  The watts are 5.3 on low, 12 on medium, and 43 on max. Low and medium are virtually noiseless and high is about the level of high on most air purifiers. Our daughter's bedroom has felt fresher and smelled better since using this.I like air purifiers with an ion feature. That is a plus. The negatives are no way to turn the lights off. We try and get our rooms to as pitch black as possible. So this is annoying for us if we want to use it overnight in a bedroom...which we do. Also no auto sensor to adjust speeds. That one is not a big deal.Overall I do recommend this and thing total operating costs are reasonable for an air purifier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EC7R45F25ZFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GLCVRI#wasThisHelpful","R3EC7R45F25ZFF","A3LWC833HQIG7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LWC833HQIG7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A bit on the short side (but useful length) but packed with useful, life affirming/ life improving information.If you have been Paleo/Primal for a bit a lot of this information you have probably heard before.But Ben has collected it in short, easy to read in one setting reminder. And I definitely learned some new things and I really needed the reminders. Ben points out very good things to be eating (child and adults), the importance of rough housing (new to me), the importance of walking bare foot (I hadn't thought about that), and some great reminders to put away the electronics and engage with your child on your workout.Because of the book I now do chest pushups using my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. I think one thing that was missing, especially for people newer to Paleo/Primal concepts was what foods to avoid.

"I love to cook and bake and one of the basics that you need is a good digital thermometer. I love this kitchen thermometer. It helped me make a homemade pudding tonite that came out perfectly. It even has a power saving mode so you use less battery in between multiple measurements. It comes with a replaceable 1.5 volt battery too. It is super easy to operate as well. This thermometer eases my mind especially when it comes to meat and fish. I can get an accurate read so I know it is properly cooked. That is no laughing matter either.

"I received the conditioner only for review not the entire kit so my particular review is for the conditioner.  My hair gets dry the minute the leaves start falling.  I like that this conditioner is organic and free of chemicals and sulfates plus it is super hydrating. This is a totally natural conditioner that contains ingredients like plant proteins, shea butter, sea silk and peptides. My hair gets very dry in the fall and winter and I like the idea of using a hydrating conditioner like this one.  My hair feels soft and combs out easily after showering and applying this gentle moisturizing conditioner. I love the scent too. It feels gentle on my scalp and does not cause any irritation. I like that I can use this conditioner every time I wash my hair and it styles beautifully. It has a nice blend of shea butter and sea silk which adds moisture back into my hair and scalp but feels light. I like that there this is an organic conditioner that is produced cruelty free. As important as what is in a conditioner, what is NOT in it is just as important to me. Shielo conditioner is totally sulfate free and paraben free plus it is a totally luxurious formula. That makes me feel even better about using it. The lack of sulfates means that it is safe for me to use even with my twice yearly keratin treatments to keep my hair smooth. I feel good about using it or letting my tween use it on her hair too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUOD81VA5VY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GS9OMU6#wasThisHelpful","R1BUOD81VA5VY3","A3CPL126VL12H8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CPL126VL12H8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought Clara by Kurt Palka was to be a story of love between an aristocratic young woman and the cavalry officer, but it is one of the most emotionless books that I've ever read...ever. Inspired by a collection of documents, the author seems more interested in showing off what he knows about that part of history, rather than showing any real talent for story-telling. It could easily have been a story about androids for the lack of human emotions.Clara, the woman at the center of the novel, seems very cold and unfeeling throughout most of the novel. She shows more interest in her books than in her own children or husband. The character development is almost non-existent, and, despite the time period, there is little drama within. The story reads more like an essay than a novel.I haven't been this disappointed with a book in a long time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIH7LB7PMNRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0771071329#wasThisHelpful","R1WIH7LB7PMNRF","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dead Run by Adam Mansbach begins with a man, aptly named Mulligan, attempting to cross from Mexico to the U.S.; he blacks out and comes to with a beautiful woman tearing into his thigh with her teeth. The story then cuts away to Jess Galvan, who tries to save a young girl from gang rape, only to end up in a Mexican prison. The POV continues to move from one character to another, including Galvan's daughter Sherry Richards and Sheriff Bob Nichols.Sherry is kidnapped on her way home; her mom is a recovering cult member. Meanwhile, Nichols finds a dead girl in the desert near the border with the ""kiss of the devil"" stabbed into her chest. Nichols is contacted by Ruth Cantwell, the doctor who was treating Sherry's mother after the mother and daughter escaped from a cult. It's not clear at first how the three storylines fit together, but they do converge, it makes for a great horror-thriller with a touch of the supernatural.Aaron Seth is the cult leader with one hell of a god-complex, but he is not as frightening as the demonic forces at work in the desert. There is an abundance of action, drama and carnage, and the entire story takes place within a 24 hour time period. The Dead Run is also the first book in a new series based on Jess Galvan. I cant wait to see what Mansbach has in store for the reluctant ""boy scout"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQF2Z97UPZ02L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006219965X#wasThisHelpful","RQF2Z97UPZ02L","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thirty Girls by Susan Minot is a powerful novel based on real-life events that took place in Uganda, in 1996: an abduction of the girls from St. Mary's College of Aboke. The POV moves between Jane, a journalist, and Esther, a girl from St. Mary's. Jane is on the rebound from a divorce; her ex-husband died from a drug overdose. Esther has escaped from her captors and she is trying to heal mentally and physically at a rehabilitation facility.The two women suffer pain and loss in completely different ways, but their suffering bonds the two together. The novel explores the various ways of interacting and connecting with other people in unfamiliar situations. Jane learns more about herself as she investigates the story of the girls that escaped from the rebel army, and her self-discovery is moving. However, Esther's journey makes a lasting impression - I can't imagine what it would be like to be torn from my bed in the middle of the night and be subjected to the atrocities that Esther was forced to endure.The novel is not a political statement - it's a story about human nature and how we perceive life based on our personal experiences. I recommend this novel to anyone who needs to take a step out of their comfort zone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5Q3YICR615T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307266389#wasThisHelpful","R3J5Q3YICR615T","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At Hell's Gates: Origins of Evil is the second volume of an effort to raise money for the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. I have already read volumes one and three, and I have yet to be disappointed. Whatever method they are using to choose the stories, it's working well. There is something for every horror fan, including science fiction and fantasy subgenres mixed with classical horror elements, and, if you're not normally a fan of the horror genre, you will be after reading any of the anthologies.This particular volume had numerous stories bordering on the bizarro genre, so, once again, the volume is unique from the other two:PULSE BY MARK TUFO is a fantastic thriller about a bug zapper, kind of like Borne Identity meets the SyFy channel.COOKIES FOR THE GENTLEMAN BY C.T. PHIPPS is a dark and hopeless tale about an unwanted visitor.BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY BY EVIN AGER introduces an Army MP with a Lovecraft-type of deployment.HISTORY'S END BY FRANK TAYELL is proof that even the smartest person can make a really stupid mistake.A MOTHER'S NIGHTMARE BY J. RUDOLPH is a sad zombie story that will tear your heart out.PATIENT 63 BY STEVE KOPAS is one of my favorites; this is an excellent outbreak story.TYRANNICAL ASCENSION BY SHANA FESTA is a twisted apocalypse story that I enjoyed a lot.INK BY JAMES CRAWFORD is another favorite of mine about the dark meaning of a tattoo.THE MAN WITH FOUR SCARS BY STEPHEN KOZENIEWSKI is Clan of the Cave Bear meets Night of the Comet, and is one of the very best stories in this volume.DADDY'S GIRL BY IAN McCLELLAN caught me off-guard with the twist; well-written.OPERATION DEVIL WALK BY DAVID MIKOLAS is a personal holocaust.THE INFECTED BY SG LEE shows how a zombie virus is born.FORGET ME NEVER BY SHARON STEVENSON tells the tale of a starlet's dark secret to success.MIRAGE BY SEAN T. SMITH is a story that Ray Bradbury would be proud of.THE MILLSTONE BY LESA KINNEY ANDERS is another favorite in this collection; it's one of the best vampire stories that I've ever read.GENESIS BY KIT POWER is an intense thriller-prequel to the novel ""Godbomb!""LOCKDOWN BY TIM CALDWELL features a zombie outbreak at a school.COLLECTION NIGHT BY CURREN GEIST is a gut-wrenching sci-fi story...a damn good one.THE COLD BY DEVAN SAGLIANI is one of the most unusual stories in the entire anthology.A DIFFERENT COCKTAIL BY CLAIRE C. RILEY is about a cult meeting that goes horribly wrong for one young man.A SONG TO SING IN BABYON BY BOBBY METEVIER & MATTHEW BAUGH is very weird...told from a demonic POV.THE GOUGER BY PAUL MANNERING is a brutal ending to a brutal anthology.The variety and originality of the stories makes this a perfect gift for horror fans, while contributing to a good cause.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3WFYDRSMXBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZKZBMY#wasThisHelpful","R1H3WFYDRSMXBC","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heritage by H. Perry Horton is the best fiction that I've read all year. The novel begins with a news article, drawing in readers while laying down the foundation of the story. There is disturbing imagery of a tortured little boy, but the description is subtle - no graphic details of the actual violence. I am impressed with how Horton terrifies readers without exploiting the pain and suffering of the characters for shock value.Possibly due to the number of horror/mystery/thriller books I have read, I guessed correctly which character is the perpetrator and how the person gets away with it, but it didn't ruin the story for me at all...and, even though I figured out who the killer is, I couldn't have predicted the ending if my life depended on it.I've never been so traumatized by a fictional character before reading Heritage. I've had nightmares from stories before, but this novel is so horrifying, I couldn't even read it one sitting. Horton is an exceptional horror writer, a true master of suspense, and I sincerely think this novel should be given an award.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9FUZO9O4WM3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YHVPF2#wasThisHelpful","R9FUZO9O4WM3S","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This collection has more humor than horror - a dry, dark humor that doesn't appeal to me. By the time the stories become interesting, they're over, so that didn't help. There are a few stories that I really enjoyed: THE DEATH TRAP BUS, A GOOD WAY TO DIE, MURPHY'S INSURANCE LAW, A CHARITABLE DEATH, THE WAR ON HALLOWEEN and TIL DEATH DO YOU PART. If it had been just those stories, I would have given at least four stars, but I felt like I had to trek through a lot of muck to get to the must-reads.Most of the stories are simply boring - not much change in one plot to the next. Even though there are different POVs, the character development is almost non-existent...people tended to react to the undead in the same nonchalant attitude from one story to the next. However, I am not saying, ""don't bother reading this,"" I'm just saying that this anthology didn't impress me that much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZTNBH489Q5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRQ4COQ#wasThisHelpful","R2SZTNBH489Q5Q","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The whole family is huge Star Wars fans, so this is just one more thing to add to the collection.It's not really much different from the original version, as far as rules, but keep in mind this is NOT the electronic version...there is an electronic Star Wars Battleship.The reason I gave four stars instead of five is because I think the quality is a little lacking. For starters, you have to apply stickers yourself. I hate having to decorate game pieces myself...and, if you screw up, there aren't any backup stickers to fix your mistakes. The pieces are stuck together like in model sets, so you definitely want an adult to carefully separate the ships.It's kind of easy to see over the divider, and the size of the board makes it hard to put the pieces where you want to. It's more limiting than the original version. Also, some pegs don't seem to fit quite right.Unless you are a diehard fan of both Star Wars and Battleship, you might want to pass...maybe even opt for the electronic version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7LQEHD2XNAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCL6#wasThisHelpful","R1A7LQEHD2XNAN","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Eyes On You by Kate White is not just a story about jealousy and threats, but also betrayal, trust issues and complicated relationships. Told from Robin's POV, there is a suffocating feeling throughout the novel, and the intensity of her situation increases with the suspense. While I felt bad for Robin as a victim of stalking and sabotage, she seems to lack the emotional depth of a main character. It made it difficult to empathize with her.I did read this book in one sitting, but I didn't wonder who as much as why...I wanted to know the motivation behind the attacks.

"I'm happy to say that Pajak brings all his talent to the third installment, Regeneration. It's six months after the initial outbreak, but it feels like a lifetime and then some. Matt and his fellow survivors are trying to keep it together at the Finnegan farm, but they have suffered another round of losses, and their future is looking even worse than their current circumstances. Matt and Brian venture away from the farm to round up the remaining residents of Randall Oaks, only to discover another group has taken over.The concept of yet another group of bad guys is not very original in a zombie series, but the ensuing battle is exceptional. Not only is the action brutal and realistic, but Pajak shows no mercy to his main characters. Wesley's POV informs readers what takes place at the farm while Matt is away, which means nothing is left out this time, but it made me wish that Pajak had included a POV from Sam or Kat to show readers how the new group took over Randall Oaks.The epilogue makes it obvious that this series is to be a trilogy only, and I wasn't disappointed with the ending in any way. If you haven't read this series yet, you should. The monsters aren't always wearing rotting faces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYWD328ES2Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SJQ31Q#wasThisHelpful","RRYWD328ES2Y5","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until You're Mine by Samantha Hayes introduces a theme that some may remember in the headlines: women so desperate for a baby that they attack pregnant women. The prologue is a great hook which introduces readers to a desperation some women feel when they are unable to conceive. however, until the end of the book, it is not clear who the childhood flashback belongs to, and the mystery creates a suspenseful atmosphere for the story to develop within.The three POVs belong to Claudia - stepmother to twins, Zoe - their nanny, and Lorraine - the detective hunting for the person killing expectant mothers and carving the babies out of them. I enjoyed the side stories of the women, such as the marital issues between Lorraine and Adam, and the strained relationship between Cecelia and Zoe. I also found the connections between characters enthralling, even though the characters themselves are mostly unaware of those connections.The author obviously uses misdirection throughout the story - too much and too often, in fact. Misdirection only works if the readers are unaware that they are deliberately being misled. Instead of building suspense, it took away from it. However, the pace remains steady throughout the novel, and I felt compelled to finish the book in one sitting. The epilogue is straight-forward, yet the very last sentence is the most sinister moment of the entire novel, as far as I am concerned.Even though the male characters take a backseat in this story, I think this crime thriller will appeal to both male and female fans of the genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQQT467OZ4HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804136890#wasThisHelpful","R3SQQT467OZ4HA","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Darkness Rising by Brian Moreland disappointed me. When I read his novel, The Vagrants, I couldn't wait to read more by the author, but his novella lacked the level of creativity that I'd come to expect from Moreland. Marty's special ""talent"" is extremely original, but the majority of imagery within Darkness Rising reminded me of various horror movies pieced together - kind of like Frankenstein's monster.The novella is well-written, and, perhaps, readers that are new to Moreland will enjoy this story more than I did, but I feel I would be doing a disservice to the author if I said this was a great example of his talent...it's not.

"Suddenly, Love by Aharon Appelfeld is a very intimate accounting of the love that develops between an elderly man and his much younger caretaker. There is almost no physical contact of any kind between the two characters and limited conversation, and, yet, what is left unspoken speaks volumes. Although it is a work of fiction, the historical elements add a depth to the characters which brings the two to life on a very personal level.I'm truly surprised by how captivated I was by this unusual relationship. I don't have a specific reason for choosing this story to read, other than wanting to read something that stands out from the typical mainstream romance novels. The setting is mostly contained to Ernst's apartment and the narration tends to favor Irena's POV. However, as Ernst share his writing with Irena, the literature within the literature is deeply moving...a profound sharing of souls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE61WL0H8DLFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805242953#wasThisHelpful","RE61WL0H8DLFM","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Steve is driving his wife Carrie to visit her family in West Virginia in a rain storm. During the drive, Carrie thinks she sees a bigfoot digging on the side of the road.

"My 9yr old loves puzzles and dinosaurs, so this is perfect for him. Not only does he like putting it together, but he gets out his plastic dinosaurs and uses the puzzle as a type of backdrop.The glow-in-the-dark feature is okay, but the glow doesn't last long. As far as the coloring, I wouldn't use crayons. My son used markers, but even colored pencils would be better than crayons because of the texture of the surface.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BU6SZB4ERSLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXOU20K#wasThisHelpful","R2BU6SZB4ERSLU","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brendan P. Myers has written a story that features a group of young boys, not unlike Stand By Me, with a horror a bit like Phantasm. Applewood has a slow beginning, but it didn't take long for me to get into the story. The novel begins with an unusual murder in present time, then flashes back to the childhood of the main characters, which draws readers into the heart of the story and surrounds them with drama, suspense and horror. Also, the background of the characters makes everything more emotional.The writing style of Myers is excellent, blending two mysteries into one fantastic vampire story. There is a sequel, Fledge, which follows the character Scott, but Applewood easily functions as a stand-alone. Even if you aren't into vampires, I recommend this story to all horror fans, including readers of YA fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZXKL16Y0CBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J59F7S#wasThisHelpful","R2DZXKL16Y0CBH","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The character development is excellent. I couldn't predict the behavior of Julia, Marcus or Sam, and the supporting characters provided some great misdirection. I was guessing all the way to the end, and I enjoyed not knowing what would happen next.I think the using three POVs to tell the story helped keep me on edge, and each switch is clearly labeled. However, the POVs overlap on the story's timeline, so I was a little confused at first. I think readers will get a kick out of seeing the same situation from three different perspectives...and yet Kramon doesn't reveal everything about his characters' inner thoughts - that is the real key to the suspense.I hope to read more by Justin Kramon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140CEPC84QPZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605984809#wasThisHelpful","R140CEPC84QPZX","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a reviewer/blogger, I was really excited to read this book. I thought it was great that someone decided to focus on the comments that shape and influence numerous types of websites, as well as the effect they have on the people who use those sites. However, I think Reagle missed his opportunity to truly explore new ground and, instead, wrote one anecdote after another. Considering the controversy over Amazon reviews in particular, I'm surprised at how little he covered the sociological aspects of this new culture that has developed as the internet has evolved.A lot of the information provided seems like unnecessary filler, such as details about products for sale, instead of spotlighting the different types of reviewers and other online commentators. As a result, the insight that Reagle provides loses its impact on the reader. The most enlightening section is Chapter 3, which discusses the various forms of manipulation that occurs through reviews, comments, likes, etc. I wish the rest of the book had been more like that chapter.In any case, if you are a reviewer, blogger or someone who relies on the internet to make a living, I recommend reading this book - it's entertaining, if not informative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FVXGQY5PT0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=026202893X#wasThisHelpful","R18FVXGQY5PT0P","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is a lot like Redken's Extreme AntiSnap Serum - I get the same results. I have fine (not thin, just fine) textured hair, so it's hard to find products that treat my hair without weighing it down. I've been using this for a week: skipping my conditioner and just applying this to my wet hair. I love the way it feels and looks. Not only does it look healthier, but it has a bit more volume.However, the reason I gave it four stars is because I have to pump it a LOT to get the same amount that two pumps of my Redken bottle gives me...and I have to use more of the Dove in general, so it's not really cost efficient in the long run.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQ3GIYKH4I53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS7ZVN8#wasThisHelpful","R3FQ3GIYKH4I53","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Killing Lessons is a suspense-thriller about a San Francisco homicide detective, Valerie Hart, who has been hunting a serial killer for some time. Her career is in jeopardy, due to a lack of progress in the case, and her personal life is a train wreck. When a random home invasion appears to have the same modus operandi as the murders in her case file, Hart is determined to catch the killer, even if it kills her in the process.Nell is the child who manages to escape from the grisly attack upon her family, but she is injured and trapped in a remote cabin with a crippled stranger. Unfortunately, the serial killer finds out there is a witness, he hunts Nell down as he tries to evade Detective Hart, and readers must bear witness to the deadly race between the two opposing forces.Saul Black does an excellent job of portraying the horrific suffering of the victims, without being overly graphic, while contrasting the killer's determination with that of the detective to create a sickening masterpiece in terror. I wanted Hart to find the killer, not just to stop him, but to redeem herself...the way she devalued herself made it painful to read her POV. In comparison, Nell - the young girl - is truly the strongest female character, and her struggle to survive gave me more hope than anything Hart was doing.There is also another female character, Carla York, a federal agent determined to kick Hart off the case and destroy the detective's career...I found her to be more of an antagonist than the actual serial killer. Black cleverly orchestrates drama between York and Hart to keep readers guessing about York's true motivation until the very end.The ending is well-written, but not nearly as shocking as the events leading up to the finale. However, I enjoyed this story a great deal, and I will never look at the alphabet the same way again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQI87QNJI63F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057345#wasThisHelpful","RHQI87QNJI63F","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though this is a work of fiction, it makes you think about what goes on behind the headlines of a violent murder. Readers are shown how the aftermath affects two married couples, parents of the convicted and the victim, couples who have known each other for years. The POVs are divided between Maris, mother of the victim, and Ron, father of the convicted. The story begins when Ron offers to kill himself to appease Maris. With one phone call, both of them realize that, although they had already felt shattered beyond words, they only recently hit rock bottom.I noticed that while Ron and Maris had similar ways of dealing with their grief, essentially shutting down and shutting everyone else out, the outcomes of their choices are radically different. There are many times when I feel that Ron is also a victim, particularly when his wife Deb decides to push for an appeal, dragging both families back into the spotlight. Maris, meanwhile, struggles to find something solid to hold onto...something about her struggle was more interesting to me than Ron's family drama. I really wanted Maris to find some happiness, but I wasn't sure Ron would ever find peace.There isn't anything particularly outstanding about this novel, but there is just enough suspense about the circumstances of the murder, as well as the connection Ron has with Maris, to keep the drama rolling along at a steady pace. If I had to pick one theme to describe this book, I would describe it as story about starting over...beginning from scratch at a time when a person believes major life changes are a thing of the past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSG884MPAHGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476757836#wasThisHelpful","R3MSG884MPAHGR","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think the title fits at all. There is nothing beautiful in this book, just lots of ugliness, but it's a captivating story and I'm glad that I read it all the way through. I had my doubts, at first, because the beginning is written like lyrics from a Talking Heads song (Once In A Lifetime) - I could even hear the story being narrated in David Byrne's voice. It is told in third person, moving from person to person, giving the reader insight that the characters don't have, but I didn't feel drawn to the story until the various chimp POVs were included. It was strange to feel more connected to the chimps than the humans. (The loose, random writing style left a LOT to be desired.)The story follows the life of Looee, a chimp captured as baby, raised by a childless human couple. After 14 years with no serious incidents, something devastating changes all of their lives, and Looee is sent to a primate research facility. The living conditions of the test animals is deplorable. I realize this is a work of fiction, but there are scenes that I could hardly stomach, regardless of how the scientists justify their actions. The author does a great job of highlighting the ugliness of animal testing, without the condemnation of the human race that often accompanies this subject matter.I don't think this is a novel that is going to appeal to a wide range of people, and yet it's one of those stories that is so radically different from most fiction, I think readers should at least attempt to tackle this one. Also, a portion of the novel's sales will go to the chimpanzee sanctuary, Save the Chimps, so it's reading for a cause.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XBGQ6TJGLCFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616953152#wasThisHelpful","R2XBGQ6TJGLCFO","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the initial concept of this novel: something locked away in our DNA is set free by a couple of scientists who think the anomaly is what should have been our natural evolution. The initial outbreak occurs in Orlando, Florida, just in time for the July 4th weekend, and the infection is spread by a mere touch. In other words, everyone is totally screwed.Carmen has the ability to sense something bad about to happen, and when she gets one of her feelings, she can only watch as the domino effect takes the life of her boyfriend. Scott and Kim are the only two to escape a parking garage that has become a death trap for everyone else. Janet jumps in Nick's car, and the two barely break away from a hellish traffic jam. Eventually, the survivors converge on the same truck rental location for sanctuary, but the infection has already beaten them there.The details of the infection are so graphic, I was gagging through most of the story. As soon as I saw the word ""worms,"" it was all over for me. Especially when the virus evolves to become more potent. The likelihood of becoming one of the dead is so high, I had little to no hope for the characters, especially when Carmen because severely injured, and the group turns on one another. If you read this novel, abandon all hope.R.M. Smith gets points for setting up such a bleak and grotesque outbreak scenario, but he loses points for the lack of depth in his characters. Without proper character development, the story is a little flat, even with all the action. I would have liked to see Smith do more with Carmen's sixth sense and I think her hobbling around with broken bones isn't realistic (I had a broken foot and there is no bloody way I could jump, climb, etc. the way Carmen does). Nick is a mystery; he talks about his pregnant girlfriend, while being a complete pig to the female survivors, not to mention the other horrible things that he does throughout the story...I would have liked to know why his personality is so dualistic. Janet didn't have much personality at all, and Scott and Kim are, well, Scott and Kim.Considering how long the novel is, I think Smith had plenty of space to do more with his main characters. He also could have skipped the side stories with the supporting characters, and just focused on the core group.All things considered, I was entertained, and that's all I really ask for with my undead. Beware if you have a weak stomach, but enjoy otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21CIN644TC487/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z23J3NK#wasThisHelpful","R21CIN644TC487","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me begin by stating that I do not believe a rape victim should be blamed or shamed at all. Period. I also do not believe that surviving a rape makes a woman stronger...the rape victims that I know personally happen to be strong women, but I know all too well how their rapes still affect them years later, and I wouldn't be stupid enough to tell them that they are better, stronger women because they were able to rebuild their lives after a rape.I want to make it perfectly clear that any critical comments that I have about this book and/or author has NOTHING to do with the rape itself, although the rape is a big part of the reason the author decided to make this journey and write her memoir. However, I do not think her personal journey on the Pacific Coast Trail is limited to her healing process because of the sexual assault.This is a coming of age memoir. This is a young woman sharing the painful process of growing up: establishing her boundaries in all of her relationships (especially with her mother) and learning to enforce those boundaries. She is not only discovering who she is, instead of measuring her value based on the opinions of others, but she is also learning to see herself with a new and healthier frame of mind. Unfortunately, she is, at times, her own worst enemy...some of her biggest obstacles, she creates herself.As far as the writing style itself, I found it to be quite repetitive in many places. For example, throughout the book, she keeps brining up the fact that her mother was still dressing her (bra and all) into high school. Her mother's smothering and sheltering behavior was already well-established in the beginning, when the author describes what her life was like before the rape. She revisits the same dysfunctional themes over and over in the book, but I didn't really see much progression in her thought process or changes in her behavior until she had finally neared the end of her journey. And, even then, she still seemed to have missed the point of establishing her independence. (She seemed pretty dependent on Dash, considering how new that relationship is. It also bothered me that she has no problem with her parents spending vast amounts of money on her, but she doesn't want to be treated like child.)I'm not sure how much of an influence the writing style had on my opinion of the author herself, but I feel she spends a great deal of time on the PCT being self-centered, self-destructive and she refuses to take responsibility for her decisions and actions, instead placing blame on everyone else around her, particularly her mother. The author often uses the behavior of others as an excuse to act out. Her binge drinking is a perfect example. She gets drunk several times, finds herself in compromising situations, even acknowledging that perhaps she shouldn't have been drinking at all, but it's always somehow the fault of everyone but her. I am not referring to the male hikers trying to take advantage of her, I am referring to the way she alienates everyone around her. She blames them, but doesn't take into consideration that maybe they didn't want to be around a girl who is so drunk, she is crawling around on the ground.In another example, she runs out of water, nearly dies of dehydration, and, even though her mother isn't on the PCT with her, it's her mother's fault for babying her for so long. She knows that she should have refilled her water-bottles when she had the chance, but she doesn't accept full responsibility. And, instead of learning from that near-death experience, she makes the same mistake again when she runs out of food. She also blames her awkward interactions with other hikers on the hikers themselves, rather than admitting her own lack of socialization skills is most likely the source of friction. She is so judgmental of the other hikers, while complaining any time she feels someone is judging her, I wish I could find out what the other hikers had to say about their interactions with her.On a more personal note: I think she might have gotten more out of her journey on the PCT if she had stayed sober. I know she sought help for the sexual assault, but I hope she was able to get her drinking under control. It seemed to be a huge crutch for her, as well as an obstacle to making real connections with other people.Up until now, I've been calling her ""the author,"" but I have a reason: her pen name is Aspen Matis, but that is not her given name in the beginning of her memoir. It seemed confusing at first, but I enjoyed the eventual explanation towards the end. I also appreciate the confidence she has in her writing, and I think that is the one thing she was absolutely correct about: she is a great author. Too bad it was so difficult to see beyond the self-centered martyr she made herself to be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8ZXBBA8XJV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062291068#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8ZXBBA8XJV3","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is amazing! I was just looking for a good mystery-thriller, but this story has elements of several sub-genres, which I won't mention because I am afraid of revealing spoilers. I was very impressed with the organization of the story: the timeline moves back and forth between the 1950s, the 1980s and the present...basically encompassing three generations. The POV switches often as well, but the sections are always labeled by year and person, so it's impossible for the reader to get confused or lost.The drama begins with two sisters, Rose and Sylvie, who are as different as night and day in the 1950s, and one suspects the other of keeping a terrible secret. At first I thought the author was using misdirection to lead readers away from what might be obvious to most, but the family secrets come in layers. These layers start to unravel in the 1980s with Amy, daughter of Rose, and her two friends, Piper and Margot, when they make a startling discovery that becomes the undoing of their childhood friendship. As adults, Piper and Margot decide to uncover all the details of Amy's family secret after Amy is suspected of slaughtering her entire family just days after she reached out to Margot for help. The truth, as hard as it to believe, might be the death of all involved with the family's motel and the mysterious tower on the property.I've never heard of Jennifer McMahon before this novel, but she has made me a fan with this dark mystery-thriller. The inclusions of Sylvie's letters to Alfred Hitchcock are perfect and a great way to emphasize the classic horror within these pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TL4A75PR42N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538510#wasThisHelpful","R30TL4A75PR42N","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel is centered around a young girl named Ari, adopted from China by a single Chinese-American woman, Charlie. Even though Ari is at the heart of the story, it doesn't take long to realize that all three generations of the Kong women, including Aunt Les and Ari's grandmother, are doing some serious soul-searching. Ari is struggling with abandonment issues and longing for a father figure, Charlie is struggling with being a single mother, Les is trying to balance a career and love life, and the grandmother has been keeping a dark secret for years.I enjoyed reading the story, but it was almost like watching a car accident happen in slow motion. I found all four women to be very self-centered, even though Ari's mother, aunt and grandmother keep emphasizing the importance of family. I never sensed any real happiness within the Kong family and no one gets the happy ending they're longing for. So why read such a depressing story?It's a gritty eye-opener, displaying the cultural differences, not only between China and the U.S., but also between the Chinese-Americans in Chinatown, the Chinese-Americans trying to be as ""American"" as possible, the white families that adopted Chinese daughters, and, of course, Ari and her Chinese-American family. Ari's self-destructive path is the prefect tool to highlight all the racial politics, both at home and abroad.Ma's debut novel is a well-written social commentary that I think will interest readers who enjoy novels with cultural emphasis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWZU67IOFODB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062273345#wasThisHelpful","R2CWZU67IOFODB","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can't believe I actually put off reading this book for over three years! When I first put it on my reading list, I did so because I was looking to read more fantasy books at the time. However, I was under the impression that this novel had a heavy religious theme, and that's a theme (much like politics) that I try to avoid, even in literature.The book description emphasizes the turmoil between followers of the Light, and worshippers of Mother Earth, mentioning missionaries, priests, heresy and treason. What it doesn't mention is the family drama that is the true heart of the story. And, while the details of the Mother's children definitely brings the fantasy element front and center, the medieval setting has some elements of historical fiction.Three siblings (Maddy, Bram and Rollo) are separated at the beginning of the story by circumstances arising from the conflicts between the two religions of their country. Thus, three separate storylines emerge, one following each of the Woodbridge children. From time to time, the POVs of other characters are included, depending on their proximity and/or relationship to the Woodbridge trio.I think Maddy's storyline is the most interesting because her character appears to go through the most physical and emotional changes. Bram's experiences are also very extreme, but he maintains his childhood innocence longer than his brother and sister. While Rollo is a main character, and a key plot device, I don't think he has to face as many personal challenges as his two younger siblings.The character development is amazing. Duncan doesn't describe his characters as much as he allows readers to share in their experiences, creating a bond between the audience and the Woodbridge children. The use of dramatic irony also built the suspense far higher than I would have expected for a novel based in this genre.The ending did leave me wondering if this was to be continued in a series; it works as a stand-alone, but I wouldn't mind reading another story set in the opposing country.If you've ever read anything by Fred Saberhagen, you might enjoy Dave Duncan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LK99EVKTRQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612182038#wasThisHelpful","R13LK99EVKTRQ0","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used different kinds of sponges to apply my foundation, and I only recently heard of people using brushes, so I've been trying an assortment of brushes to see if I can tell the difference.I have two different kinds of foundation that I use, depending on my makeup needs: cream and liquid. I could not believe how much better this brush is than any sponge. I didn't have any streaking, etc. and both types of foundation went on so much smoother.The brush is obviously of a higher quality than my other brushes, but I'm not crazy about the price difference.

"This sequel begins literally just a few days after the first book ends, and I love the seamless storyline. Unfortunately, Alex gets the bright idea to go ashore to look for his family, even though he doesn't have a clue where they might be. Naturally, everything goes wrong for him as soon as his feet hit the ground, and he is separated from Lucy. Luckily, he meets another group: Sam, Tanya and Jax. These new survivors seem better prepared than Alex's first group. However, the military is just as much of threat, if not more, as the undead...especially when Alex discovers more information about the ongoing infection.There are several surprising and horrifying twists, which help keep up the pace of the story, but I thought the second group of survivors were too much like Alex's first group. I would like to see more character development, even if it's just Alex's perception of people around him.The cliffhanger is absolutely tragic, and I can't wait to read the next one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZ00Q4XAZD0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNZ0ZMM#wasThisHelpful","RDZ00Q4XAZD0J","ACR4HKUT808U1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACR4HKUT808U1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's terrific that De Burgh keeps giving us a nice range and depth of characters, both young and old intermingled as friends and in romantic relationships. Her best IMHO remains ""Less Happier Lands"", the first in this loosely tied trilogy, so I liked how Diana and Sam show up to offer sage advice and support. (As was the case with ""Seize the Day"".) ARLT is no less a book to read than the others, though the enormous patience and devotion for frigid damaged Frances exhibited by rich but not so rock solid Jordache still in deep grief was a bit of a stretch to me. A life skill that Jordache learned from her older dead partner Mell is to hope for the best but prepare for the worst. So, one hopes for happy ever after and kindness trumping the corrosive for both Frances and Jordache. The reality is that healthy relationships are hard to form even between functional folk. I found myself wanting to tell Jordache to run from all this drama - that her insistent white hot goal more likely would yield a ripe crop of pain that ineluctably sprouts from the dysfunctional or non-functioning when least expected and when least able to defend oneself. Alas, 29-year-olds consider themselves invincible and don't always have 20/20 vision for what's around the bend. It also nibbled at my willing suspension of disbelief that, while age doesn't always matter, the life experiences that come from economics and, sadly, class often does. Their mutual catholicism was necessary to move the story forward. But the glue hovering in the background of ARLT is ultimately the wealth of Jordache, her ability to give and keep giving financially to rescue both Frances' family and Frances, who at 49 always will be on unequal footing, except for the largess of the younger Jordache. That left me with a sense of unease, though perhaps this is material for another sequel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LSDWU5XC8M2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6SP5TU#wasThisHelpful","R2LSDWU5XC8M2O","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Liked this one. A dual storyline that evolves over 15 years. Themes of love and duty are prominent. Whether one likes Sam and Diane or not, much of the story rang true: The permanent corner of one's life - the devotion - a first true love inhabits, despite age difference or geographic distance or what may come between; the portrayal of widespread harsh and even violent homophobia of the 1960s and even 1970s; lack of maturity but precocious intelligence that gives way to the pull of repairing family ties; a profoundly put upon prodigal daughter in her mid-20s. It was a vastly different, dangerous time with no roadmap to coming out, being out or navigating a long term g/l relationship; these 2 women in Less Happier Lands are doing their best to share a heart, to make their lives work together, with close to zero family and societal assistance or acceptance. Sam's younger reality has moments of indecision and poor judgment, for which she pays dearly - each and every. So, too, does Diane in her less stark and desperate cocoon. Both are faced with untenable positions simply as the course of life. How each handles their respective mountain to move will either keep them separated or bring them back together. Life deals nearly everyone a full house of moving parts and issues that cannot always be sidestepped. This is not part of the LesLit genre that sugarcoats or makes hurdles so outlandish as to be unbelievable just to get to the happy ever after.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TU4USEGQUIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EG0DIUE#wasThisHelpful","R31TU4USEGQUIX","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm hoping GGR motivates her to read Good Girls Revolt. Big city print journalism has never been what the public presumed, especially for the women working in it and devoted to the profession The late 1960s Newsweek women kicked down the door as a collective. Other women in the profession, both print and broadcast, were doing the same thing but often on their own, without group support. As portrayed in GGR, this is what it continued to be like for female journalists in the 1970s, too, with dawn breaking in the 1980s - mostly thanks to the unquestioned equal opportunities offered in nascent medium of cable broadcast news, quite frankly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKMOR515KVWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AOXKR8#wasThisHelpful","R2VKMOR515KVWE","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wish I'd found these several years ago, before our breakfast bar chairs rubbed away the top sealant finish on our kitchen hardwoods. We settled on these, after looking at all the different types of chair leg caps. These are pliable clear plastic and will slip right onto the chair or table leg but are snug and thick enough to withstand movement or bumps. Our kitchen barstools have rear square legs and front round decorative scroll legs, so I was worried we'd need two different sizes. I measured the diameter of the front and rear chair legs to get the correct sizing, since Lorell makes a handful of different size leg caps. This 1.2 fit all 4 legs of each chair. The soft bottom felt padding is generously thick enough to protect floors but not alter the height or stability. i.e. seem to be a high quality that will last over years of use. A bargain for the inexpensive price to protect expensive floors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MM2PLIGSKDDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YESBL6#wasThisHelpful","R2MM2PLIGSKDDM","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far so good. We wanted a dusk to dawn option on an existing outdoor light between the garage doors that doubles as a security light at that side of the house/yard. We'd tried sensor lights in the past but found them unreliable. The Philips energy saver seems to do fine. As soon as it arrived, I screwed it into an inside lamp to ensure operation and it, indeed, did flash a couple times and then stay a solid beam. RIght before dusk, I transferred it to the intended outdoor light (with a frosted globe and under a bit of an overhang/eave, which didn't impede it one bit). After turning the sensor to the most advantageous light receptive spot, the bulb came on right away. The amount of light is surpassingly bright. Given the price, hope it last a good long while. We'll likely buy a 2nd one for the lantern at the front door.

"Fine light dining for the mind. Don't be shy about handing this book to your favorite adult or teen reader, gay or straight. Quindlen has written a sleek but substantive novel about the tensions of teen life, the exploration of love - and not just angst or same sex attraction. There is bravery and there is bigotry, loneliness and surprising strength in the face of violence, with gradations in between. If you think the setting of a Baton Rouge Catholic parochial high school is a small box to have characters inhabit and bump against the corners, think again. The narrative would play just as well in any U.S. town or city, Seattle to Boston, Akron or Austin. Between these pages is an entire community populated by ineluctable saints and sinners but, as in life, few foregone conclusions. The strongest note is the interior conversations our protagonist Hannah has with herself and about the handful of antagonists who impede her journey to true north Baker, including Baker herself. At age 17, surrounded by 5 long time friends all college bound and in their last year of high school, Hannah's choices now rest with her - as do the consequences. At times, she will stand alone, searching for solutions among the static. In an era of American arrested development, not enough authors give young girls the credit anymore for a range of thoughtfully formed emotions at the cusp of adulthood, as well as the ability to break free from the miasma of religion, conformity and betrayal of others on their own journey. It's always a pleasure to read lean, pitch perfect dialogue uttered by well-crafted young characters. Her Name in the Sky is modulated, with emotional spikes that ring true. Many adults, male and female, will relate and find themselves traveling back in time to view their younger self at critical moments when life irrevocably pivots for them or someone they knew. Others will relate to the adults who help or hinder. Would they make the same choices, would they have the courage to support those faced with dancing along the edge of conflict?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76ASK0MNIW4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IM0J2A4#wasThisHelpful","R76ASK0MNIW4B","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Does not hold a charge and necessary play tray will not connect via bluetooth to any of our devices. Waiting to hear from Digital Dreams support on return or exchange of defective Puzzlets game. Our kid is already as frustrated and disappointed with it as I am. Any kid over the age of 6 who already plays Minecraft or even Skylanders likely will not be impressed with a goofy alligator and cartoonish pre-school characters in the app. Truly, a better option would be the much more sophisticated Kano, which is actually a snap together Raspberry Pi computer kit with keyboard-trackpad that teaches coding, gaming and a ton of real tech skills. We bought one of these first Puzzlets in August at $69, which is overpriced by at least $25, given how little it is and actually does. Reminds me of some of the early LeapFrog stuff.Edit: Digital Dream Labs customer service promptly sent us a new replacement device, which does work as intended. Due to DDL quick response, I'm more than willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt the problem was just a glitchy lemon and will upgrade my rating accordingly, from 1 star to 4. Watching my kid rather easily play the games, I'd suggest that - If you can swing the $$$ outlay, start a younger child on Puzzlets, along with the many steps up Kano that'll keep their interest while also teaching networking and coding skills. Different animals for different ages that can overlap.Edit #2: Replacement device worked once, then battery would not hold a charge and the play tray once again would not connect to the iPad app via bluetooth, which is necessary to play the games. Deleted the app, which loses all game progress, re-installed and the DDL app worked (deleting/re-installing the app didn't work on the 1st defective device). Bottom line: A glitchy interface that takes away from the time the child can use the device and adds to parent frustration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7U4LXXXL3KTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TSMF9S#wasThisHelpful","R7U4LXXXL3KTB","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our 4 now adult very healthy (and seemingly happy) fantailed goldfish really like this food. We've bought different brands over the years and keep returning to this one. The ziplock top is a real bonus for keeping the 2 lbs. fresh. Our pond fish are not pets that we try to train or have entertain us. We are pleased to enjoy them enjoying the best environment we can provide, which includes constant monitoring of that environment for cleanliness, nutrition and general health. i.e. we care and respond to their needs. If we pass the pond or even linger, they don't really notice us - which is fine with me, as they are busy doing their thing with each other as fish. However, I do delight every morning at feeding time, when they always swim up to the surface and over to me to receive a handful of their Tetra Variety Blend. This is the only pond fish food they've ever responded to so enthusiastically. One other reason I care is that these 4 are the great grandchildren of our original 4 who constantly bred so quickly and in such great numbers that we had 40 of several generations at one point and had to constantly find good pond homes for most every year in order to keep them all and the medium size pond healthy. We rarely lost any to to death and disease, but it was always an issue to worry about - for their sake as captive creatures.

"In many ways, ""The Right Window"" is a story of capacity, not just to love later in life but to develop new friends, to pull together disparate threads of one's life and of those closest to us - those we think are closest to us. This is not merely a story of woman meets woman, etc‚Ä¶ There's a care taking theme, because that is what much of life is: taking care of ourselves and of those we encounter along the way over the years; interpersonal relationships are inevitably a reflection of how we view ourselves, how we grow into someone truer to our core. Sweeney has crafted a well-written story of depth, humor and kindness that's a cut above most lesbian fiction. ""The Right Window"" is a welcome departure from the crowded field of cardboard cut-out college coming out angst, lonely young adult anger and cheating exes. Through the eyes of 54-year-old June, we travel in time through the lives of her elusive friend, Lorena. The primary and secondary characters in both geographic locales of Chicago and small-town Fraser Creek, South Carolina are interesting in their own way and easily recognizable to many readers, especially those who grew up in small towns but left: People you know and can't get enough of, people you don't want to know any more, people you thought you knew but who left tangled knots behind, people who orbit us and provide a tracking beam to the mindful moment. Some skate the edges, some navigate the safe middle, some make do with aching self-absorbed dysfunction. Most put one foot in front of the other, just as it is with much of life. This is not a dark or spiteful story, not one of shaming, judging or lack of self-worth. It is one of living with the vulnerable corners of life. The standalone and interwoven threads inevitably clothe the self - the solid wall of friendships, as well as the chimera. As with most fiction, there are the intersecting life stories of loyalty, messy regret, things we can change and things we learn from - lives well and poorly lived. Bonus: a fluid style accentuated by tight editing . The bits about the animals will warm your heart, as will the sharp exchanges by older and wiser women.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P5L1GJZU5TKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015KYAXN4#wasThisHelpful","R3P5L1GJZU5TKI","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have the green one, not the red, and don't know if there is a difference.These Ant Guards work like a charm! We've had the same one for about 5 years now, putting it up with the hummingbird feeder at the end of summer and leaving it until October. It still repels whatever sugar ants and stray insects might be attracted to the liquid sugar solution. (We make our own clear solution for a red bottle: 1/4 cup cane sugar dissolved into 3/4 cup water; no red dye or any other contaminants.) We get several hummingbirds every year from August to e/o September and sometimes into October. The hanger on our feeder (the smaller 16 oz. red glass Perky Pet) slips over the bottom hook of the Ant Guard, the top of which hangs from a wrought iron garden plant hanger attached to a less trafficked post off the deck that can be seen from a big family room window. They return to the same spot every year like clockwork and are very used to us to where we can noodle around the deck and backyard without them caring one iota. Living in the humid south and in a place with lots of old growth trees shading the yard and deck, we do also get sugar ants and even carpenter ants, which I generally kill off every early spring to get the queen, though they'll return as we have a tulip poplar off the deck that they love. The one time I road tested the process by leaving off the Ant Guard, the ants pronto got into the hummingbird feeder within an hour, like white on rice. I had to rinse out the feeder, make a new batch of sugar solution and learned my lesson to always attach the Ant Guard at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGRT8THDAJSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZRVZIK#wasThisHelpful","RZGRT8THDAJSV","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are surprisingly good looking for fake leather. The rounded toe and low heel actually are much nicer than is pictured. The pair I received do not have the wrinkled calf also as pictured, thank goodness. Oxblood can be a difficult color to find these days, though it once was standard in women's and men's shoes. It goes well with just about any color pant, skirt, dress. As a tall woman, I've always been a fan of the simplicity and classic look of boots in fall and winter. My calves are not especially thin but these boots fit just fine, with no gap, thus one might need hose or very thin socks. The zipper runs the length of the back and the ankle is slightly fitted, so don't expect to be able to just slip these on and off.

"We have 4 cats, all the same age and 3 which are siblings. The 4th is a same-age very, very feral female we adopted who has since become a lap sitting lovergirl. Each of the 4 daily will pick their favorite toy out of a small basket filled with cat toys we keep in the sunroom for them to choose from at will. Every single morning for the last 7 years, we've woken to 4 toys brought from downstairs to the master bedroom. My challenge is keep going that lovely, affectionate tradition they did all on their own. This toy - the mesh pretzel - is someone's favorite, as it always ends up both upstairs and often played with as well downstairs all around our tile front hallway and kitchen floor. Though I'm not certain exactly who has claimed it, I suspect it is the small, once-feral female who seems to prefer lightweight toys (she really is tiny, save for a massive Maine Coon coat) now that she has rediscovered and unleashed her inner kitten whimsy that had been shelved while out in the wild struggling to survive. It truly is lightweight and the mesh males it easy for cats or kittens to pick up, fling with their paw or tote around in their mouth. It has lasted about 2 years now and is still looking' good. I like it because it doesn't appear to collect stray floor or carpet dirt/dust, though I suspect it could easily go in the wash without any harm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTWC44LLW2P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006XE35YU#wasThisHelpful","R2OTWC44LLW2P4","AHHFA4RWWQ09Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHHFA4RWWQ09Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Zero Visibility has a little something for everyone. There's nothing to dislike in any of the characters and a lot to like in the geographic setting. There are no villains, mostly just family and friends and casual lovers getting on with life as best as possible. It's a relaxing, flowing and pleasant read, as most Georgia Beers' books are. Whatever troubles or life's speed bumps the characters hit are also familiar and relatable. Apart from that Beers is always a good read, her books are also well-written and well-edited. The storylines do not seem forced, overwrought or - where location appropriate - factually incorrect. Grammar, spelling and syntax are tight as a bug in a rug, which is a blessing to many a reader.

"I like it. Most importantly, my cats like the Scamper Bug. It's not their favorite toy, likely because over the last 7 years since they were kittens, I've bought them every sort of these remote control cat toys on the feline market and none really lived up to their feline imagination. So, they're kind of jaded. This one has held up past the critical 24 hour point. It's a hefty remote but lightweight, soft plush little bug that travels on a tripod of little wheels. It recharges via a plug from bug to remote, with remote charged by 2 AA batteries. My cats are siblings, which might be why they still play a lot and well with each other. No aloof or difficult characters in that clan. They still prefer small stuffed toys they can carry around in their mouth (and deliver at my feet as a gift), like any predator would, but this is a cute diversion and we can play together. They totally get the whole remote thing - that I'm controlling it. They love me enough to play along. It was on sale, otherwise, I likely wouldn't have paid more than $10. We already purchase enough cheap Chinese stuff for the house, for the family and for the cats.  :-)Edit: reduced stars down to 3. After 2 days all of mine refuse to play with it. They just sit and watch me trying to get them to play with it. Their and my reasons not to recommend: It stops and starts in fits; will ONLY work on a tile or wood floor; runs out of power quickly and has to be recharged; it will only go forward and back, which limits its ease of use and ability to interact/attract the feline desire for varied. movement in its ""prey"".

"These soft nippled cabinet bumpers are what most homeowners have longed searched for. I'm not prone to gushing over home hardware items, however, this product is my exception. Our home came with high end kitchen cabinets - lots of them, which is fantastic. The downside was the original manufacturer bumpers quickly petered out, flattened and nothing I replaced them with did one thing to deaden the loud thunk when any where even gently closed. So very tired of the noise after 8 years and trying every other type of bumper that I figured one last hurrah might be the fix. It is. Upon arrival in the mail, I tested them on the most used and most annoyingly loud banging cabinets. Voila! I then went around removing all the useless, old replacement bumpers, replacing them with these. With a coupled left over, I attacked the bathroom vanity cabinets. And now back ordering more. I'll update later with time to see if the soft noise reducing bumpers remain soft and noise reducing. Why manufacturers don't use these on the front end is puzzling.

"I was looking for a mouse. A cheap mouse. Something under $10. Hopefully, something that would actually last longer than the last cheap mouse I bought on Amazon (it didn't even last a month!). I have used and reviewed a lot of Belkin products in the past, usually with pretty good results. This was not literally THE cheapest mouse I could find on Amazon, but it was still under $10, so I decided to take a gamble on it.Fortunately, for what is unarguably a ""cheap"" (in cost) mouse, the Belkin USB Optical Mouse is surprisingly well built and works flawlessly. A couple of things impressed me with this mouse off the bat, First, it has no ridiculous, unnecessary LEDs. I have this mouse connected to a laptop in my bedroom and mice with blinking LEDs drive me nuts. They also waste electricity. I love the fact that this mouse does not light up my entire  bedroom, even when the computer is unplugged. Secondly, I was also impressed with the USB cable that the mouse uses. Most ""cheap"" mice sold these days use cords that are as thin as a strand of spaghetti. This is always a sign of poor construction, which leads to a very short mouse lifespan. The Belkin mouse has a pretty beefy USB 2.0 cable by today's standards. Light enough to not get in your way, but thick enough that it will probably last longer than my past few cheap mice put together.The packaging that the mouse arrived in was a very simple cardboard box. No driver disk (none necessary, for Windows at least). No confusing manual written in Chinese. No maddening blister packaging, nor any materials that can't be recycled. Kudos to Belkin for keeping things simple. It's definitely worth more than the $2-3 extra than you will pay for THE cheapest mouse you can find here on Amazon. So, do yourself a favor and give the Belkin mouse a try. I'm guessing that you will not be disappointed, either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A4IH98CZXU5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CLWN5A#wasThisHelpful","R1A4IH98CZXU5L","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to rate this drive squarely in the middle as compared to the rest of its SSD counterparts. I ran benchmark tests on the drive alongside another solid state drive that I had bought earlier this year, made by Kingston. The results were fairly comparable, in that both fell well short of their advertised maximum read/write speeds.Disk read speeds on the OCZ Trion 100 Series (240GB) SSD were fairly average, clocking in at just a little better than 300 MB/s at its absolute fastest. That's nowhere near the advertised max speed of 550 MB/s, but at least it's in the ballpark. On disk writing speeds, benchmark tests showed the OCZ disk to not even be in the same zip code, let alone the ballpark, though. At best, I was able to eek out 100 MB/s, as compared to the advertised max write of 520 MB/s. I ran the same test 5 times in a row to assure accuracy. Disappointing? Yes. Surprising? No.Unfortunately, solid state drives not living up to their specs seems to be the norm with most manufacturers today, including OCZ. The common excuse seems to be that I just happened to get a bad one, or that I must not be testing the drive correctly. I have been building computers for myself and for my customers for 20+ years now. In other words, I know what I'm doing and how to properly test computer equipment. The benchmarks simply don't lie. Unfortunately, 90% of the drives I test these days are no better, which is why I am cutting OCZ some slack. It is not THE cheapest drive on the market (the similar Kingston 240GB drive is selling for about $10 cheaper at the moment), but it is still way cheaper than a drive that I would expect to pass benchmarks with flying colors.Bottom line, as long as you aren't actually expecting this drive to operate anywhere near it's advertised speeds, it is a pretty good deal. If you want/need a drive that actually performs to spec and is screaming fast, I would suggest something from the Intel 5XX series of solid state drives.You will pay nearly twice as much for Intel's drives, but you can always rely upon them to run at the speeds they advertise. In the end, you get what you pay for in the world of SSDs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCWWT6MHE4J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106AOB7G#wasThisHelpful","RLCWWT6MHE4J4","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that I at first found the basis of this book to be intriguing. Unfortunately, the concept seemed to come unraveled rather quickly. The author's explanation of his theory seems to be an answer in search of a question, in story after story. However, some of his arguments feel way too much like trying to stuff a round peg into a square hole.While there may be some cases in the media of black vs white, in actual practice story telling is a much more of a grey area. The best stories are ones that closely reflect real life and let's face it, if real life was mostly black vs white (good vs evil) it would be infinitely easier to make decisions based upon our faith. Implying that all works of man must be inherently good because we are all made in God's image is a gross oversimplification, but that seems to be part of the general argument from what I was able to take-away from the book.While I find it a very hopeful for mankind to think that there is always some inherent good in what we do, no matter how hard it may be to see at first glance, I unfortunately have to classify this as wishful thinking. It's nice to think that every cloud has a silver lining, but at some point you have to accept that the cloud part vastly outweighs any silver lining you may eventually find. There is just too much ""reading between the lines"" in this book and not enough subjective reality. I admire the author's devotion to his argument, but I believe that his devotion in this case may be misplaced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TD5T6XN64OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787413#wasThisHelpful","R13TD5T6XN64OM","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two cats and have subjected both of them to trying an ever-growing list of ""healthy"" cat foods in order to find the best balance between quality ingredients, taste and cost. This particular brand was not all that difficult to judge, but not for the reasons you might expect.First of all, I had a difficult time convincing either of my cats to actually try this particular brand and I am pretty sure that I know the reason why. Compared to every other cat food I have fed them before, Hill's Science Diet definitely has the largest kibbles. I took a picture that I will upload with this review, but suffice to say it is both wider and thicker than any cat food I can remember seeing. My cats seem to have sensitive teeth and at first avoided it, very likely for this reason.Insofar as quality ingredients go, the actual ingredients list is quite disappointing. While the #1 ingredient may be meat (chicken), it really goes downhill (no pun intended) from there. The #2 ingredient is whole grain wheat, #3 is corn gluten meal, #4 is pork fat, followed by powdered cellulose, wheat gluten, chicken liver flavor (what, just flavor, not actual chicken liver?) dried beet pulp, soybean oil, and on and on... Near the end are some other ingredients you would never expect to see in a cat food, such as apples, cranberries, carrots and broccoli. This ingredients list is something I would expect to find in a cheap-o brand cat food sold in bulk, not a supposedly ""premium brand"" cat food. What kind of ""science"" they are using to come up with these ingredients is beyond me, but it does not sound like the basis of a healthy diet for cats.Hill's premium brand also sells at a premium price, which can not be justified considering the ingredients it uses. In a rather ironic move, the bag lists the #1 ingredient as chicken and displays next to that a picture of what looks to be fried chicken. I will assume that the chicken in this cat food is not deep fried, but you never know. It does include pork fat.I will let my cats finish this one bag (if they will agree to it), but I definitely will not continue feeding it to them beyond that. Hill's makes some excellent products, but this isn't one of them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYJ1MXKC014X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQYGSU6#wasThisHelpful","R2GYJ1MXKC014X","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nutro has been around for quite awhile and at one time was one of those high-end brands that you could only seem to find at veterinarian's offices. The small company eventually ended-up being bought out by Mars, a corporation mostly known for its line of chocolate bars. Since then, Nutro has gone mainstream and you can find their products in pretty much every major supermarket chain in the country. It's price has also come down accordingly.These days, Nutro is somewhere near the middle of the pack on price/quality when it comes to ""healthy"" dog and cat foods. I had largely avoided the brand in the past due to its high cost, but it has gotten to the point now where it is not outrageously expensive, so I thought that I would give it a try.Both of my cats seemed to take to Nutro's ""hairball formula"" right away. They each seem to have rather sensitive teeth so the size and shape of this food is a definite plus. It isn't soft, but it is a lot less ""crunchy"" and dry than other brands that seem to have more complex shapes. The Ziplock-like resealable bag it comes in also keeps it fresh for longer.The ingredients list is impressive in some ways and disappointing in others. Unlike the really cheap cat food brands it does not contain corn, grain, artificial colors or a tremendous amount of fillers. It is also supposed to be GMO-free, although I don't know how on earth that could even be tested for. The #1 ingredient is real meat (chicken), which is something I always look for. It does have some non-meat sources of protein that cost them less to include like peas and potatoes. That seems to be the trend nowadays among most of the cat food manufacturers though. It is definitely healthier for cats than stuff like corn or grain, but not something they would probably not eat at all were it not for the majority of the flavor coming from chicken and chicken meal.I normally feed my cats Purina One Smartblend because they seem to love it so much. Nutro seems to be slightly higher quality (Purina One DOES use corn as filler material) and my cats like it almost as much, so I will probably end-up switching. The price difference between the two is justified and not all that great considering the better ingredients.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UAAEGXDQMR4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZI3QFE#wasThisHelpful","R2UAAEGXDQMR4T","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The cable I received did not arrive in consumer packaging, just a plastic bag, but I am assuming that it was actually manufactured by Belkin due to the fact that the Belkin name is stamped across the entire length of the actual cable. If the cable is counterfeit, the manufacturer went through an awful lot of trouble. The construction and features seem the same as other patch cables I have bought from Belkin in the past as well.Since the particular patch cable I ordered was only 3' long, there isn't really much that can/should go wrong with the product. It definitely seems up to spec. I generally buy CAT6 for most long runs, but for patch cables like this I can't imagine that there is any difference in performance between CAT6 and CAT5E that is measurable. Honestly, CAT6 has been standardized for so long now, it makes me wonder why anyone even bothers to make 5E anymore.Irregardless, Belkin has been my go to manufacturer for patch cables for quite awhile now.

"I've owned a (regular) George Foreman Grill for several years now and really like its features. When I first looked at this grill, I figured that it would keep most of the same features and characteristics of the regular GF electric grills, only it runs on liquid propane. Not really.To me, the greatest part about my electric George Foreman Electric Grill is the ability to avoid a huge mess by using the teflon cooking surfaces on both sides to contain any grease splatter. I can just throw-on a hamburger after pre-heating, and walk-away, since it includes a shut-off timer. It cooks evenly on both sides. When it's done, I just pour out the grease and throw the teflon cook surfaces in the dishwasher. The Camp and Tailgate Grill is a whole different story though.Having only a single side to the grill allows for grease to splatter, most of which sticks to the metal parts of the grill. These parts can not be put in a dishwasher and have to be cleaned by hand. Having a single side and cooking with gas also means no walking away from the grill at any time. You need to be there to both flip the food over as well as properly turn of and then disconnect the propane bottle. There is no automatic shutoff timer. Unlike the electric version there is also no way to easily determine what temperature your grill is operating at.Just opening the unit up pretty much requires reading the few instructions you will find in the manual. It is kind of clunky in that regards. The manual itself is mostly just warnings about cooking with gas in general. One thing that few other reviewers have mentioned is that the safety warnings explicitly warn you NOT to use anything but a 1 pound LP container. It doesn't give a reason, but it is VERY specific about warning you not to ever use any other sized container. It also warns you never to store LP containers indoors or store it attached to the grill. So, you basically need to store most of the grill inside and the LP bottle and regulator outside, since it also says not to store the grill itself outdoors.Insofar as its cooking abilities, although I personally prefer charcoal when cooking outside, this is what I would call a nice ""emergency stove"". It's something I might use on my deck if I am cooking for just myself, but I would prefer a ""real"" BBQ when cooking large meals for the best taste. I don't tailgate, so I don't know how convenient this would be for those occasions, but it certainly will fit into a vehicle much more easily than a traditional LP or charcoal BBQ. It would also be much more convenient for camping, as I can't imagine lugging a full-size BBQ around more than a few feet. This grill folds-up easily and has a carrying strap for easy transport. FYI, you can store the drip tray and regulator inside the grill when carrying it. They will fit under the griddle. You will have to carry the LP bottle(s) separately though.It's not quite what I expected, but still a decent and sturdy product that comes in handy if you aren't cooking at home. If you don't mind the grease splatter and cleanup it entails, as well as the constant attention needed while cooking, this might be the perfect outdoor grill for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NURWHHWK8CEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NURWHHWK8CEZ","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie started out kind of slow, but very quickly picked-up its pace and started sucking at full throttle. The script is plain nonsense, the characters unlikable and performances barely serious enough to convince me that this was a spoof and not a spoof of a spoof. Don't get me wrong, I love cheesy, campy movies in general. Some of my favorite films are cult classics. This one just isn't entertaining enough for me to not regret wasting 90 minutes of my life though.About the only redeeming qualities in this film worthy of mention are the performances of Corey Feldman and The Iron Sheik (mostly the latter). Despite Feldman's awful lines, he is the one entertaining and likable character in the movie. The Iron Sheik is clearly the highlight of the film though. Although he has few lines and little screen time, all of it towards the end, he makes the difference between this film earning a ""solid"" one star vs zero stars (even if Amazon doesn't actually allow me to rate anything zero stars). Anyone who has seen or heard the Sheik before will recognize that he isn't even acting. He's just doing his regular schtick, albeit in costume. I seriously doubt that even half of his performance was scripted, which is what actually made it enjoyable.One scene in particular (spoiler alert!) that was off-the-charts stupid was a ""chase"" scene between a vehicle and the main characters who were riding a camel and a donkey, respectively. The highlight of the scene was the lead character (on a camel) screaming, ""They're gaining on us!"". No kidding. A vehicle with a gas engine gaining on a camel who doesn't seem to be in any particular hurry? What kind of screenwriter would be stupid enough to think that there was any way of making this scene look plausible?Oh, since no one else has mentioned it, this movie is not just a romantic comedy, but a musical as well. All of the musical numbers are original and all are cringe-worthy awful. You might enjoy the film more if you simply turn off the audio and just read the subtitles until the Iron Sheik's part comes along. You may want to leave the subtitles on even then though, if you want to understand anything he is saying. The few words he spoke that I could understand were either profanity or the word ""jabrone"".For an indie film, I have to say that the production values seemed good and the direction so-so. Kudos to whomever did Corey Feldman's make-up. That's about all the nice things I can say though.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R852B8PYPZUNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M25YTC6#wasThisHelpful","R852B8PYPZUNP","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't have a dog, but I do have a cat that seems nearly as stuffed as this pet bed. I bought him a cat bed when he was small, but these days it seems barely big enough for him to use as a pillow. So, I went ahead and ordered the Stainmaster pet bed, hoping that he will not outgrow this one. I got the large size and it certainly lives up to its name. I would absolutely agree with an earlier review here here stating that the padding is easily more than 4"" thick. It's not very often that you actually get more than you pay for.Fortunately for me, my cat really did not need any coaxing to try this bed out. I was in a bit of a rush the day I received it, so I just tossed it on the couch on my way out the door. By the time I got home, my cat had already made himself comfortable on the bed and was sound asleep. He had even managed to drag a couple of his cat toys up on to the bed, which there is plenty of extra room for.The best thing about the bed (by far) is the outer cover material and the fact that it comes off for easy washing. It makes for very easy cleanup as cat hair doesn't seem to stick to the surface that easily. What hair does stick is easily wiped off by a damp cloth. The bed has not yet gotten to the point where I have needed to wash it. I suspect that it will not need to be done that often though, since the damp cloth trick and dusting it off outside seems to get the job done with little effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7AVAZJP7QY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQZ19LM#wasThisHelpful","RT7AVAZJP7QY1","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the look of most reviews here, this toothpaste seems to be a touchy issue. I have been using this product on-and-off for about a year now. I have not had any type of allergic reaction that some here have mentioned, fortunately.I have some mixed feelings about this product insofar as to how well it works. For me, it actually seems to work a bit too well. The presence of baking soda is definitely noticeable and it seems to do a much better job at cleaning my teeth than most other toothpaste does. The baking soda in this formula is more abrasive than I have found in other brands though, which results in getting my teeth cleaner but also seems to result in wearing-away my teeth's enamel if I continue to use it more than a few days in a row. I have found myself alternating between this brand and a much milder one in order to keep my teeth clean without eroding them as a result. If I keep using this toothpaste on a prolonged basis my teeth become extremely sensitive to cold and heat, to the point of causing significant pain as well.I have no idea why this brand seems to be so much harsher than other baking soda types of toothpaste, but I would definitely not advise continued use if you can physically feel the enamel decaying-away after every brushing. I will probably end-up only using this product on an occasional basis rather than for daily brushing. It's great for an occasional deep-cleaning, but really is overkill for daily brushing in my experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37X3Z33IEM3V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ECQ41W#wasThisHelpful","R37X3Z33IEM3V8","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had diabetes for the past 10+ years and am always on the lookout for food/snacks that taste good, yet are actually healthy for me. Glucerna's snack bars are definitely not health food by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are craving something sweet with chocolate in it this product is a much better alternative than most foods.On taste, I thought that they tasted quite good. You definitely will not mistake Glucerna for a Snickers bar, but they certainly are sweet enough to satisfy most people's chocolate cravings. The ones I received from amazon were quite moist and not at all chalky like some other reviewers have mentioned. One thing to keep in mind... If you get these from Amazon you will almost certainly receive a product that has not been sitting around in a warehouse for an extended period of time, due to the fact that Amazon sells so many of these and has a lot of turnover. If you buy these from a drug store, variety store, grocery market, etc. the product may very well have been sitting on the shelf for many months and will likely be nowhere near as fresh. So, if you find these on sale someplace, I would carefully check the expiration date. It may be that they are on sale because they are close to (or even past) the expiration date.As to being a proper food for diabetics, while these bars will definitely not make your blood sugar spike like a ""real"" candy bar would, it will still make it go up. You have to keep in mind that while there is quite a bit of fat, fiber and protein in these bars, they also have 20g each of carbohydrates. They have twice as many carbs as they do protein, so it isn't like you are eating health food. Glucerna bars would be best used as an occasional treat, rather than as an integral part of a ""healthy"" diet. They are not really ""good"" for diabetics, they are just much, much less ""bad"" than their sugar-laced counterparts. Honestly, given the near-impossible task of creating a sweet snack that is relatively harmless to most diabetics, I think that they have done an amazing job.The only real disappointment I have with these bars (outside of how expensive they are) is in the ingredients list. The ingredients list reads more like a science experiment than that of real food. It would be nice if they concentrated a little more on adding natural ingredients to their product than extending it's shelf life. I'm pretty certain that these bars are not GMO-free, organic, lactose-free, gluten-free, kosher or any other label that might sound reassuring to those of us trying to avoid overly-processed foods. I can only imagine how much more expensive they would be without using so many artificial ingredients though.As long as you are treating these as an occasional snack and have no illusions about these being a health food, I believe that they are a perfectly acceptable part of a diabetic diet. The product's relatively high cost and laundry list of artificial ingredients is the only reason I will not rate it at five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HFO8A2YJWJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LEMQP2#wasThisHelpful","R37HFO8A2YJWJX","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, if my cats were actually writing the review, they would likely give it much more than 3 stars. Then again, they also eat their own vomit. My cats seem to enjoy the ""filets"" or ""shredded"" variety as opposed to the pate, or mush as I call it. All of the different varieties seem to be combined in the reviews section though.As for me, I only really care about two things... How much it costs and how healthy is it for my cats to eat (not necessarily in that order). So far as the price goes, Friskies is a pretty good deal. With Prime membership I get 24 cans for under $11 with free two-day shipping. That's less than I pay for it at the local grocery store and a LOT less than at the pet store. Combine that with shipping right to my doorstep and it definitely comes out a winner in the price category.Insofar as to how healthy the food is for my cat to eat, I am far less impressed with Friskies. The #1 ingredient in every variety is water (or ""moisture"") which comprises 80% of each can. That's a lot of ""moisture""! Next to that is meat and meat by-products. You don't even want to know where the by-products come from, but I assure you that you would not even feed them to your worst enemy's cat if you knew where they came from. After that comes a huge assortment of artificial coloring, artificial flavoring, wheat gluten, soy and a bunch of chemicals, some of which have vitamins in them.I'm no vet or nutritional expert, but I am pretty sure that about half of the ingredients listed aren't ones that my cat should be eating. Just check the ingredients for yourself and you will see what I mean. While my cats love this stuff, I feel guilty about feeding it to them in a similar way that I would feel guilty about feeding my kids junk food. Since they very rarely finish an entire can (or anywhere close to it) before it ""goes bad"" (insofar as they are concerned) I'm thinking that both my cats and conscience may be better off feeding them smaller quantities of healthier food. I haven't found one that they will eat yet, but will leave a review when I find one that they will.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S8UTGDW494RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00376301U#wasThisHelpful","R1S8UTGDW494RJ","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Viking Professional 5-Ply Casserole Pan is definitely a professional, high-quality product that is backed by the manufacturer with a lifetime warranty. It's surgical steel construction not only provides an extremely evenly-heated cooking surface, but also makes it the most impressive looking piece of cookware in my kitchen. The surface is as tough as it is beautiful and extremely lightweight for its size. Even the riveting is impressively done. The handles give the feel of being so solidly connected to the pan that you would think that they were welded together, if not part of the same mold.The lid and pan fit together extremely well and the weight of the lid helps to keep it very snugly in place while cooking at high temperatures. Due to how durable surgical steel is, it has not bent or warped at higher temperatures as cheap cookware seems to do. I seriously doubt that it would, short of anything less than being placed in a blast furnace.I had not used any surgical steel cookware until now and was a bit skeptical about just how non-stick it would be. It definitely exceeded my expectations in that department. The non-stick surface makes for less wasted (burned) food, less initial cleaning and great results from just popping it in an automatic dishwasher.Obviously, the price of the pan will keep a lot of people from choosing it. I think that it is best looked at as a long-term investment though. With a lifetime warranty (from a company that is not likely to disappear overnight) this is the last cooking pan you will ever have to buy. It may be the last pan that anyone in your family ever has to buy! It's versatile size also makes for less cookware you will need to buy in the end, which saves you both money and kitchen space. I would definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SURRRMS9PEOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9QFYIM#wasThisHelpful","R1SURRRMS9PEOH","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there is a lot about mouthwash preferences that is purely subjective (like taste), there is one major difference in TheraBreath Plus that sets it apart from the vast majority of its competitors. In a word, it's alcohol (or lack thereof). The vast majority of mouthwashes on the market include some form of alcohol. Amounts can vary greatly, but it is one of the most common ingredients you will find and what is largely responsible for the burning sensation you feel after using most brands. TheraBreath includes no alcohol, which makes it a much better product in my opinion.Alcohol is generally used in mouthwash because it is a relatively cheap ingredient that kills (through sterilization) most forms of germs and bacteria that cause bad breath almost immediately. Unfortunately, its effectiveness in stopping bad breath is extremely short-lived though as alcohol evaporates very quickly. As a side-effect, it can also cause dry mouth, which can actually make your breath worse after the initial effect has worn off.TheraBreath uses a different type of ingredient than alcohol to kill germs and bacteria called OXYD-8. While the formulation of OXYD-8 is proprietary, it most likely works similarly to hydrogen peroxide, which also kills germs but does not evaporate as quickly or have the same side effects as alcohol. By eliminating the quick evaporation effect of alcohol it makes the ingredients designed to give your mouth a minty type of odor (mostly leaf extracts) last longer. Natural oils help the product to coat your teeth and gums and provide a long-lasting effect that makes it even more effective.Besides lasting much longer, there is an even better side-benefit from leaving alcohol out of the product. You won't get the same ""burning"" sensation in your mouth as you will with most products like Listerine. You may get a very mild burning sensation from the Menthol, but it is quite weak in comparison. People have come to believe (for whatever reason) that the strong burning sensation that you often get after using alcohol-based antiseptics means ""it's working"". Unfortunately, that just isn't the case. The results you will get from TheraBreath clearly prove that.While the product is definitely priced on the high-end of the market, at least you will get what you pay for. The high price is due to the fact that it uses natural ingredients to replace more costly (and less effective) ones. The product has no artificial coloring or flavoring and is free of alcohol, gluten, sugar or GMOs. It's most likely one of the safest things you will put in your mouth all day! This product doesn't claim to be cheap, just natural and effective. In that respect, it definitely deserves five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15DG1J48P0D2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GLCES8#wasThisHelpful","R15DG1J48P0D2Z","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The KitchenAid Cast Iron 6-Quart Casserole Cookware is far and away the most well-constructed and versatile piece of cookware I have ever owned. It combines the durability and evenness of cast iron cooking with the benefit of having a very easy to clean and attractive enamel surface. KitchenAid certainly did not cut any corners when they built this thing. While it's price may be a bit on the high side, you tend to get what you pay for when it comes to cookware. This product definitely proves that point.If you haven't cooked with, or are not familiar with, cast iron cookware, you will probably be surprised initially by its weight. The KitchenAid weighs in at around 20 lbs, and that's without any food added to it. Fortunately, the handles on this model make it much easier to pick-up than most cast iron cookware. Most of them have a simple, single handle. The two handles on this model make it much, much easier to pick-up and work with than those types.Again, the quality construction of this item can't be stressed enough. It is most likely stronger and more durable than the material that they make black boxes on airplanes out of. About the only real downside to this is that if you are unlucky enough to drop this thing on your foot, you will almost certainly need a trip to the emergency room and be stuck in a cast for several months. Don't worry though. The cookware won't have a scratch on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4G2WZD6YNB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFCK932#wasThisHelpful","R1J4G2WZD6YNB7","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had a number of cats over the years and have pretty much tested the entire spectrum of cat litter that has come on the market. I have tried everything from the ultra cheap-o store brands to the expensive, hi-tech crystals. While the crystals would probably still be my first choice based upon performance alone, Precious Cat gives you a lot more bang for your buck, so to speak.I live in a fairly rural area where everything from gas to cat litter seems to cost more than it does for people in the rest of the country. What first attracted me to Precious Cat was honestly the price. I usually buy some type of mid-range, clay cat litter here locally and a 20 lb bag usually costs somewhere around $8. With Prime membership I can have this delivered straight to my front door for roughly the same price as going out and buying it at a local store and a bag lasts twice as long. The only downside in this equation seems to be for the UPS guy, who has to lug a 40 lb box across the street. I'm not sure how he would feel if he knew that he was actually doing all that lifting to carry my cat litter. I digress, though.When it comes to performance, Precious Cat hands-down outperforms all of the generic store brands and other clay litters that I have tried thus far. The dust is absolutely minimal. I would say that 99% dust free is probably a good estimate, with the exception of the very bottom of the bag (the bottom of all all containers of cat litter seem to have more dust than the top, for obvious reasons). Odor control is excellent. It performs well enough to be scoopable, but is cheap enough that you can just throw-out the entire litter box if you don't want to bother.About the only downside to this brand is one common to all brands of clay cat litter. Cats (and in turn, people) tend to track it around the house pretty easily. Compared to crystals, you will likely spend more time sweeping your floor and brushing pebbles off your furniture. Considering the vast difference in price though, it doesn't really bother me that much. If you have unlimited financial resources, the crystal-type cat litters might be the way to go. For the 99% of the rest of us though, Precious Cat is definitely a winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RND1BCG6EE0GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009X29WK#wasThisHelpful","RND1BCG6EE0GD","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just recently upgraded to PowerDVD 15, due to the fact that the computer my Blu-Ray player is on was upgraded from Windows 7.0 to Windows 8.1. I already owned a previous version of PowerDVD, but it would not work under 8.1, so I had to find something new to play Blu-Ray discs on.While the last version of PowerDVD I had installed on Windows 7.0 without issues, this new version had problems. An error message told me to check the hardware compatibility list. I'd played Blu-Ray discs on the same computer before, so I knew that the specs were more than sufficient. I had to dig around on the Cyberlink website to determine what the real problem was. Apparently, the software will not run at all if you have the HyperV (virtualization) feature in Windows enabled. So, if you have this standard Windows feature activated, you will have to physically uninstall it if you want PowerDVD to work. I found it a bit annoying that I had to disable a basic feature of the operating system in order to use the software, but played along to get it working.Once installed, my CPU spiked as PowerDVD started scanning my hard drive and indexing anything it found that it was capable of playing. I don't want it cataloging files on my computer without permission, so I had to turn that feature off. I then inserted a Blu-Ray disc of The Expendables in my drive. The PowerDVD player immediately informed me that I was watching a copy of the movie The Avengers and gave me a long description of the movie that I wasn't playing. Weird.I rebooted the computer, changed some settings (most notably, I turned the option to download movie information OFF) and tried another Blu-Ray. It seemed to recognize the movie fine, but then I get some scrolling ad across the top of the screen for new movie releases. Apparently, there is no way to opt-out of having this software exchange data with (who knows) that downloads new advertisements for me to sit though. I find this lack of control over being bombarded with ads on a software title that costs a hundred bucks rather annoying. Equally annoying, I found that PowerDVD silently installs some type of background process that starts running every time you start Windows, whether you are using the player or not. There is no option to turn this program off. It has to be killed manually unless you want to tweak with your registry settings. Otherwise, it just runs 24/7, eating up memory. Doing what, I have no idea.One feature that I was eager to try out was the software's ability to play .iso files directly, without having to mount them as an extra hard drive. I have my movies stored on a disk linked to my computer network (Network Attached Storage). I use a different software program to play regular DVD .iso files across the network regularly and it works flawlessly. Unfortunately, there is no option in PowerDVD to access a networked drive. I ended up using Windows Explorer to access the drive, found the particular movie .iso file that I wanted to watch, right-clicked on the file, chose ""Play with CyberLink Power DVD 15"" and waited. The PowerDVD software launched, but the movie would not play. Eventually, the software froze completely and I had to kill it with Task Manager. Subsequent attempts to open networked .iso files always ended with the software crashing. This was extremely disappointing, as I have never used any type of media player that refused to play a file from a networked drive. This is really a show-stopper type of bug and I'm surprised that a piece of software could even make it to Beta testing without fixing something this basic.While I was eventually able to get the software to play Blu-Ray discs directly from the drive, the annoyances, bugs and limitations of the software are extremely frustrating. Considering the price, I really expected better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DUX39RYHMXSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV3VCLC#wasThisHelpful","R3DUX39RYHMXSF","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I found this 500GB drive to be amazingly small, lightweight and highly portable, I did not get anywhere near the speeds promised in the specs.

Disk encryption on the drive was NOT enabled, which should have provided maximum speed.

"The Tri-Lynx 12 LED Motion Sensor Light seems to fill the gap that exists in-between the line-powered outdoor motion sensor light fixture and the weaker, but more portable, solar powered, outdoor LED lights. If you have a location outside of your house that you know will need to be lit at night, there is probably already a light fixture there. If not, installing one can be a bit of an expense, but is usually well it. Alternatively, solar-powered LED lights are generally very inexpensive, but have a habit of not being terribly reliable (especially during the Winter months) or able to give off enough light to make one feel safe. This device seems to fill the in-between niche quite nicely and is definitely priced to be competitive against either solution.The range of detection this device offers seems to be a bit less than most outdoor fixtures would provide at around 8-10', but the range seems well-suited to how far away the lights themselves can illuminate. The limited range also cuts down on the sensor being set off by small objects (such as falling leaves or squirrels) which would quickly drain your batteries. The device accepts 3 standard AA batteries (batteries included!), which are non-rechargeable, but fairly inexpensive these days. You can usually find packs of them at The Dollar Tree, Dollar General or Harbor Freight for $1 or even for free on occasion. Amazon also offers them in bulk for quite a reasonable price.The unit is fairly lightweight and definitely not waterproof, so you will need to find a place to mount this that is not only well-protected from the elements, but which will not be easily dislodged from its mount. A fall to the pavement from 6'0 would almost surely destroy this device, so find a stable, steady place to mount it. It almost seems better suited to be placed indoors than out, which would be easily accomplished using its magnetic base (attach to your fridge, washing machine, water heater, etc.). For the price, you could probably afford to have a few around the house, which would come-in extremely handy during electrical outages or nights when you are too sleepy to find the light switch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197T4WLG7U6UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7JX7ZU#wasThisHelpful","R197T4WLG7U6UW","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having had diabetes for the past 10 years and been through a number of Doctors and insurance plans, I have necessarily switched between a number of different blood glucose meters. Cost aside (more on that later), the Freestyle Lite Blood Glucose monitor and kit is by far the most accurate, painless and convenient meter I have used to date.The meter's best attribute is probably its accuracy. As other reviewers have noted here, The FreeStyle Lite scored very high in a government study done on a number of different commercially sold meters. While I have found the majority of meters sold in the U.S. to be fairly accurate, there are a handful of cheap ones that provide very unreliable results. If you need absolute accuracy, the FreeStyle Lite meter is definitely the way to go.On the more practical side, its small size is definitely another big plus. The LCD display is large enough to read while keeping the layout simple and straightforward. Some of the smaller numbers (like the date) might seem a bit small if you have poor vision, but the majority of users are really only interested in one ""number"" and that is on the large LCD display. Another bonus is the meter's speed. Results take a fraction of the time as compared to many other meters I have tried. It may only be a few seconds' difference, but its still nice to have.FreeStyle Lite test strips let you draw the least amount of blood of any glucose meter I have seen that gives reliable results. Non-finger testing is also available, but you will still get the most accurate results from a finger poke.The last issue I will address is price. As with most brands, the meter will only give results from using the same company's test strips, which is why many times you can get a meter for free. The manufacturer knows that if you use their meter, you will have to use their test strips, which is why most test strips are so expensive. You will most likely fall into 1 of 2 categories. Insured or uninsured. If you are insured, the cost of the meter and test strips is largely immaterial. You will likely pay the same co-pay (if any) for all brands of meters and the test strips. If this is the case, definitely go with the FreeStyle Lite. If you are NOT covered by insurance and have to pay out of pocket, the FreeStyle Lite test strips are fairly expensive by most standards. They cost up to 10x what you will pay for test strips from other companies. If money is an issue, and you don't need pinpoint accuracy when it comes to results, you should probably shop around. There are other meters that are not nearly as small, accurate or fast, but give adequate enough results. If money is no issue though, this is definitely the blood glucose test meter that you want to buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVQ85O2CLEP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001945M6S#wasThisHelpful","R3DVQ85O2CLEP9","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read quite a number of books about spam control and network security. This is the first book I've seen thus far completely dedicated to tackling the issue of phishing though. Most books aimed at the IT industry concentrate on the technical aspects of how to stop these types of e-mails from ever getting to the inbox of users in the first place. This book concentrates not so much on the technical methods of stopping scam e-mails as it does getting inside the heads of both the phishing fraudsters as well as their potential victims.Phishing Dark Waters approaches the subject of phishing from two distinct angles. About half of the book is focused on the technical aspects of e-mail fraud while the other half delves into the psychology that goes into crafting a successful phishing campaign. Although network administration and psychology are two incredibly different subjects, the authors do an admirable job of presenting both sides of the coin while trying not to put the reader to sleep in the process. For the most part, it works. Switching back and forth between the two subjects is a bit abrupt in some places, but all of it is done in a logical manner that will not leave your head spinning.Anti-spam itself is a niche subject and phishing spam is really a niche of a niche subject, which explains the book's brevity at around 200 pages. It is by far the most complete work I have seen on the subject thus far though and belongs in the library of every network or mail administrator who takes the subject of spam control seriously.

That is true, but when first setting up encryption there is a different sequence of lights flashing to let you know whether or not encryption has been set up successfully (the set-up instructions describe this). So, that isn't really a factor for me, personally.Compared to setting up a typical wi-fi connection in your house, the Powerline is ridiculously simple. It is also faster and infinitely more secure. If you use a desktop or laptop and don't need the flexibility that a wireless system offers, the Powerline solution definitely seems to be the better choice. At the what this kit sells for, it is actually comparable in price to deploying a wi-fi solution as well.With the exception of limitations that are inherent with wired connections (namely, you are limited to moving any further than the reach of the outlet and cable you are connected to) I really can't find a single thing about this product to criticize. It is rare to find such complex solutions that you can just plug-in, push a button and ""it just works"". This happens to be one of them though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U13I6VWS8FF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6DBGJM#wasThisHelpful","R3U13I6VWS8FF4","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is definitely not a rickety old wagon from yesteryear, nor is it one of those tub-like contraptions that seems to have replaced it more recently. This Radio Flyer seems to be a totally new design that is more of a buggy for toddlers than a toy for hauling stuff around in. Compared to the older models, this one is probably more like riding around in a limousine for small kids.With the exception of the telescoping handle, this is one very solidly built wagon. The handle is a bit hollow and flexible to suit my taste, but it is just solid enough to be justified by the wagon's ability to easily fold-up and take-up a very limited amount of space.The canopy honestly seems to be more trouble than it is worth and doesn't protect from the sides at all for sun or rain, so I really don't see it being of much practical value. Fortunately, it is not an integral part of the wagon and can just be left off.Most of the wagon comes put together, but some assembly is definitely required. You will need a wrench, screwdriver and about 20-30 minutes of spare time. It's nowhere near as much hassle as some toys are nowadays. I've spent more time just getting some toys out of their boxes than it took me to assemble this.All in all, it is a bit pricey for something your kids will only be able to fit into for a year or two, but there are plenty of things that both kids and adults can use it for once they get bigger. Judging by the construction and sturdiness thus far, I would expect this wagon to last quite a number of years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJAID97ZQYC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD3EVDW#wasThisHelpful","RNJAID97ZQYC7","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I will say that this is definitely an expensive kitchen faucet to own, but when you take a look of what the average kitchen sink faucet runs these days, the figure is really not that out of line at all.This happens to be one of the few products I have had the pleasure to review where the instructions were not only written in perfect English, but were extremely helpful, thorough and easy-to-understand as well. Bravo, Pfister! It does help to run through the installation guide WELL before you start the actual work as there are likely a variety of situations unique to your installation and you will need to take them into consideration long before you dive under the sink.The main thing to take into consideration is the nearest source of electricity. If you have a newer home with an AC outlet right under the sink, you are in luck. If not, you will need to do some planning well before you start the actual faucet installation.Whatever you do, DO NOT wire a AC connection anywhere that has a history of water being able to reach the AC outlet. That is just asking for trouble and could conceivably pose a health risk.In any event, I would make doubly sure that the cold water pipe (and sink, if metal) connected to this faucet is connected directly to a solid earth ground for maximum safety.Once you have all of the preliminary planning finished, the actual installation is a breeze. It obviously helps to have some prior plumbing experience. I have just enough from having installed a few home appliances to have made installation exceptionally simple.Although the unit has not been installed long, considering the great reputation of the brand and their famously great support. I would expect this faucet to last quite a number of years. If I have any problems in the future though, I will come back to edit this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F0SZYHF4BMPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7FZONQ#wasThisHelpful","R1F0SZYHF4BMPB","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered one of LD's remanufactured ink cartridges (Cyan) for my Epson Workforce 7620 (you can find my review of the printer here on Amazon as well). After my printer gave me a message telling me that the original Cyan cartridge that came with the printer was no longer recognized, I figured that I didn't have much to lose going with a non-Epson brand cartridge. If it doesn't even recognize the ink cartridges that it manufactures itself, how big could the difference be?I had tried replacement ink refill kits for my older HP printers about 10 years ago. It was quite messy, labor intensive and gave mixed results, to say the least. These LD cartridges came complete and ready to use. No mess. No instructions needed. For $7.99 you really don't have much to lose. I placed my order on a Friday afternoon and the ink was delivered directly from the company on the following Monday. Essentially, I got free, overnight delivery! I live in California (where the company is located), so your results may vary.As for the ink and cartridge's quality, I had no problem getting the printer to instantly ""recognize"" the ink cartridge (ironic, since Epson couldn't even identify its own!). My limited experience with printing thus far has resulted in no noticeable difference in quality between the original ink and the new ink. I will try to remember to update this review in a few weeks when I have a better idea of the cartridge's long-term stability. For the moment though, these replacement cartridges would seem to be the deal of the century.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKVX37RFU9M4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O841C6K#wasThisHelpful","RKVX37RFU9M4J","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Baofeng/Pofung HT that I have owned, but all of their models seem to share two things in common: 1. They all are incredibly cheap as compared to just about every other manufacturer; and 2. Trying to figure out how to program their radios using the few instructions provided should be considered cruel and unusual punishment.After watching a ton of YouTube videos, and going against the direct advice of the manufacturer, I was able to get the Pofung BF-F9+TP working using a daily build of CHIRP software. The model is nowhere to be found in the CHIRP menu, so I just chose the closest Pofung model that was listed, which is the BF-F8-HP at the moment. You will save yourself a ton of time and trouble if you simply use the CHIRP software and choose RADIO>IMPORT FROM DATA SOURCE>REPEATER BOOK to directly import a list of local or national repeater frequencies. You can also use the RADIO menu to easily import scanning frequencies for NOAA weather broadcasts, FRS/GMRS and Marine radio. To add additional frequencies, simply use the other entries as a template and then click on RADIO>WRITE TO RADIO. Bam. Your radio is now programmed and ready to use.Of course, you will need a USB programming cable to interface the radio with your computer. A cable is NOT included with the radio. Fortunately, the same cable works with every one of their models I have tried it on thus far. I paid about $8 for mine from Amazon. Once the nightmare of programming your radio is finished you are left with a very attractive and functional (if not exactly durable) dual-band HT. It's definitely not a radio that would survive the type of punishment that a radio from Icom, Yaesu or Kenwood would take, but at the price it sells for this radio is practically disposable.For the money, there is very little to complain about insofar as the radio's performance is concerned. I have not made any contacts using simplex thus far, but from prior experience Baofengs do not seem to have a great battery life, so I would advise having more than the one battery that is included if you plan on spending any amount of time directly communicating with other handhelds.If you are thinking of using this as a FRS/GMRS radio, don't. It does not have FCC type acceptance nor does it conform with required output levels to operate on these frequencies legally. Same goes for the marine band, public service and commercial frequencies. Just don't. The radio's high 8W output power is probably offset by it's rather anemic stock antenna. The radio's SMA connection to the antenna is not compatible with most other HTs, so finding a better replacement might be difficult, at best. Economically infeasible at worst.For hitting the local repeaters now and then, this radio works well enough and is a great value. I'm definitely not ready to replace my Yaesu HT with it, but as a back-up radio you can hardly go wrong.

"The Honeywell HPA250B is an impressive air filter on a number of levels. The most unique and useful feature of this product has to be the VOC sensor though. When tuned to the VOC mode the unit will automatically detect Volatile Organic Compounds (stink!) and ramp up its cleaning power to match the VOC level. When the air is clean and VOC levels have dropped, the unit then throttles itself down into low-power mode. This not only takes the need out of self-monitoring the air and adjusting the power level manually but greatly reduces power consumption while improving overall air quality. This is especially helpful while sleeping, as the highest setting is just loud enough to keep light sleepers awake but probably not loud enough to actually wake a person up.I have used a couple of Honeywell air filters in the past and they have all performed much better and lasted longer than competing brands in similar price ranges. The price point of this particular model is particularly good, considering the amount of square feet it can cover. I've tried quite a few different types of filters, but the combination of HEPA and charcoal pre-filters seem to work the best. A negative ion generators would be a nice addition to this model, but Honeywell has never really embraced NEG technology for some reason.Compared to my last Honeywell model, this model takes up quite a bit less space yet has equal or better air cleaning ability. The wide and tall ""tower"" design would seem to be ideally suited for air filtering as opposed to the short, stubby design of other Honeywell models. It also seems to result in less noise being made. The low setting is little more than a small amount of white noise from only a few feet away. The highest setting is considerably louder though and best used sparingly.The Android app is a bit of toss-up, insofar as trade-offs are concerned. The most useful part of the app simply lets you change the mode/speed of your air filter (or turn on/off). Another function allows your air filter to adjust its sped according to a timer or pollen counts for your area as determined by either entering your zip code or allowing the unit to turn on your phone's GPS (which will shorten your battery life considerably). The unit functions just as well without the app as with it, from my vantage point. The tradeoff? In order to use the app, Android users must agree to a staggering amount of control over their phone's features and can transmit a considerable amount of data about you and your phone back to Honeywell's ""mothership"", without your future need of approval. From a privacy standpoint, it simply is not worth the tradeoff for me. I would rather do without the app than agree to have my private information uploaded to Honeywell and sold for commercial purposes.Bluetooth issues aside, this is a very good product at a very competitive price with added bells and whistles that are actually quite useful;. Even if it cost a bit more it would probably be worth it, simply from the energy savings you can obtain from scheduling and/or use of the VOC sensor. I would have no problem recommending it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FCLU63JWNX4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG8BQAI#wasThisHelpful","R1FCLU63JWNX4P","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Panasonic Home Monitoring System not only provides an easy way to monitor your home from any location but is actually the center for an entire home automation system. Despite there being no mention of this in the product's description, you can also purchase a number of other add-on items to greatly extend the system's capabilities. For example, you can add a Smart Plug (Model KX-HNA101) to remotely turn on/off almost any electrical appliance (including lighting with an external cord) in your home via your smartphone. This device will even record the outlet's electrical consumption, so you know how much energy you are using. There is also a motion sensor unit (Model KX-HNS102) that can be used to trigger a number of camera functions or cause electrical outlets to turn off/on as well. Window/door sensors (Model KX-HNS101) can be purchased separately to trigger camera functions as well as appliances/lighting and indoor cameras (Model KX-HNC200) can be added to provide an audio intercom system and temperature sensor. Lastly, a digital/cordless phone system can be added (Model KX-HNH100) to arm/disarm the alarm system without the need for a smartphone as well as monitor system status.The overall system can be extended to four cameras, six cordless phones, four smartphones or Android-based tablets and any combination of up to 50 additional sensors or power controllers. Obviously, those devices cost extra, but the ability to easily expand the device to a quite extensive home-automation system is especially awesome.Set-up of the base system is extremely simple. The only problem I had was from another Android app switching between wireless networks automatically which initially prevented me from completing the set-up. I temporarily disabled the other app and that solved the problem permanently.Mounting the wireless cameras outside is little misleading, unfortunately. The video transmission may be wireless, but the camera and lights need electricity (provided by included power supplies). So, the cameras aren't entirely wireless. You would never know this from the picture on the product's page though, which shows someone mounting the camera on a brick wall (using wood screws!!!) and no wires. Fortunately, there is NO set-up in regards to the cameras. The phone app and hub just seems to connect to them automatically. Literally, plug and play.The camera's resolution is quite good as compared to most home monitoring systems I have seen, although I can't find the actual resolution anywhere in the documentation. The audio is also quite sensitive. Just make sure not to enable the audio monitoring via the app if you are standing close to the camera or you will trigger an audio feedback loop that will leave your ears ringing. The cameras could also be mounted indoors as well, I assume. Just make sure that you can locate a stud for use with the wood screws, because drywall alone may not support the camera/mount's weight.The central wireless hub works extremely well. I had no problem with reception or fading signal anywhere around the perimeter of my house. The DECT wireless technology they are using seems to be much stronger and more reliable than typical wi-fi systems. For maximum range, the hub should be mounted on a wall or on top of a tall object. The top of most refrigerators would probably be ideal as it would provide both height and a large metal groundplane to extend the reach of the signal.While I probably would not use this system for a large business or an installation needing extensive (more than four units) camera inputs, for the size of most small homes and apartments this system works great. The ability to extend it later on to a home automation system with temperature and electrical usage monitoring is just icing on the cake.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1THHPXZ48E597/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ1XXA4#wasThisHelpful","R1THHPXZ48E597","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this 16V DC replacement power supply for a rather oddball Dell desktop computer that used an external power supply similar to a laptop. Although this is not listed as a direct replacement by the manufacturer I knew the specs that the power supply needed (output voltage, amps, plug polarity and size) and this one was a perfect fit. It also happened to be one of the cheapest OEM power supplies on amazon.Honestly, for the price this costs, I figured that I had almost nothing to lose, since the computer would not work at all without a power supply. Amazon delivered it quickly and it was exactly as pictured and completely to specs. I plugged it in and was finally able to get the computer running. After a couple of weeks of running nearly around-the-clock, the computer is still still doing well and I have had absolutely no problems.The power supply looks like any other replacement supply you will find. It does not seem to cut any corners and is solid enough that it doesn't even get warm while running. All in all, it does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it at an extremely affordable price.

"Cosco's new Light & Comfy car seat certainly lives up to its name in the weight department. It is extremely lightweight and easy to carry. I have no idea what type of government regulations that baby car seats come under, but I would have to assume that the product's light weight does not sacrifice protection for convenience.The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the manual, or lack thereof. You can't really tell from the product picture, but there are stickers and sewn patches all over this thing with warnings and instructions, to the point of being a bit overboard. It kind of reminds me of NASCAR and how driver's cars are almost completely covered with stickers these days.There is no mention of what type of fabric the car seat uses, nor are there any washing instructions. It is obviously something synthetic though and not terribly soft. This is good from the standpoint of washing off messes or hosing it down, but probably not the most comfortable for baby. Since this is an infant seat only though, it probably won't be used for that long.As others have stated, there is no way of adjusting for the tilt of your particular vehicle's seat, so you will need to use something in-between to keep the car seat level. Considering the relatively cheap price this car seat sells for though, you would kind of expect it to be a no-frills type of product, which is essentially true. Whether the trade-offs are worth it depends totally upon your situation. Since you are only going to be using it for a few months before it is outgrown, the trade-offs are probably worth it though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19620A2GSTIVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNXHRCS#wasThisHelpful","R19620A2GSTIVP","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will be the first to admit that I am not a gamer. However, the Turtle Beach Impact 100 Gaming Keyboard impresses me quite a bit. The first thing you notice when unboxing this product is how heavy it is. Upon inspection, the weight is not just ""thrown-in"" indiscriminately, the actual construction is of a very thick and high quality plastic that should survive a drop test at any height you would possibly drop a keyboard from in the real world without suffering so much as a scratch. The steel reinforcement inside definitely adds to its survivability. This is NOT anything like a ""stock"" or ""replacement"" keyboard that you will normally find in the $10-$50 range. I have literally used dozens of stock and replacement keyboards over the years and this one is by far the toughest I have ever tested. In fact, the only keyboards I have used that were even close to this product in respect to durability are ones built by IBM and HP for use in computers from the 1990's era. Those were considerably larger though and USB didn't even exist back then.The keys have a sort of depth to them that I have not seen in other keyboards before. They seem designed in an ergonomic fashion that would favor keeping your fingers on the keys and using them as ""buttons"" rather than something built for speed typing. Between that and the fact that it does not have the same feedback as an IBM soft-click keyboard (or clone), I would have to say that this keyboard was definitely not made for those of you who type 40+ words per minute. If you are using it for video games or are a hunt-and-peck type of typer, it will more than meet your expectations though.Some other features of the keyboard worth mentioning are the USB cable and connector. They are also of high-quality construction and should be much more durable than that of most  replacement keyboards you will find on the market. The USB plug itself is built tightly to specs and fits very snugly into any USB port you can find available. The reference to it having a braided cable refers to the braided shielding wire inside the cable. You can't actually see it, but braided shielding wire gives you a much better physical and electrical connection between the keyboard and computer. It is also greatly helpful in environments where there are high levels of RF radiation and will prevent electrical or RF interference. Most manufacturers use thin, foil shielding in their cabling these days, which may be thinner and cheaper, but is also more apt to break under any type of physical stress.I like that the shape of the keyboard does not waste space with an over-sized bezel or odd shape like many keyboards do these days. While you get a full-sized keyboard (for easier typing) you also get a keyboard that you can rest on your lap instead of only fitting on the top of a desk.The literature does not say if the keyboard is waterproof or even water resistant. That would certainly be nice to know if you are planning on using it in some sort of industrial environment. Perhaps the manufacturer will clarify this issue in the future. Overall though, it seems to be a great, sturdy keyboard that will most likely not only outlive my computer but probably me as well!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHSILEZXS9O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1SCDSQ#wasThisHelpful","RSHSILEZXS9O0","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first impression upon unboxing this new Hoover cordless vacuum was that the engineering and construction quality that went into designing and building this unit are absolutely top rate. All of the parts seem to fit together tightly and with precision. Controls are easily accessible and its design incredibly ergonomic. The vacuum swivels and tilts in such a fashion as to maximize the places that it can reach well beyond expectations. It's weight is light enough to lift and carry around with ease, yet not so lightweight as to feel cheap or flimsy.First impressions aside, once I started vacuuming it became apparent that this model has some definite strengths and weaknesses. Some of its problems are inherent with all models of cordless vacuums I have tried thus far. Compared to most other cordless vacuums, this model is by far the best I have ever used though.Compared to other cordless, upright vacuums, the Hoover is robustly powered. The two rechargeable batteries that come with the unit are a bit bulky, but simple to replace and provide enough longevity to clean the average home without worrying about running out of juice. You can maximize the life of the batteries to an even greater extent by manually switching the rotating brush on/off or using the ""boost"" feature to only use the maximum amount of power when you need it. Compared to corded vacuums this model is surprisingly quiet, although it does make a rather dreadful, high-pitched noise when switched into the boost mode.The vacuum seems to work best on laminate and vinyl flooring. The fibers of the rotating brush are soft enough not to scuff floors with hard surfaces, but strong enough to pick up quite a bit more dirt than you normally would by turning off the brush feature. It's small head size lets you get into tight corners and under low ""bridges"" that the average vacuum cleaner simply can't. If your flooring is almost entirely hard surfaces, I would say that the Hoover is strong enough to actually replace high-quality corded vacuums with.The Hoover's biggest weakness is in dealing with thick carpets and handling large amounts of hair or ""fuzz"" that you inevitably find in carpeting of this type. While the Hoover is definitely a huge improvement over most cordless vacuums in regards to cleaning power, it simply can not compare to high-quality, corded upright vacuums like you would expect from something like a Dyson. We've all seen the commercials where a vacuum cleaner has suction powerful enough to suspend a bowling ball in mid-air or gobble-up marbles and other small objects like a riding lawnmower cuts through grass. This is NOT one of those vacuums. The power simply is not there and while you may get a perfectly acceptable-looking cleaning done on thick carpeting, you will never achieve the type of deep cleaning that a well-built corded vacuum will provide.For what it is built to do though, the Hoover is an outstanding piece of equipment, although I would be hesitant to spend the amount of money it costs if you have any type of carpeting that you want to thoroughly clean. Besides its lack of power (as compared to corded models), about the only problem I had with this model was its regular habit of the hose being plugged-up by pet hair, lint and carpet ""fuzz"". There seems to be a permanent bottleneck in the hose between the cleaning head and dust compartment that requires removing the hose and physically digging out the contents until the hose is unplugged. There is about a six inch section of hose near the head that is always the first place for contents to get stuck. I'm certain that this is more of a design problem than one specific to the unit I received, since other reviewers have mentioned the same thing. If you don't mind getting your hands dirty two or three times during the course of cleaning your house, this might not be a big deal to you. It did bother me though, as having to dig through chunks of dirt to unplug the hose of an absolutely brand-new vacuum cleaner was not something I had expected to be doing.All in all, if you have rather light cleaning requirements and a combination of hard floor surfaces, the Hoover may very well be all you need for regular cleaning and dusting. It's flexibility and light weight make it almost perfect for the job. If you have any significant amount of carpeting, especially of the shag or deep-pile variety, this would definitely not be my go-to vacuum though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6RAZQLBEEBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1HU#wasThisHelpful","R2C6RAZQLBEEBD","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the only new pet foods I have ever given to both of my cats where each of them took to it right away, Considering how picky they can be about new foods, that is really saying something. They are both used to being fed fairly high-quality dry foods, so they have been pretty much spoiled from birth. It's nice to know that there is something else that I can get them to eat.I would not have even tried to get them to switch to this brand were it not for the fact that it is 45% protein and uses real trout as it's #1 ingredient. The fact that it doesn't use corn, wheat or artificial coloring is also a big plus. Corn and wheat may be cheap fillers, but there is very little to be said for their nutritional value to cats or dogs.About the only downside to this product is the addition of soy and pea proteins. These proteins are much cheaper to use as an ingredient than meat protein is, but is much more difficult for cats to digest. You wouldn't normally see a cat munching on peas or soybeans, which is a good indicator that it is not something that their bodies will absorb all that naturally. It's a good ""gimmick"" to boost the protein content percentage, but not much else positive can be said for these added ingredients. Still, it's better for them than corn or wheat, which is what normally passes for cat food.I'm not sure if the price this is selling at for the moment is normal or not, but $36 seems a bit pricey for a 6lb bag of dry cat food. I can normally get a 16lb bag of a decent brand for $10 less than that. This seems to be a newer product though, so perhaps they are still experimenting with the price. It certainly is a decent product, but not worth what it is priced at for the moment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CTTCW94NUL5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVMMKM6#wasThisHelpful","R1CTTCW94NUL5J","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SilBlade FLX1919 Premium Beam Wipers seem to be a vast improvement over the cheap replacement wiper blades I usually buy when I get my oil changed.Despite the stupid-proof installation instructions, it took me awhile to figure out exactly how to install these. I would have to attribute this to user error rather than to anything having to do with the product though. Once attached, the blades were quite sturdy and fit well with my 2002 Ford Escape. The packaging was also in a quite minimalistic cardboard box, which I definitely prefer as compared to struggling to remove blades from some sort of plastic packaging that requires a knife to cut through.Fortunately, if you can call it that, it started raining the day after I installed these wiper blades and there hasn't been a dry day since. The curvature and construction of these blades allows me to keep up with the rain with the wipers on low, rather than having them go at full-speed. That is quite impressive. Although I haven't had these blades long enough to vouch for their durability, they have gotten quite a workout over the past week and seem to have come through fine. Definitely would recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OBNWD1TJQ7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXRXNO2#wasThisHelpful","R25OBNWD1TJQ7L","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The above title pretty much sums up my experience with the Artaste 4890 Vertical Rabbit Style Corkscrew Kit with Foil Cutter. First of all, the most notable thing about this product is its complete lack of documentation. There are no instructions inside and only a picture of the unit on the outside of the box, which really doesn't help.After studying the contraption for a few minutes, I decided to try uncorking a local wine that was on sale at Safeway for $4. I didn't want to test it only anything important with no idea as to how/if it actually worked. My first attempt failed. I got the corkscrew into the cork, but the cork would not come out. It did work on the second try though. The cork was lifted up into the innards of the contraption, which made it a bit difficult to remove. It took a minute to figure out how to get the cork to more easily release.As for the foil cutter... Where is it? What does it look like? Is it part of the main product or did it go missing in transport? I have no idea, since there are no instructions and no diagram showing how any part of the device works.Compared to other ""normal"" wine bottle openers I have used, this device is needlessly complicated, takes up WAY too much space and for $30 you would think that it would at least include instructions. I'm pretty sure that I have never paid anywhere near this price for a corkscrew bottle opener, yet every other product I tried was simple enough to not need instructions, smaller and considerably cheaper. I really do not get what all of the fuss is about with this thing. It looks nice enough, but is hardly a ""better mousetrap"". If it were just a little heavier, it might make a good door stop.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WMR473TJDKBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQI3Q1I#wasThisHelpful","R1WMR473TJDKBD","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one of PBS' higher-profile original series, Frontline has had a history of producing some great reporting. Unfortunately, it also has had a habit of mixing ""news"" with politics and political opinion, which is a very slippery slope for a broadcaster that is being kept on life support by politicians and taxpayer's money. While I find very little of Frontline's programming politically overt, there does seem to be an unspoken undercurrent of liberal influence, which seems to be where most of PBS's political and financial allies keep camp.For this review, it was suggested that I watch the episode Frontline: Egypt in Crisis. I found it to be fairly typical of most Frontline episodes, so I will go on to review that episode here.Again, typical of most Frontline episodes, this one is the the product of literally hundreds of hours of observation, reporting and filming. It is inevitable that such a massive piece of work will eventually be whittled down to a single 60 minute segment, but that is the reality of journalism these days, unfortunately. Although there is plenty of footage and some interviews, the bulk of the show is presented as narration, supported by accompanying video. This method of news production unfortunately seems to rely heavily upon the personal interpretations of the reporter, rather than lending itself to a ""just the facts"" type of presentation. In essence, human reporting's greatest weakness is that reporters are humans, each filled with their own personal imperfections, biases and sometimes lack of comprehension regarding the subject being reported.In this episode, while I don't see any overt political bias, I do sense a serious lack of understanding by the main reporter in grasping the situation's ""big picture"" as a whole. Instead of tackling the real elephant in the room (the goals of the religion of Islam and its followers) the reporter attempts to describe the Muslim Brotherhood and its leader Mohammad Morsi as simply being part of a political movement that dates back less than 100 years. I believe that this is being done either purposefully, or unintentionally, to provide viewers with a type of political movement more easily understood by Americans. In fact, it is a gross oversimplification to paint the revolution in Egypt as being part of a political struggle. The truth is simply far too complicated to easily explain within the span of 60 minutes, so a storytelling ""shortcut"" is taken to make everything easier to comprehend for an American audience, but winds-up distorting the picture in the process.What the reporter in this episode seemingly fails to understand is that the Muslim Brotherhood is NOT a political organization, nor is it a humanitarian organization. It's goals are very much the same as groups like Al Queda and ISIS. That is, it's chief objective is to impose Muslim rule and Sharia law across every nation on earth. Rooted deeply in the Koran and the Islamic faith, the use of terrorism, murder and martyrs is standard practice and supported by fully 30% of the Egyptian population. Those are Morsi's supporters. That percentage is actually considerably higher in other middle eastern countries. Egypt has traditionally been a moderate in the region. The ends always justifies the means in this sort of mentality and there is no way that ANY Islamic state (like the one Morsi and the Islamic Brotherhood tried to bring to Egypt) can remain at peace as long as there are non-muslims living within their borders or near them. The Koran demands that ""infidels"" be killed or taken as slaves. There simply is no legitimate ""middle ground"" in the teachings of Mohammed. This is the elephant in the room that American reporters fear to report, lest they be accused of being politically ""insensitive"".Without delving into the real reasons for Islamic revolution, this Frontline episode only serves to obscure the underlying facts in favor of a politically-correct narrative that is dumbed-down to the point where people watching it THINK that they have actually learned something. Perhaps this is what the public actually wants, rather than to be confronted with the more dismal reality of the situation? Unfortunately, only a very thorough education and understanding of religious and political dynamics of the middle east will give one insight into the subject of Egypt In Crisis. I'm afraid that this episode sacrifices the complexity of truth for politically correct oversimplification.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RALPK78L9QD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9TQ1FU#wasThisHelpful","R2RALPK78L9QD6","A10U8DJAPJJI8I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10U8DJAPJJI8I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I seem to recall Clearasil from my youth as having a lot of drying, irritating facial products in it that actually contributed to breakouts. I was shocked and pleased to receive this modern kind of Clearasil, with gentle products suitable for sensitive skin and a really effective exfoliating ingredient - the salicylic acid.I've been using these wipes longer than the time I would normally experience breakouts over facial irritants. And no problems at all! My skin looks almost radiant. My nose pores are clean and look smaller. My whole face looks more even and smoother.I will definitely be purchasing more of these wipes when I use them up. I can manage to get by with one wipe for my entire face and neck at bedtime each day, carefully using all the parts of the (admittedly) small wipe to get all the moisture off. So I can make a packet last an entire month.NOTE: This is my second round of buying these - and this time, I got a six pack! Six months of good, clear, adult skin.I realize the idea for these wipes is for on the go use, but I've already added to my nightly routine and appreciate the simplicity of a wipe. It's replaced the expensive liquid salicylic acid exfoliator that I used to apply with a cotton ball.The scent is mild and clean, and there is no burning sensation that one would associate with a formulation containing alcohol or menthol/mint compounds. There is no residue left on my face.I'm extremely pleased - and, I have to admit - I wasn't expecting much. Clearasil seems to have updated with the latest advances and research into what is actually good for skin. I follow this up with a good moisturizer with antioxidants and am good for sleep.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOGNW8TF6WYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4EZ7OG#wasThisHelpful","R1QOGNW8TF6WYE","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Words cannot express how clearly I hate this bird feeder. Or rather, how much the birds hate this feeder.I'm a novice feeder. I'm pretty good at wild bird IDing...in, you know, the wild. With binoculars, while camping. I'm no good at luring the birdies to my home to watch them feed at my leisure. I was feeling particularly depressed at the time I bought this, and needed some light happy cheering up. So I read the reviews and carefully selected this one. It looked simple; it looked good. Most of all, it looked foolproof - you put it on your window, put seed in, and waited in comfort for the birds. Free food! Come and get it. EAT AT JILLY'S!You just know how this tale's going to end.First off, my feeder arrived broken. The thin, cheap plastic was cracked. Bright and chipper, like the birds I hoped to see, I used a bit of glue and a clip to hold the plastic together until it dried. Then I plopped the feeder on my window, added the seed my local ACE recommended, and waited.Weeks later, and with no birds, I tried scattering seeds nearby. Maybe the birds couldn't see the feeder and I could leave a little trail of goodies? Still no birds. At that point I was convinced they needed a stick to land on while feeding...I cleverly added a stick, and of course that didn't work. Overthinking is my specialty.I decided my entire approach was wrong, and I needed to figure out where the birds were, and move the bird feeder there. I saw that little birds liked the back window that had morning sun, and moved the little house there. No birds yet. So I scattered seeds along the ground under the window, along the window frame, and along the back yard - anything to get birds to come near the dumb bird feeder that got such nice rankings on Amazon.Finally, one morning, an actual bird hopped along the ground under the window, eating the seeds I scattered there. I was absurdly happy. Then he left, ignoring the feeder. A week later, a bird ate the seeds I scattered along the window frame.No bird ever, EVER went into the bird feeder - the seeds were piled as perfectly as the day I piled them. Until one morning when the glue popped open and all the seed spilled out, freeing the birds even from having to look at the feeder they hated so much.The seam re-breaking actually pleased me. I grabbed the feeder and a hammer and went to my potting bench, intending to smash the thing into smithereens. I even got my husband to film the event to post here on Amazon for all humans to enjoy, yet that pleasure was even denied me - the plastic refused to smash properly, and just deformed weirdly around my hammer. Screw it.SUMMARY: You're on your own with this one. Maybe it was the glue that turned off the birds and I should have just sent it right back when it arrived broken. Or maybe the feeder sucks in every way.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF8H21C9BHIQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVM2L6#wasThisHelpful","RF8H21C9BHIQT","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"50 exhausting, dirty, wet minutes later, and my large Scouring Stick is a nub.Let me explain. In a normal household, with normal toilets, these things should last a good while. They arrive a good half foot long - a nice chunk's worth, oh wow! I've used tiny bit of pumice to clean the poopy rings around typical toilets before, and said rings come right off. Easy peasy.This house is an old trailer with three toilets that I doubt have been properly scrubbed since the early 70s. This isn't hyperbole. This neglected ugly trailer home has been Student Party Central for decades. I know this because I found a Time Capsule in the attic stating just that...and I also talked to dozens of enthusiastic people in town telling me of all the outrageous events they've been to here as time ticked by.Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike parties and I've been a student...but I'm also familiar with just how clean things aren't in these kinds of places, much of the time. 'Nuff said.I started with the easiest toilet - mine - the one I give a good 'swish and scrub' to (the Flylady Way) after each use. After sitting on the floor and scrubbing, and scrubbing and scrubbing, I realized just what I'd gotten into. I moved into my husband's office toilet and scrubbed so vigorously that the floor became a pond...but at some point the bowl was mostly clean. So I left the pond for him to deal with, and took my rapidly dwindling pumice stick into the worst toilet - that in the main hall.Okay. I'd been using soap each time, and doing a lot of flushing to see what still remained to be scrubbed. I also had to stick MY FACE in each toilet bowl to scrub under the rim, which is a delightful experience I recommend to everyone at every opportunity.At some point my husband walked by and asked why I wasn't wearing gloves, at which I yelled, ""BECAUSE THE PUMICE KEEPS MAKING HOLES IN THEM AND IT'S USELESS AND THERE ARE NO GLOVES LEFT GO AWAY.""After 50 minutes of pure scrubbing I thought my elbows would fall off and my huge pumice stick was small a round cobble. Enough. I'm saving the pumice cobble to scrub away the iron stains in my bathroom sink once I've recovered from toilet bowl hell.Not today. Time for a scalding hot bath to wash away the stink of...I'm not even going to finish this sentence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9O7OJ24HREO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DAPGS#wasThisHelpful","R9O7OJ24HREO6","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SPOILER..........OKAY, seriously, no one in their right minds would be reading or watching this as a stand alone movie...This will make zero sense if you haven't seen the series in order, and paid a great deal of attention. Actually, it's best to watch this after a BSG series re-watch, where you can mentally slot this all into the places where it should go. This is not told in any logical fashion - it is an attempt to fill in the gaps, and is an admiral (no pun intended) attempt, truly, since everything production-wise is well and truly wrapped up by the time they pulled this little feat off. Major kudos for everyone they managed to pull back in for this, for the decent attempt at production values, for the music, for Tricia Helfer, and my gods the brain frakking effort to give the fans a treaty treat. Don't forget to watch the deleted cuts, which add to the story.I keep wanting to make an Ultimate Series Re-Watch Guide, since BSG is SO GOOD (but SO IMPENETRABLE to the dilettante). In my head, I'd put the pieces of this movie right where they need to go, from the very VERY beginning before the miniseries (or ""Before the Fall"", at the very last episode and OW MY BRAIN), then during the miniseries...then all along the first three seasons, during the webisodes that relate, and ending when the Cavils meet and (SPOILER SPOILER OH WHATEVER WHY ARE YOU READING) die.In Summary:The Plan is worthwhile for the rabid BSG fan, but not important if you really haven't been paying attention. It's a Love You note to the fans, and if you love BSG back, then buy it to thank everyone involved. Seriously, the gesture is important, and that's why we also bought Dr. Horrible, even though we could get it free online - to thank Joss Whedon for his Horrible Awesomeness. But The Plan really does fix a lot of dangling plot threads, shows Trica at her most versatile, explains poor Boomer, throws a lot of cute Cavil evuls at us, and gives Anders a lot more to do, with bombs!

For itty bitty mice, though, these small ones don't work without a lot of hassle. They are super tricky to set without snapping them shut on your fingers...and then the mice are STILL able to get the bait without tripping the doors. Every night. Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle. Mounting anger. Rough edges making our fingers bleed. Tripped traps, open doors, no results - unless you count my husband swearing to get poison next, and me begging to try something humane, anything else, please, please.After a lot of arguing, we ordered the highly ranked little green trap made of plastic - which worked like a dream from day one, and every day thereafter, until we caught all five mice in our pantry.

The directions suggest turning the solar panel to catch the light directly, but since even indirect light charges this device, it's easier to use than the directions suggest.I appreciate that the light was made for third world countries and especially jungle living - this thing can withstand my typical gear abuse.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a simple, inexpensive, durable solar task light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C6REBNID23F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJF86A6#wasThisHelpful","R2C6REBNID23F8","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That I can use red bulbs or blinking options is pretty sweet.I really just use the steady white light.

"This is the strangest chopstick set I've ever used. They are extraordinary light (hollow metal - aluminum?), and super slippery. I'd say they aren't for Gringo beginners, since their gripping power is zero. It's all in the technique.There are shallow circular ridges spaced evenly along the tips of the chopsticks, so, okay, the gripping power isn't exactly zero, but seriously, it's close.Another thing to note is that these are working chopsticks, intended for direct use in your kitchen drawer. There's no satin or velvety drawstring bag to pull out and impress the guests for your special Asian meal. The packaging is simply intended for delivery, not for storing, or re-use. I wouldn't give these as gifts, either.My sense is these are the real deal - the utensils used by people at home in the Orient on everyday occasions. I don't actually know anything - this is just me, guessing. They aren't the high end 'silver' versions - there's an obvious seam running the vertical length of each one. They're nice enough for everyday use. :)So I put them right in my own kitchen drawer, next to the forks. I make a point of practicing with them when I think of it.

"This is a well sewn, 8 inch thick belt, with just the right amount of Velcro. The stitching is solid. It holds up to a full day of working out, gardening, hiking, doing projects around the house, or adding back support to whatever I need.At the end of the day, it gets a little floppy in the middle. I just do some quick, gentle hand washing (gentle, in cold water with shampoo) and let it hang overnight. It is set and ready for the next day.I like the color. It's not a teenage pink, but more like a calm, cool fuchsia.Personally, I like to wear it a bit higher than the waist, so that it holds my boobs in securely while I work out or do chores. I find it very comfortable that way. I am around a 36-38D, and I appreciate the snugginess. Really, for me, it's more for back and boob comfort, than any weight loss, and I would fully recommend it for ladies looking for something to wear around the house for tasks, gardening and anything else at home where a bit of extra comfy support would be welcome.I'd also recommend it for anyone with Autism, since it's very huggy and comfortable, and sold at a much more affordable price than most of the compression gear at Autism shops.

It really is a good idea. I have a huge television, and it's neat to turn it into a camera display. I have thousands of photos on my phone, after all. No joke. Thousands of thousands of pretty nature shots to enjoy on the big screen.My suggestion: Wait for the bugs to be worked out and get something more universal, something more plug and play with all kinds of devices. This one is just too confusing. I know there's an adapter for the other size pins...but I'd have preferred said adapter to be included, and avoid asking everyone to be just so shiny about it all. I can barely remember what remote to use between the TV, DVD player, Synology...actually, our DVD player is the Game device with its weird control thing - don't make me learn all this, okay? Ow.I received this as a review sample and really should have known it would be more complicated than I was up to. STILL: IT'S A GOOD IDEA. I'd wait for a simpler version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVR9B1AAWRB1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LAZG2M#wasThisHelpful","RVR9B1AAWRB1B","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I was charmed with these spoons, and feeling so clever with myself. I have a lot of powdered supplements I take on a daily basis, and I need very small amounts. I read the reviews here and saw that people had done the work for me in measuring what exactly a TAD and DASH and so on meant. I ordered the spoons and used a Sharpie to write the actual amounts on the backs of the spoons.Clever me.Until after a few uses rubbed the amounts right off. The stainless steel is too smooth. Now I'm stuck with useless guessing again, or these choices:1. Open up Amazon and look up the amounts on the reviews (which is annoying)2. Print up the amounts and tape them in my bathroom (which is still annoying)3. Get another pair of spoons with actual amounts on them (which I did, and now I'm not annoyed at all)My POV: If you have a way to engrave these spoons with the amounts  you need (- ie - 1/16th, etc, then go ahead and bother with them). Or, order them as a gag gift for someone who might find such archaic amounts cute.HONESTLY: If the manufacturer would  - just a suggestion - put the actual amounts somewhere on these spoons, it would be a five star item.

"These are pretty good. I use them for quick dish washing, quick gardening chores, and yes, food handling - but for handing my OWN personal food. I don't like touching food. At all. I just don't like touching anything wet or messy.I also use them for pulling poison ivy. I put a set on, then pull my rubber poison ivy gloves over them, and get to pulling. So I end up double gloved. I keep the rubber gloves and toss the plastic 'under' gloves.I keep sets of them in my first aid kits (in my car, in my backpack and the big one under the sink). Some go in my recycling area and some go in my craft area. I think my husband took a few for his workshop.What I'd like is some way to store these in the kitchen for food prep that is more attractive than the ugly paperboard box it comes in. I'll keep looking: something will turn up, probably in a thrift store - maybe a ceramic jar.

"We really wanted this to make perfect little Death Stars. We even brought them out on Star Wars Day (May the 4th Be With You) and our guests all exclaimed in happiness....but the being the perfectionist Siths that we are, we really were displeased with our efforts. There's no way to do this right, unless you use the Force, I guess.Our Death Star cubes came out:- Cracked- With little knobs on top- with external rings - not trenches - around the middlesSo, I wrote the manufacturer (who provided these as review samples), who suggested I was filling them too much. Well, yes, I am a Sith who can read, and the instructions clearly say not to fill them too much, since water expands. There is even a Fill Line, beyond which a Padawan should not fill the cubes. I'd paid attention to all that the first several times I tried to make Death Star Ice Spheres.In my next attempts I went really, really below the fill line. I ended up with half stations, of course, which was worse than my overfull stations with rings around the middles and knobs on top.Another thing worth mentioning is that the bottoms are impossible to remove. The tops come right off, but to get the bottoms off, we have to either:1. use the microwave2. knock the bottoms against the sink several dozen times and make the Death Stars even more cracked3. use hot water on the bottoms4. pry and pry and pry at the bottoms until our fingers are like HOTHBTW, the hot water and the microwave systems work but create melty ice spheres that look nothing like Death Stars, as one would expect.In the end, I have to assume that neither my husband or myself have very little Force skill, since there are a lot of glowing reviews here of perfect Death Stars. Lord Vader would Force-choke us both. We shall, of course, re-debouble our efforts. We want cute little spheres of cold destruction and to inspire fear in the galaxy. :(","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TRYAHGQC5GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTII3XC#wasThisHelpful","R19TRYAHGQC5GX","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are okay. I'm kind of just glad there are seltzer flavors out there, but they don't taste as good as I expected (they are sort of 'flat'), and are a little messy to use. I have to keep them in the fridge, I have to keep a little 1/8 measuring spoon by them and rinse the spoon after each use (it is sticky)...and the entire little boxed operation isn't cheap.I'm actively looking for better ways to flavor my seltzer so I won't have to use this kit again.It's okay for a starter set to get going with your new Soda Stream, and that's the best I can say about it. I like the raspberry flavor best, mixed 1/8 teaspoon with 1/8 teaspoon lime.I've found a lot of things around the house that also work, like vanilla, lime juice squeezers (or lemon), a tiny bit of any juice of any kind, a tiny bit of any liquor...the key is using a small amount of something so that you get an 'essence', rather than a flavor.In any case, three stars for just getting this for the FIRST time with your Soda Stream/seltzer-maker. After that, you should be able to make your own seltzers with 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon of any other juice, mint, lemonade, cream soda, amaretto, vanilla, Tang, tea, whatever.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFKL8F9AYIOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NSVWD0#wasThisHelpful","R1TFKL8F9AYIOU","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are fabulous labels. I like a lot of things about them:- big enough to write on without cribbing it- big enough to read what you wrote from a distance- sturdy enough to stick in the ground without effort- slightly textured so your Sharpie doesn't rub off (this is a big issue with a lot of the slick labels)- the texture means they won't be so shiny in the sun the reflection isn't painful to my eyes- 100 of them for the price point of 5 bucksBasically these are well thought out - actual gardeners must have been consulted. I can use both sides and there's room for instructions, even. I really like these. Not cheapie dollar tree labels that break as soon as you try to break dirt.I got these as a review freebie but would have bought them anyway.

"I was thrilled to get these as a review sample. I opened the box, slipped them in my favorite daily sandals,and kept on going. I wear a woman's size 9, and they barely made my shoes feel tighter on top. What they DID do was make them more comfortable. Loads more comfortable. What I tend to do is find a pair of shoes (from a thrift store), which I wear to death, whether or not said shoes are actually good for my feet. These make that pair better for my poor soles.So:- less sweating- less slipping in the shoe- more comfy sole-feel- very nice on the heel- cover the entire foot- gives my flat feet a bit of arch support (not a huge amount, which would bug me)- they don't stinkTo sum:I didn't have to do a thing. I opened the box and stuck them in my shoes and stuck my feet in them. Out the door I went. Nice!NOTE:I do have big feet, and I wear large hiking sandals everywhere I go, so I didn't have to cut these down. I imagine for smaller feet, that would be an issue.UPDATE 5/16/15:These things do slide around. I am constantly pulling them down, which is annoying, and I just took off a star for that. The bottoms should be tacky so this doesn't happen. I might use some sandpaper, or find some kind of light glue to apply to the bases so this stops happening.

"I love and use these toe separators every day in front of the television. I use them for about ten minutes. They stretch my feet nicely, and feel really good once I remove them. Then I just rinse them with cool water under the kitchen since, let them dry on my drain board, and put them back in the drawer under my coffee table for the next evening.LOVE THEM. It's like the easiest yoga. :)NOTE: They do pick up every stray bit of dust, since they are made of sticky gel. That's why I rinse them. Rinsing cleans them right off, with very little effort.I received them as a free product sample, but I used to have something like these that I paid for previously, and would have bought again anyway. I lost the originals in a move...but these are nicer, since they mold better to my feet, having one straight side, and one side that molds to my foot contours.I also like the pretty tropical blue color.

"The best thing about this mouse trap is that you don't sacrifice any effectiveness in making it a ""mouse safe"" trap. I can't imagine that any mouse trap could be more effective than this one. We put it out six nights in a row and caught a mouse each night except for one. (I discovered that a young mouse is too light to activate the trap door so I taped a nickel to the trigger.)What we did:- We caught the parents the first two night with trap as is.- Then the trap did not trigger with the younger mice until we taped the nickel onto it.- After that we trapped all three of the rest of the family.It is also super easy to set. We tried another ""mouse safe"" trap first -- made of metal  (the Havahart version) -- and it was crap. It was very hard to set without triggering the trap and it never did catch a mouse even though it was triggered every night (-ie -they managed to steal the bait but we never caught a mouse).Suggestion: keep a large storage container handy to release the mouse into before taking it to the woods. The trap is very small and not a very nice place for a mouse to be trapped for a long period of time. On a few nights we caught a mouse before going to bed, so I put the trap in a storage container, with some old clothes and food, and opened the trap. At least that way the mouse had a nice place to sleep.If I had it to do over again I would have purchased a mouse habitat to keep all of the mice in as we caught them and then release the entire family together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDOSIMK31PU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YFA7HW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDOSIMK31PU5","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Product received as a review sample*My Samsung Galaxy Note fits, tightly and securely, in this mount. I had another mount for my Samsung Galaxy S4, which worked just fine, but didn't have the stability to hold my new Note. I have a Honda CRV that doesn't have a particularly smooth ride, which caused my S4 to vibrate constantly while in the old mount. This new mount holds the Note rock steady.What is really nice is that the clamp mount swivels for either direction of phone use - horizontal or vertical. Nice touch. The suction cup is easy to mount and sticks solid. We put ours on the dashboard, but it could also work on the windshield or roof. The gel-suction is reusable if you clean it off, and the box includes a 3M sticky mount tape in case you don't have a hard surface to work with.The only thing that could make this mount better is if it were a tiny bit bigger. It's an effort to get the phone in and out of the grip, because the jaws are open just about as wide as they'll go, but I will admit the Galaxy Note is a really big phone. Our smaller Galaxies and iPhones fit in just as well. The clamp is really responsive and I'm pleased that finally my phone doesn't droop.This really is an excellent phone mount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PK1KLTC3RB3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZWW3ES#wasThisHelpful","R1PK1KLTC3RB3O","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very unusual makeup brushes, at least to me. I'm used to seeing only a few larger brushes in a kit, and tons of tiny little eyeshadow art ones. This kit is specific - it's mainly for really doing foundation, concealer, and total face coverage. It's for the full-on, flawless face look.I'd call this a sort of Kabuki line - the brushes are very full, on the large size, and several of them are totally flat across the top. This is, I believe, for stippling and blending motions, rather than the sweeping motions usually used with typical American makeup brushes.Here is what the Amazon blurb suggests for their use:1.Round Blending Brush---Powder Foundation2.Angled Blending Brush---Foundation around nose and mouth3.Flat Blending Brush---Foundation around nose and mouth4.Tapered Contouring Brush---Conceal around eyes and nose5.Angled Contouring Brush---Blush and Bronzer6.Small Tapered Contouring Brush---Conceal on rounded areas like the nose7.Small Flat Blending Brush---Conceal under eyes and around your nose8.Small Round Blending Brush---eye shadow and primer9.Small Angled Contouring Brush---Contouring hollows of cheek and sides of the nose10. Small Angled Blending Brush--- Stipple conceal and blemishesNotice only one of these brushes is specifically aimed at applying eyeshadow.MY THOUGHTS:The 10 brushes themselves are wonderful: thickly packed in the ferrule without being too stiff, soft like bunnies, with pretty ombre tips, and nice pink wooden handles. The handles are a good length, too. The pink velvet drawstring case they arrive in is very feminine.I like this set for home use, for when I have the time and inclination to do a perfect face. I'm usually very lazy with foundation and concealer, rarely contour, and barely bother with a lot of blending. This set is so pretty and such a pleasure to use that it makes me slow down and pay attention to the process. It makes me more mindful. That's an interesting effect right there. It's also made me look up other makeup techniques than what I'm used to doing.RECOMMENDATION:This is a very girly, pretty and unusual brush set that works really well for at-home use, for creating really porcelain-like facial looks. If you like to get really involved with eyeshadows and liners, though, you'll need another kit. There's also no lip liner brush, or anything small enough for brows. The focus here is on foundation, concealing, blending, contouring and bronzing. If you love makeup, I think this is an excellent kit for days/nights when you want to do the whole 'flawless' deal, but you'll probably need a separate kit for small detailed eye/lip/brow brushes. Or just buy a few extra individual brushes and add them to the pink bag (there's plenty of room).[I received this set as a review sample]","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXE9DIOGECUQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VKDRQ30#wasThisHelpful","RXE9DIOGECUQ9","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm having a hoot with this clips. I know they're for clipping towels to lounge chairs, but they have so many other uses. I'm going around the house and yard looking for things to do with these large, sturdy, happy-looking clips.USES I'VE FOUND:- Hold those large pet food bags closed.- Hold human food bags closed (since these clips are so big, that's kind of a waste, unless your food bags are gigantic).- I used them to 'iron' my bed skirts: I sprayed them with Febrese in sections and held them flat with the clips, working around my bed skirt. As each section dried, the weight of the clip would pull it down and help it dry flat. I can totally see the section I haven't finished yet looking all wrinkly.- Hanging big, wet heavy things up to dry: bathmats, blankets, shoes, coats.- Holding open a book I'm reading so I can be hands-free while I eat.- Holding a book propped up for reference while doing other things, like cooking, or researching Internet items, or for copying notes from papers to my blog.- Holding open curtains when sunny out, or clipping curtains closed (for privacy, for blocking out the neighbors' porch lights).- Hanging linens and bedding out to air on my balcony (on sunny days).- Holding plant vines around stakes (gently, through the big curved hole).- Clipping notes to my metal desk as reminders for the day.- Clipping around the wad of wires behind my TV/entertainment center (through the curved hole), as a sort of 'corral'.- Holding art/craft projects together while the glue dries.- Emergency hair clips. I'm using one right now in my very long hair.I'll say it. These clips are both stupid and brilliant. They are just overgrown clothesline clips...but oh, so useful. And cheerful.

"I'm really happy with this car charger on several levels. I like that I can charge three devices at once (or that three people in my car can charge one device each - no more waiting). I like the form factor - the shape is smooth and easy to pull in and out. And I like the pretty blue LED light that lets me know the charger is seated properly and working.PROS:- Seats well in outlets without jiggling around.- Easy to grab and pull from the outlet (some other chargers are hard to get in and out of the socket, or hard to grab itself).- The construction seems durable.- 3 USB ports!- Numbers by the port let me know which port to use alone (the one on the top).- No trouble recognizing either my Samsung Galaxy 5 or my iPhone 4, along with my husband's Samsung Note Edge, all at once.- The blue LED light is handy when driving in the dark. I don't have to futz around looking for the outlets.- Good price point at around $9.CONS:- No USB cords included. This isn't actually a con, since most people have their own cords, but as a few car chargers come with USB cords, I thought it was worth mentioning.- I don't actually have anything negative to report. :)I have the white one and it looks clean and sleek. The Amazon blurb suggests this won't overcharge any devices, but I've never had a problem with that and can't think of a way to test it anyway.

"I like the new wave of ultrasound devices to eliminate household pests, but they do require a learning curve to figure out where best to place them for what rodent, insect, spider or small monster you want gone. I don't mind doing a lot of experimentation, since I'm very adverse to using toxins in my home, and I'm not big on actually killing living creatures if I don't have to.This one apparently takes a few weeks to kick in. You plug it in (lots of caveats as to where - see below), and the red LED light stays on steadily to indicate it is working. The amber and green lights blink intermittently. Amber = electromagnetic function is on. Green = ultrasound function is on.PROS:- Nice blue LED nightlight option.- No poisons or toxins! A big plus.- This doesn't actually kill any creatures. It just makes them leave. I'm good with that.- Plug and play use. You don't have to set anything at all. The only issue is finding the right outlet to do the most good.- Two prong plug is easier to use with older extension cords.- UPDATE: works on getting rid of large carpenter ants!- A NEW UPDATE: works on cockroaches!CONS:- Instructions are vague. ""Do not leave doors, windows, garage or basement doors open"", or ""Leave a door or window open to let them escape""? I'm baffled that they would offer contradictory advice.- Instructions say to keep this away from water, flower vases and object containing water. Is that because it will inhibit the sound waves? Will it bother my fish? I could use some clarity.- Apparently, rabbits and pocket pets will be disturbed by the electromagnetic and ultrasonic action. If you want mice gone, that would be a plus. If you have pet rodents, you probably shouldn't purchase this product, or at least keep them far away from it.- It keeps clicking every few seconds, which annoys me. At first I had it by my computer, but it's going in the bathroom next. I'll explain why below, as in what vermin I want to vermoose.- The 'manual' is a poorly photocopied slip of paper with tiny print. I can read small print, but I know a lot of adults that would need a magnifying lens for this. Just FYI.- When first using the iCooker, pests are supposed to be stirred up and more active, as they try to escape. Not really a 'con', but something to be aware of. You may end up with spiders or mice scurrying around as they freak out, try to escape, whatever.- If someone has a serious pest problem, according to the instructions, one will need a bunch of these devices around the house. The area covered is small, and walls, furniture, and textiles absorb the ultrasounds. The manual actually suggests getting one for each room, and then actually says to get two for each room. So, if it works, it might be well worth investing in a ton of these. But you have to try at least one it for a few weeks -  in optimal conditions - to see if it works for your particular pests.MY THOUGHTS:I have a huge problem every summer with no-see-ums that drive me batscat insane. My real hope is that this device will give me some relief. I'm willing to put up with the clicking and the LED blinking if it will help end my torment. Since the no-see-ums don't really get bothersome until mid-June, my hope, for now, is to eliminate the giant black ants all over my bathroom. The clicking and blinking won't keep me awake in there, and the pretty blue nightlight is useful in that location. And since the bathroom is a small area, it should work to get the ants out.Remember: the directions suggest it could take 1-3 weeks to actually chase away the vermin. In the meantime, I have a nice nightlight.Device received as a review sample.UPDATE 4/29/15:I've had the iCooker in my bathroom now for about a week, and haven't seen a single ant since. I was having huge problems with large black carpenter ants everywhere. Not a one has popped up! The clicking sounds are still a bit annoying (I can hear it from my bed), but since I sleep with a fan near my face, that drowns out the soft clicks anyway. When I want to relax in a bath, I unplug the unit, and then plug it back in when  I'm done. I'm very satisfied with how it's working on ants.The next real test will be this summer with the no-see-ums.UPDATE 5/5/15:They also work on cockroaches! I do not have a big problem with roaches, but one was hiding from my machine in the bathroom by clinging to the opposite, vertical support of a wooden shelf. When I tried to pick it up with tissue, the cockroach dissolved into little bits. I've never had an insect fall to pieces like that before. The instructions do say that the device takes longer to work on roaches, and I guess that would be accurate - but it DID work. Also, sometimes a carpenter ant now pops in my bathroom, but it seems lost, and my thinking is they keep hoping I've removed the device and they can move back in. HA! I don't think so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNKNQ2XAQ636/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUG0CV8#wasThisHelpful","R1DNKNQ2XAQ636","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's nice about this fielding trainer is that it's stiff (you can't just scoop up a ball), but not so stiff that there you don't get some of the give you find in a glove. It's the right textural combination to train players to use both hands when catching grounders.What this does is create engrams - the part of the brain that memorizes correct body positions, for unconscious play later. If you've learned how to swim, ride a bike, or drive a car, you can thank your engrams for giving you the ability to do complex maneuvers without having to think it through newly, each time. Imagine how mentally exhausting that would be. This faux-glove gives you the same kind of training for proper technique catching ground balls in the field.The construction is a little flimsy on this - it's really just a foam pad with finger slots sewn on the back with elastic - but for training purposes, it's a good place to begin.

I could just eat a handful of nuts if that's all I wanted.It's a decent trail bar though, bringing a little salt (70mg), 8 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber and some calcium and iron. It's also dairy-free, vegetarian, gluten-free, non-GMO, has no transfats, is cholesterol-free, and contains only 4 grams of sugar.It's also only 190 calories, which is far less than the cookie type versions (the White Chocolate has 240 calories, for reference). And for some reason, it's got 10 more calories than the far more delicious nut-blueberry version.Less good: 13 grams of fat - 1.5 of which are saturated. It's also a smallish bar, and won't serve as a meal replacement. It's better as a trail snack, or something to eat after a workout.The nuts inside: peanuts, almonds and cashews, in that order. Brown rice syrup is the third ingredient, after the almonds and before the cashews.I'm just not that excited about this bar. It's nuts in a sugar base with 'soy crisps'.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GKWVQ09R5YUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDIQYC#wasThisHelpful","R1GKWVQ09R5YUH","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like that there are two screen protectors in this package, since I'm not the most adept at placing these screen stickers on without trapping bubbles. It's a basic shield - it keeps scratches off the glass, and does a bit of overall ding protection to the entire device. The touch capacity is still present, and a little glare is reduced. You get a cleaning cloth and a little card to help press out the bubbles.I prefer the solid screen protectors myself - the stiff kind you place over the entire front - but for the price, this is a decent way to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27OG9B4G43L11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATZ9I90#wasThisHelpful","R27OG9B4G43L11","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far the most delicious thinkThin bar flavor I've tasted, and I've been a bit scathing in my reviews of some others. The outer coating is white and creamy, and the inner cocoa layer was thick, moist, chewy and sort of like a cross between a cake and a brownie. I've had this bar almost two years before eating it, and it was still amazing.It also had 20 grams of protein, which is a LOT in a small bar like this. A typical egg has 3-6 grams of protein, for reference. There's also no added sugar, which is a bonus. Also good: it's gluten-free, and there's some calcium and some iron.This isn't a diet bar, though. It has 240 calories and is too small to act as a meal replacement. There are 25 grams of carbs, 200mg of sodium, and 9 grams of fat - three of which are saturated.RECOMMENDATION:Bring this bar on a hike as a snack - it's tasty, you get a nice wallop of protein, and some of the sodium that outdoor activities seem to make one crave. It lasts a LONG TIME in the package without going bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z88EEEOW7LBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDIP5M#wasThisHelpful","R1Z88EEEOW7LBT","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inexpensive, lightweight protection. All the functions are accessible, and it has a slim, clean profile. This is a good case for people who don't want an obvious thick for of protection for their device, and the clear, barely there look is definitely attractive.

"What is the point of this product? It contains 4 little packets of mostly salt. I could add salt to rice by myself, or just have Ramen noodles if I wanted a starch and salt combo. In case this was not clear, there is no rice included in Mi Arroz (which means My Rice, in Spanish).SPECS:- 4 packets, each with .42 oz of salt, an undisclosed flavor, MSG, corn starch, silicone dioxide, cellulose gum, barley extract, sugar, disodium inosinate, and partially hydrogenated soybean oil.THOUGHTS:- Way more salt per serving than is recommended in a day: the box lists 660 mg per serving. A serving, again, per the box, is 1/6 of a packet. The FDA reports that 480 mg or more of sodium per serving is high....doing the math, ONE PACKET would supply 3,960 mg of salt. That's just shy of 4k grams of salt if you add the packet to some rice and eat the whole thing.- I'm going to just pause here and reflect on the 4 thousand grams of salt.- I have no idea what the ""natural and artificial flavors"" are, because they don't tell you on the box or packets. The flavor might be onions and garlic, but that's a guess based on photos on the packaging. The only flavor actually indicated in words is WHITE.- MSG is a flavor enhancer. A lot of people like the taste, but some people get headaches from it. Just be aware of this. It's also a form of salt. For more information, the FDA classifies MSG as ""generally safe"", and the Mayo Clinic website warns against MSG symptom complex, which has a whole suite of unpleasant temporary symptoms, if you are susceptible.- Silicone dioxide is found mainly in quartz, and sand. The Wikipedia says silicone dioxide is used in foods as a 'flow agent' - this is mainly - I assume - what keeps the rice from clumping. Health dot com lists this ingredient as one of their Top 18 Sickening Food ingredients. A little sand won't hurt you, but I don't know why I'd add it to my food on purpose.- Cellulose is indigestible wood pulp, also used as a flow agent, and works as a filler. It's also on Health's article about the Top 18 Sickening Food ingredients. So now we are eating salt, sand and sawdust.- The Barley is actually an autolyzed yeast extract, according to the ingredients list, and is a flavor enhancer made from salt and barley. It makes Vegemite taste like it does. This is another kind of MSG, the Wikepedia reports, creating a savory ""umami"" flavor. Umami is very interesting to read about, if you have nothing else to do, but it essentially means 'savory'. It's more sodium, in any case.- Sugar. Why sugar? Why add sugar to rice? For the same reason that sugar is in catsup, I suppose. We're addicted to sugar.- Disodium inosinate - just another form of sodium, used as a flavor enhancer, often associated with MSG. The Wikipepdia says it can be sourced from meat, fish or tapioca.- Partially hydrogenated soybean oil is where I draw the line. I've eliminated transfats and partially hydrogenated fats from my diet, because it causes cancer. Unlike sand and sawdust, it is actively bad for you. The FDA is making moves to actively ban these fats from food, according to NPR's website, but there is a lot of pushback from the soybean industry and other food groups. This has to be a personal choice for everyone at this point, but transfats are not allowed in my house. I suggest you do your own Googling on this one.RECOMMENDATION:Well, this was fun. I never intended to spend so much time on this review. I don't recommend Mi Arroz to anyone, really. I'm going to save these packets for my backpacking trips, which is when I start craving massive amounts of salt and stop worrying about transfats. I decided not to eat them here in my kitchen at all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1COHGUG566TJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1CLQGC#wasThisHelpful","R1COHGUG566TJH","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a kind of fun product to play with. You can print out your own design from the computer, and then add the plastic to anything stick-like. I added it to a walking stick I found in the woods and take it hiking, and everyone is curious what exactly I did here. It really is easy to use, adds a firmer grip to pole-like things (bats, rackets, hockey sticks), and let me add a wild touch to something I use all the time anyway.Keep in mind this is smelly out of the package, so open it outdoors and let it air a bit.BTW, I made mine with a sort of Lord of the Rings theme (i got creative with my own designing), because I'm that kind of nerd.

"Super easy to cook. I received two different kinds of these Knorr sides, and cooked one on the stovetop, and one in the microwave. The taste was pretty much the same (slightly spiced rice).WHAT I HAVE:- Creamy Chiptotle Rice Sides (rice and pasta blend)- Creole Garlic Butter Rice Sides (rice and pasta blend)What you get in these is the actual rice, ready to cook, with the spices already mixed in. There are no packets to have to open. Rip the top off the bag, dump in a bowl or saucepan, add water, and go. I didn't see a need to add margarine, which was an optional choice anyway (who uses margarine anymore?). The Creamy Chipoltle one says to add milk, which adds a slightly creamier taste.You get 2.5 servings per bag. One of them I split three ways - which wasn't quite enough for each person. The other I ate all by myself as a meal, and it was only a bit larger than I'd normally eat as a meal. So the 2.5 servings (for two adult people, with a little left over for seconds) sounds about right, especially as a side meal. Alternately, each of these could be made into a decent meal for two with some nice veggies or meat added.WHAT I LIKED:- 7 minutes on the stove, or 14 minutes in the microwave, with nothing to have to do but stir it a little. For non-cooks like myself, this is a very easy do.- It lasted a good long time. I owned these packages almost two years before I cooked them, and they were fresh enough for family food.- I thought it was better than Rice A Roni, and a good contribution to the 'instant starch meal' lineup- 6 grams of protein per serving.- 2 grams of fiber per serving.- A decent amount of B vitamins: enriched with thiamine, folate and Niacin- - ZERO trans fats! Yay!- Minute saturated fat (if you keep butter or sat oils out of it). Over all, one bag has 1 gram of any fat, and the other has 1.5 grams. So this isn't bad stuff - mostly it is carbs  (around 49g per serving), and calories 230 per serving.LESS GOOD:- This isn't a health food. It's not packaged as one, so that's not a con in my book, but don't expect to live on these. There's no added veggies, although the sides are enriched, along with 700mg of sodium per serving.OVERALL:Easy to cook and not too unhealthy. Knorr did a nice job with these 'insta-food' products. It's not all that tasty (the spices are bland, unless you add your own afterwards), but it's hot and filling. I think children would eat these, and I like the idea of having a few of these on hand for lazy nights when I want some warm, quick comfort food. Since there are no transfats, these are welcome in my house.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IIIZW13BRRGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4ASPXU#wasThisHelpful","R3IIIZW13BRRGY","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm very happy with this phone case, and it fits my Samsung Galaxy 5 perfectly. I picked the blue one that looks like tropical water, and this color makes me happy every time I see it. The case leather is soft, with a textured pattern, and feels a very tiny bit padded. There are two slots for cards. Three little freebies come along with this: a blue stylus, a plastic phone cover, and a tiny cloth-like square for cleaning the phone's screen. It's a thoughtful little kit.What is ISN'T is a wallet. It's just a nice kickstand case with two card slots.PROS:- Pretty case with a nice feel to it- Magnetic closure flap works well- There's a bottom grommet on the case that I could see putting some kind of leash on- Nice little freebies, as mentioned above- Props up nicely for horizontal hands-free viewing (kickstand feature)- Between the case and the plastic cover, you get great scratch protection- All the buttons and camera lenses are perfectly accessible. Nothing is blocked.- I can plug it in to charge while closed- My phone is securely snapped in the plastic holder inside the leather caseCONS:- Only two card slots- No clear card slot- No pocket for dollar bills/receipts- There's nowhere to put the stylus that comes along with this- The 'cleaning cloth' isn't microfiber - it's more of a very loose-knit felt (but as a freebie that comes along unadvertised, this isn't really a con)- Not a lot of protection against dropping. Don't expect that.With these limitations, it really can't be substituted for a wallet. I just see it an upscale-looking/feeling phone case, with the bonus of two slots to put cards in. In one slot I placed the little screen cloth that came in the kit (folded over) and in the other I put about three business cards to have for handily handing out. Personally, I love this. I love the way it feels, how it protects my screen from everything else in my purse, and how darn pretty it looks.I really feel it would be improved with a clear card slot, a little pocket for a few dollars, or an actual place to put the stylus.

"I'm happy with it. It's not super heavy duty, but it punches holes in my projects with the loose precision I was looking for. I wouldn't choose these for a classroom of boisterous kinds, but for an adult with occasional holey needs, it's plenty good.It would be nicer if it came with the loop so many of them have inside the handle, for tying to a string, making it easy to hang.A nice point: hole puncher arrived in a little clear plastic case. I just keep it in the case, in the drawer with my misc office supplies.Also good: there's a little 'hole catcher' lip. It doesn't work to catch every hole I've punched, but it does collect most of them. I've never seen this on a hole puncher before. It needs a bit of tweaking to be a better design - sometimes when I open it, it doesn't close back to the proper position, and then I have to futz with getting it back on correctly. But since I wasn't expecting this little feature anyway, it's no big deal. I just wanted to punch holes in some cards. :)NOTE: At this time, the product is an Add-On for Prime, which I find annoying. You can't just buy it alone. It's also $1.79, which is about 79 cents more than I think it should cost.Sometimes you just need a stupid little thing, and now I have one, and I don't expect I'll ever need another.

"Very creative design for a mudflap, and nice LED light unit. I'm very pleased with this kit.A lot of people don't put mudflaps on their bikes because they 'look dorky'. Unless you live in Seattle, where people are used to seeing mudflaps on commuter cycles, people tend to endure getting a wet, slimy back. This completely solves that problem, with an interesting tensile solution: the mudflap rolls up, out of the way when not in use. You barely notice the little black roll over the front and rear tires.When pulled out, the flaps do the job of diverting water at the same rate as conventional flaps. This is really best for a road bike, commuter bike, or hybrid. I don't think the flaps will stay flat if you're mountain biking - my sense is with the right angle of knock, they'd roll back up. From my experience with hardcore mountain bikers, mud flaps aren't a consideration in the first place, anyway.Whether or not the mudflaps are out, the other neat thing is the LED tail light unit. There are five choices of lighting - red/blue/white slow flashing, red/blue/white quick flashing, white quick flashing, red flashing, blue flashing. There is only one button, so you have to press through through all five options to turn the lights off. You do have to press solidly on the button - it won't accidentally come on by itself.The LED unit is USB chargeable, and mine arrived with a full charge. The USB port is the smaller size that works with my Samsung phone. It blinks red when charging.Note that there is only the tail light in this kit; no headlights are included.The kit comes with installation hardware, but no instructions for mounting. You're on your own with that. They do include a small bike wrench, sized for their hardware.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:Even without the mudflaps, I love this tail light, and it makes cycling safer. I'm definitely more noticeable on the road, but the lights won't blind anyone behind them in cars. I like the color and blinking choices. With the cool rollout flaps, cycling is now more comfortable, without dealing with the typical ungainly metal flanges. I'd be surprised if everyone didn't get these - creative, cool tech advance.I received this kit as a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHGONBO46M2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMXW4QS#wasThisHelpful","R1KHGONBO46M2B","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is kind of flimsy. I've had a lot of over the door hooks, and this one is not really up to snuff. It arrived with one of the door hooks bent to the side; I was able to fix that by just bending it back into position. Some of the white paint was also chipped in six noticeable spots, which I fixed by touching it up with WhiteOut.PROS:- Nice, dainty design, if you like that look- Five clothing hooks- The clothing hooks have balls on the end to protect the clothing- The over-the-door hooks are narrow enough in profile so that just about any door will still close- You don't have to screw anything together - just hang it over a door, right out of the boxCONS:- A bit wonky- Too cheaply made for the price point- Arrived chipped and bent- Will not stand up to heavier coats or laden purses, unless you're very careful in how you use the hooks. I wouldn't carelessly yank on these!OVERALL:For the price point, this isn't a good deal. It's too flimsy. Once in use, though, it does the job for lighter-weight clothing items. It would look very nice in a girl's room, and I can see it being useful inside a woman's closet for lingerie and scarves. I put it in my craft room and it's okay. I have much sturdier over the door hooks for my own bathroom and closet.I was provided with a sample for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J7XWJ9I77PL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7CQQA0#wasThisHelpful","R2J7XWJ9I77PL9","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the problems I've had in the past with styluses (stylii?) has been my fear of losing them. So I keep them safely in a drawer at home and forget I even have them. This affordable pack has enough stylii to encourage me to actually use them, which is the goal.PROS:- Good price point, lots of them.- Fantastic, brigh colors.- Freebie screen cleaning cloth included.- Clip on one end, plus a hole through the clip: gives choices on how to attach or leash the stylus to yourself.- The Capacitive tip works fine to press buttons, move screens, and generally act like a finger, but with more precision than a finger.- Comes in a decent resealable plastic bag that's clear in front. I put the lot in my drawer and pull out the color that looks fun for the day- If you don't like bright colors, you can choose the black, white, silver, gold, red or dark blue one. Actually, that's more than half of the colors, so everyone should be fine. My favorite is the teal. :)- Because there are so many, I feel comfortable using them all over the place - nightstand, in my desk, in my purse, in my car, in my travel bag, and clipped onto the cases of my many devices.CONS:- My husband complained he could not use the stylus as a screen 'pen' to write on his Samsung Note. This isn't that kind of stylus, so I don't see it as a con, but it's worth noting. If you're looking for something to make clear handwriting on your screen, keep looking.- The metal (?) clip on top is really rather cheap.RECOMMENDATION:Worth having if you want something more precise for your touchscreens than a bare finger. I find myself missing these when I don't have one around. Has a clip and a hole for a narrow string, if you're having issues with where exactly to put them near your devices.

"These are some nice, well-made glasses that I'm not sure what to do with. They don't block the computer glare on my large desktop monitor, nor my husband's array of three desk monitors and one laptop. It's possible this will help me use my phone to take and see photos or read texts on sunny days? I'm going to do my nightly TV watching with these on tonite, and see if they reduce eye strain.PROS:- A really nice black canvas, solidly-built zip case is included with these computer glasses. It's a hard case with some give, and there's a nice rotating clip on one end. I've already put my own daily glasses in them and don't have to fear I might sit on them anymore. :)- The glasses themselves are a solid, pretty tortoiseshell that appears to be unisex. They look very handsome on my husband - it's Clark Kent look. We will probably save these just for the frame.- The ear pieces have a 'wood panel' look to them, which is an interesting choice with the tortoiseshell front.- These are sold as having UV protection, which would be a nice feature if I used these with my phone, out of doors.- I do wear eyeglasses for distance viewing, and these fit right over them. I won't include a photo, since I look a bit silly, but yes, they can be worn over prescription eyeglasses. Since I have a female-sized head, I asked my husband to put these on over his reading glasses, and that also fit fine.- Not bad for nerd-chic fashion statements, or as part of a costume.CONS:- They don't block glare. WTF?- Am I doing something wrong, really? All they do is lend a slightly amber overlay to the world. Very slightly.- Not polarized. How is this supposed to work?RECOMMENDATION:Since they don't block computer glare for me, I don't know how to rate these. They are nice 'nerd' frames, well made, with a truly great case. The price point for the frames and case alone are well worth it. The UV protection would be nice outside, but these aren't sunglasses - they are almost clear. At most, they 'soften' light. Maybe worn for hours at a time, they would reduce eye strain. For $13, it might be worth trying.These were provided to me as a review sample.UPDATE 4/21/15:I thought of a new use for these glasses: sneeze protection in crowded areas, like in planes. I tend to get everyone's colds on planes, unless I take a lot of precautions about not touching things. I'm placing these glasses in my carry-on bag, next to my Airborne, Clorox wipes and little cloth gloves. Yes, I know I'm a freak about it, but since I've started being so careful I haven't come down with any more travel-related flu.UPDATE 4/23/15:I like to spend a lot of time walking around a little pond near my house and text people. I get fitness, and I get some time with friends. I wore these glasses today - a bright day - and they did NOT cut the glare from the sun shining on my phone. They did nothing of the sort. If I think of a good way to use them, I'll add that here. I really don't know how a tiny bit of amber can reduce eye strain. Please let me know in the comments below if I'm missing something crucial.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHINS2D2C4MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FVT927C#wasThisHelpful","R1WHINS2D2C4MU","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very lightweight phone case that doesn't do much to protect the Samsung 4. Well, it will cover the four edges from light dings, and cover the back from scratches. I wouldn't toss this across the room with my phone in it. If you're the careful type with your phone, though, this will probably be all you need. It has a slim profile, is light, milky, matte, translucent, and has a smooth, slightly grippy texture.PROS:- It's like its barely there (this will be a con for some)- A good seal around the Samsung 4- Somewhat useable for the Samsung 3 (same good seal, just minor issues with buttons lining up)- Attractive- Nice feel - smooth with a bit of grip, so it's easier to hold than the phone alone- Decent edge protection if you don't expect armor platingCONS:- It's like it's barely there (this will be a pro for some)- No rim - so there's nothing to have as a scratch 'bumper', so to speak, for the screen.NOTES:- I was able to fit my older Samsung 3 in the case just fine, but the holes do not match up exactly. It's very usable, though. If all you have is a 3, this  cover will serve for everything but the lower part of the volume button. Just FYI.- For some reason, a lot of reviews on this page are for an armband. This is just a lightweight case to cover the back from scratches and the sides from light dings.FINAL THOUGHTS:I like Belkin products, generally. I'm not sure about this case, because it just doesn't seem to DO much. It's practically invisible and the protection is light. Too light for someone like me, who's rather hard on her stuff. I expect this case is PERFECT for people who take a lot of care with their things and want a bit of extra protection that isn't obvious. The grippiness does  make it easier to hold onto the phone. Better for adults, especially adults  who are careful with their belongings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BXJJ1Z0RFR7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUCY9Q8#wasThisHelpful","R2BXJJ1Z0RFR7J","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very happy with this phone case. I picked the blue one that looks like tropical water, and this color makes me happy every time I see it. The case leather is soft, with a textured pattern, and feels a very tiny bit padded. There are two slots for cards.What is ISN'T is a wallet. It's just a nice kickstand case with two card slots.PROS:- Pretty case with a nice feel to it- Magnetic closure flap works well- There's a bottom grommet on the case that I could see putting some kind of leash on- Props up nicely for horizontal hands-free viewing (kickstand feature)- Between the case and the included plastic cover, you get great scratch protection- All the buttons and camera lenses are perfectly accessible. Nothing is blocked.- I can plug it in to charge while closed- My phone is securely snapped in the plastic holder inside the leather caseCONS:- Only two card slots- No clear card slot- No pocket for dollar bills/receipts- Not a lot of protection against dropping. Don't expect that.With these limitations, it really can't be substituted for a wallet. I just see it an upscale-looking/feeling phone case, with the bonus of two slots to put cards in. In one slot I placed my business cards in those, to have for handily handing out. Personally, I love this. I love the way it feels, how it protects my screen from everything else in my purse, and how darn pretty it looks.I really feel it would be improved with a clear card slot, a little pocket for a few dollars, or a place to put a stylus.I received this item as a review sample.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FJPJUHBSWJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWWXAKQ#wasThisHelpful","R39FJPJUHBSWJ6","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bundle of microfiber cloths is one of those things I really didn't realize how much I would need, until I had it. I've always had a few microfiber cloths here and there, but the quality of these are a step up. They feel luxurious. To my Asperger's-sensitive skin, they feel like silky clouds. And since so many are included, I've felt free to use them for all kinds of uses, instead of weirdly hoarding them in my computer desk drawer.USES I'VE TRIED AND SUGGEST:- Cleaning eyeglasses- Cleaning my phone screen- Cleaning my computer monitors and other electronic screens (good for my Kindle Paperwhite)- Cleaning my television screen- When damp, you can clean keyboards- Great household duster when damp- Cleaning windows (especially doggy nose prints left on the glass)- I've enjoyed using these as little washcloths for my face. Since they are so soft and smooth, it feels luxurious, and the microfiber drinks up moisture- Good for removing makeup when damp! I set aside one cloth just for this. The black ones show makeup stains least- They actually work fantastic to mop up the sweat from my hot flashes...now I always have some in my purse just for drying off my face and neck- Cleaning my coffee work mug. I have one just for this to remove the brown rings inside the cup, and the spots that get outside. They also remove lipstick- These also work for cleaning mirrors in the car. One now lives in the glove box of my truckYou could probably shine silver with these, but I haven't tried that yet. I'd also try them if I was going to to polish my car, if I ever bothered to do that. If I had kids, I'd keep some around to wipe off dirty little mouths and faces. :)PROS:- Extremely soft and smooth- Three colors in the package - the variety is a nice touch (blue is my favorite, then black)- Perfect size - not too tiny (I have small hands for an adult, and this covers my entire hand when laid flat on my palm)- Scalloped ends to prevent fraying- Easy to hand wash in my bathroom sink; they dry super fast- It's been fun finding off-label uses for themCONS:- The grey color isn't very exciting, and shows grime the most readilyRECOMMENDATION:For seven dollars, getting 15 of these really soft cloths is a great deal. I never realized how multifunctional these small cloths were until I had so many to play with! Highly recommended for many, many cleaning uses. I'm most impressed with the relief they help give me with menopausal hot flashes.

"This oil feels lovely on. It has a smooth slip, isn't greasy or waxy, soaks right into the skin, and doesn't leave any sort of residue. It is also completely scentless, to my nose.The bottle says this is an organic, unrefined, cold pressed oil. There's also a warning to keep it out of the eyes, and not to take internally.The bottle 4 fluid ounces, comes with an airtight cap and plastic seal, plus a pump top option. I removed the caps it arrived in and just use the pump.You do not have a lot of control with the pump - it's a bit squirty. Be prepared for that. More comes out with one pump than expected, but I just make sure to use any extra on the backs of my hands. Keep the airtight cap in case you want to take it traveling, since the pump cap doesn't lock.I haven't heard of using Rosehip as a carrier oil - my husband, who used to be a masseuse, always used almond oil. This oil seems clearer and cleaner, a bit. Less slippery, but I prefer that in a massage. I've been hearing about using coconut oil as a carrier, which seems messy, since coconut oil is a solid at room temps. This rosehip oil is an elegant solution.WHAT I USE IT FOR:- I've been rubbing it over a scar of mine, just to see if it does anything. It's a really old scar, so I don't expect much, but we can see.- I'm experimenting with it as a facial moisturizer. I'm very particular what I put on my sensitive skin. Almost anything with a scent makes me have a reaction. So I'm trying this two ways 1. As an all-over night-time facial moisturizer in place of my usual stuff, and 2. as a serum, placed only over the areas that lines are developing (I'm 47 with very light age lines). My normal-to-aging skin drinks it up and it feels great. I haven't had any bad skin  reactions, after a couple weeks of use.- Massage. I've added a drop of peppermint oil to it, which was a bit more revitalizing than I wanted. I want to add some other, more soothing essential oil next, like Chamomile. Since there's only 4 ounces to the bottle, this won't last long if you do a lot of body massaging. I mostly use this to massage my hands and forearms, and my feet. It's really nice to work this into my toes and let it soak into the backs of my heels.- On my nails. My cuticles in particular, since I have troublesome ones.- On the ends of my hair, as a sort of serum. Since this is a straight oil, I only use a little and keep it on the ends, so I don't get a greasy look.RECOMMENDATION:This is an elegant textured oil with a nice array of possible uses. I like that it's organic and contains only rosehip oil (and nothing else). With only four ounces, this will probably get used up quickly in my house. Highly recommended for personal hygiene.I received this product as a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SBWTYDST0YKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIUESAY#wasThisHelpful","R1SBWTYDST0YKG","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting over a year to review these stool softeners, and still have not had a need yet. This is one of those things that's good to have around in your first aid kit, but you don't necessarily want to use. Kind of like life insurance.So, all I can do is 1. wait until I get constipated enough to use this, or 2. review what I can see of the product without using it.Here's my information on Number 2 (no pun intended, hehehe):1. The box is pink. I think the idea here is that it won't look so scary in your cabinet. It lends a feminine air to the whole nasty proceedings.2. The bottle has a pink label.3. The pills (softgels) themselves are half pink. They are also half white. The pink half is translucent and catches the light, while the white side is opaque and seems milky.4. The one active ingredient - Docusate sodium, in 100mg per softgel - will make bowel movements within 12-17 hours. The instructions say to take 1-3 softgels daily with a glass of water, as a single or divided dose over the course of a day, for adults over age 12. The pills are considered  ""stool softener laxatives"", according to the package label.5. You take these by mouth. DO NOT insert them up your butt.6. Interestingly, included in the box is a little health insert, briefly mentioning ""Women's Problems"" like menstruation, menopause, pregnancy, and the taking of Calcium. This offers a few suggestions to prevent constipation in the first place (ie - eat more good fats, eat complex carbohydrates, take less Iron). There's a $1 off coupon for more laxatives on the back. This insert is also pink.7. 25 softgels are included in the rather small, almost discrete, little bottle.WebMD, a site I trust, has this to say: ""Stool softeners such as docusate are often the first method used for preventing and treating this type of constipation. Docusate is often used when straining to have a bowel movement should be avoided (e.g., after a heart attack or surgery).""RECOMMENDATION:Since doctors say this works, I'll go with that. It seems to be the first line of defense before moving up to stronger laxatives. So, yes, this should be a suitable product for constipation. The action occurs after at least 12 hours, so don't expect immediate relief. The main thing that sets this product apart, really, is the pink PINK pinkness of everything. It won't look frightening or manly in your medicine cabinet, so, it's got that going for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8HKIIC4YDAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN5LJUG#wasThisHelpful","R1B8HKIIC4YDAF","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off - this stuff is STRONG. Like, acid for blood strong (ten points if you get the Aliens reference). I remember living in Boulder, CO, and going on a tour of Celestial Seasonings tea warehouse. They had to keep the peppermint locked in an air tight room, so it would not make every single tea in the factory taste like peppermint. When they opened the peppermint room door, with a whoosh, it would clear out your sinuses. I'm not exaggerating.That's what this stuff is like. It is pure essential oil of peppermint, and I'm surprised it hasn't melted the plastic off the stopper cap. You receive quite a small bottle of this (10ml, or .33oz), but my sense is this is enough to last a lifetime for typical home use.Once you're aware of what this is, then you can decide what to do with it. Websites abound with ideas for this oil.MY OWN EXPERIENCE:- I wanted to use it to flavor my SodaStream carbonated water. I used one drop from the tiny dropper, and it made my entire liter of water so strongly pungent that I couldn't drink it. If I was to try this again, I'd see if one drop worked suitably in a gallon.- I also used a drop in Rosehip carrier oil for massage, and it tingled. I'd call it more bracing than relaxing.- I have hopes that it can help with the inevitable no-see-um torment I get every summer - either as an insect repeller (I'd use a carrier oil and glycerin, I think, in a spray bottle).- I also have a mouse problem. I'll put some on cottonballs and see if that keeps the mouse out of my bathroom cabinets (it likes to live in there, and poop, and make nests from my extra toilet paper rolls).- Any mint can be used as a counter-irritant, so I'd think this would help with bug bites, poison ivy, or even soft tissue pain (maybe arthritis). It works on the same principle as menthol, which it's related to.MEDICAL, TOPICAL AND HOUSEHOLD USES:~ WebMD, a site I trust, suggests the following as MEDICINAL USES:""In dietary supplements, peppermint oil has been tried for a variety of digestive problems including:Irritable bowel syndromeIndigestionHeartburn""Dietary supplements containing peppermint oil are also used by some people for the following conditions, although there is no clear evidence that they are helpful:NauseaVomitingMorning sicknessCramps of the upper gastrointestinal tract and bile ductsDiarrheaBacterial overgrowth of the small intestineGasColdsCoughsInflammation of the mouth and throatSinus and respiratory infectionsMenstrual problemsLiver and gallbladder problems""Skin preparations containing peppermint oil are used by some people for the following conditions, although, again, there is no clear evidence that they are helpful:HeadacheMuscle painNerve painToothacheInflammation of the mouthJoint conditionsItchinessAllergic rashBacterial and viral infectionsRepelling mosquitoes""In addition, peppermint oil vapor is sometimes inhaled to treat symptoms of colds and coughs. Also, some doctors add peppermint oil to a barium solution to relax the colon during barium enemas.""According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, several studies suggest that enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules -- which allow the oil to pass through the stomach so it can dissolve in the intestines -- may help relieve common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome such as abdominal pain, bloating, and gas. Non-enteric coated forms of peppermint oil, however, actually may cause or worsen heartburn and nausea.""~ Please, if you're going to ingest this oil, be really careful, and see what your doctor thinks.~ There are tons of non-medical uses. The PaleoMama blog offers 20 great ideas on peppermint oil, including ways to eliminate bad breath, eliminating bloating by rubbing on the belly, breathing it in to reduce drowsiness (this works!), repelling spiders and ants (use cottonballs or make a spray), removing ticks, adding to a diffuser to freshen air or help combat stress, adding to a foot soak, mixing with vinegar for a household cleaner, and as an odor control scent for smelly closets/lockers/shoes/whatever.~ Also, as the Amazon blurb says above, you can add this oil to crafty, homemade items such as perfumes, candles, body wash, bath salt, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, balms, and soaps.OVERALL THOUGHTS:Very strong, pure minty oil substance that could probably be used as the perfect murder weapon somehow. I'd have to think about that. You should be careful with this...but it IS the real deal. This is an excellent choice and a good value if you need pure essential oil of peppermint, and there are probably literally hundreds of ways to use this. The dropper itself is also well-made and easy to work with.

"This is a fantastic charge unit. It's one of those things I didn't realize I needed, until I had one.You know how old houses don't have enough outlets in a room? Or how hotels might or might not have enough outlets, but they are in inconvenient places? I was recently at a truly crappy rat-bag of a motel with one outlet in the room, right behind the bed. The only source of light (a table lamp) was plugged into one outlet, and the TV had the other. I unplugged the TV (I needed the light), and then spent the rest of the night juggling between my phone and tablet. Good thing it was only me that night - a couple with devices would end up out of luck.Don't ever stay at the Payless Inn in Gila Bend, AZ, BTW.Even more importantly, I can now use one outlet at any coffeeshop, or in the airport, or on a plane...and charge - guilt-free- ALL my devices. No more feeling greedy. I can even share.This just isn't an issue anymore, any of it. Where has this been all my life? Seriously.PROS:- 4 USB ports :)- Everything charges at once, and is each device is actually usable while charging. I have another charger that only allows for either charging OR using, so this is a nice feature.- Charges anything a USB takes. I've used my Samsung, iPhone, ASUS Tablet, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Paperwhite, USB power bank, and a USB fan...no problems. Nice and speedy and reliable.- Fits in my daily purse. It's a little on the large size for daily toting, but I have a big purse. For actual travel with a backpack, it takes up very little space.- 48 watts of power, so nice for camping with an inverter.- Even with all four ports in use, the device never gets hot. Warm, yes, but not hot. This is a well made unit.CONS:- Although it looks like those cute little charging cords are included with this unit, they aren't. It's just the charging box, with 4 USB ports.- I wish there'd been a little bag for this, since I now bring it everywhere. I went to the Dollar Tree and got a little canvas zip bag for it.I do recommend investing in a few of the shorter charging cords, since when I have all my devices charging at once, my long cords look like a spaghetti factory. This isn't really a problem, just a matter of aesthetics and organization.RECOMMENDATION:Highly recommended. I think anyone with more than one device needs this. Anyone in a relationship needs this - it keeps the peace. If you travel , you need it.

"Strangely enough, I find myself carrying this monopod around to use quite a bit - more than the actually superior, more upscale version made by this  company. I think I like the squishy handle for gripping (mine is the pretty green one). The aluminum telescoping 'stick' is stronger than it looks, and I really like the way the holder grips my Samsung 5. It feels safe and secure, once I tighten the directional screws down. There's plenty of room for my largish phone, even in its case.A little orange rubbery clip is included for iPhones, but I since my old iPhone 4s lives in a case, I didn't need to use that when I tested this. The newer, more narrow iPhones might need that clip for extra security, or to protect the glass, or both.PROS:- Nice black-on-black box presentation - would make a pretty gift.- The inside is also well-packaged, with all the pieces in a velvety drawstring bag.- I like the heft and feel of the grippy handle.- You can really reach up high with the telescoping arm extended - there are tons of uses for something like this, besides taking selfies. :)- The whole kit, once in it's drawstring bag, is pretty lightweight, so it's very easy to pack this in for camping, hiking,- The handle holds a charge for a long time. I was able to still use this thing after a month, without a recharge.- Charging cable is included too. :)- The green color is attractive. I like that there are several color choices with this company; these selfie sticks stand out (no pun intended) from all the boring black ones on the market.- With the phone holder unscrewed, there's a standard camera mount on the monopod, so it works with digital cameras too.CONS:- The button for taking the picture is at the upper part of the handle, which is less convenient then at the lower end. Unless you have a large hand, that cuts off a half foot of picture height. The other YOPO has this issue corrected.- The button itself is kind of 'soft' - I do prefer the actual clickey type button on the other YOPO Bluetooth Selfie Stick.- No instructions. I don't know why there isn't even a card for this. If you don't know how to operate Bluetooth features, you have to do some internet research on your own. That's kind of an oversight, in my book.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:Sturdy BlueTooth monopod that gives you plenty of extra height, works well, holds phones securely, while looking good. :)I received this product as a review sample.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTZLNLBGQ9EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5JCTKG#wasThisHelpful","R2PTZLNLBGQ9EH","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smells lovely, is gentle on my face, and does a nice job of cleansing off dirt. It also leaves my skin feeling dewy and soft:  I'd even go so far as to call this rose water dreamy, okay? I love spraying it on my face all day long, just to refresh myself. It's like taking a gentle break from whatever stresses are going on...literally taking time to smell the roses.AS A TONER:My facial skin tends to be sensitive to fragrances, so usually my toners and spritzers are scentless.  I'm very careful with what I allow on my face. I don't feel like I have to worry with this one. Not a single breakout yet.I'm not a daily makeup wearer (only for special events, really), but my face does get grimy from all the gardening, yardwork,  and outdoor activity I do. This definitely picks up dirt, grit and sweat on my cotton rounds.FOR MENOPAUSE:Yes, at 47 I'm right about there. I've been experiencing the hot flashes and irritation that comes with peri-menopause for five years now, and I don't see that letting up any time soon. I'm already carrying this around in my purse, along with my usual microfiber washcloth, to mop up the sudden tropical monsoons I get on my face and chest. After wiping off the sweat, I spray this on, and just let it evaporate off. I feel cooler, and less irritable.DISCLAIMER:I received this product as a review sample, but will be buying it as soon as I run out. I don't want to be without it, especially as summer ramps up and  the humidity really kicks in. I'm sorry about all the superlatives, but this Rose Water is one of the nicest personal treats I've run across, ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXKF08VR1E2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RU918E6#wasThisHelpful","RGXKF08VR1E2J","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Think Thin makes some hits and misses in their flavors, and I'd say this one is a miss. It's not awful-tasting, but it isn't what I'd call good, and the texture is a bit chalky. I expect more...flavor...out of something called Cookies and Cream.What's good? It's gluten-free, has a lot of protein (20 grams is significant), and comes in a convenient bar format. There isn't any added sugar, so it's low on the glycemic index.It's not low carb (11 grams), or low calorie (230), or even low fat (7 grams). It's just a way to get some more protein into your day, and to avoid spiking your blood sugar while doing it.My recommendation is to try one of the other Think Thin bar flavors. I prefer the Chocolate Covered Strawberries one, and the White Chocolate. Keep in mind that NONE of these bars are going to taste like dessert; but some are more palatable than others. Since everyone's taste buds are different, you might want to try out single versions of different varieties before you settle on an entire box of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JN5QYC2TPA6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDIOYY#wasThisHelpful","R3JN5QYC2TPA6X","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shampoo is a bit thin, and I didn't find it all that amazing to use. It cleans hair, but doesn't have any kind of elegant scent or texture, and didn't leave me feeling like I'd done much cleansing, either. My hair felt a bit heavy and limp, somehow, after using.It's light on the lather, which is actually a good thing (sudsing doesn't actually do anything to clean hair), but since I'm used to lather, it did feel a bit odd.I've also used the conditioner and oil in this line, and none of these products left me impressed.For reference, I have dark brown Causasian hair of medium texture and thickness.

"These things work, but it's a slow process. I've used used mine over the course of a year, and noticed they work best when left in an area not often frequented by people.For example, when I put them in my daily use clothes closet, I never saw a single bug trapped in it. But when I moved them to my RV, over the course of months the entire thing filled up with moths, crawlies and grub-like things.I put one in my RV clothing wardrobe and the other in the food pantry. The food pantry one worked so very well after a few months, that I moved the  second one to the food pantry too. It also filled up. I'm very glad to not have these insects crawling around my food. I'll be buying these again for the food cabinets in my RV...this may be an off-label use, but I'm glad to have figured this out.If you have major problems with moths in your clothes (probably in an attic or some other infrequently used area), then I can verify that moths are indeed attracted to the trap, but it takes them a while to find it. This isn't the item for a quick fix. I think you'd need something stronger (ie - more toxic) for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14QRL4AHZGXB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017M5V9A#wasThisHelpful","R14QRL4AHZGXB9","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suitable hardhat with a nifty UV exposure element (because sunlight breaks down plastic). The suspension harness is comfortable, once it's in there.Which leads to my main issue with this hat: the frustration factor in assembling the suspension/strap system. The written instructions were a bit feeble - worse than Ikea's hieroglyphics.I understand that sending it out unassembled kept the price point down, but I'd rather pay a bit more and have it arrive in a ready-to-wear form. At the very least, some care and attention should be paid to making usable instructions. Perhaps most buyers are in the construction industry and already know how to put a suspension harness in a hat? Still, I feel that's no excuse. People buy products for all kinds of reasons, and not just because a brick might fall on their head. ;)I tend to retrofit my hardhats for caving use by removing the 'brim'...which required a little bit of power tool use and some sanding, but then worked fine. I also had a to buy a hardhat chin strap: those cost around $4-$7 on Amazon. This all cost less than the price of an actual caving helmet (those start at $50 and go up to over a hundred dollars), so it was a worthwhile endeavor. Note that in a cave, you don't get an awful lot of UV light, so I don't expect the sensor tag to go off-color on me anytime soon.The vent holes are a nice touch, and the design of the helmet leaves me plenty of room to strap on a headlamp.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKZYU2JSFCTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081JT7LK#wasThisHelpful","R2JKZYU2JSFCTL","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Multiple uses! I do like the 'selfie' idea - I take enough of them, like everyone else, but I actually prefer this as a monopod for getting nature photography at angles I just can't on my own. The Bluetooth button at the base allows for me to make creatively framed shots, without having to get into crazy positions.Other uses:- Getting enough distance for group shots, without needing to mess with self-timers, or in finding stable/safe places to rest your phone.- Using to record events - meetings, classes, flash mobs, concerts, dance clubs...anywhere where you need the height.- You can actually be discreet taking people photos with this, since you're not holding it up to your face. You can hold it off to the side, or down low, over people's heads, or even around a corner. Think of the International Spy uses! :)Pros:- The mount works on real cameras - if you don't screw in the phone, there's a standard camera mount!The spring mount for the phone holds my Galaxy 5, even in its big case.- USB charging cord for handle is included.- I have to mention the lovely packaging. The black-on-black box is pretty, inside and out, with every last piece of the item set in a black foam backing. Gift quality presentation.- The velvety carry pouch is a thoughtful addition.- Solid handle with a grippy texture and good plastic button, well placed.- I ordered mine in blue. It's a very pretty blue. :)- My phone picked up the Bluetooth connection right away.- Handle keeps a charge for a long time!Cons:- Where are the instructions? If I didn't know how to set up my Bluetooth, I'd be hunting the Internet to figure this thing out. No instructions included. None. With everything else so carefully presented and included, this seems a crazy oversight.- The extension rods are a little stiff at first - they don't screw out - you pull them. Yet, once extended, you do have to be a little delicate with it. It doesn't lock into position.- The weight of my phone makes things a little awkward at the farthest end of extension. Use caution.Overall:One of the better selfie/monopods/spy devices on the market (I've tested four in the last month!). Instructions should have been included...but aside from that, this one is sturdy, the handle has a nice heft to it, the photo button is well placed, and the entire box is just so pretty. Recommended both for one's own use, or as a nicely presented gift.Disclaimer: I received a sample of this product for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXYHZJFOVI2OJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T651BMQ#wasThisHelpful","RXYHZJFOVI2OJ","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This isn't the best dust mop on the market, but it's a good one for the price point. I like using it - it's just so easy to get the hairs and dust and little bits of floor flotsam out the door. The blue color is also cheerful, which appeals to me.Pros:- Lightweight and pleasant to use. No lugging.- I don't have to attach something to the bottom every time I want to use it, unlike the Swiffer dust mop- To clean it off, I just take it outside and shake it. The dust flies off and into the wind.- If I want greater gripping power, I just hold a can of Pledge a foot away from the mop head and lightly spray it into the blue hairs.- The mop head bends nicely between the floor and wall.Cons:- Blue hairs come out all the time at first, making a mess. This stabilizes, though, after a bit of use.- The hairs aren't very grippy for anything larger than hair or dust. For the other little random things that end up on floors, I end up using this like a push broom. That's fine and all, but it's worth noting.Recommendation:This is a good everyday dust mop for light conditions. Heavy-duty conditions would be too much to expect...if you have a lot of foot traffic and constant floor dirt, you will need to buy something else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCZL6535TS5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UTJK9G#wasThisHelpful","R2VCZL6535TS5V","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this cover for a year now, and it's stood me in excellent stead. I drop my phone ALL THE TIME. This case absorbs all the impacts, leaving me with a perfect, crack-free phone. The raised edges also provide a bit of a lip to prevent scratches on the glass. Seriously, I'm hard on my stuff - anything I choose to use had better be up to the task.Also love the cobalt blue color. It hasn't faced at all, although you can see a bit of oil staining from where my fingers grip my phone from my constant texting and photography. The entire look of it is rugged, and somehow makes me think of The Borg, or a Terminator.The only issue I have with the case is the useless stand. I think I used it once before it broke off. I can jiggle it around to work it back in and make it do an okay job of giving me a hands-free horizontal view of whatever I'm watching...but I can't touch it. So, if I want to do any reading where touch swiping is involved, the stand just falls back off again. It's so annoying to use that I forget it's even there.I also found it a bit hard to get on my phone, the first time. Three edges would go right in, but the last fought me for hours. I had to get someone with stronger hands to force it completely in there. Once in, it stays put. So, that's good.I won't take a star off the case for having a ridiculously weak stand, since I bought it for phone protection, period, and that's where the strength of this product lies.Overall, I love the color, the price is great, and it really is a heavy duty piece of plastic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8CTP9N3JM8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IN5L2RE#wasThisHelpful","RG8CTP9N3JM8M","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a lot of use, I'm happy with this 'hobo' style lunch sack. It's cute and well-constructed.Pros:- Very cute dots and style line- Thick, solid zipper- BUILT makes good products, so I trust them- The thick neoprene protects whats inside, and adds an element of insulation for both hot and hot foods- Easy to clean by just wiping with a wet towel, or rinsing in the sink- After almost two years of use, still going strong- Solid stitcheryCons:-  Strap stretches out under too much weight - so be careful with that. Mine hasn't broken yet, or stretched too far to be useful, but I'm mindful to use this for lighter items like food, and not as a quick carry-all for heavy things like books, or beverages- Seriously, not for the heavy stuff, unless you want to ruin the strap- Not big enough for use as a beach tote - towels alone would take up the entire space and look bulgyRecommendation:Great thickness, durability, style and usefulness for lighter items like food.

"I liked the taste of this bar, which surprised me, seeing all the reviews that said it tasted bad. Everyone has different taste buds, and different experiences with food bars. Suffice to say, this has a simple chocolate-strawberry flavor that I found appealing.It was soft without being overly chewy. Not crunchy - rather smooth.It didn't stick to the roof of my mouth. So, non-offensive in texture. It wasn't sweet like a candy bar, but it's not intended to be. Sometimes I think we expect too much of weight loss food bars. They're never going to be like a  Snickers!In any case, I've had far, far worse protein bars. I'd actually order and eat this particular flavor again. Seriously - so many bad bars out there: this was just a treat.Enough on the taste and texture. What about the nutrition?- Protein is the first ingredient, made mostly from whey and soy. There are 15 grams of protein in one bar. Good deal.- Malitol instead of sugar...in fact, there is no sugar listed in the Nutrition Facts.Again, I like that.- Gluten Free, if you care.-  There IS fat - 7 grams, of which 3 are saturated fat. There is no trans-fat. Keep in mind this is a protein bar, not a calorie-free one. I'd prefer less saturated fat. It's probably from the Casein (dairy protein).- 200 calories per bar, which is a reasonable for a protein bar.- 23 carbs per bar. So...not exactly low-carb!Recommendation:Not low carb, not low cal...but with 15 grams, it's very high in protein (by comparison, an egg is only 6 grams of protein). Some saturated fat (3 grams). Gluten free, and high in soy. I liked the taste, since I wasn't expecting candy-bar flavor. The texture is inoffensive, unlike Power Bars that stick to the top of your palette.  Keep in mind what your goals are...for a high protein bar that travels well and tastes good, go with this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W5BZP8CV21DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YDIP7A#wasThisHelpful","R3W5BZP8CV21DI","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't generally like sweet beverages, but with this packet, I could dilute it as much as I wanted, and it still carried the neat flavor of coconut and tropical fruit (called passionfuit on the label, but I honestly do not know what exactly passionfuit tastes like). I thought it was a unique and pleasant flavor. Lipton did a nice job with it this powdered Green Tea line.The best thing with this packet is that it travels very easily, and keeps well. I've held onto this little bag for a year and half, and just opened it today while at a hotel room. I wanted something to wake me up and start my day, without resorting to using the sometimes icky coffee packets left for travelers in hotel rooms.I was able to open the packet without scissors, which was nice. It has a little 'start' section for ripping it open. Scent DOES billow out when you pour it int a glass, so be aware if that sort of thing makes you sneeze.Tasted fresh, and the little clumpy parts smoothed right out when stirred slightly.Be aware the first ingredient is sugar (honey granules), plus there is sucralose and maltodextrin (more sweet enhancements). This isn't a health drink. :)It's a little unclear from the directions (in tiny font) exactly how much water to use with it. One packet makes two servings in a glass...but you can one one packet in a 17 ounce bottle of water. The key to remember is that if you put it ALL in one glass, it's pretty overpowering. I prefer the idea of using it in a water bottle and just sipping across over your day. Once in the bottle, you can also just shake it, without needing a spoon for stirring.In any case, the combo of sugar and green tea powder woke me up and put me in a good mood. I wasn't expecting a nice taste...and was happy to be wrong.Recommended for  traveling, or just being on the go.

"This lovely conditioner is a thick creamy white that smells terrific while using, and leaves my hair smooth and shiny. It works better than the more expensive non-lice conditioners I've been normally using.How I use this:With my long, wavy hair, I need about three solid pumps of product. I work it into my hair, starting with an emphasis on roots, working down my hair shaft, and then applying some to my root and scalp line. I massage it on and leave it on for about five minutes, and then rinse.The result:I don't seem to have a lot lot repellent-type scent once it dries. My husband detected a faintish lemony smell from my damp hair, and I couldn't detect any scent from my long ends, once dry. So, will the scent that remains be enough to drive away the biting insects that torment me? Mostly, I follow this up with the stronger and long-lasting repellent spray this company makes, and that does the trick.Honestly, what I love this conditioner for is the soothing, healing, and smoothing effect is has on me. My scalp itches less, and my hair becomes very soft and smooth. I love it, just as it is.Product notes:The bottle is a dark plastic that keeps the vast array of essential oils and potent healing ingredients from breaking down. The pump works smoothly.This container doesn't scream ""WE HAVE LICE HERE"" all over it - in fact, you'd really have to read through the entire small-font blurb to even find the word lice. So if fits in on my bath shelf without any stigma. Not that I have lice...but I do have major issues with no-see-ums. As it warms up here in North Carolina, I'm hopeful this conditioner will help either 1. keep the no-see-ums away, or 2. soothe my itchy and sore scalp after any bites I do get. If it works, I'll make sure to have gallons of this stuff, and leave it on for 20 minutes at a time, maybe using it as a body lotion and even shaving my legs with it. There's nothing in the ingredients list that cannot be left on.Ingredients:The bottle has different ingredients for soothing and protecting the scalp and hair, and for insect repelling. For the former, it's loaded with helpful ingredients - Emu Oil, Olive Fruit Oil, Argan Oil, Grapeseed oil, rice protein, panthenol, and glycerine. For repellent qualities, it contains lemongrass oil, lemon oil, geranium oil, and lemon-eucalyptus oil.That last one is probably the key - the CDC released information stating that lemon-eucalyptus works to keep biting bugs away. I trust information from the CDC (Center for Disease Control).OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:Use this conditioner for the wonderful way it leaves hair - shiny and smooth - and for the soothing effects it has on scalps that have been itchy and subsequently scratched to death. It's a super pleasant product, and one I intend to keep around. For the best repellent qualities, pair it with the repellent spray they produce that spritzes on hair AND body.Note: I received this conditioner as a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MXT04L6MDLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQU2DGW#wasThisHelpful","R21MXT04L6MDLL","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This whole line is innovative and pleasant to use, but between the repellent spray, the shampoo and the conditioner, this is the item I feel works the least well for actual repellent action. As a shampoo itself, it's pretty nice. Not excellent, like the conditioner and spray, but quite nice. And it has nice soothing ingredients to counter sore, itchy spots.The texture is think, and looks mostly clear with a whitish tinge to it.Pros:- Pretty scent that I love, but apparently insects don't: lemon oil, lemongrass oil, geranium oil and lemon-eucalyptus oil - the latter of which is recommeded by the CDC to keep biting insects away.- No one would ever know, seeing the bottle resting on my tub, that it's for something 'uncooth' like lice. The bottle and label look like something you'd find in the beauty section of of health store co-op. The label has an 'all natural' look to it.- Dark plastic keeps the volatile essential oils within fresh longer.- Smooth pump action.- My hair feels super clean and super smooth. I don't know how much of that is due to the line's conditioner that I used after, but the ingredients list is wholesome, with healing ingredients like Emu Oil (not vegetarian), aloe (the main ingredient), passionfruit oil, acai oil, rice bran oil and panthenol.Pros:- Formulation is a bit runny.- Not much lather action. This isn't actually a con, since lather itself does nothing to clean hair. I just found myself using more of it on my very long hair, just in case.- Keep in mind this ins't the shampoo to use when you actually HAVE lice. That would be a totally different product - I remember from my childhood that those had a tar-like substance. This is more of a scented repellent, and a way to soothe the scalp after lice has actually been removed after using the appropriate removal products. Again, not a bad thing here, but an important distinction to be aware of.After using both the shampoo and conditioner, I didn't find the scent as clear and apparent as I was expecting. My husband could barely smell the lemonyness in my hair. I think, scentwise, it smells great in the bottle, but dissipates quickly after using. Fair enough on a shampoo, which is a beauty product mainly to put on and quickly rinse out. For a repellent, I really prefer the spray made by this company, which lasts and lasts, besides working on BOTH hair and body.Note: I can see using all three products as a way to layer the scent, and would suggest the company add a soap and body lotion/oil to the line. I want to wreathe myself in this scent! I have a huge no-see-um reaction each time it warms up outside, and would rather not use toxic DEET all over my body/hair every year.Overall:- I like this shampoo a lot for it's healing qualities and nice scent, but won't rely on this alone for keeping bitey bugs away. The scent just doesn't last much after rinsing. While the spray and conditioner will become a permanent part of my summer-time bug arsenal, I'll be sticking to my regular cheapy shampoo once this is used up. However - if I had a sore, itching scalp, I'd go right out and get this again, since I think that's where its biggest benefit lies.Disclaimer: I received this shampoo as a review sample.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TRZHD5EP2UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQU2FU6#wasThisHelpful","R19TRZHD5EP2UZ","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without access to instructions in English, I had to experiment with using this whole leaf, high end tea. If done right, you get a delicious and soothing cup. A little bit of the leaves go a long way, and I really recommend using a clear glass with this tea, since drinking it is only 1/3 the point of the process in Presentation Teas.As far as I can glean from my side of the globe, Presentation Teas offer three parts to the user:1. Making the tea2. Watching the leaves absorb water and sink, creating a soothing, meditative 'water feature'  in your glass3. Actually sipping the tea and and relaxing into a new day/afternoonI believe the process is intended as a sort of Firewall to stress. You're forced to slow down and be with your thoughts for a reasonable break of time. I'm not even a spiritual person, but I can absolutely see the value in this. Buy something cheaper, in tea bags, if you don't have the time to make your own 'ritual' with this tea line.Pros:- Lovely scented green tea.- The Jasmine Tea is fragrant, and easy to drink for people new to the very layered and complex luxury green teas from Asia.- Elegant leaves that look great when served in clear glass, as depicted in the Amazon blurb.- Very nice black tin, with elegant Asian characters in a raised silver design. When all the tea is used up, I'll be happy to reuse the tin in my office.- The tin has a printed safety seal, and the inner bag is vacuum sealed.- Using the tea in a loose presentation format is a slow experience, but I think that's intentional. It takes a good 10-15 minutes for all of the  whole (uncut) leaves to fully saturate and settle. In the meantime, you get some time to meditate, warm your hands around the glass, look out the window and relax, or sit convivially with friends.Cons:- The nice characters are pretty to look at, but there aren't any instructions in English. The only English I can see on my tin are the words Jasmine Tea. If you know how to brew loose tea, not having instructions won't be an issue, but if you aren't familiar with using exact steeping times, the resultant tea is a bitter brew. I had to do a bit of experimentation, and I've used loose tea before. I recommend looking around the internet for exact details.- The inner bag is not resealable, so the tea will not stay as fresh as it could be, once opened.- The not tea to use for quick mornings. You kind of have to make a ritual of it. Of course, you could put the loose leaves in a tea ball, but I think with a tea of this quality, you're missing the point of the experience. This is a 'slow food' example (ie - the opposite of fast food).Note:Green tea is a source of L-Theanine, the compound that's supposed to decrease stress levels in the brain. Green tea also contains caffeine, so I think the idea is that the L-Theanine will slow down any caffeinated jitters, but not get you so sleepy that work is impossible. Green tea was probably the world's first 'Smart Drug"".Overall:Great tea in terms of taste and presentation. A nice introduction to using tea in a mindful way. Jasmine in particular is a good start for the newbie to break into the higher-end loose green teas, since Jasmine smooth and friendly-tasting, and not as complicatedly layered as other teas of this type. :)Received as a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWFROVWPXK3W5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO2BLBS#wasThisHelpful","RWFROVWPXK3W5","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing that surprised me: this book is a memoir. Based on the title and blurb, I was expecting more of a guide to handling adult-type conversations with young people.The memoir itself is a quick, light and easy read, and never goes very deep. There are amusing passages, and a couple of times I smiled to myself in appreciation. I do admire the level of honesty the author shares with her daughter, and agree that her parenting style is worth emulating. I just would have liked this to have been more of a how-to guide than a collection of essays loosely tied to the theme of 'hard questions'.There are tons of family-anecdote memoirs and mommy blogs already out there, so I'm not sure this collection is particularly new in the huge and thriving genre that's already out there.

"This is a very nice puzzle, with solid pieces that are cut well, good colors, and a design that isn't a pain to put together. I know some people like puzzles that are hard on purpose, but I prefer one that I can put together in an evening or two, for relaxation purposes. This one has lots of clues in the picture to let you know what part you're working on.The whimsical pieces are a novel idea that adds another dimensional element to the process of putting it together.Highly recommended if you use puzzles to relax your mind, instead of testing your mind. There's a difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YUFEN9AFIPIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Q3J99A#wasThisHelpful","R1YUFEN9AFIPIT","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For being cheaply made little cubby bins, I really like these. The double-thickness of cardboard has stood up to my abuse now for a couple of years without ripping, fraying, bending or falling open at the bottom.What else do I like?- Although sometimes the plastic handles pop out, I can snap them right back in.- It's surprisingly attractive for, in essence, being a cardboard box.- There were two in my pack, which look nice when set up next to each other.- They were easy to assemble (they arrive flat, as cardboard boxes tend to do).I've even moved a few times, using these to store my silver plate goblets and art supplies, and the bins are still going strong.I did think they were a bit expensive, for what they are. I think at this price point, there are options that might look better on open shelves. Also, mine came with one handle per box, which makes carrying the boxes a tad awkward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382DI6NMCQW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BM0KPV6#wasThisHelpful","R382DI6NMCQW6","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cream is rather thick, and has a slightly stick feel to it. I have to wash it off my hands after using. The scent is also a little bizarre: it's not a bad smell, so much as not really a pretty smell. Kind of like glue?I only need a little bit of this product to tame my frizzies, curls or hair ends...too much and it starts to make my hair look dull. The formulation does work for me, but it's simply not the hair product I reach for when I need serum or control. I don't find it elegant, texture-wise, it's too easy for me to end up using too much of this, and I don't like the smell.What's interesting is that Just For Me makes another hair milk that I like and use: the Curl Smoother. I'm sure different people will prefer one over the other.

"I like the scent and texture of this creamy white hair 'milk'. When I add it to my dry hair, it tames down the frizzies without making it sticky or greasy-looking. I can use this on both straight hair days and curly hair days.This isn't just for children - I like it just as well on my adult hair. For reference, I have dark Caucasian hair of middle texture and thickness, with a tendency for waviness.How I use it on dry hair:1. I pour a dollop into my hands, and rub my hands together.2. Starting at the ends, I work it into my hair and then work it up the hair shaft. I don't put much on top of my head. I really concentrate on the ends, and on the shorter hair pieces around my face.3. On curly hair days, I scrunch the milk into my hair.4. On straight hair days, I just smooth it around sections of my hair in pieces.I'm not thrilled with using this on wet hair - it doesn't seem to do much of anything when used that way, unless I scrunch it in and then strictly leave my hair alone when dry: any further styling removes any benefit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJBX80ACB2RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040H00PE#wasThisHelpful","R3KJBX80ACB2RK","A55LS2HWPQB0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A55LS2HWPQB0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As of this review this queen sized mattress costs $253.96 which I think is a fair price though I would not want to pay anymore for it.  It came in a big, tight roll inside a long, cardboard box.  I didn't know a mattress could get rolled up like that - much like you would roll up a sleeping bag.  And it was held in a tight roll by several layers of heavy-duty plastic so be careful when using scissors or a knife to cut off the plastic that you don't accidentally cut the mattress material.  We took the unwrapped mattress roll upstairs and set it on the box springs and unwrapped it there.  It quickly unrolls itself and then it is easy to adjust on the box springs.It fit our queen size box springs perfectly and we compared it to the queen sized mattress that it was replacing and both were exactly the same size.  However, the Classic Brands mattress only has one side up (the pillowtop side) and the other side is a different color and material and not meant to be slept on, so you will not be able to flip this mattress every few months or so like other mattresses.  The pillowtop adds some cush to the mattress and makes it more comfortable.  The material appears to be fairly durable, but I wouldn't expect it to last for years and years.  Although we have used this mattress to replace our nearly 20 year old former queen sized mattress, I think it would be better to use on a bed in a guest bedroom since it can't be flipped and might eventually sag.  There are no handles on the side to move the mattress but it's not too terribly heavy.We slept on it all last night without adding an extra mattress topper (foam) and it was comfortable enough, though this morning I put a foam mattress topper on it because I really like how comfortable they make any bed.  Overall, I think this is a good mattress for the money, but I haven't had it long enough to see how it holds up over time therefore only 4 stars for now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBB45PLCRPCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016ONGQE0#wasThisHelpful","R1VBB45PLCRPCM","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, of all the tanning solutions, sprays, creams, etc....that I have tried I find this one works the best.  I get a nice, even realistic-looking tan and the only orangish areas are on the bony parts of my body (ankle bones, tops of my feet) where I neglected to wipe the tanning mousse off. So, overall it tans well and lasts me about a week before I notice it fading away.  I can even shave my legs and still keep my tan.Other reviewers have very well described in detail the application process (which should be followed exactly for a positive result), so I won't waste mine or your time talking about it.  Though the XEN-TAN Mousse is a bit pricey I think it delivers a good tan for the money.  I've tried a lot of other tanning products and some worked well but others turned me orange or didn't last past the next shower.  This one seems to hold for a while which is good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4L2EHBI6WF7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OSADQE#wasThisHelpful","R4L2EHBI6WF7T","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I guess I'm just spoiled at how easy the ketone test strips are to use.  All you have to do is pee on them, but this ketone tester is a lot more involved and I'm not really sure it's any more accurate than the strips.  Basically, when I was using the strips I just wanted to know if I was finally burning fat or not and they told me what my fat burning situation was, and for less money.  This disposable Breath Ketone Test works if you follow all the steps very carefully.  I tried too, but I don't know for sure.  I never did reach the fat burning stage according to it.  But, honestly, I really didn't totally cut out carbs so I'm not surprised.  The only times I ever tested positive for fat burn was when I was on the Atkins diet and followed it to a tee.

I'm not pregnant, nor is my husband, but these are very good for all people not just those who are pregnant.

"I have longed to take CoQ10 but when I see it for sale in regular stores it's just out of my price range.  I don't know what they are selling this for but when I was given the opportunity to review it I took it.  I was looking at the list of ingredients and noticed it has black pepper in it.  I can only guess that the peperin (sp?) is needed to bind with the CoQ10 to pull it into the bloodstream.  I add freshly ground pepper to my Golden Paste that I make at home for the same reason.  (Google ""Golden Paste"" and you will find something wonderful).I am at the age where I need all the anti-oxidants I can get and anything that will help with heart health is wanted. As another reviewer noted, I can't possibly eat enough CoQ10 in my food to get what one of these pills will easily deliver. And these pills (softgels) are very easy to swallow since they are nice and small and slick.  I feel as one grows older, if such supplements are available and found to be helpful then they should be used.  I can't say I can ""feel"" any improvement physically, but I rarely notice an actual physical feeling of improvement with most of the supplements I take.

"This stuff is great for those times when you are sick.  I mean sick with a stomach bug including vomiting and diarrhea and all that loveliness involved.  This will greatly help replace lost fluids and electrolytes that are lost through the above activities. I drank this when I got food poisoning and was sick (with the above activities) for 4 days.  It helped me to not dehydrate away and eased my suffering somewhat but I could only drink it right after tossing my cookies or I'd be tossing it too.I received the dry powder which I think is even better than the pre-mixed liquid.  If you store the dry Pedialyte in a dry, dark and cool place it should last for months, possibly years before losing it's effectiveness.

However, I will say that I frequently get a sore shoulder from playing a lot of tennis and I have not noticed my shoulder being sore in the time I have been taking this supplement.  I understand that Astaxanthin is supposedly a powerful anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory so I think that is a good combination.  This is the first time I've ever taken Astaxanthin and so far no bad reaction but I'm not allergic to shellfish either.

"Our chihuahua has always had a bad breath problem even shortly after getting her teeth cleaned about 5 months ago.  I feed her dry dog food almost exclusively and she gets a lot of dog biscuits to help keep her teeth clean.  The vet who cleaned her teeth said chihuahuas just get gunk build up much faster on their teeth than do larger dogs - hence the reason I opted to try out these breath drops.I've been putting about two squirts in her water dish at every re-fill, and though I have not intentionally gotten my nose near her face or mouth to test for how much funk she is emitting, I have not noticed it being very bad.  I think the drops are helping to a certain extent.  Apparently the taste of the water is still alright after spraying some breath drops into it since she drinks it just fine and she has always been a particular beast when it comes to flavors.  I haven't run out of the drops yet and I change out the water at least once each day.

"This is really quite a nice cat tree. However, YOU MUST BUILD IT FROM THE TOP DOWN!!!.  If you build it from the bottom up like we did the first time, you get to the top tier board and there is no way to screw it down and it will be very loose and not cat-useable.  We had built it completely and got to the last step of putting on the top board and realized we would have to disassemble it and build it from the top tier down which was not an easy task because we had to keep reversing everything.  The included instructions have no writing on them whatsoever, and is just a picture diagram of the cat tree with all the parts numbered and what piece goes where.  Nothing was mentioned about the order of assembly.  So, for something that should be easy to assemble turned out to be a project for me and my husband with several curse words and insults delivered to each other.The finished product however, is quite a nice thing.  It looks really cool and is coated in a creamy colored carpet.  All the poles have a rope-like material wrapped around them which is great for cats to claw on.  Our chihuahua immediately discovered the cat resting pouch (which you can't really see in the picture) and made herself at home.  I think she might be using this more than our cat.  I hope to get a picture of both of them on it at the same time.  Overall, I really do like this cat tree.  It's not overly big and we have it against a portion of our wall in our bedroom.  The various things offered to a cat (or chihuahua) to do are numerous.  It's very steady and doesn't seem to want to tilt one way or the other and we have it sitting on carpet. The materials used seem good - the hard pieces are made from press board and the carpet though not super great, should last a while before turning into shreds.I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't such a beast to rebuild.  The instructions should have made that clear.  If the instructions had been drawn in a way to reflect the order of building it it would have been a piece of cake since all you need is an Allen wrench which is included.  If you start from the top down it won't be very difficult - just re-orienting the parts was kind of a mental exercise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNYSI5XE4YVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY250YC#wasThisHelpful","RNYSI5XE4YVN","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I bit a bite off of one and it tasted like a regular dog biscuit - grainy, crunchy with a bitter back taste so I wasn't too fond of it.  It tasted a lot like Milk Bone dog biscuits.  I often taste the pet food for myself when doing reviews in order to really be more accurate about the flavor and texture of the products mine and anyone else's pets might be eating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJF0KG6OAFWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062LJ1O2#wasThisHelpful","RPJF0KG6OAFWM","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as I can tell, these are high quality vitamin C capsules.  According to the info sheet, these are non GMO because the vitamin C is derived from non-GMO corn grown in Scotland.  Whether that's actually true or not, I don't know but I'll take their word for it.  Each capsule contains 1000mg vitamin C, 25mg Rose Hips and 25 mg Citrus Bioflavonoid Peel Complex.  The label on the front of the bottle says there's 250 capsules inside, but the lid has a red sticker saying there's 50 bonus capsules so I guess there's 300 in a new bottle.

"Chicken is listed as the first ingredient and I always want to see a meat listed as the first ingredient because it means it's the most plentiful ingredient in the dog food.  However, corn meal is the second ingredient and I'm not too fond of corn meal in my dog's food, but the rest of the ingredients look good and there are no chemicals or preservatives that I see on the list of ingredients.  I don't have a puppy right now, but I wanted to try this food on my mother's little rescue dog who appears to me, to be underweight.  I want her to eat some puppy food because of the higher calorie content and hopefully she will begin to put on some more weight.  She already loves this food (she loves all the food I've given her since I don't think she got enough to eat before) and really wolfs it down.  I'm happy with this food.

My favorite was the regular milk chocolate - super creamy and good.  The others were similar to other chocolates I've eaten such as Hershey's dark blend, and many other more fancy chocolates that you can easily buy at a grocery store.  But, these are very good, and each little chocolate is individually wrapped in a cool-looking wrapper.  The glass jar and lid is o.k. and can be re-purposed for something else after all the chocolates are gone.

"This mold worked better than I expected it too.  I like to make handmade soaps and I poured some cold-processed white soap batter into these and let them sit in the freezer for a couple of hours.  They un-molded nicely with a lot of snowflake detail.  I was kind of expecting them to stick or break or not have much design but I was wrong on all counts.  I will be buying a couple more of these to make soaps to give away this Christmas.  The bars (soap snowflakes) after removal weigh approximately 3.23 ounces each so they make a good sized bar.  I won't be using this mold for hot processed since the mold is very flimsy and will collapse if I press thicker batter into it.

I always just used a butter knife for icing a cake........BUT NOT ANYMORE!!!  This thing is great!!  The handle is higher than the blade and keeps your knuckles from dragging through the icing.

"I pour my ""Seeds of Beauty"" into a tall glass of cold filtered water and stir.  Then if I let it sit long enough all of it completely dissolves into the water.  The flavor is a weak pineapple and is alright, but not wonderful.  As far as making my skin, hair and nails appear in healthier condition I can't really attest to that.  But, I'm not saying this product won't help with that - it just takes a LONG time to see results.  I only have 30 days with which to try out the product and review it so that is not enough time to tell if my skin, hair and nails are getting better or not.  I think after about 6 months to a year I would see some results.I think that if you are patient, and drink this daily, you should see some improvement in those areas it is supposed to help with.  The flavor is tolerable and it will make you drink more water daily which is always good for your skin and other bodily functions.

"I like this concealer/cover stick, but I don't like it well enough to pay $28.00 for it.  I'll keep using my other, much less expensive brands that seem to do basically the same thing as this one.  The lipstick style container is attractive, and it seems to operate smoothly.  The make-up stick itself is very easy to apply.  I received the 'Opal"" tinted stick and though I am Caucasian, I am not as white as a red-head.  My skin is fair in complexion but the opal color was a little bit darker than I normally would use.  Trying to accurately determine the color after it has been applied while inside under artificial lighting is impossible so I went outside with my mirror and looked at the color in the light of day.  It was an overcast day and perfect for seeing colors as they really are.  The tint was good, but I could still see a tinge of orange where I had applied it a little thicker to cover my dark circles.  I have always had really dark circles under my eyes all my life (my brother too) so it is obviously a genetic thing and not due to being sick or tired.  Also, after wearing it for several hours I still saw some tiny creases where the make-up separated at the inner corners of my eyes near my nose.I will still use this stick, but honestly, I just can't see paying nearly 30 dollars for it.  Maybe $7 - 10, but no more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GOU7XIE2HAHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW6ZTW6#wasThisHelpful","R3GOU7XIE2HAHT","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's a lot of reviews already about this product.  I wavered for a good while about deciding if I wanted to accept this Cloudbook for review and now kind of wish I hadn't.  As far as I'm concerned, the Cloudbook is like a merging of a laptop and a chromebook with neither giving the features that are special to each one.  As far as it being a computer, it runs on Windows 10 of which I have great suspicions and doubts.  If you remember, I believe most everyone received an offer for a free download of Windows 10 as an upgrade from whatever Windows program they were currently using.  I have read from several sources that it was offered only as a way of installing NSA spyware on your computer.  We are being watched and monitored at every turn.  If you don't believe me, next time you are driving take a look at all the cameras on poles along the roads and highways and tell me we aren't being surveilled.  Smartphones, smart TV's, smart refrigerators, dryers and washing machines are simply ways of letting TPTB know what we are doing at all times.  How many loads of clothes you washed, what you are doing in your bedroom and on and on.  So, what does all this have to do with this little and cute computer?  It has Windows 10 installed.If you are o.k. with that then overall it's not a bad machine.  I really miss having a disk drive to load my own personal programs and don't like having to download stuff from the internet via the app store or some other internet source.  And since it is a computer but has very little space for storage, you have to have an anti-virus program.  It comes with one but it's only good for 30 days and you have to purchase it or get another one.  Most of your stuff will be stored in the Cloud (like a chromebook) unless you opt for a Sandisk or external hard drive.  And if you buy an external hard drive for more storage why not get a regular computer instead that has more bells and whistles and possibly a disk drive?It looks like a chromebook and I have had to put a label on it to distinguish it from mine and my kids chromebooks.  I'm having a hard time getting used to Windows 10 and it takes a long time to finally get on the internet.  I have taped a piece of paper over the camera lens staring me in the face - call me paranoid if you wish but I don't like people in my house uninvited. The ""shift"" key is way too small and I'm always missing it.As far as specs go they're listed on the main page but here they are again for your convenience:  11.6"" HD Widescreen ComfyView LED-backlit Display (1366 x 768 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio).  Intel Celeron N3050 Dual-Core Processor 1.6GHz with Intel Burst Technology up to 2.16GHz.  Windows 10  Intel HD Graphics  2GB of DDR3L Onboard Memory.  32GB Internal Storage  Secure Digital (SD) card reader.  802.11ac WiFi (Dual-Band 2.4GHz and 5GHz).  Bluetooth 4.0  Webcam (640 x 480)  High-definition audio support.  Two Built-in Stereo Speakers.  1 - USB 3.0 port  1 - USB 2.0 port  1 - HDMI Port with HDCP support.

Up to 8 hours of battery life (Video Playback).  2.54 lbs. | 1.15kg (system unit only).If you are already using Windows 10 then it should be easy to navigate, but I feel as if I'm learning a whole new OS though I use Windows 8 on my other laptop.  It only detected two of my Bluetooth devices and I have several. If you want Word processing you must redeem your card number inside the box before a certain date or else it expires.  And it's all cloud based so your data is out there and not in your pc safe and sound.I will modify this review as needed, but I have not used this computer since a few days ago and probably will not be using it much at all.  I like my chromebook better for web surfing, and it doesn't require an anti-virus program because it's totally cloud based but I never use the cloud.  I store the stuff I want on my old desktop or other laptop.

"As of this review this watch costs $29.99.  I have worn it for only a couple of days but I wore it continuously except to take it off at bedtime.  I found it to be comfortable and was not bothered by it.  I often have to take watches and bracelets off after a while because they begin to irritate me for whatever reasons, but this watch was easy to wear.  Though it says it can be adjusted  for size I can't figure out how to adjust it so if you have thick wrists it might not do.  I have slender wrists and the band gave me about 1/4th inch of play.  The instructions that come with the watch do not tell how to adjust the band and I think it's non-adjustable.  They do tell you how to set the date though this watch doesn't come with a date window.The watch itself is basically made out of green plastic.  It says it ""rubberized"" but if so, only minimally because I couldn't really detect any rubber.  The strap did not pinch my skin or snag any arm hairs.  The face is large and I could easily read the time without my glasses.  I didn't have to set the time because it came set already to my time zone.  It's not waterproof so I try not to get it wet.  It really looks just as pictured and is a nice deep olive green.  It's kind of an army-ish color and with some splashes of brown and beige it would be perfect camo.I like this watch so far but as of yet it's too early to tell how long it will last and when it will need a battery change.

"The first two ingredients are water and mineral oil.  Baby oil is mineral oil.  It is a very inexpensive oil and does not sink into your skin as a natural emollient would such as cocoa butter, shea butter or coconut oil.  It does contain a little glycerin and less jojoba seed oil, but it also includes alcohol, aluminum chlorohydrate and other chemicals.Personally, I would keep my money and buy something that delivered more natural (or preferably all natural) ingredients and no mineral oil.  But it does make your hands smoother for a while and has no smell that I can detect.  It's made in Switzerland but that doesn't do anything for me as far as making me think that it's a superior product.

She's been using this teething gel by rubbing it on his gums and after about 10 or so minutes he quietens down and appears to no longer hurt.

"This works o.k. for a fake tan, and does look like you've gotten some time in the sun, but it's a lot of work and time to apply. Mine came with a mitt for review purposes, but I understand that a mitt is not included when you buy the Xen-Tan. However, it wasn't all that easy to use and I think just using a plastic glove and a soft washcloth will do just as well.I applied this thoroughly over my freshly showered bod using small circular motions as instructed in the directions. That took a while and I was working up a sweat just doing that, which caused me to have to re-apply in some spots. I couldn't do my back but I was able to smear enough on it so it was actually a good indicator of how much Xen-Tan stayed on after showering later on. I noticed I did look noticeably darker after applying the Xen-Tan. I wore loose clothing for the rest of the day and actually did not shower again until the next morning so I certainly left it on for the minimum 3 hours before showering.When I got into the shower I saw the water run dark-ish down the drain and it had to be the Xen-Tan. I checked my back in the mirror and saw where some of the Xen-Tan had not washed off, but it was a lot lighter than when I initially applied it. I'm not really sure I'd want to spend $65.00 to work that hard, and not get much to show for it. I want to mention, that yesterday when I first applied the Xen-Tan, it felt sticky and I felt sticky for about an hour until it began to dry. Also, when I washed my hands any water that dribbled down my arms erased the Xen-Tan and I had to re-apply it. It doesn't tell you that water will erase the tan shortly after applying.  And be real careful with it on your feet because it will look like you just walked through red clay mud if you don't smear it around well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31QPZBJNH7P0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIQALAC#wasThisHelpful","R31QPZBJNH7P0Y","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dogs really love this food.  I think it may be the ocean fish meal (2nd ingredient) that they crave more than the bison which is listed as the 1st ingredient.  But whatever, if it gets them to eat dry easily than it's all good to me.  I've fed them other Solid Gold dry dog food flavors and they like all of them.  It seems that they all contain natural ingredients such as meats, vegetables, fruits, vitamins and minerals and I can't find any long chemically named ingredients.  I don't know if the ingredients are non-GMO as it doesn't say that on the package so I'll assume that at least some of them are GMO products.My dogs are small but they don't have any problems crunching up and eating the large breed dry dog food.  If your dog has weak or bad teeth, I would get the smaller sized food though.

"The first three ingredients are oatmeal, pearled barley and peas.  Ocean fish meal is not listed until ingredient #4.  I always want meat or fish to be the first ingredient.  That said, I still think this is a quality dog food at a reasonable price.  As of this review it costs $12.99 for a 4 pound bag.  The other ingredients are pretty good being vegetables, fruit and vitamins and minerals.  My dogs ate this with no problems and they obviously liked it. Since this dry dog food is aimed towards medium/large, less active adult/senior dogs the calorie content is listed as 345 calories/cup.  I'm not a dog food expert but those seem like a balanced amount for less active or aging dogs.  Hopefully they will not gain weight eating this.I think my dogs smelled and tasted the fish.  Dogs simply love fish and even if it's listed as the 4th ingredient they still ate it with no qualms.  I would feel alright buying  this food for my dogs even though meat is not a first ingredient because the entire ingredients list looks healthy and I didn't read any long chemically sounding ingredients.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ46DM4ESBG6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9DRRYK#wasThisHelpful","RJ46DM4ESBG6B","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband really liked the applicator since he's the one in charge of applying flea medication on our dog's backs.  He usually gets more on his hands than on the dogs.  The applicator helped a lot with that.  We haven't had much of a flea problems since our dogs have always been on some sort of flea/tick preventative.  One of our dogs is pure white so I can easily spot a flea running through her hair coat and so far she has shown no sign of fleas since using this flea preventative.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars on such products is because I'm not 100% sure the chemicals are not harmful to the dogs in some way, but from experience, fleas can be a devastatingly horrific problem if not controlled.  So, I use the preventative despite my concerns about potential toxicity to the dog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TST2ENFVX1XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6MTG9O#wasThisHelpful","R3TST2ENFVX1XB","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My niece recently had another baby and she was concerned about her milk flow since she had some trouble with that with her last baby.  When I was offered this to try I thought of her.  She's been using it for about 3 weeks now and though at first she was not particularly fond of the taste, she has now developed a strong liking for it AND she has noticed a definite improvement in her milk flow since last time - and that's what it's all about.  She mixes it up with fruit juice and sometimes adds some honey to it, and says it tastes better.  She always had a sweet tooth so the sugar content doesn't bother her (9 grams/packet).I'm happy this is helping her and she says she will be buying some when this runs low.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QEKUF7ILDFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O96X4QI#wasThisHelpful","R39QEKUF7ILDFZ","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works o.k. for a fake tan, and does look like you've gotten some time in the sun, but it's a lot of work and time to apply.  Mine came with a mitt for review purposes, but I understand that a mitt is not included when you buy the Xen-Tan.  However, it wasn't all that easy to use and I think just using a plastic glove and a soft washcloth will do just as well.I applied this thoroughly over my freshly showered bod using small circular motions as instructed in the directions.  That took a while and I was working up a sweat just doing that, which caused me to have to re-apply in some spots.  I couldn't do my back but I was able to smear enough on it so it was actually a good indicator of how much Xen-Tan stayed on after showering later on.  I noticed I did look noticeably darker after applying the Xen-Tan.  I wore loose clothing for the rest of the day and actually did not shower again until the next morning so I certainly left it on for the minimum 3 hours before showering.When I got into the shower I saw the water run dark-ish down the drain and it had to be the Xen-Tan.  I checked my back in the mirror and saw where some of the Xen-Tan had not washed off, but it was a lot lighter than when I initially applied it.  I'm not really sure I'd want to spend  $65.00 to work that hard, and not get much to show for it.  I want to mention, that yesterday when I first applied the Xen-Tan, it felt sticky and I felt sticky for about an hour until it began to dry.  Also, when I washed my hands any water that dribbled down my arms erased the Xen-Tan and I had to re-apply it.  It doesn't tell you that water will erase the tan shortly after applying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ELFLOWJ3W4D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CL2HK#wasThisHelpful","R1ELFLOWJ3W4D6","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used probably all the various brands of topical flea treatment over the years on my pets, and they all seemed to work just fine. We have had too, on occasion, when visiting relatives in S. Georgia, bathe and re-treat our dogs again upon returning home since the fleas in that part of the country can be ferocious. But for our fenced-in, suburban yard, one treatment for each dog will keep them flea free easily for a month. No other dogs can enter our yard to bring in fleas, but I have seen cats enjoying themselves hanging out near the bird bath.This product is easy to use and I always apply it after they have been bathed and are fully dry. So far our two dogs have not experienced any bad reaction to it and I can honestly say that I rarely ever find a flea on them anymore. I buy this stuff several boxes at a time because I never want to run out. I remember how horrible it used to be when the house would get infested with fleas and our animals scratching all the time. I never want to ever have to go through that again and using this type of product is such a loving thing to do for your dog(s). It's cruel to let them scratch and scratch and scratch from fleas. I used to work for a vet years ago before topical flea products were invented and I actually saw some super serious flea swarming on some dogs - one died anyway from loss of blood due to extreme flea bites though I tried my best to save him by rinsing him for a long time with warm water.  The water ran off blood red down the drain. But he died because the owners had waited too long and there was nothing we could do. I will never forget that dog. So anyway, needless to say I use this product and have used other products to keep my dogs flea free.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVWAP76P9EOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWP1QIG#wasThisHelpful","ROVWAP76P9EOG","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 19 year old cat loves this food.  As a matter of fact, she now demands this food by sitting near her dish (which is full of dry food) and meowing loudly at me.  I know what she wants and of course, I cave.  I normally feed her dry just to keep her teeth healthy, and they are.  My previous 18 year old cat was fed almost exclusively canned cat food and her teeth were in bad shape by the time she got really old, so with this food I feed it to my cat only intermittently as a special treat.  I feed her top quality dry so she eats a good diet, but I still like to indulge her a little an show me a cat that won't like canned food with chicken listed as the first ingredient, followed by chicken broth and then chicken liver.  I scanned the ingredients list and everything looks pretty good. It's got vitamins and minerals plus taurine for their eyes.Keeping a few cans of canned pet food is a good idea too in case you run out of dry food.  You can mix this with dry food and I will be doing that soon.  These cans should keep for a long time if stored in a dry, cool place.  Overall, I can find nothing to merit a lower star rating.  This food is easily eaten by my beautiful old kitty cat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4FCWZGHOHUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEIQ0LO#wasThisHelpful","R3K4FCWZGHOHUI","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are small, sweet and dissolve almost immediately.  I don't see how a baby could possibly choke on them since they literally turn to solution when placed in the mouth or under the tongue.  I think babies will like the sweet flavor and calm soothing these small tablets will deliver. I wish I had these when my babies were teething.  Adults can also use these to soothe sore gums but they have to take a lot more of them.  I thought these tasted great too, not too sweet but gently sweet.

"This is the second book in a series.  The first book, ""The Iron Trial"" was really good.  I ordered it after I realized I had gotten the second book in a series and I really am tired of trying to jump into series without reading preceding books. I loved The Iron Trial and really liked ""The Copper Gauntlet"".  I think someone else said what I had been thinking and that was I wish more time had been spent at the Magisterium and less time outside in the real world, though it was still fun to read.  The school fascinates me and and I hope more exploring of it is done in the following books.I really can't add much that hasn't already been said.  When I review books that already have nearly 100 reviews there's not much I can say but if I liked it or not.  I liked it and will buy, ""The Cosmos Blade"" when it's ready.  These are similar sort of, to the Harry Potter series, but different also.  Callum and his very close friends, Aaron, Tamara and his wolf, Havoc have some stressful, exciting and dangerous events to get through and accomplish.  These characters are very well developed and I feel I know each one on a personal level.  All the characters are well developed and the writing flows smoothly.I had to fight with my 13 year old over this book as we both were reading it at the same time.  I give it 4 stars since I can't help but see things from an adult's perspective, but my kid said 5 all the way.  Therefore, 5 stars since it was written for that age group and not mine.  I still liked it a lot though and it's fun for me to get excited about magic school.  While reading the first book in the Harry Potter series I really felt like a kid all excited about going to Hogwarts.  This book (especially the 1st book) gave me much the same feeling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3AYD0IZ1VTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545522285#wasThisHelpful","R3L3AYD0IZ1VTM","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quite a nice curling iron.  It seems to be well constructed and is an attractive appliance.  The colors are white with copper-ish colored trim.  I expect the copper color to definitely wear off with frequent use, but for starts it's the loveliest curling iron I've ever seen.  And I guess it should be for $185.00.  I have several curling irons and brushes stuffed under my bathroom sink right now and none of them compare to this one.  The clip that holds hair against the heated barrel is strong and the clip must be opened to release hair once it's been curled.  You will not be able to easily pull it out without losing some hair so be sure to open it again.The various 5 heat settings are really nice to have and are very easy to set.  I don't like it very hot but my daughter has very tough hair and needs to use the highest heat setting.  The T3 Micro Twirl Convertible Curling Iron comes (I believe because it's not quite super clear) with a straight 1.25 barrel but you can purchase different sizes of barrels.It heats up fast and they include a black pad to rest the hot barrel on when you lay it down on your bathroom countertop.  I think that was a very nice extra since it could possibly damage it if it was really hot.  The tip of the barrel does not heat up so you can hold it with your bare fingers if you need too.  Still be careful though, because you have less than an inch of ""cool tip"" to hold onto.  The cord is nice an long and should give you plenty of room to work especially if you only have one electrical outlet and have to share the counter space with someone.  And the cord swivels from the end so getting your cord all curled up shouldn't be a problem.  It also has a 1-hour automatic shut off (which I admit, I haven't tested yet).It's got a nice weight too.  It might get your arm tired for a while until you get used to it.  The instructions are well written with good diagrams so even if you don't read English you can still understand it, but then I guess you won't understand this review lol. I expect this curling iron to last me for YEARS since it's so pricey.  Hopefully, I will never have to purchase another one.  I like this curling iron a LOT but am only giving it 4 stars for now.  I have to give something like this some time to see how it holds up and then I will come back and update this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N644MDCU1Z9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R3FO92#wasThisHelpful","R2N644MDCU1Z9S","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't know what's in it that's causing this acrid, chemical smell, but it comes through in the taste too.  I tasted it anyway and I could taste the chemical.

"I find this book to be almost perfect.  It is absolutely loaded with truly wonderful and mouth-watering recipes, detailed and illustrated instructions and lots of ""good to know"" information.  The color pictures are all full page and are quite beautiful.  I've been doing a lot of what's in this book for several years so I already know quite a bit about food preservation.  Making your own handmade soap is discussed with a very good recipe for shaving soap. I ran the ingredients through a lye calculator and her amounts are correct and the soap itself is of a very good quality.  In the section on cold process soap making she describes the steps very well, and the reasons for the goggles, gloves and long sleeves (protection from accidentally getting active lye on your skin though it happens to me a lot and it's not that bad - just rinse with tap water if you feel a sting.  Never use vinegar to get a lye spill off yourself as that will only make it worse but you can use the vinegar for kitchen clean-up. You really don't want to get it in your eyes and I always wear eye protection when working with lye.)  There are three very good soap recipes included in the book but you can easily google some good soap recipes and run them through a lye calculator to see if they are good or not. I make up my own soap recipes - it's that easy!I mean really, this is a great book.  It delves into water bath and pressure canning which I do a lot of.  It's all very good information.  I just wish she had included a few pages on dehydration of foods for long term storage.  I have done a lot of that and I feel it is an extremely efficient and safe way to store vegetables and fruit for extended periods of time.  It's even easier than canning.  So that is why I deducted one star.  Other than that, this book is just loaded with all sorts of great information, it's easy and enjoyable to read, and I'm really glad I got the opportunity to read and review it.  It's one of those books that every home should have because there is so much in it that applies to home life.  For instance, you find that your carpet is smelling not so fresh.  You grab the book and voila!  There is a great and easy recipe for carpet freshener that really sounds delightful.  If I didn't have all hardwoods I'd be making it right now!Maybe later on, if this book gets revised, a section on how to use a dehydrator and vacuum sealer will be included.  As I stated before, I really feel food dehydration is of paramount importance if you are wanting to store food for longer periods of time and especially if you are short on storage space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SI0H2GO0OKXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570619913#wasThisHelpful","R1SI0H2GO0OKXN","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I play classical guitar and frequently have to give performances.  I have taken beta-blockers (a musician's dream come true!) on some occasions to help with my nerves because they allow me to play and still keep a clear head.  But the next day I usually have a bad headache from them (I don't drink so it's not alcohol induced lol!). So, I thought I would give the Jarrow Formulas PS-PA Syngergy capsules a try to see if they helped ease the nervous jitters of performance.  Well, I didn't have an actual performance, but I'm a member of a musical group that meets regularly and it can get very stressful.  I started taking these about 4 days prior to the meeting and I did notice I had a calmer feel, and I was able to maintain focus on the music and not get flustered if I lost my place or made mistakes.  It's very complicated music and I am too hard on myself concerning musical errors.  I don't know if I will purchase any of this since it's kind of pricey (as of this review it costs $30.79 for 90 capsules) and musician don't usually make squat as far as money goes.

I know from personal experience - when I was a kid I had a sleepover and my friend totally peed the bed during the night.

"These are great disposable razors, especially for the price.  As of this review they cost $9.97 with prime membership.  The three blades glide nicely over skin thanks to the slick strip and they leave the skin hairless- - baby butt hairless.  My husband shaves his face with them and I use them for my legs and armpits.  The handle fits nicely into your hand and the grip is very secure - it doesn't slip out of your grip like the cheap pink razors.

"I'm in my 50's and still get zits between my eyes and on my chin.  I'm very concerned about anything I put on my skin drying it out and I have to use a lot of natural oils and butters to keep my skin soft.  I was surprised that the Benzac Acne didn't seem to dry my skin and was very easy to apply.  It's kind of like a lotion - thin and creamy and not harsh to my skin.

"I think this is really very convenient to carry and to use.  As far as it's accuracy I think it does a very good job though other reviewers have had some problems with that so please take that into consideration about purchasing this.  That said, it seems to be a well constructed device and and is easy to use.  Mine came with the following components:2 containers of test strips (25 each)lancing deviceglucose meterclear cap for alternate site testing2 packs of lancets (25 each)1 bottle of control solution1 USB charging cableA very durable travel caseQuality instructionsBecause it has Bluetooth capability, it works with most mobile devices so that you can download your reading whenever you want too.  It stores your data as well so you can download all of it at once at a later time.  The size is so nice and small and everything fits into the travel pouch very neatly and is readily accessible when you need to use it.  As of now, the cost of this device (as of this review) with all it's extra components is $29.95 with Prime, and that to me, is an incredibly good price, especially since you get all the test strips, lancets, control, etc... as well.Overall - I have nothing negative whatsoever to say about this device.

"This is pretty good dog food for the small, overweight dog.  Both my dogs are small but only one is showing the propensity to gain weight so I have to be careful about what she eats.  She likes this dog food fine and I like that chicken is listed as the first ingredient.  I haven't noticed her going to the bathroom (#2) any more than usual, though this dog food is higher in fiber than the regular dry dog foods.  The reason I mention that is because years ago we had a beagle who was obviously putting on the pounds so we fed him a dry dog food made to help dogs get their weight under control.  Well, he pooped so much fiber out that my husband had to go and rake it all into the woods every evening when he got home from work.  So, we didn't continue with that anymore when the bag was empty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8DMU47XFD3F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRK742#wasThisHelpful","R8DMU47XFD3F2","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a problem out in my garden with some neighborhood cats using it for their litter box. I have sprinkled this stuff around and feel pretty much that it is o.k. to use since all the ingredients are natural.  I didn't read any chemical sounding ingredients at all and I did have 2 years of college chemistry so I should know one when I see one.  It has a lot of natural oils (can't remember exactly now but I do recall thinking how normal and natural they were).  I still see the cats jumping over my fence but only one bed is still being dumped in.  I guess I should sprinkle some more Havahart in it.I also am currently using this indoors to hopefully keep my two small dogs from peeing on a new carpet we put under our dining room table.  We had the old carpet removed and flooring installed and the dogs used to pee on the carpet in there.  I have put several small piles of the Havahart granular repellent on folded paper towels and placed them in the sweet spots the dogs like to use the most.  I have found one wet spot on the carpet but it didn't smell like pee......I think someone might have just spilled some water on it but I'll keep checking to see if the dogs are still going in there.  So, so far, I really don't know that well how good this stuff is working but if I think I notice a change or something I will update this review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3GQLM4HW2EF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5TRG5Q#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3GQLM4HW2EF","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm over 50 and I think these vitamins are nicely formulated for women who have entered into that free and wonderful time of life (no more periods).  These vitamins don't have iron which is fine with me, and they have a lot of other very necessary vitamins and minerals.

"This toilet paper is so much better than the cheaper one-ply that I'm often tempted to buy.  This may cost more initially than the other, but you use a lot less of it each time which saves paper and money.

"I have used this sonic toothbrush several times now.  I want to preface this review to say that I haven't used an electronic, much less a sonic toothbrush in years.  So, when this was offered up for review I thought why not.It's easy to understand and the instructions are very clear.  My toothbrush battery was already charged to two lights (out of three) right out of the package.  I'm not yet clear on which brush head to use so I just picked one and tried it out.  I did like the instructions said to do, and thoroughly brushed all my teeth.  During this process I kept accidentally pressing the on/off button with my holding hand, on the toothbrush body so I have had to reconfigure my holding technique.  No biggie.  I used just a small dab of toothpaste, got it wet and have learned not to start the toothbrush until it is all the way inside my mouth lest I lose my dab of toothpaste in smaller dabs all over my bathroom counter top.It is still taking me a while to get used to the tickle factor that the sonic emits.  There is no way I can tolerate it on my tongue because I tried to brush my tongue with it and it was too tickly for me to withstand.  It kept sending shivers down my spine so I now keep my old toothbrush on standby to use to clean my tongue with.  I will say that after only one thorough brushing with the sonic toothbrush my teeth and mouth in general felt very clean.  I normally brush my teeth two times in a row to remove all the gunk and yuck from them and my tongue.  I'm wondering if the sonic waves emitted by this toothbrush is knocking off some of the bacteria and stuff that sticks to the inside of my cheeks because my entire pie hole feels much cleaner even after one go round.I will continue to use this toothbrush and so far I like it a lot.  I'm not loving it just yet, since I still am trying to get use to the tickle and just the way it operates, but overall I think it does a much better job of getting my teeth clean then my previous double brushing method.  I just can't use it on my tongue. As of this review I still don't know how much it will cost.  And I need to check the price on getting replacement toothbrush heads.Also, I meant to add that it has a nice slim profile, it sits nicely in it's charging stand and it comes with two different brush heads and a sturdy, plastic travel case for those who want to take it with them.UPDATE: 10.15.15 -  I just got back from my 6 months cleaning from the dentist.  I had a PERFECT set of clean teeth, and I have only been using the Philips Sonicare toothbrush exclusively for the past 3 weeks or so.  The hygienist could not find even a tiny speck of tartar or anything at all to scrape off.  I looked at my paper bib after everything was over and there was absolutely NOTHING on it!  She said my teeth were already very clean and I told her I was using a sonic toothbrush.  She said she loved them and now I do too.  I have raised the star level from 4 to 5 to reflect what an awesome job it does at cleaning teeth.  I am totally blown away by this thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7TE3R6XOBIID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","R7TE3R6XOBIID","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't find this ""moisturizer"" to be particularly moisturizing to my skin.  It goes on easy and smoothly with no greasy feel, but I feel like I need to put on moisturizer right after I apply it.  I put it on two times about an hour and a half ago and I feel like I need to go and put some lotion on my face.  Personally, I would never pay $41.95 for this (cost as of this review) even if it does say ""Green Tea"" on the outside of the tube. If that is the natural ingredient they are selling then please take a look at the LONG list of of ingredients that many are not even pronounceable much less good for your skin.I have been using whipped Shea butter scented with a little bit of lemon essential oil and though it seems a bit greasy at first, it really soaks in after a while and my face feels great.  And it has NO additional chemicals.  Shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter, etc.....just by themselves make a good moisturizer and are very inexpensive compared to this stuff above.  I thought maybe this Proactiv+ moisturizer would be wonderful and maybe it is, but just not to me.  I'm giving the Proactiv+ three stars and I'm being generous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PMFUU60IIFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZH05VUM#wasThisHelpful","R12PMFUU60IIFE","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My two finickies wolfed this food right down.  Obviously it tastes very good to them.  I was surprised because one especially is very particular about her food.  My dogs are small but they were able to easily bite into the big, soft chunks and eat it just fine.  I like this food for a couple of reasons - first it has chicken broth followed by chicken as the first two ingredients and secondly, it's in a can so it will last for months if stored properly.  I am always running out of dog food and like to keep several cans as back up for those times I get low on the dry food.  I normally feed my dogs dry food (of which Nutro makes a good dry food product also) mainly to keep their teeth healthy and breath unstinky.  The chihuahua can really get some bad halitosis going but we had her teeth cleaned a couple of months ago so now I'm extra particular about what she eats.  That said, I still like to give them canned food for variation and as a treat simply because I love them very much!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J577WPPM9N6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZSEO0U#wasThisHelpful","R2J577WPPM9N6C","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a very old cat who I truly spoil to no end.  I'm always changing out her food so that she never gets bored with just one.  I tried out this food on her yesterday and she didn't readily take to it, but then she probably wasn't very hungry.  However, I have noticed this morning that her dish was nearly empty so I know she ate it.  I like pet food in which the first ingredient is a meat which means most of the food is meat.  Protein is super important for cats and dogs and I never feed them a food that doesn't list meat as the first ingredient. Turkey is listed as the first ingredient followed by chicken meal.This is not the best cat food I've ever given to my cat, but for the price (as of this review it costs $9.77 and free shipping with Prime) and turkey as the first ingredient I feel o.k. giving it to my cat to eat.

"I have taught classical guitar for years and have used all sorts of electronic tuners ranging from the old analog Korgs to the newest ones.  This tuner will accurately tune your guitar to standard pitch (440 Hz) but I cannot get it to tune to a lower pitch such as 420.  I have fiddled with it for some time now, read the tiny printed instructions several times and still it will only tune at 440.  Also, I cannot get this tuner to give me a tuning sound when pressing both buttons at the same time.  It will read out ""440"" but no tone is emitted.  It clearly tells me what pitch my strings are and I can easily to down to D or C or whatever I choose, but for across the board tuning in a different Hz range I can't seem to get it to do that.What is nice is the clip itself.  It is made out of metal with rubber tips and seems to firmly clip onto the headstock of my my old Ramirez quite well and I don't feel like it will break.  I have broken off two Snarks already and though I love how a Snark tunes, I have found them to be too fragile for me.  This tuner seems to be able to take rough handling better.  The display is clear and bright and easy to see.This is a good tuner but for the price I want more options.  My tiny D'Addario guitar tuner is my favorite.  I think it cost about 12 bucks and will do everything I want it too including remaining at different Hz even after turning off and back on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLJUVX9TKXPZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU4G0ZK#wasThisHelpful","RLJUVX9TKXPZE","A2VH0UT5EQFB6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VH0UT5EQFB6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Now, that I'm just cranking out the jams while I shower left and right, I've had issues getting too much water in my mouth.  That is kind of gross since its shower water.

I have not experimented in an overhead ""rainfall"" shower, but I'd imagine even this ingenious trick would fail.

"""That Blast came from the Death Star! That thing is Operational!"" - Lando Calrissian, year unknown.Fortunately, the only thing blasting out of my 2 Pack Silicone Mold Ice Cube Tray Ball For Star Wars Lovers or Party Theme (2pSMICTB4SWLoPT) is delicious cocktails! Often I'll be sipping on a philyorita in a rocks glass with my death star ice cube in it and someone will be like ""Where did you get that spherical ice cube?"". Now, here's the best part, I get to respond ""That's no spherical ice cube, that's the death star you idiot"". I enjoy myself every time this happens. No one else finds it amusing. You're welcome for sharing.When these same friends find out that I also own Kotobukiya Star Wars R2D2 Silicone Tray and Kotobukiya Star Wars Han Solo Silicone Tray they are super weirded out. Like, facebook defriending weirded out. Thankfully Mrs. Philyodaddy is locked in with a ring on it, so she can't leave me. It's a trap.Now let me rate the 2pSMICTB4SWLoPT in the categories provided by amazon:How much fun is this toy: 4/5 stars - 5 stars because it makes drinks more fun MINUS 1 star deducted because I don't know in what bizarro world this qualifies as a ""toy"". Maybe a dog toy if that silicone is totally safe to chew, unknown at this time.How would you rate this toy's educational value? 5/5 - The destruction of the death star is a laudable lesson in exposing the power of nature over the myth of technological dominance.How durable is this toy: 5/5 - hasn't broken yet. Fill it about 80% of the way and it makes a perfect ice Death Star. Every time.Overall - 5/5 Best ice cube death star maker I have ever seen. Dominates the category.Con: it is pretty hard to remove the case from ice cube when frozen. Luckily, philyodaddy has the strength of the Force on his side, but for average people this could be a cause for concern.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3POMDG79O4P7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JG0CV9S#wasThisHelpful","R3POMDG79O4P7Y","A3ODKNXD86RZCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKNXD86RZCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was extremely excited to try this bad boy out as I used a lot of limes in Philyodaddy's world famous margs (recipe at bottom).  I previously had been using: Campeon Lemon Squeezer, Medium, Yellow which I paid about $8 for.  My problem with that device is that it left a lot of meat on the bone (if you will).  I had to do additional squeezing by hand to get those last precious drops.This problem is largely solved by the stronger, metal ""Premium"" Lemon Squeezer.  This was especially important during the tragic lime-shortage of 2014.  My local grocer was ringing me up to the tune of $1.50 PER LIME.  That is absolute extortion and it is entirely the Mexican drug cartels fault (seriously, look it up).  Even now that limes are more reasonably priced, I still want to get all the juice.  That juice is mine.  Anyway... I definitely endorse this as an improved product.  Props to the folks at Kitchen Frontier for making a more high-quality version of a basic kitchen necessity.  And I do view this as a necessity.I also tested it with lemons when preparing a delicious Salmon feast for Mrs. Philyodaddy (my lady loves her Omega 3 fatty acids, can you blame her?).  It worked swimmingly and kept all the seeds where they belong - outside of my culinary concoction.My one issue would be the price, at $18, it is a little more costly than the plastic versions.  You gotta pay for the quality I guess, but some may see that as a lot for a squeezer.  Philyodaddy understands the concern of the everyman.Philyodaddy simple marg recipe:  2 parts decent tequila (don't you dare bring the cuervo up in this), .9 parts cointreau/triple sec (or grand marnier if youre classy af), the juice from 2 large limes (or 2.5 small/medium lines).  Serve on the rocks.  Get wasted.  Repeat.Disclaimer: received this gratis to test and review from the lovely folks at Kitchen Frontier.p.s. it is dishwasher safe and has shown no issues after 4 washes.  Will update if that changes.

"I bought these for my friend Nigels as an engagement present. His fiancee loved the purchase so much that she threw all the balls at me when I came into his apartment.

I can't imagine someone would want less than 144 bouncy balls when 144 is available.I purchase all important must-have items in lots of 12 or 144 and so should you. 12^3 is 1728, but I don't think I could afford 1728 of anything let alone something as valuable as bouncy balls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZPRDJ88E4TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003B7HY9E#wasThisHelpful","R1OZPRDJ88E4TL","A3ODKNXD86RZCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKNXD86RZCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the name is quite a mouthful, I really like the MpowÆ Seal Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Stereo Running, Sport Headphones Earbuds Earphone with Aptx, Mic Hands-free Calling for iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5S 5C 5 4S, Galaxy Note 3 2 S4 S3 and other Cellphones (I think that is even too long for an acronym, so I'm not going to try).This is my first experience with bluetooth 4.0, so I was pleasantly pleased by the battery gauge showing up on my iPhone 6+ (my phone's bigger than yours, you know what that means). The battery gauge isn't the most accurate thing in the world since it seems to stay above 50% until it's on its last legs. So there's that, but it doesn't really bother me. I really enjoyed the convenience of having ear plugs that I didn't need to connect to my phone (or other device), and the earphones were both comfortable and seemed to be good quality. I'm no audiophile, but I would say Wu Tang sounds just as good on these as they do on my more expensive wired headphones. Aint nothing to F with.I tried to use the mic once for a phone call and it didn't work. I am willing to accept that this is almost certainly my fault as I didn't read the instrux or try too hard to make it work. I'll take the blame on that one. Still really like the product, and for under $50, great value.  At the $30 they're currently offered to, it's really a steal.

" 0:21 Mins Makes a terrific Wedding present. After buying Mini Neon Smile Face Bouncing Balls (144 pc) for my friend Nigels as an engagement present, I needed a way to step my game up for his wedding. I figured two steps:1) buy a larger quantity of bouncy balls - this was accomplished because this product has 106 more balls than the aforementioned product. For you mathematicians 250 - 144 = 106. Boom.2) dump them all over his apartment while he is away on his honeymoon. - This was accomplished by me sneaking into his apartment and dumping them all over.Mrs. Nigels was so happy that she didn't even wait a few days to send me a thank you note. As soon as she got home they both texted me! Her text (as remembered by philyodaddy) said ""What in the world did you think you were doing?"".

"At $25 currently for 100 feet of the big bubbles, this represents about $1-$4.17 savings from when I purchased the Staples brand product in person.  Moreso than the savings though, I thought it was kind of funny have to have bubble wrap delivered to you. What is it protecting on that journey, a cardboard tube? Must be the most valuable cardboard tube in the world to have 150 feet of bubblewrap protecting it. One cardboard tube to rule them all.Don't know if I'm paying extra for the ""duck brand"", nor do I know what the means. But none of my expensive artwork (Philyosister's paintings, New York Giants Sports Illustrated Covers, Eli Manning autographed seatbacks - you know, all the stuff you find in the Met) was damaged during my recent apartment move.Oh and as the title says, Mrs. Philyodaddy loves when I pop these for days. She doesn't find it irritating at all. Just last night she said ""This behavior makes me question everything"". POP! Profound thoughts coming up next. Pop! I don't think she likes it quite as much as when I force her to watch the original Star Wars trilogy, but I mean, how could she? Anyway, good quality bubbz.A final note, I enjoy popping the smaller bubbles far more than these larger bubbles (minutes rather than hours of enjoyment), but my expensive television collection tells me that these large bubbles are far better for protecting my investment.

"Colander Me Maybe.  Get it?  Okay, I won't quit my day job.  I will keep making sweet pasta using the Arrow 4 Quart White Plastic Colander.

"I'll admit it, there are very few things in this world that I am more scared of than shattering my iPhone. I honestly think it is truly terrifying. And the worst part is that it seems so fragile that an overaggressive Cake Bomb in Candy Crush Saga could cause full screen destructsh.True Story: Mrs. Philyodaddy just got a new iPhone 6 (non-plus) on Saturday November 22nd at 5:15 PM EST. Mrs. P did not put any ballistic glass on her phone. Mrs. P then dropped her phone in a bar restroom and shattered the screen at 11:20 PM EST on that same evening, a mere 6 hours and 5 minutes later. Way to go Mrs. P! Breaking Hearts and iPhones since '81.Not me, no sir. I bought the iPhone 6 Plus (5.5 inch ONLY) HD Clear Ballistic Glass Screen Protector, Tech Armor Apple iPhone 6 Plus Premium HD Clear Ballistic Glass Screen Protector. Now that's a mouthful. The TAAi6PPHCBGSP is some serious stuff. Like military-grade protection. Or so they tell me. I didn't take out my Tec-9, battle axe, or light saber to give it a real test. I'll leave that kind of devotion to #1 Amazon Reviewer, Ali Julia. I'm sure she would have at least had a tactical nuke on hand for some real testing. At a reviewer rank of around 1000, Philyodaddy aint giving you that kind of insight. Yes, with a title like that, it does sound like it can stand up to a Cruise Missile, but I have absolutely no idea.I have paired this protector with my Incipio NGPÆ for iPhone 6 Plus - Translucent Black. Thus far it has stood up to several drops of the carpeted, wood, and concrete variety. It has additionally been handled roughly during tense moments of sports viewing and tenser moments of chick-flick viewing.In other somewhat relevant information, the TAAi6PPHCBGSP was fairly easy to put on, and I'm not good at that kind of stuff. These big mitts are made for sports and medieval warfare, not delicately applying a thin piece of military grade glasstic to my mobile computing device. It did not create air bubbles, which are whack.Two Cons: because it can't all be '82 Bordeaux and Nutella, $10.95 is pretty expensive, even for something that could be run over with an APC. Not for erbody. Additionally, it doesn't fully cover the face of your phone as has been discussed ad nauseum in the other reviews. It makes absolutely no difference unless you suffer from OCD and the edges will really bother you.Lastly, for those of you raw dogging with no screen protection, let me quote the always relevant Wu Tang, ""You best protect ya (iPhone 6 Plus)"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z4G9KNAF4AF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGMVD8W#wasThisHelpful","R2Z4G9KNAF4AF1","A3ODKNXD86RZCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKNXD86RZCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this bad boy after I purchased my Iphone 6 Plus.  I did a good amount of research and figured that Incipio seems to make the best of the super slim (shady) bendable cases.  I am pairing it currently with some Tech Armor Ballistic Glass.  This pairing seems to be quite excellent, akin to a '82 Bordeaux and a nice Ribeye.I previously had an otterbox on my iphone 5, and it was gross, really turned the ladies off.  If I'm going to have a phone the size of my head, I don't need a case that is adding to the bulk.  I prefer adding bulk on my arms, not on my phone.  Hopefully this does not mean it is fragile, but I have not had any problems yet.  Fingers super crossed.  No whammies.For $13, I think this represents good value and I would recommend the purchase.  Way better than the crappy cases they recommend at the Verizon store and then try to charge you 5x markup for.  Lastly, the color choices leave me a little wanting.  Where's Giants blue?

"Full disclosure: I used this product when I was 28, which was very recently, so my cane-alysis could potentially be useless for the majority of the cane-living set. I tore my ACL playing basketball and was forced to rely on walking aids. As every person in the world knows, crutches are the biggest drain on humanity this side of Nicholas Sparks. Yes, they might help my leg problem, but here's a new armpit problem for you to deal with while you're hobbled! Anyway, as soon as I could hobble around I purchased this stylish little dandy for $13. What a steal.  Great $ to support ratio.Other than getting odd looks for being a tall 28 year old (I feel like I'm missing some hyphens, is it 28-year-old or 28-year old?) with a cane, there is legitimately 0 downside to this device. The ladies f'ing love it. ""Oh who's that hot guy with a cane?"" Heard it more than once. The thing just screams vitality.It folds like a champ. To the reviewer who bragged that it takes less than 15 seconds to fold, you must have one arm or an incredible lack of dexterity because this thing takes no more than 5 seconds to be fully folded. The fake (I assume its fake) wood at the top adds a classy touch. And I am one classy mother f'er. Good weight, good grip, all the things you're looking for in a cane.

"For Philyodaddy's 30th birthday, I went to the Dominican Republic with Mrs. Philyodaddy, 16 friends, our inflatable alligator ""Chloe"", a healthy stomach, and a lifetime's supply of hopes and dreams.  I left with Mrs. Philyodaddy.  ""Chloe"" was not so fortunate to make the return voyage.On the plus side, this ""gator"" works as advertised, it's big, it's lean, it's mean, but it's not a fighting machine.  At almost 7' long, weighing approximately 3 pounds (soaking wet, zing!), it requires 5-8 minutes of intense respiratory action to get to its full size.  The maximum-weight of 80 kg can be safely ignored.  Not that I'd know, but a friend told me.  We successfully got 4 30-33 yr old women to ride the device long enough to take a few non-selfie pics and then get thrown into the alcohol-infested waters.  The women, not the pics.Chloe was a fun toy to play with while getting inebriated in 3 feet of urine, alcohol, and chlorine.  Made me almost forget the first one.  We got crazy, like not putting the toilet seat down crazy.  Like not leaving the pool to find the toilet seat crazy.

"I may not be the typical nerf demo, but I thoroughly enjoyed this product.  For only $17.99, I got to go all Philyo Everdeen on Mrs. Philyodaddy.  Pretty sure she loved it.  She only used our safe word once!  The Nerf N-Strike Blazin' Bow Blaster (NN-SBBB or N2-SB3) provided me with minutes of entertainment.Philyodaddy is great at many (most) things, but being handy is not one of them.  Yet I was able to construct this within 90 seconds of ripping, and I mean RIPPING, it out of the package.  So your children should be just fine.After assembling, I tried various trick shots with the end goal of annoying my wife.  I measured out a 50 foot shot, which shouldn't be possible in my small apartment.  So you know this thing's got some kick to it.  The nerf arrows didn't hurt.  She was just being a little whiny.5 stars overall, 4 stars for educational value, as it could prove useful in the war against the Capital.Mrs. P's take: ""It's amazing (philyodaddy) can get such enjoyment out of 5 min of a product and then you will nver (sic) pick it up again"".  Touche.12/11/14 update - I now see that it is > $30. While I still endorse the N2-SB3, I would probably wait til the price comes down (or buy elsewhere).

"Honestly, who in the world doesn't love goldfish? They are a delicious snack. In the non-sweet snack category, I'd put them right up there in the pantheon with Combos (obviously Pepperoni Pizza as the best kind) and Doritos (preferably Cool Ranch, but I'll hear arguments for other flavors). I have heard rumors goldfish are slightly healthier than the two aforementioned tasty treats. Rumors are a tricky mistress. Hard to say.What more can you ask for when discussing a snack that is as American as Windows 95? Goldfish for everyone.  That's a campaign I could get behind.I will note that these little bags just don't work as well for me as the big box.  I can just dump that thing on my face and make a mess everywhere.  Mrs. Philyodaddy loves that!At the current price of $12.95, I believe this represents good value.

"I was bored a few weekends back, so I ordered this as well as some black truffle oil and white truffle oil.  Figured I'd have myself a little truff party.  Well let me tell you, it's been a 2-week non-stop party in my mouth.  And you can be invited!  Well I guess the party would be in your mouth, but I digress.My kitchen now smells like Umamiville, USA.  This is some seriously pungent stuff.  Mrs. Philyodaddy put the three aforementioned products in one drawer, which she started calling the truffle drawer (very clever lady that Mrs. P).  More like flavor country.So far I have applied small doses of this product on: sandwiches, steak, salmon, other fish, cheese, chicken, pork, lamb, my finger, and other animals I cannot currently think of.  Everything was improved.  As you can see, I have an extremely healthy diet.  I might be going off the deep end a little, because Mrs. Philyodaddy is ""getting sick of truffles"".  Like that's possible.  Hey Mrs. P, maybe you should get sick of expensive purses or renttherunway.The ratio is 95 parts salt for 5 parts truffle, not that I could tell.  It seems that there is real black truffle in as well as some sort of truffle flavor, but this is my first truffle salt, so I don't know if that's par for the truffcourse.  I would say, of the three truffle related products I've tried so far I like the salt the best, and a little goes a long way.  Try it out, unless you don't like delicious things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQ1HTKWO1FEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E5SGI4#wasThisHelpful","RVQ1HTKWO1FEU","A3ODKNXD86RZCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKNXD86RZCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ladies, get your tickets to the gun show, asap. Feature attraction: Philyodaddy. Well I don't know if back muscles can be considered guns, but check out these hot, sculpted delts.I am on my second version of the Iron Gym Total Upper Body Workout Bar (IGTUBWB). First purchased about 3 years ago and recently purchased a new one. After 3 years of heavy use (because I am so strong and lift so much), the handles had started to wear away. When I was moving, figured might as well buy a new one rather than schlep it to the new pad.Originally purchased with the goal of improving upon perfection (at least that's what Mrs. Philyodaddy calls it to my face), the IGTUBWB really helped step up my weekly Adonis-maintenance activities. Three years, dozens of protein shakes, and countless Jager Bombs later, lets just say I needed to buy a lot of new suits.To quote Arnold in ""Pumping Iron"": ""I don't have any weak points. I had weak points three years ago, but my main thing in mind is, my goal always was, to even out everything to the point... that everything is perfect.""I really only use the IGTUBWB for pull ups and chin ups, as I have separate push up bars. Philyodaddy likes single-purpose lifting equipment for no apparent reason. This is made more strange by the fact I live in an apartment. Between this, my push up bars, and my bowflex weights, I've got a mini-Tony Horton workout studio in the second bedroom aka ""the shredzone"". Maybe you freaks who have 3000 sq ft can fit a whole gym in your basement, but I'm limited to a pair of dumbbells, a pull up bar, a coffee table, and my 3 televisions. I also have sufficient room to surround myself with mirrors, but I have yet to do so at this time.Putting together the pull up bar took me about 3 minutes and 0 tools. I am the least handy man alive. Literally, my only flaw. So you could say it is easy enough that even the typical roidheads at the gym could do it, not that I would invite them over to my apartment. That would be weird.Only con would be that it doesn't last forever (what does?), so I'll give it a strong 4 stars, closer to 4.5.Lastly, unfortunately just buying these doesn't make you as strong as philyodaddy, some work is required. Good luck. To double my quote total in this review, as Ric Flair is prone to say, ""To be the man, you gotta beat the man.

Wow, just give me the Nobel Candy prize, right now.Lastly, the full size cups (or even the super-large ""Big Cup"", which are also Philyodaddy-approved - please Reese's purists, don't nail me to the cross) are far superior to the little, dainty guys that come in the tin foil. Don't bring that weak crap up in this. You got the choc-pb ratio ALL WRONG.

As for all the people who wrote reviews of this product claiming it is super fresh, what in the world are you talking about? It is a processed food. Did you think that they just picked your pack of 36 right off the Chocolate Peanut Butter tree before hand-delivering it to you in a refrigerated container?

"Remix to what? Similarly to R. Kelly's jam ""Remix to Ignition"" - The Orbit Strawberry Remix Sugarfree Gum is probably far more famous than the original. That being said, I like this gum. It is very strong-flavored, so weak gum-likers need not apply. It is true that the flavor does not last as long as other Orbit delights like the Wrigleys Orbit Bubblemint, 14-Count (Pack of 12). You can't win 'em all. Truth be told, that is a better gum. This is more of a special occasion gum, when you're really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country.

"This was by far one of the best purchases of my life. Yes, it is just basically a super solid ziplock bag, but I don't care. I read my Kindle while sitting in a pool drinking margs in Cabo San Lucas and you didn't. My girlfriend also could not stop making fun of me. I have no idea why the decided that this product needed a strap to wrap around your neck. What is the possible point of that? Looking like a bigger geek? It is bad enough that I have to remember to pack 24 different chargers every time I go on vacation for my Kindle, Laptop, Phone, DS, Ipod, etc. but now I am wearing a plastic Kindle protector around my neck? That is just a little much.I don't have any fancy video to add, although I certainly recommended watching the fancy video reviews (now those guys are the real losers, who takes the time for that? They probably love the neck strap)The one slightly annoying thing is it is hard to slide the power button when the case is on... oh well, I was reading my kindle in a pool! How cool is that?!?!?! Why wouldn't you want to be reading your books while in a pool, pools are awesome.After having this product for 2 years, I have only used it thrice. I still looked like a super big nerd when I did. In addition to reading in a pool in Cabo San Lucas, I have read next to other pools in less exotic locales. It sounds much less awesome when I talk about it this way.

"Step your poop game up. When I was in my early 20s, a girlfriend broke up with me because I was using the single-ply variety of toilet paper in a cost-saving measure. Living in New York City is very expensive. I learned an important lesson, you gotta step up your poop game. Take that S--- seriously. Pun intended. At a cost of $0.55/double roll, the Angel Soft Double Rolls (I purchased the 40-pack) this is a good way to step your game up on the cheap.I did extensive product testing comparing to the more expensive Charmin Ultra Soft Toilet Paper 40 Double Roll (10 Packs of 4 Double Rolls). I use the restroom frequently, so I figured myself to be the perfect test subject. Below:Price: Angel Soft: $0.55. Charmin: $.71. If I had a dime, a nickel, and a penny for every time I bought cheaper toilet paper... Oh wait I do, so that is a total of $.16 x 12 = $1.92. Almost enough to buy something useful like an Admiral Ackbar action figure.Softness: Angel Soft: 9/10. Charmin 8.5/10. Angel Soft with a shocking Wichita State-style upset here. The champion of crap has been dethronedToughness/Resiliency: Angel Soft - 4/10. Charmin 8.5/10. This is the big weak point for the Angel Soft. Really can not stand up to daily use.Those are the only categories I could think of to judge Toilet Paper in. In all, it is a solid, if unspectacular product.

"These HPs are really Ear Buds (EBs) so my title might be a little misleading. Apol. I was sent a pair in exchange for writing an unbiased review. As the king of unbiasedness, here goes. And... they're pretty good, if unspectacular.To start, I like plain ear buds that fit well in my ear. These fit pretty well, but I have big ears (you know what that means), so it could be a little better. They are also angled, even though they appear straight in some of the photos, which isn't too my liking, but I feel that this is a ""to each his own"" type of thing.Big like: the wires aren't normal wiry but thick and non-tangely. Big plus in my book. I have approximately 69 different head phones and they all get tangled all the time. It is really annoying. Not with the Brainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones (BS1IEH). Thanks guys!I could not figure out which one was supposed to go in my left ear and which was supposed to go in my right, so I asked the manufacturer and was told to check the ""strain relief"" for a little L/R. Now, my back was feeling pretty good on that day, so I didn't know what kind of strain relief he was talking about. Apparently that is the little rubbery part that connect the cord to the actual EB. There was a small L and R there. He didn't lie to me.Anyway, people probably care most about sound quality, and while I'm no expert like Mike Erb, I do own approximately 69 headphones (as previously stated), most of which are EB's. The BS1IEH rank in the top quartile (the top 17.25 for you math nerds), possibly in the top quintile, but I don't want to sound like I'm being hyperbolic. They sound very good.I don't know if I would pay $60 with MEE and other brands making good products at a cheaper price point, but I am glad I have them and would recommend them if they were on sale.4 Stars.aside: do you say ""pairs of headphones"" or does ""headphones"" obviously apply one set?

"I bought and played this bad boy with several members of the esteemed East Coast Bias podcast while consuming adult beverages and waxing philosophical about the corruption of America's youth via Snapchat and Nicholas Sparks novels.  None of us were very familiar with the advanced board game scene, so it was a pretty eye-opening experience.  I don't think we're ready for a Settlers tournament yet, but onward...Before we played A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition (henceforth AGoT:TBG2E), we each tried to read the 30 pages of instructions.  We understood very little and figured we would try to play as we went.  No one wanted to be the Greyjoys, so we picked out of a hat. Naturally I had to play as Theon and co.  From there we kind of fumbled our way through the game.  It was pretty-to-very enjoyable.I look forward to our next play, but unfortunately being almost 30 there is only so much time for complicated board games with your friends.

Have fun up there buddy, I've got a clear path to Kings Landing and I have Valyrian Steel in my hand.ANNYYYWAY, since this is in the ""toys"" category, I will address philyodaddy's favorite star ranking, Educational Value.  5 Stars.AGoT:TBG2E Teaches children (and grown children like me) important lessons like the geography of Westeros (""No, you dimwit, the Stoney Shore is MILES from the Stoney Sept."") as well as important social dynamics such as: how to stab your friends in the back, a useful talent in Corporate America, just ask the Zuckerberg.On a personal note, it is way too much of them to ask us to keep all of those little pieces in some kind of organized fashion for following playthroughs, I mean let's be real, if you're anything like philyodaddy, your method of cleaning up is throwing everything in the box, slamming the lid shut, clapping your hands together, and saying ""All in a good day's work"".  This is considerably more difficult when there are 689490349 pieces/cards/items included in the game.  The board is also the size of a 12-person dining room table.  So I hope you have one.My one complaint would be that even with 30 pages of instructions, we still don't know how a few things work.  Ports?  Ships?  Not a clue, we made the rules up as we went along.  Pretty sure if there was a professional AGoT:TBG2E society, they would shun the crap out of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13EGG68Y0VNDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589947207#wasThisHelpful","R13EGG68Y0VNDC","A3ODKNXD86RZCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKNXD86RZCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many of the uncultured masses, I previously didn't put too much thought into the subject of ice trays. However, I have stepped up my ice tray game because of many broken promises over the years by inferior products. As philyodaddy fans are well aware I have had my ups and downs with the Arrow Plastic 00055 Ice Cube Trays (Pack of 2) so I purchased these badboys for a larger ice cube to throw in my Rubbermaid White Ice Cube Bin.  I'm sure this sounds like a joke, but amazon pro's can see all of the linked items are verified purchases. I wonder if that makes it better or worse? Anyway, I digress.I hate not having an ice maker, but these trays make it a tiny bit better. I have the standard 3 criteria (""3D"" as tray-pro's call them) when reviewing an ice tray: Difficulty of Use, Durability, and Dimensions:Difficulty of use: 8.5/10 - The ice comes out without having to apply my super human wrist strength. Good for mere mortals. Hence the ""Easy Release"" moniker attached to this product line.Durability: 9/10 (subject to change of course) - I have yet to break one of these. The crappy ice trays always break. I honestly believe it is intentional to make us buy more of them.Dimensions: 7.69/10 - They are a little big for the ice chewers among us but they excel at keeping the drink at a delightfully cool temperature. Not the super jumbo size that all ice users loathe. Because they are a little larger girth than I prefer, I tend to combine some of these with the Arrow small guys (linked above) in my drinks so i can have the ""best of both worlds"" (like the fatally flawed R. Kelly and Jay Z Tour).This is the highest 3D score I have found in my foray into the ice tray world. 1 star is deducted because $8 for 2 puts the average cost at the top of my ""maximum acceptable ice tray cost"" range of $4/piece. $8 for crappy plastic is ridiculous. I can buy A LIVE LOBSTER for $8.4 Stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93WXHWQN02DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNE7KNK#wasThisHelpful","R93WXHWQN02DW","A3ODKNXD86RZCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKNXD86RZCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was ecstatic when the lovely people at LifeCHARGE provided one of these bad boys for me to try out for my iPhone 5 with the purpose of reviewing. Shout out. Now if only I was provided with the iPhone 5 as well... I kid I kid. I am still pretty happy and use this every day. Previously I had carried (and tested) many external batteries and it was just a little annoying to carry around something extra.Let's get to the important things first: the color choices. Black and White are very early 2000's but gold (or champagne to philyodaddy) is clearly the color of NOW. I'd say this particular hue of yellowish is more of a Piper Heidsieck or maybe a single-vintage grower Champagne rather than a more tacky Veuve Clicquot or Cristal (poppin in my stretch Navigator). An understated, muted even, champagne color that contrasts superbly with my black selfie taker. A real classy look. Almost makes people stop focusing on my Mets pajama pants. Almost.Now that we've gotten the important stuff out of the way, I did some very in-depth testing. What I did was: I played the Notebook on full volume (to the thrill of Philyodaddy's neighbors) repeatedly until the phone's battery died (it was around the 42nd time that Ryan Gosling's chiseled features could be described as ""smoldering"") I used the LifeCHARGE MFI Approved Rechargeable Extended Battery Case for Apple iPhone 5/5s - Gold (hitherto: LMAREBCfAi5-G) to charge it back up. End result, the LMAREBCfAi5-G will give you about 1.238-1.373 extra charges of your iphone5, not sure about the iphone5s, because RESULTS MAY VARY.Cons, I'll get this out of the way quickly so I can make more jokes that only I find funny:1)It is a little bulky, sorry what did you want your magical device that charges2)You need to hold the charge button and charge the phone and battery pack separately. I would love if it automatically charged the phone and battery pack at the same time, but as BSB might say ""aint nothing but a heartache""3) I now find the need to have my phone or battery charging at all times. I think I might be OCD but I want my phone and battery pack at 100%, because that's what I want.The cuatro) Doesn't work with some headphones without an extender. Oh shucks, just find headphones it does work with.I consulted noted phone-case expert Mrs. Nigels (of Assorted 27mm Super Bouncy Balls - 250 Count fame). She has a Mophie and she confirms that her experience both pros and cons are the same. She also thanked me again for filling her house with bouncy balls. Weird that both battery packs share the same negatives, I guess there is still room for another entrant into the subcategory.To pre-conclude, It is better than carrying around external battery packs, and its champagne color is super sexy, but there are still a few stars. I'd give it 4.3 stars, unfortunately rounding down to 4. Also if they could make one that prevents drunk-texting ""What you up to?"", that would be a swell enhancement.I'll end by demanding that Apple (and the Android producers) make their phones last longer. It is absolutely outrageous that devices like these are needed. I mean I know that the LifeCHARGE company is surely cheering for this never to come to pass, but c'mon. Instead of making Siri direct me to the nearest Rub and Tug, why don't you invent some new awesome batteries? Is that really too much to ask?","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THYZZU8GP8HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGZ247O#wasThisHelpful","R3THYZZU8GP8HC","A3ODKNXD86RZCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ODKNXD86RZCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As for all the people who wrote reviews of this product claiming it is super fresh, what in the world are you talking about?  It is a processed food.

"In a traditional case of the pot not being the same color as the kettle, I bought the ""Matte Red"" version of this bad boy.  #allredeverything It is a good tea kettle.  I rarely wash it.  Seriously, what is the point of washing it.  The only thing that ever goes inside of it is water and it is then boiled so as to remove any contaminates.  I ain't washing that crap.  The dishwasher is busy, sorry.Anyway, Primula engineers deserve kudos.  This is loud as f.  One of my least favorite things  in the world (this list appears to be getting long) is when Mrs. Philyodaddy just lets that beast go on for minutes.

It looks good, it holds 2.5 quarts (obviously, that is in the product description).One star deduction because the plastic handle is too hot to hold (It's gettin hot in herre) and I need to use a dishtowel.

Mrs. Philyodaddy didn't see the proposal coming since I was wearing a t-shirt, cargo shorts, and Rainbow Sandals.  GOTCHA.Rainbow sandals are great.  The one obvious problem is that these things are absolutely awful to break in. Literally, it takes months, and I do know the definition of ""literally"".  Mrs. Philyodaddy made me throw away my 4-year old pair and buy a replacement, and my feet looked like size 13 swiss cheese for months. Thanks again.

"I am giving this 5 stars because I love ASOIAF. I think these books are wonderful. However, why in the world would I want to have all 5 books as one file on my Kindle? It just doesn't make any sense. Oh great, I can read for 3 hours and make 1% progress! SWEEEEEETTT. It is the downside of e-books, they are completely unmanageable. The worst part was when I re-read them. For some reason, it bothered me even more. You can't find your place when you have 5000 pages in one stupid file. George, can I call you George, you really need to have more input on the electronic publishing. I can't imagine this was your choice. When the future books come out, I will be glad to get them separately.On the actual books, I love all 5 although of course AFFC is not as good. I'm not in the Dance with Dragons hating committee, so sue me. I liked it quite a bit. I discovered the series only when the TV show started.

"These ball pit balls are not joking around. There is a very good reason that they are number 1 in the category of ""playground balls"". I haven't figured out that reason yet, but I'm sure there is one. Maybe it is because they are ""Phthalate Free"". Notice I put quotes around it just like the product description does. Why the quotation marks? Did someone say they were ""Phthalate Free""? Do they ALLEGE to be ""Phtalate Free""? How can I trust that they are legitimately free of Phthalate with those quotation marks hanging around? Answer: I can't.Next question: WHAT IN THE WORLD IS PHTHALATE? Is that something I need to be scared of? I don't have children yet, but when I do, do I need to protect them from the evil dangers of Phthalate? I just spent 45 seconds internetting phthalate and I still don't understand what it is. It is spelled funny though. 4 consonants in a row! Unheard of!

"Oh Sparty, I already miss you and it hasn't even been a year. This was a great show. It wasn't the best written or most realistic, it was just the most entertaining. There are men, There are great men, and there was Andy Whitfield. Liam McIntyre did a pretty good job in seasons 3 and 4, but when you're replacing a legend, what in the world are you to do?I have debated the realitisticness of this show with some of my friends (shoutout Langers 2003). Spoiler Alert- in the first season finale, AWhit jumps 20 feet straight up into the air. So, I'm not sure why they didn't let him take the weights off and really show off his high jump prowess.

Philyodaddy majored in history, so I would know.In all seriousness, I loved this show as much as I mourned Andy Whitfield's unfortunate passing. Even season 2 without the title character was excellent. Seasons 3 and 4 were a little worse, but oh well, what are you going to do? Godfather 3 wasn't as good as 1 or 2 either.

"Alexander Grechaninov was a major composer of the Russian silver age, and his best works qualify as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù, including some of his choral and chamber works. We certainly needed a complete cycle of his symphonies (I have a particular fondness for the exuberant fifth), and the Chandos one is certainly worth the investment for any fan of the Russian silver age. It is, however, hard to imagine a strong case being made for the first symphony apart from ‚Äúfor completeness sake‚Äù. Completed in 1895, it is a work heavily indebted to Rimsky-Korsakov and sounds a lot like Glazunov‚Äôs works from the same period. But it lacks the inventiveness, brilliance and melodic memorability of either of those composers, and although there are some pleasant things going on and the symphony never really gets ‚Äúboring‚Äù, there is nothing to remember it by once the moderately interesting scenery has passed you by. No complaints about the craftsmanship, but the scoring is hardly as brilliant as Rimsky or Glazunov either. The Russian State Symphony Orchestra plays well under Valeri Polyansky, but although it is not slow there is a certain lack of energy to the proceedings that I think is only partially the composer‚Äôs fault.Snowflakes (1910) is a collection of ten miniature poems about childhood. I admit that I expected some fantastic, phantasmagorical and wonderfully atmospheric fairy tale music in the manner of the Nutcracker or Liadov, and that seems to be what Grechaninov was aiming for as well ‚Äì but no, it doesn‚Äôt really work; after the opening number the music often turns banal and trite and the melodic material isn‚Äôt really memorable enough. Here, however, the performances are not free from blame. I know the opening song, Snowflakes (yes, it gave the title to the cycle) as a wonderfully crisp, mischievous and atmospheric solo song, but the choral-and-orchestral arrangement packs it all in a wet, woollen, grey cloth ‚Äì at least it does in the poorly balanced and woolly recorded sound here, and I suspect my disappointment in the rest of the cycle can at least to some extent be blamed on the same problem. But the singing is not great either, which is surprising from this source.And in the late Missa Sancti Spiritus (1940) the Russian State Symphonic Cappella certainly prove that they usually are excellent singers; it is very well performed. The mass dispenses with orchestra, and the result is a very devotional, rather low-key but emotionally charged setting. It is not great music ‚Äì not a patch on the best of Grechaninov‚Äôs other choral works ‚Äì but it is well written and beautiful enough. In sum I think this disc is mainly for completists; there are some good and enjoyable things here, but some serious drawbacks as well. Let me close, however, with a plea for an opportunity to hear one or more of Grechaninov‚Äôs operas.

"Chandos‚Äôs Prokofiev series is amazingly comprehensive, and for much of it they employed the indefatigable Neeme J√§rvi. Now, J√§rvi‚Äôs unparalleled versatility and productivity are explained by something close to a one-size-fits-all approach to very diverse repertoire, but the Prokofiev symphony cycle he gave for Chandos is still possibly the best complete cycle in the catalogue (even though he cannot quite compete in some of the individual symphonies ‚Äì with Ancerl in no. 1 or Karajan in no. 5, for instance). How does he fare here? Well, the results are a bit variable, but it is never less than perfectly acceptable.The ballet The Prodigal Son was one of the works Prokofiev wrote during his stay in Paris and before his return to the Soviet Union, but it is written in a rather populist style, much simpler and straightforward than many of his earlier works (one imagines the story being an expression of the composer‚Äôs view of himself at the time: the artist tempted to forsake his homeland, but presently regrets it and hopes for forgiveness). It is nevertheless an inventive work, full of splendid ideas. J√§rvi and the Scottish National Orchestra are arguably best in the more tumultuous scenes, but they are really very good throughout, playing with plenty of spirit, panache and color ‚Äì this is the kind of work that really can take J√§rvi‚Äôs somewhat brazen, noisy and hard-pressed (though not necessarily particularly fast) approach; it is, after all, not a particularly subtle or multi-dimensional score.The other works are somewhat more harmonically complex ‚Äì not much so for the contemporaneous Divertissement, a fifteen-minute work in four movements, but at least the first movement contains the kind of machine-like pulse that you find in the earlier music. The second movement, a Nocturne, is an early example of his later style, however; the third is in the style of The Prodigal Son, and the fourth is also dance-like. It is a really rewarding and fun work, though I think the first two movements are the best; J√§rvi and his forces, however, are arguably most convincing in the last two, though this is once again an overall very fine performance. Where I have most doubts about the performances is probably in the Andante, an orchestration of a movement from his fourth piano sonata, which here sounds mostly ominous and one-dimensional (whether the orchestration really adds anything to the original anyways is an open question, though).The Symphonic Song dates from 1933 and is another stylistically transitory work. It is generally dark, troubled and dissonant, though a theme finally breaks free and the work ends in triumph. I have to admit, though, that I find the whole thing somewhat puzzling ‚Äì perhaps the somewhat noisy performance is partially to blame. Overall, the program may not be an essential one to anyone but already committed fans of the composer, but the Divertissement is certainly worth hearing, and The Prodigal Son is great fun as well. The sound is clear and spacious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCA3HQJBSV8FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AIO#wasThisHelpful","RCA3HQJBSV8FY","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was unfamiliar with the music of the Argentine composer Alberto Williams (1862-1952) before hearing this disc ‚Äì apparently there are some releases devoted to his piano works out there, but this seems to be the only disc devoted to any of his nine symphonies or major orchestral works. Both works on this disc belong to Williams‚Äôs late period ‚Äì in fact, the dates are 1937 and 1943, respectively, which means that he was 75 and 81 years old when he composed these works. I think it is worth pointing this out, since I suspect that many potential listeners would expect orchestral music composed by an Argentine composer born in 1862 to be essentially romantic. The truth, however, is that these are both clearly 20th century works, and if the basic language is romantic they often sound quite modern.Unfortunately they also strike me as rather bland; though not anachronistic the musical language isn‚Äôt particularly original, either; instead, Williams adopt a rather mainstream, cosmopolitan style ‚Äì there are plenty of hints toward his Argentine background, but they are overall rather subdued and polished off. The outer movements of the seventh symphony, Eterno Reposo, are dark and tragic but not particularly dramatic, and although the opening movement, La Pir√°mide, sounds ambitious and goal-directed at the outset, momentum quickly dissipates into aimless meanderings with some mildly interesting moments that ultimately fail to cohere. The second movement, Danzarinas De Am√≥n, sounds like its going for glitz but ends up with syrup, while the third movement, Tocadoras De Cr√≥talos, is more interesting ‚Äì at least it exhibits some vigor. The finale is moody and brooding ‚Äì at the outset it seems to aim for the dreamlike, but although it does achieve some atmosphere it never seems able to go anywhere; when it develops into something more dramatic and, ultimately, jubilant, that isn‚Äôt achieved by development but by simple juxtaposition. Overall, the symphony ‚Äì in fact, it sounds more like a suite ‚Äì is no more than moderately interesting.The Poema del Iguazu is a suite of musical images of the river Iguazu. It strikes me as more satisfying overall, perhaps because I didn‚Äôt expect any symphonic unity within or between the movements. The opening movement, Las Selvas Dialogan Con Las Cataratas is light and atmospheric with several good ideas and even a memorable theme or two. Barcarola Del Iguaz√∫ is nobly flowing, whereas La Luna Ilumina Las Cascadas is a slightly impressionistic nocturne, gentle but secretive but not very interesting ‚Äì one gets the feeling that Williams overall should have increased the speed, and no: I don‚Äôt think it is ultimately the performers‚Äô fault. The finale, La Garganta Del Diablo, supposedly depicts a great waterfall, but don‚Äôt get your hopes up: There is some noise and swagger but it doesn‚Äôt really make a particularly powerful impact. Overall, though, this is a pleasant and pleasing suite of what admittedly are rather insubstantial tone paintings.I do, however, suspect that the Orquesta Filarmonica de Gran Canaria under Adrian Leaper is partially to blame for my somewhat mixed reaction to the music. It does sound like Leaper knows what he is doing, and the playing is general decent, but I suspect much of this music requires somewhat fuller textures than the Gran Canaria players can give it. I also wonder whether they play it too safe ‚Äì the performances lack spirit and brilliance; they may be a bit too slow, but I am not sure a higher speed really is all I am asking for. The sound is fine, though, and those with a sense of adventure may certainly want to check this one out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVCXTQXVZM89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EBGF7W#wasThisHelpful","RPVCXTQXVZM89","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Max Bruch‚Äôs instrumental music beyond the ubiquitous first violin concerto is currently reasonably well represented on disc, but the main part of his compositional output consisted of a long series of secular oratorios and dramatic ballads for soloists, chorus and orchestra, only a couple of which are actually available on disc. Das Lied von der Glocke, after Schiller, is actually available in three recordings. I have not heard the others, and although I have heard good things about the CPO one I am not willing to believe that it could be much better than this Thorofon release, which is excellently performed with reasonably strong soloists and recorded in vivid sound. The music itself is a blast ‚Äì not particularly original, and perhaps not ultimately strikingly memorable, but hugely enjoyable, brilliantly scored, tuneful and with some beautiful meditative parts and marvelous (and marvelously developed) climaxes.The work was completed in 1878 and was apparently inspired by the bells of the Cologne Cathedral. Most of the work is actually rather reflective in character, as the Schiller poem would suggest ‚Äì the poem is a philosophical take on the episodes in a human life framed by an allegorical description of the creation of a new church bell ‚Äì but it builds up to a sustained, blazing climax; clearly inspired by Beethoven‚Äôs Ode to Joy, but not derivatively so. Of course, the message of domestic harmony in Schiller‚Äôs poem, of which Bruch makes much, will come across as pretty quaint to today‚Äôs listeners, especially as it is set to the tune of Holy Night, but whatever: It‚Äôs a glorious and very tuneful spectacle and can easily be enjoyed as such, and if you think this kind of romantic spectacle is for you, you will definitely appreciate Bruch‚Äôs Das Lied von der Glocke.The performances are overall excellent. The soloists are good ‚Äì none of them are perfect, but they clearly know how to work with each other and their ensemble work is magnificent. Still, it‚Äôs the Dresden State Opera Chorus who tends to steal the show ‚Äì this really is first-rate choral singing. The Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra is also very impressive under Hans-Christoph Rademann, and it‚Äôs all spaciously and vividly recorded (the climaxes are fortunately excellently captured). So, while it may not be a masterpiece this one still deserves a very, very strong recommendation. I would rate Das Lied von der Glocke above Moses and at least as equal to Damajanti and Arminius ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt heard Odysseus, but there is a recording of that one, and I hope I will get to hear both that one and some of the currently unrecorded ones, such as Achilleus or Das Feuerkreuz, at some point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DD10FDG2RQYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000026318#wasThisHelpful","R3DD10FDG2RQYG","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Plenty of famous conductors were also composers, and the fact that they made names for themselves as conductors of course makes it more likely that their compositional output is not completely forgotten but of interest to record companies, somewhat independently of concerns about quality. Hearing the music of these conductors is occasionally revelatory (Markevitch) and often eminently worthwhile (Furtw√§ngler); much of it is very much middle-of-the-road (Walter, Svetlanov, Dorati), however, and some of the music by these conductors turns out to be disappointing (Klemperer). At least a career as a conductor is a fairly reliable predictor of being a skilled orchestrator, but usually also favoring an eclectic style and a pretty conservative harmonic language, with Markevitch being the main exception.Rafael Kubelik‚Äôs music is indeed skillfully scored, eclectic and relatively conservative. Orphikon, a ‚ÄúMusic in Three Movements for Orchestra‚Äù, is quite ambitious in scope, however, and clocks in at approximately 35 minutes. It is darkly dramatic and often anguished in character, and influences are rather obvious ‚Äì a bit of Bartok and Shostakovich and some nods to Mahler, and I cannot help but hear the resemblance to the sound worlds of contemporaneous Czech composers like Vycpalek, Dobias and early Kabelac, perhaps in particular the latter. So, no ‚Äì not much of a discernible personal voice, but the work nevertheless manages to hold the listener‚Äôs attention (at least this listener‚Äôs attention) throughout. An enjoyable work ‚Äì though enjoyable in the manner that effectively written and scored brooding, gloomy, angst-ridden and tragically dramatic music can be enjoyable. Apparently the work is based on ‚Äúthe idea of integrating vertical and horizontal tone-relations through the existing principle of harmonics ‚Äì as determined by the inextinguishable laws of acoustics‚Äù. Yeah, whatever ‚Äì at least the overall structure of the work is somewhat unclear. Ideas are introduced and examined before being replaced by new ones rather than developed; but there are enough good (if not ultimately memorable) ideas and sufficient variety here for the result to be pretty effective nonetheless.The Cantata Without Words is written in the same style, but this time if employs a wordless chorus in addition to the orchestral forces, and the musical narrative is far more explicit. The chorus is imaginatively used and the whole thing is, once again, pretty enjoyable, though I do think that I did, in the end, find the ideas in Orphikon to be somewhat stronger in general. No matter, this is rather enjoyable music and of course the composer himself secures idiomatic and convincing performances from the Bavarian RSO & Chorus ‚Äì stronger on drama and blazing intensity than refinement, perhaps, but that is entirely appropriate for the music. The sound is a bit old and rough but not really any obstacle. Recommended to the adventurous, especially if you don‚Äôt expect any big revelations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21REA5FPEV0OA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009E7N#wasThisHelpful","R21REA5FPEV0OA","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ASV has produced an eminently worthwhile series of Martucci‚Äôs orchestral works; the piano concertos and La canzona dei Ricordi are particularly worth checking out. Martucci did, as is well known, go against the grain among his Italian contemporaries by eschewing opera and focusing on instrumental music (and symphonic forms), but he also brought influences from German and French romanticism to Italy, and the piano music on this disc is written in a typical and unfortunately rather generic romantic style. There are influences of Liszt and the salon but few traces of a personal voice ‚Äì which you do, to an extent, find in some of his orchestral works. Fortunately much of the music is fast-paced and vivacious, and if it lacks depth ‚Äì which it consistently does ‚Äì much of it is at least moderately enjoyable, even if nothing sticks in the memory.The Prelude, Toccata and Gigue strikes me as perhaps the most enjoyable work of the program, but that might be just because it opens that program rather than because of any particular inherent merit. The three romances, on the other hand, are by some distance the weakest ‚Äì these are inconsequential salon works seeming to aim for sentimentality and nothing else. Francesco Caramiello‚Äôs playing is dutiful more than inspired ‚Äì at least he doesn‚Äôt overdo the music, but one sometimes gets the feeling that he doesn‚Äôt exactly believe in it either. Especially the slower works lack lyricism, but it is hard to completely blame the performer. The sound is good, though, and if you have a particular fascination for romantic piano music I suppose this might be worth checking out if you can find a cheap copy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1CW6ZD772T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000030UV#wasThisHelpful","R1V1CW6ZD772T2","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Marx (1882-1964) remained a resolutely late-Romantic composer throughout his career, and while he remained a respected teacher his own compositional style became more and more out of step with the times. At the time of his death his music disappeared more or less completely, but it has received renewed attention the last couple of decades. I have myself been very impressed by some of his works, but I have to admit that I am not entirely sure what to say about the music on this disc. The three tone poems comprising his Nature Trilogy are big, lush works containing some marvelous colors, scoring and orchestral effects, but are also rather diffuse and aimless (with one exception). The musical language is, as mentioned, late romantic but it seems to have borrowed quite a bit from Debussy; the music ebbs and flows and rummages, sometimes sounding a bit like Delius in his most ‚Äúacquired-taste‚Äù passages (and I am a committed fan of Delius), but there are few real themes and accordingly little real development. Perhaps that was the idea: the music is supposed to capture some moods and impressions of nature, not to tell a story. Perhaps Marx was more forward-looking than we give him credit for, and I am looking for some old-fashioned narrative structure that he has consciously chosen to eschew.In any case, the Symphonic Night Music seems to me to have at least the outlines of a discernible structure. It also contains plenty of lovely thing and is amazingly scored; but the enchanting details and shifting, opulent textures are primarily there to be savored for their own sake, it seems, and lovely as they are the work acquires something of an interminable character as it unfolds. The Idyll-Concertino is the shortest of the works and by some distance the most successful. It is, in fact, a marvelous work of gorgeous, hazy summer light and is able to capture the sense of temperature almost as well as Debussy‚Äôs Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune. It also has some discernible themes to give it structure ‚Äì more similar to an architectural shape than the narrative structure of a story. In fact, after the Idyll-Concertino I thought for a moment that I had discovered a key to the music, but the Spring Music quickly lost me again. And once again, despite some lovely details and scoring it strikes me as mostly interminable wandering, even more aimlessly than the Symphonic Night Music.Four stars for the Symphonic Night Music (being generous), five for the Idyll-Concertino, three for Spring Music would be my verdict on the music. At least the Bochum Symphony Orchestra under Steven Sloane manages to realize the glittering colors and almost succulent textures of this music; indeed, the performances strike me as very admirable throughout, and the ASV sound is very good. To what extent they are perfect advocates for this music is harder to determine for sure, but I suspect the aimlessness that characterize at least the Spring Music is no fault of Sloane and the players. Overall, though, given the performances and the loveliness of the Idyll-Concertino I have to give this disc a fairly strong recommendation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35C1HOLF3UIA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008IHWP#wasThisHelpful","R35C1HOLF3UIA5","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Franz Waxman is probably best known for his film music, though his concert work has received a bit of attention the last couple of decades; Eric Zeisl also made a career as a film composer, but recordings of his orchestral and chamber music have, to my ear, revealed him to be more than worthy of being compared to the greatest composers of the twentieth century. Both composers are stylistically associated with brilliant, essentially late-romantic splendor often reminiscent of film music ‚Äì which is unsurprising since these were among the composers establishing the sound of (Hollywood-style) film music. The disc at hand, however, finds them both in unusually reflective, dark, and powerfully poignant mode, far removed from the glitter, champagne and historical-epic qualities of the works with which most listeners would associate them.It is hard not to be affected by Waxman‚Äôs The Song of Terezin, composed in 1965 to texts drawn from poems written by children incarcerated in the Terezin concentration camp. Waxman sets the text with obvious consideration and sensitivity to the material, though there is a sense of anger running underneath and the score turns pretty dramatic at times. Scored for soprano, children‚Äôs choir, mixed choir and large orchestra, Waxman is also an exquisite colorist. Is it great music, though? See, that‚Äôs the rub ‚Äì like I said it is impossible not to be touched by this work, but I don‚Äôt really think Waxman‚Äôs music adds much to the poignancy of the poems. But then, maybe it wasn‚Äôt supposed to do so? I have to admit to having some trouble rating a work like this.Eric Zeisl‚Äôs Requiem Ebraico (Psalm 92) for choir, soloists and orchestra was written in 1944-45 in memory of the composer‚Äôs father. The music is more subdued than Waxman‚Äôs, but also somewhat more conservative, at least superficially so (there are, as always with Zeisl, some interesting and remarkable touches here and there). Though the text (sung in Hebrew) isn‚Äôt anywhere near as moving as Waxman‚Äôs poems, the music itself is to my ears more touching and more eloquent. It is probably not among Zeisl‚Äôs greatest works, but it is a touching one nonetheless. The performances are uniformly superb, at all levels, and the sound is very good. Overall, this is a highly recommendable disc, though I do perhaps ‚Äì I have to admit ‚Äì suspect that the contexts of these works, and the poems Waxman uses, have led to higher ratings for this disc than the music alone strictly speaking warrants. Still.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97RLL2MNR0X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DBVSZI#wasThisHelpful","R97RLL2MNR0X9","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music of Hermann Wolfgang von Waltershausen (1882-1954) isn‚Äôt often encountered these days. In fact, he seems to have lived a rather humble life and, although he apparently had some influence over the musical life in his native Munich, does not seem to have tried too hard to achieve much beyond that. His opera Oberst Chabert, completed in 1912, was nevertheless quite successful (so much so that there does, in fact, exist an alternative recording from 1956 with Julius Patzak among the cast, issued by Walhall ‚Äì I have not heard it) and certainly his greatest hit; it was even performed internationally but WWI but an effective stopper to any possibility it might have had for entering any kind of standard repertoire. You might have noticed that Waltershausen‚Äôs dates ‚Äú(1882-1954)‚Äù are also the dates of Walter Braunfels, another composer who continued to write in what is essentially a late-romantic style, but Waltershausen‚Äôs music is even more conservative and apparently remained that way throughout his career. Certainly the language of Oberst Chabert is heavily indebted to Wagner and Liszt, with a touch of Italian opera (Catalani and Puccini); much of it could pass for Richard Strauss, some of it as Franz Schmidt or Korngold, but it is also a more conservative overall than any of these latter three composers.The story is a relatively free adaptation of Balzac‚Äôs novel ‚Äì the characters‚Äô motivations are different and so are the outcomes. It is, in fact, a rather moving story in this adaptation (though it has become more standardly operatic), and at 100 minutes, it is also a relatively compact and dramatically effective one. Musically, Waltershausen doesn‚Äôt quite manage to achieve anything like the brilliance of Strauss or Korngold, but he is a skilled orchestrator with some fine, even memorable themes and some spectacularly good ideas. In fact, the quality of the music improves as things proceed ‚Äì in the first act, he seems mostly to present ideas and fragments that on their own sound disparate, and which together makes the act seem meandering and wayward without anything really memorable happening musically; but then things pick up as the ideas are developed and brought together, and much of the third act is magnificent ‚Äì not to mention the quintet at the end of the second act. It is, I suppose, a dangerous game, but if you feel like sampling this set before making a decision just listening from the beginning will not give you the right impression. I won‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs a masterpiece, but it is a very impressive work overall, and I would definitely like to hear more of Waltershausen‚Äôs output.The performances are generally very good ‚Äì at least Bo Skovhus is dependably excellent and dramatically hugely effective. Manuela Uhl is also very good ‚Äì she may score higher on drama than on sublime beauty of tone, but that‚Äôs also the right emphasis in a work like this. The rest of the cast is good if not outstanding and the orchestral performances by the Berlin Deutsche Oper Orchestra under Jacques Lacombe generally very effective ‚Äì clear textures and dramatic involvement, though not in the end ideally lush or opulent. That caveat is unfortunately exacerbated by the engineering; the sound is quite dry, which, although it keeps the textures clear, does to an extent undermine the kinds of effects I think the composer was often going for. We do get full texts and English translations and good notes, as usual with cpo. Overall, and despite a few shortcomings, a highly recommendable affair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHWG8IAT2UIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004R7WGRM#wasThisHelpful","RTHWG8IAT2UIO","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Danish composer Hakon B√∏rresen (1876-1954) remained a staunch musical conservative throughout his life, and if you are looking for anything strikingly personal or (at all) forward-looking, this disc is probably not for you. These are Romantic, conservative, somewhat sturdy works; yet I found them absolutely lovable ‚Äì the ideas, while not exactly earworms, are strong, the colors glorious and B√∏rresen knew how to sustain momentum throughout ‚Äì these are, indeed, the kind of arch-romantic symphonies I am very happy actually exist.The second symphony (1904) is like so many other symphonies inspired by and subtitled ‚ÄúThe Sea‚Äù. Oh, well ‚Äì I don‚Äôt really hear that much seascape or vivid oceanic imagery here, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. The style doesn‚Äôt venture that much beyond Schumann and perhaps Bruch and Reinecke, except for plenty of touches obviously indebted to Tchaikovsky; the robustly constructed and moderately dramatic first movement reminds me a bit of early Dvorak as well; the delightful second is a spirited and atmospheric Mendelssohnian scherzo; the third is perhaps the movement where the ghost of Tchaikovsky is most obvious (the overtures and symphonic poems more than the symphonies); and the fourth is a relatively gentle and wistful movement though not entirely without drama. These description doesn‚Äôt, however, capture how eminently enjoyable and satisfactory the whole affair actually is ‚Äì the third movement may meander a bit, but otherwise this is thoroughly recommendable for any lovers of romantic symphonism.The third symphony dates from 1927. It is hardly more modern in style, but the voice does seem a bit more personal nonetheless ‚Äì Dvorak and Tchaikovsky are audible influences but overall B√∏rresen manages to incorporate these influences seamlessly into something that is at least modestly individual. The first movement is also more complex than anything found in the second symphony (it is also almost as long as the other movements put together); though generally romantically tuneful, it also has more depth (and darkness) than anything else on this disc. The slow movement is by comparison modestly pleasant and the scherzo wistfully supple and touching. The last movement, too, is sparkling and spirited and mostly fun (enormously fun, in fact), though occasionally veering toward something resembling the depths of the first movement. It is an excellent work, and probably even more impressive than the second symphony (and, written 24 years after, even more completely out of touch with its times).In short, this is thoroughly enjoyable music, and I am very, very happy to have heard it. The players of the Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Frankfurt at least sound like they enjoy themselves as well, and turn in spirited, colorful and warmly glowing performances under the direction of Ole Schmidt. I have not heard the alternative recording with Owain Arwel Hughes, but found little to complain about in the performances at hand. The sound is good. Pretty strongly recommended.Addendum: To say that many composers have found the connection between the symphony and the Ocean inspiring, would be an understatement. In addition to B√∏rresen‚Äôs second, ‚ÄòThe Sea‚Äô is the subtitle at least for Hanson‚Äôs seventh and Tuukkanen‚Äôs third. Rubinstein‚Äôs second is of course subtitled ‚ÄúOcean‚Äù, and Vaughan William‚Äôs first is ‚ÄúA Sea Symphony‚Äù. Alfv√©n‚Äôs fourth (‚ÄúFr√•n Havsbandet‚Äù) and Atterberg‚Äôs third (‚ÄúV√§stkustbilder‚Äù) have ocean-inspired titles, as does at least arguably Bantock‚Äôs ‚ÄúHebridean Symphony‚Äù and the title ‚ÄúSinfonia del mare‚Äù has been used by Malipiero, Nystroem and Nystedt. Montsalvatge wrote a Mediterranean Symphony, Langgaard‚Äôs fifteenth is titled ‚ÄúS√∏rstormen‚Äù (translated ‚ÄúStorm at Sea‚Äù) and more recently Williamson‚Äôs second (‚ÄúPilgrim p√• havet‚Äù) and Rasmussen‚Äôs first (‚ÄúOceanic Days‚Äù) have ocean-inspired titles, in addition to Dewey‚Äôs ‚Äúex Oceano‚Äù (on climate change). Moreover, at least Bax‚Äôs fourth and Braga Santos‚Äôs third were explicitly inspired by the sea. There are probably plenty of other examples of ocean-inspired symphonies, aren‚Äôt there?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21NVLDFRSM0HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000AENY#wasThisHelpful","R21NVLDFRSM0HB","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I assume that the Paul Wittgenstein story is familiar enough: Wittgenstein ‚Äì brother of Ludwig and hailing from one of the wealthiest families in Europe ‚Äì lost his right arm in WW1, but decided to continue his career and commissioned concertos and music from Strauss, Britten, Prokofiev, Ravel, Korngold, Hindemith and others. Not a particularly sympathetic character, Wittgenstein insisted on lifetime exclusive performance rights (‚Äúyou don‚Äôt build a house just so that someone else can live in it. I commissioned and paid for the works, the whole idea was mine‚Äù) but still failed to perform many of the works he commissioned ostensibly because he didn‚Äôt like or understand them. Apparently he liked the works composed for him by Franz Schmidt very much, however, and Schmidt‚Äôs output for left hand was accordingly pretty substantial: In addition to the concerto and Concertante variations recorded here, there are three quintets (two with clarinet and string trio) and at least one solo piano work.Well, I don‚Äôt know for sure, but strongly suspect that Schmidt viewed these works as primarily or even purely sources of income. Schmidt‚Äôs best works are masterpieces, but the works here are not among them. That said, the craftsmanship is undeniable, and the Concertante Variations on the scherzo of Beethoven‚Äôs fifth violin sonata are unfailingly charming and delightful; nothing particularly exciting happens and it was evidently written to please Wittgenstein ‚Äì notice for instance how Schmidt carefully avoids letting the orchestra ever overshadow the soloist: It plays relatively quietly throughout and is evidently only there to provide some texture that a left-hand-alone score cannot. This is utility music, and it is hard not to notice the cynicism involved on the composer‚Äôs part to ‚Äì I speculate ‚Äì ensure that his customer (for whom it is hard to have much sympathy) would be satisfied. But as mentioned, it really is pleasant music, flowing nicely from one pretty moment to another completely without care or fear or a dark thought. It is actually worth hearing, though at 30 minutes obviously too long.The concerto is probably a different matter, unfortunately. Composed in 1934, its sound world is admittedly somewhat reminiscent of that of the fourth symphony, which immediately preceded it. But in terms of inspiration the fourth symphony is in a completely different league. The concerto, which goes on for 43 minutes, contains little that is at all memorable ‚Äì at least I could find little; others may disagree. It is heavy, cloudy, ruminating music that meanders around without ever really building up any drama or tension, and the main ideas are not only relatively weak but don‚Äôt ever really go anywhere. Now, I have certainly heard worse music than this, by all means, but for a composer of Schmidt‚Äôs reputation this is on the disappointing side.I suppose, though, that these works are must-haves for fans of the composer (and the variations are enjoyable enough to merit a listen even for the rest). In that respect it is good that they receive the advocacy they do. Markus Becker is a first-rate soloist here, with glitter, sparkle and enthusiasm in the variation and plenty of bravura in the concerto. He is finely supported by the NDR Radiophilharmonie, whose role is often subdued but no less important. The sound is good - the soloist may be somewhat too forwardly placed (I can see why they would do that way, but they exaggerated). I short, it is hard to imagine better advocacy or presentation of this music, but the music itself doesn‚Äôt really warrant an unreserved recommendation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JEQ3JLSXVGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MPHA0S#wasThisHelpful","R27JEQ3JLSXVGR","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Swedish composer Maurice Karkoff (1927-2013) was a productive composer, and I am just going to assume that the disc at hand paints a representative portrait. Apparently the critic Carl-Gunnar ≈hl√©n once wrote that Karkoff‚Äôs symphonies form a canon in the genre that is comparable to that of Allan Pettersson. That is exaggerating, but (at least one of) the two symphonies on this disc does make a case a composer who knew how to turn beautiful but often deeply introverted tone painting in an often uncompromisingly modern language into formally convincing structures. The title work, Sinfonia della vita, which was composed in 1993-94 and was the composer‚Äôs eleventh symphony, and is a case in point. The sound world of the work reminds one perhaps a little of Berg (or Fartein Valen), though it is more modern ‚Äì there is an undeniable romantic sensibility to the music, and a lyrical, melancholic strain running through the whole work. It is actually an impressive and appealing work; more so than the darker Dolorous Symphony (no. 9) for strings, which is dark and brooding and, I would say, sometimes dangerously close to self-parody (which may, perhaps, have been the point).‚ÄúSkuggspel, klara vatten‚Äù reveals a rather different side to the composer ‚Äì the lyrical, introverted character is still there, but these nine Chinese songs (from 1990) for voice and piano are based on Chinese music in melodic character and rhythm; they are, almost surprisingly, basically tonal and many of them almost shimmeringly beautiful. A similar inspiration from far Eastern sources characterize the older piano piece ‚ÄúVid gransen‚Äù (from Orientaliska bilder), but the expression seems less personal. The disc, however, opens with the song cycle ‚ÄúGl√ºhende R√§tsel‚Äù, a decision about which I have to say I have my misgivings; these uncompromising and, frankly, sometimes downright ugly pieces in a much less personal, more generic style inspired by contemporaneous avant-garde music.At his best, however, Karkoff‚Äôs music achieves a certain haunting, introverted beauty that is also quite personal; I recommend sampling Sinfonia della vita and ‚ÄúSkuggspel‚Äù for two very different examples. Still, I honestly think there is a fair bit of late twentieth century music to go through before this one. The performances are good enough, though I think the song-and-piano works would have benefited from a slightly mellower, more refined approach and the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra under Tommy Andersson ‚Äì while overall good ‚Äì lacks the last ounce of brilliance and opulence, I think.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S4FGDFC1XOIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000026B3Y#wasThisHelpful","R3S4FGDFC1XOIY","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, Boris Godunov is one of the greatest operas ever composed (it might, in fact, count as two or three operas given the various versions; all of them are great, though), and Khovanshchina is regularly performed. But Mussorgsky composed other operas as well ‚Äì or rather, he started a couple of other operas: like Khovanshchina, these operas were left unfinished and had to be put in working order by other hands, but have not received anything close to the same amount of attention. Salammbo and The Marriage are relatively early works (recordings exist) but Sorochintsi Fair, based on Gogol‚Äôs short story with the same name, was a project at least started when the composer was at the height of his powers. He completed some numbers (even some of the scoring), but much of the story was admittedly left without music, or just with scattered sketches. Among the things he did manage to do, was to incorporate the Night on the Bald Mountain music and a dream sequence not in the original story (and frankly rather bizarrely tagged onto it). At present the work exists in several completions, and it would have been interesting to compare them since anyone who embarks on the project of completing this work will have to do quite a bit of original work as well. The most famous version is Shebalin‚Äôs, and it is apparently the least interventionist one (I can‚Äôt help but think that I do hear some of Shebalin‚Äôs own voice here, though); one result of being non-interventionist is that the story itself doesn‚Äôt quite add up, but fair enough: I‚Äôve encountered worse in the realm of opera.Well, it is a work that any fan of the composer needs to hear. There are some delightful and fascinating things here, but I sometimes ‚Äì heresy, I know ‚Äì would have preferred a more interventionist approach from Shebalin. There are some very banal and clumsy parts here, too, though the juxtaposition of dark drama and almost vaudeville-like scenes seems to have been deliberate; it‚Äôs after all a comic opera, and one can only imagine the status it might have achieved had Mussorgsky managed to leave a complete or at least almost complete version. The appearance of a crude version of Night on the Bare Mountain is interesting ‚Äì it ends up sounding almost like a parody of itself, and the ending of that sequence is almost more effective than the ending of the work as we know it. The scoring is sometimes borderline amateurish (despite the often-made pleas for authenticity in performance versions of Mussorgsky‚Äôs orchestral works, I have to admit that I understand where Rimsky-Korsakov and his gang were coming from), but overall this is a fascinating and even fun work.Alternative recordings exist. I have not heard those (and as far as I know none of them use the exact same edition), but the one at hand is unfortunately no more than serviceable. The singing barely passes muster, and especially the female singers are problematic, even downright ugly. Partially this seems to be in virtue of conscious decisions, the idea being that these are comic characters in a comic opera and should therefore be sung like caricatures, but even it that (mistaken) decision had not been made, I doubt that Zalizniak‚Äôs Khivrya, for instance, would have been acceptable. Evgeny Brazhnik directs the Chorus and Orchestra of Ekaterinburg State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre of Russia in a performance that similarly sounds as if it tries to underline the comic elements; it‚Äôs brash and forced and rushed (I suppose that‚Äôs one of the reasons why the Night on the Bald Mountain music comes across as something close to a parody) with little atmosphere and sense of majesty, and the orchestral players have serious troubles coping with the interpretative decisions.The sound quality is nothing to write home about either. The singers are far too forwardly placed (it actually varies a bit, but they are at least never integrated into the full sound picture), and the orchestra sounds hollow. Finally, there is the rather important matter of documentation. There is no libretto, only a summary ‚Äì but what we get is a summary of Gogol‚Äôs short story, not Mussorgsky‚Äôs adaptation. And that, of course, makes it well neigh impossible to figure out what is actually going on in the opera ‚Äì you easily figure out that it‚Äôs a comic opera, but it is impossible to determine what the jokes might be. So, in sum, this is a fascinating work well worth discovering, but the present release is, in the end, really no more than serviceable. The extent to which the other existing versions are superior is something I cannot say for sure, however.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H1O4VU7WOXKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH10BGY#wasThisHelpful","R1H1O4VU7WOXKR","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dvorak is usually not considered to have been a very idiomatic composer for the piano, though his best works, the Humoresques op. 101 and the Poetic Tone Pictures op. 85 belong among the greatest masterpieces ever written for the instruments. But the composer was not a virtuoso himself, and his music for the instrument are hardly virtuosic or dramatic (all of his piano works are miniatures), but they are often hauntingly beautiful, reflective and atmospheric ‚Äì and his famous melodic gift is as much on display in these works as it is in his more familiar works. Radoslav Kvapil has helpfully recorded all of it (he might have done it more than once, in fact), and if you just want to sample Dvorak‚Äôs piano output vol. 4 of this series is without the one to go for, though the present volume is an absolutely delightful follow-up.The main offerings are the six mazurkas op. 56 and the Suite op. 98. The latter is, of course, better known in its orchestral version as the ‚ÄúAmerican Suite‚Äù, though I suppose even in orchestral garb it remains among the composer‚Äôs less well-known works ‚Äì it is essentially light music, and the five movements are not linked together in any particular way; yet the music is gloriously atmospheric, sunny and reflective, both in the orchestral version and the original piano one. I am not sure either version is superior, but the piano version is definitely worth hearing. The mazurkas were composed a year after the first series of Slavonic dances, and these six pieces, too, testify to Dvorak‚Äôs seemingly unending supply of gorgeous melodic ideas. Though they do of course owe something to Chopin‚Äôs models, they are also instantly recognizable as Dvorak‚Äôs, and although the technical demands they put on the performer aren‚Äôt particularly daunting they come across as works that would deserve to be far better known.The other pieces on the disc are mostly minor works, but even the smallest trifle contains lovely elements entirely characteristic of the composer. In fact, the smallest of them, the F sharp major Humoresque (nothing to do with the G flat major one) composed in 1884 is, at 2‚Äô35, is a witty and disarmingly charming little gem. The poetic Impromptu, originally published in a humor magazine supplement is less memorable but contains some nice, characteristic touches. The Dumka and Furiant, though given the opus number ‚Äú12‚Äù, actually dates from 1884 as well and was also published in a magazine supplement. The Dumka is a more serious, solemn work the character of which is somewhat reminiscent of the contemporaneous Stabat Mater; the following Furiant is, as expected, as big of a contrast as one could imagine. Though perhaps not exactly among Dvorak's greatest masterpieces these are lovely works, very much worth hearing. Finally we get two small piano pieces dating from the time of the composition of the Humoresques, a lyrical Berceuse and a jolly Capriccio. These are admittedly merely chips from the composer‚Äôs work bench, but even so they have a touch of magic to them.An overall fascinating survey, then, and it should be mentioned that it covers Dvorak‚Äôs stylistic development from the national style of the Slavonic dances to the American or post-American style of his late works ‚Äì albeit in the form of lighter music. While the works here are not quite on the level of the op. 101 Humoresques or the Poetic tone pictures, there are still rewards aplenty, and Radoslav Kvapil plays it all superbly and idiomatically. The sound quality varies a bit (the recordings date from 1967 and 1970), with the Suite becoming a bit constricted. Still, this is an excellent disc, enthusiastically recommended, even if you should pick up vol. 4 first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZROI1D5ZSTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IMSH#wasThisHelpful","R2KZROI1D5ZSTM","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you may already know, George Lloyd (1913-1998) was something of an outsider to the British (and international) musical establishment, as he continued to compose in an idiom that was almost defiantly diatonic and approachable and never afraid of neither heart-on-sleeve emotions or triumphant majesty. But the fact that his basic harmonic palette was rather conservative (even traditionally romantic) does not mean that the music itself is derivative or lack originality or personality ‚Äì quite the contrary. Combined with never-ending imagination and superb craftsmanship (he was, not the least, a wonderful orchestrator), Lloyd‚Äôs music did manage to secure him something of a fan base toward the end of his life, and some of his music comes pretty close to being genuine masterpieces.The seventh symphony might be a case in point. An ambitious work in three movements lasting almost 50 minutes in total, the work was written during 1957-59 and apparently orchestrated in 1974. It was influenced by the story of Proserpine, though one may well suspect a more personal story underneath; it is at least is a darker and more anguished work than most of his other symphonies. The lengthy but tautly constructed first movement builds darkly agitated dance-like material out of the mysterious material of the opening and works itself into a massive climax before receding back into mystery. The Largo movement is wistful, even sorrowful, but often strikingly, nobly beautiful.The opening of the finale, then, is an almost shocking contrast; as if the rug is suddenly pulled out under the world of the Largo. The thematic material is mercilessly destroyed, setting off a blistering build-up of anger and fury that culminates in a thunderous climax followed by a magically beautiful epilogue. It is a tremendous work, and it is ‚Äì as expected ‚Äì superbly performed here by the BBC Philharmonic under the composer himself, and they are recorded in warm, clear sound. Yes, the disc comes in at under 50 minutes of total playing time, but it is such a powerful work that one cannot really complain. Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFJLGE2W6NVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000049M0#wasThisHelpful","R1MFJLGE2W6NVY","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For those already attuned to the idiom, this is still a fascinating disc. Lloyd‚Äôs twelfth and final symphony does have a valedictory feel, but it is a warm and overall friendly farewell; final thoughts and remainders rather than something new and novel and important. Pairing it with the first symphony is a good idea, however: Though Lloyd‚Äôs idiom remained approachable and listener-friendly, it certainly evolved over the course of his career and the twelfth is definitely a more personal creation than the first, but the two works also retain a formal kinship (deliberately so): Both works consist of a theme and variations followed by a slow movement and an energetic finale (though the twelfth is over twice as long).Personally I found the first symphony endearing; true, the idiom owes a lot to, say, Vaughan Williams and Dyson and other composers of the turn-of-the-century British school(s), and there are some awkward transitions (it was written when the composer was 19), but it also has a kind of breezy boldness that puts to mind Bruckner‚Äôs first. Of course, the twelfth is in a different league with regard to formal security and the composer‚Äôs ability to utilize the full resources of the orchestra. It is also far more individual in character; yet overall I thought it missed the thematic strength of Lloyd‚Äôs best works and, indeed, even of its companion work. In any case the performances by the Albany Symphony Orchestra under the composer himself are first-rate and the sound is very good. Definitely worth adding to your collection, but newcomers to the composer should probably start elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKI25RDHJR2YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000049LB#wasThisHelpful","RKI25RDHJR2YP","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the late 19th and early 20th century George Chadwick was one of the foremost representatives of American romanticism, but like all of them ‚Äì perhaps with the exception of MacDowell ‚Äì his name faded into obscurity where is languished until the last decade of the 20th century. His music is not particularly original ‚Äì that seems to have been part of the code for this group of composers (and which may have been part of what gave rise to the extreme originality of Ives and the American ultramodernists) - and it owes a lot to Liszt, Dvorak and possibly Chadwick‚Äôs own teachers, Rheinberger and Jadassohn. Though he may not have been a first-rate melodist, Chadwick‚Äôs scores are endlessly inventive, atmospheric and finely scored; they also requires a touch of fairy magic, full-blooded strings and dramatic momentum, which they rarely receive in sufficient degree in recordings. Jos√© Serebrier and the Czech State PO do seem to have many of the right ideas, but the playing isn‚Äôt quite as refined in the reflective movements or ferociously driven in the faster parts as the music needs, but the competition isn‚Äôt too fierce either.The Symphonic Sketches (1895-1905) consist of four movements with the kind of romantically picturesque titles that alone would explain why Chadwick‚Äôs music fell out of favor in the mid-twentieth century. Jubilee is an energetic and engaging movement written in mid-Dvorak style. Noel is unapologetically sentimental (tongue in cheek?), while Hobgoblin, though I see what the composer was going for, is not particularly successful. A Vagrom Ballad is endlessly inventive and attractive, however. The Melpomene overture is one of many Chadwick works on Greek themes, and while engaging and enjoyable while it lasts, it is frustratingly impossible to remember anything whatsoever of the music when it is over.Tam O‚ÄôShanter, however, is a riot. A phantasmagorical symphonic poem, it may be based on some pretty simple ideas, but it moves through a magnificent array of moods, atmospheres and nature painting, all the while generating more and more energy. It is definitely worth discovering, and although the playing tends to be a bit rough when the temperature is turned up, this is probably worth the price of the disc on its own. So, while not everything about this disc is ideal it deserves, in the end, a firm recommendation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCE35QONDTYIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000159Z#wasThisHelpful","RCE35QONDTYIV","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most of the music of Jean Cras (1879-1932) is now available on disc, which is as it should be, I suppose. A dozen or so of the songs with orchestra recorded here are also available in their original versions for voice and piano; I haven‚Äôt heard those, but I would imagine that they have gained something (or at least been substantially transformed) from the composer‚Äôs very effective orchestration. Stylistically, Cras‚Äôs language is late romantic, owing something to Chausson and his friend Duparc, but there is also a Breton element that he shares with, say, Ropartz and certainly more than a touch of impressionism; the later works on this disc also seem to be a little more harmonically complex (Ravel, but also something slightly more acerbic), although the overall tone is still one of delectably atmospheric late romanticism ‚Äì but the program is variegated, and the atmosphere and sound world vary quite a bit between the collections of songs here.The opening set of four √âl√©gies was originally written for voice and orchestra, and are lush, opulent and shimmeringly beautiful, almost a bit over the top. A significant contrast, then, to the sparer, halflit and gloomier soundworld of the following three songs accompanied by string quartet, arrangements of relatively early songs ‚Äì effective enough, but best if not heard right after the √âl√©gies. L‚ÄôOffrande lyrique is a setting of six Tagore poems, originally with piano, and replaces the eternity-and-the-sea mood of the √âl√©gies with a somewhat more exotic, mysterious and introvert mood. The five songs comprising Fontaines also originated as piano-accompanied songs, but Cras seems to have had a field day scoring them ‚Äì this is imaginative and very effectively done. In the pleasant Image we return to string quartet accompaniment, and the final No√´ls, originally choral works, are full of na√Øve, pastoral, rustic charm, apparently set with no apparent intent of avoiding sentimentality, but the results are very charming.As pointed out by the other reviewer, the singing is somewhat variable. Philippe Do sounds better suited to opera than to song, and lacks warmth and the kind of intimate expressiveness with which the √âl√©gies should (to my ears) ideally be sung; it‚Äôs not bad - the phrasing is admirable and the diction good - it‚Äôs just not ideal. Lionel Peintre sounds like his songs suit him better and Ingrid Perruche is overall very good even if there is a certain lack of nuance in her characterizations. The Orchestre de Bretagne plays well and idiomatically under Claude Schnitzler, though the tone is perhaps not quite as rich as one might have ideally hoped for ‚Äì it is, however, probably as good as one could reasonably expect. The sound is a bit dry as well, but not really a problem. Overall, despite a few caveats regarding the performances and production this is a very recommendable release to anyone interested in French late romanticism.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJHUWY4F6LKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VCAC76#wasThisHelpful","R2JJHUWY4F6LKW","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Timpani has done a lot for the music of Joseph-Guy Ropartz (1864-1955) who otherwise seems to have managed to retain a toehold in the repertoire mostly through some chamber works, an EMI recording of his third symphony and a Naxos release of choral works. I am not sure his opera Les Pays is the ideal starting point for exploring his output, but it is an impressive work very much worth checking out. Stylistically, Ropartz‚Äôs music is late romantic with a touch of impressionist harmonies and a firm basis in Breton musical traditions ‚Äì if you have encountered the music of Lazzari, Cras or Ladmirault, you would have an idea (though the chance that you have encountered any of the music of those composers is, I suppose, lower than the chance that you‚Äôve encountered Ropartz‚Äôs); in this opera in particular I am also occasionally reminded of Chausson‚Äôs Le Roi Arthus (Les Pays actually strikes me frankly as more variegated and effective than Le Roi Arthus) and ‚Äì perhaps surprisingly ‚Äì the tone poems of Arnold Bax, which generally postdate Ropartz‚Äôs opera.Indeed, ‚ÄúLe Pays‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Country‚Äù), the title of the opera, refers to Brittany ‚Äì the story (Le Goffic‚Äôs ‚ÄúL‚ÄôIslandaise‚Äù, from a collection titled ‚ÄúPassions Celte‚Äù) follows Breton fishermen braving the stormy waters off the coast of Iceland and experience a shipwreck, whereupon the anti-hero Tual falls in love with a local girl, marries her and promises to stay; upon spring, however, he feels the call of his native land and set out to join his fellow Bretons to return ‚Äì the call is too strong for him to stay with his pregnant wife, and he sneaks away, which is not a good idea. The music is in a sense dramatic, but Ropartz tends to add a certain dreamy softness ‚Äì it‚Äôs deeply evocative, but even the dramatic Icelandic landscape and the drama of the story are shrouded in a haze of tragic mystique. Though the overall character of the work is lyric and tragic, it does move effectively forward; the drama is relatively lowkey but there is this sense of inevitability to the proceedings. Overall very convincing, but the work also contains plenty of individually striking things along the way, especially in some of the stirring, atmospheric orchestral passages. Indeed, it is really the orchestra more than what the characters sing that carry the story. To retain the essence and feel of the story Ropartz also decided to forego standard elements of French opera, including set pieces and even the chorus.As for the performances, Mireille Delunsch should be a reasonably familiar name, and she is a world-class singer who turns in an excellent performance here ‚Äì not only splendidly sung, but with an ability to draw intense sympathy for her character K√¶the. Gilles Ragon may be more famous for his work in music from earlier periods, but seems well adapted to Ropartz‚Äôs late romanticism and gives us a very convincing performance of the role of Tual. No complaints about Olivier Lallouette as J√∂rgen either (and yes, those are all the characters), and the Orchestre Philharmonique de Luxembourg plays generally very well under Jean-Yves Ossonce, though one could ‚Äì if one were churlish ‚Äì perhaps note that Ossonce tends to play things big and spacious and ask for a bit more intimacy. Is this set good enough for five stars? Just the effort of assembling a solid cast and orchestra to record an opera by Ropartz goes a long way. And when the results are as successful as they are (no complaints about the recorded sound either), and we ‚Äì importantly ‚Äì get a full libretto with English translation, the answer is surely ""yes"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XOXY0I1C64H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000060P5M#wasThisHelpful","R2XOXY0I1C64H","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It never rains but it pours. Vytautas Bacevicius (1905-1970) was a Lithuanian composer who spent the last part of his career in the US. (He was also, it seems, the brother of Grazyna Bacewicz. Huh.) His music was for the most part ignored then, and it remained ignored until recently, when Toccata Classics issued two discs of his music and Naxos suddenly embarked on a series of his orchestral works. Well, it is not entirely undeserved ‚Äì Bacevicius has something of an individual style that, on the evidence of this disc, evolved quite a bit over his career yet retained certain signature traits. The music here is hard, belligerent, craggy and raucous, with the early works sounding a bit like a mix between Scriabin and Honegger (or perhaps rather Milhaud) and the later perhaps a bit like something in the direction of Var√©se.To start with the earliest work here, the one-movement Piano Concerto no. 1 (1929) is subtitled ‚ÄúSur les th√®mes lituaniens‚Äù though, apparently like other listeners, fail to hear much I recognize as folk music influences (perhaps it‚Äôs in part due to my unfamiliarity with Lithuanian folk music). It‚Äôs a short work (14 minutes) indebted to Scriabin but rather more modern, and, I have to admit, not really a work that sticks in the memory. The Po√®me √©lectrique from three years later shows a rather substantial stylistic and harmonic development. This is a work belonging to the ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù machine music style exhibited by e.g. Honegger‚Äôs Pacific 231 or Prokofiev‚Äôs music of the time, and is one that sacrifices everything in favor of power and forward momentum ‚Äì ugly and colorful and dramatic, and quite spectacular if a bit superficial and not quite as memorable as the best works associated with that trend.Honegger is also brought to mind in the second symphony, composed in 1940 and given the subtitle ‚ÄúDella Guerra‚Äù. It‚Äôs a passionate if somewhat brutalistic work that rejects any kind of lyricism, with a first movement depicting the bombing of Poland, the second the sorrow and tragedy of war (rather impressive) and the third the battle for Europe. It‚Äôs not quite as forward-looking as the Po√®me √©lectrique, but quite effective and perhaps the strongest work on this disc overall. The sixth symphony, from 1960, is more harmonically advanced, containing little by way of melody (not that the earlier works focus much on melody either) and at least borders on rejecting tonality altogether, but it is a concentrated and overall well-constructed work. With Graphique, from 1964, we encounter an exploration of sonorities in a style closer to the avant-garde, at least something occasionally resembling late Var√©se; once again an overall moderately impressive work if not a masterpiece.The performances are certainly serviceable, if occasionally a bit rough and raw ‚Äì but then, this is music that requires raw power more than finesse or brilliance. The sound is a tad dry but at least allows you to hear all the details. A very recommendable release for those with a sense of adventure, certainly, though if I were to decide I think I would have recommended record companies to check out some other little-known Lithuanian composers from Bacevicius‚Äôs generation (Abelis Klenickis, Antanas Raciunas or Stasis Vainiunas, for instance) before launching competing series of Bacevicius‚Äôs works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JGEV63LWLO1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P29AX6#wasThisHelpful","R2JGEV63LWLO1L","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent disc from one of the best mezzosopranos working during the last couple of decades. It does also, I suppose, present a nice survey of Tchaikovsky‚Äôs songs (of which there is quite a number, few of which are well-known) and includes at least the two most famous ones, ‚ÄúNone but the lonely heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúOnce Again, Alone‚Äù ‚Äì and the selection consists of songs from both early in his career (the 1869 set including ‚ÄúNone but the lonely heart‚Äù) and late ones. However, I would warn against listening through this disc in one go ‚Äì these songs are pretty much all rather dark and sad and slow, focusing on loneliness, regret, sorrow and longing. Taken a few at a time, on the other hand, virtually every single one comes across as a marvelous gem.That‚Äôs not the least because of the performances. Though most people will, I suppose, best know Olga Borodina from opera, these performances suggest that her talents are just as well if not even better suited to songs; it is hard not to be impressed vividness with which she characterizes the emotional contents of the songs, and the subtle variety in mood she finds across the songs here. Larissa Gergieva is the sister of Valery Gergiev, but as opposed to what you might expect from that, her performances are reflective and lyrical and occasionally almost reticent. In fact, Borodina and Gergieva take these songs pretty slowly but their artistry is definitely up to the challenge this presents.Indeed, Borodina and Gergieva have chosen an exceptionally dark and serious and emotionally replete approach to songs that are already as haunting and dark as any in the repertoire ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty remarkable how well they bring the listener along and manage to avoid any sense of self-parody. And in the final three songs they go even further; in ‚ÄúNight‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Sun Has Set‚Äù Borodina‚Äôs voice takes on even darker hues than before, and in the final, familiar ‚ÄúAgain, as before, alone‚Äù she sounds like death itself ‚Äì all light and hope is gone and one is left with such pain and horror that the result is almost unbearable; it‚Äôs the kind of thing that demands a long period of reflective silence after the end of the recital. A remarkable performance in a collection of remarkable performances. The sound quality is very good.

"Rued Langgaard was, famously, a strange figure, and as a composer he is almost impossible to pigeon-hole. His famous ‚ÄúMusic of the Spheres‚Äù sounds almost like it belongs to the experimental avant-garde of the 60s (and was famously praised by Ligeti), and elsewhere in his oeuvre there is plenty of strikingly forward-looking music; at other times ‚Äì and sometimes in the same work ‚Äì much of the thematic material would have sounded conservative to Brahms or even Schumann. For the most part it's like late-romanticism refracted through madness, but although the music sounds deranged to the extent that one sometimes suspects that Langgaard was, indeed, crazy, there is a purpose to his solutions, and there is no doubting his technical skills.One thing that strikes one when listening to Langgaard‚Äôs music, including the three works here, is his special relationship with form. I don‚Äôt think one should listen to these symphonies as if they were through-composed, unified narratives; indeed, despite the essentially romantic character of these works, you won‚Äôt really find melodies in the traditional sense either ‚Äì at least not melodies that are developed in any ordinary sense. Instead, Langgaard uses building blocks identified by style or tone or a certain idea; whether these blocks then fit together in any ordinary manner seems to have been less of a concern.Another thing to keep in mind is that although these symphonies have (evocative?) titles ‚Äì as do the individual movements of no 4 ‚Äì it is unclear whether one should take them too seriously. Langgaard tended to add such titles to his works often long after the work was finished, and sometimes changed them later to something completely different. That said, the fourth symphony is titled ‚Äúfall of the leaves‚Äù, and it does indeed have a sort of autumnal quality (at least much of it does) ‚Äì a rather stormy, autumnal quality ‚Äì and certainly something very picturesque about the movements, though there is certainly a variety of moods expressed here. Overall, it must rank as one of the most immediately approachable of Langgaard‚Äôs symphonies, though not all of the movements are equally successful.The fifth has the subtitle ‚ÄúSteppelands‚Äù, though it is only the outer movements (which do evoke a feeling of a breeze or storm over a steppe landscape) that, to my ears, really fit that description. Overall, I don‚Äôt think this is one of Langgaard‚Äôs best works, however ‚Äì like many other of his symphonies there is little traditional development here rather than various episodes that only nominally fit together, but only a few of these episodes sound really inspired to me. The sixth symphony, however, is pretty remarkable. This work, like many of the composer‚Äôs, has a religious inspiration ‚Äì and a pretty apocalyptic one, at that (though the work is not really particularly dark). Given the title ‚ÄúThe Heaven Storming‚Äù, it is certainly a dramatic work, even though it eschews traditional symphonic development ‚Äì but as opposed to the other works, it is formally relatively tight; what underlies the proceedings is a sort of variation-form based on a theme played twice at the beginning, one idyllic and pastoral version and one rather ominous and ghostly one. Perhaps surprisingly, the tauter form of the work makes the work sound more modern than its two companions.I am not entirely sure I am completely sold on the performances. The Danish National Radio Symphony Orchestra certainly plays pretty excellently, and J√§rvi does succeed in whipping up plenty of drama and energy. But he also pushes the music quite hard, and I suspect there is more details in and variety between the movements in the sixth symphony than J√§rvi manages to bring out here (on the other hand, it is certainly stormy). Still, the fourth symphony manages to combine wistfulness and punch and I don‚Äôt think the feeling of waywardness in the fifth can be blamed on the conductor ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt heard the various alternatives available of these works, however. The Chandos sounds is very good, and overall this disc can be safely recommended to anyone with a sense of adventure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30N133C93GKVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000APJ#wasThisHelpful","R30N133C93GKVF","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though it is billed as ‚Äúvol. 1‚Äù this disc really contains all of Bartok‚Äôs major works for violin and piano ‚Äì four major masterpieces, and in excellent performances and recording. The two rhapsodies are good and accessible examples of what Bartok did with (Hungarian) folk music, and although I must say that I prefer the orchestral versions, the violin-and-piano versions do reveal details and connections that one might otherwise miss, and do, I admit, allow for a kind of fierce abandon in the performances that is hard to accomplish with more than two players ‚Äì and Ehnes and Armstrong give you everything you‚Äôd want. What‚Äôs listed as ‚ÄúAlternative Ending‚Äù for part II of the first rhapsody is, in fact, the more familiar (and, honestly, effective) version.The two sonatas date from the early twenties, when Bartok‚Äôs style was at its wildest and perhaps most complex ‚Äì at least the two sonatas belong to his most harmonically and structurally complex works; they‚Äôre ‚Äì at least compared to the rhapsodies ‚Äì certainly not easy listening, but, boy, how one‚Äôs efforts and concentration are rewarded. I have no problem judging these two be among the greatest violin sonatas ever written. Though the music is tonal, both works are highly dissonant, powerful and even aggressive, but beyond that the two works are also pretty contrasted in character. The first is in a traditional three-movement form, with a ferocious and flickering first movement, a lyrical second movement and a barbaric third. The second is cast in one movement and is quite compact ‚Äì perhaps even structurally ‚Äúdense‚Äù ‚Äì but in two distinguishable section, the first one slow and the second faster. As a bonus we also get the pleasant, little and rather untypical AndanteNow, there are admittedly a number of first-rate recordings of the main works on this disc out there; yet I don‚Äôt think Ehnes and Armstrong (the piano usually plays an equal part in these works) need fear the competition overly much. I suppose one could say that they strike something of a middle ground between the more transparent and accessible approach of Tetzlaff and Andsnes, and the most fiery ones, such as the old and legendary performance of the second sonata by Szigeti and the composer himself. If so, the present performances do not feel at all like a compromise; this is wonderful, powerful, fierce but nuanced playing of the highest caliber. The sound is very good.

"Franz Schmidt may have been an important symphonist (he was), but his first symphony is no masterpiece. An early work, it was completed when the composer was 22, and exhibits exuberance and, I suppose, youthful energy, and it is surely an assured work from a young composer. The language is even rather personal ‚Äì eclectic, to be sure, but it strikes me as an interesting and somewhat attempt to combine Schumann and Bruckner, with some clever and rather successful solutions. On the downside there are few really memorable things, especially beyond the first movement, and, more problematically, Schmidt‚Äôs narratives tend to get bogged down in some heavy fugal writing, in particular in the finale. It is certainly a work worth hearing, but it is more of an interesting and occasionally rewarding curiosity that puts Schmidt‚Äôs later development in context rather than a completely successful work in its own right.The indefatigable Neeme J√§rvi seems bent on recording everything, and he often secures first-rate performances for neglected or little-known repertoire. Sometimes, however, he seems to have too little time for preparation or thinking too deeply about the repertoire he records, and this recording strikes me, unfortunately, as a case in point. It‚Äôs not bad ‚Äì it never is with J√§rvi ‚Äì but it is also rather workmanlike, and the music is often too hard pressed, with too little attention to detail; the performance here seems to have the goal in sight from the very first bars, and takes the straightest path there without bothering too much about the subtleties or views along the way. That said, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra responds, in general, well, with plenty of punch and energy. Nonetheless, this strikes me as a serviceable performance rather than anything close to an ideal one. I have no idea what the point of the coupling might be: Four Interludes from Richard Strauss‚Äôs Intermezzo that makes less than perfect sense shorn of their context played with noise and superficiality, steeliness instead of opulence. The sound is decent, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BR3S06C94EU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AWL#wasThisHelpful","R2BR3S06C94EU8","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rimsky-Korsakov‚Äôs one-acter Kashchey the Immortal is, like several of his operas, based on a Russian fairytale. It was completed in 1902, around the time he lost his professorship at the Conservatory due to political activism, and a student performance of the work was followed by a political demonstration and, subsequently, a ban on performances of Rimsky‚Äôs music (quickly lifted due to political pressure). Well, like his other fairytale operas Khaschey does contain hints of social commentary, I guess, but it is certainly not as overt here as in some others. What is clear, is that Khaschey is otherwise crammed with action, and I imagine it may be dramatically pretty effective.Musically it shows, perhaps more than many of his other operas, an influence of Wagner. The whole score is based on a few leitmotifs for characters and emotions, but the score is rich and variegated with plenty of marvelous touches and clever solutions ‚Äì the blizzard scene being a notable example ‚Äì and Rimsky‚Äôs harmonic palette is, it seems, somewhat more advanced than in many of his other works. Of course, there is no time to dawdle ‚Äì despite all the details and twists everything has to fit in an hour ‚Äì and sometimes the scenes border on being too compressed (not usually a big problem in opera). One thing that is perhaps missing is any particularly memorable melodies ‚Äì still, the whole thing is a blast.As for the performances, I find Konstantin Pluzhnikov in the title role very impressive. He sings the role with a lighter touch and a bit of humor, which is entirely apt. Marina Shaguch sings beautifully ‚Äì perhaps some might say she is a bit too one-dimensional the fairy-tale princess she portrays, but contrast is effectively provided by the rich tone of Larissa Diadkova and the result is entirely convincing. There is perhaps a bit less contrast between Alexander Gergalov and Alexander Morozov, but that would also be the only criticism I could level against their impressive singing.As usual, Gergive pushes the Kirov Orchestra and chorus very hard, and the performance is perhaps stronger on white-hot intensity than fairytale atmosphere ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know how he compares with the other two recordings of the work, but it is a convincing interpretation in its own right (though I do think I would have chosen slightly more atmosphere over intensity if given the choice). The recording is excellent, at least. In sum, this is a fascinating, exciting score, and although I am perhaps not Gergiev‚Äôs biggest fan, with singing and advocacy like this it is hard to justify anything less than a top score for this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6PU68TJLF17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y3DWIC#wasThisHelpful","RD6PU68TJLF17","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elgar wrote quite a lot of music reflecting WW1, or for various occasional purposes related to the war, and Somm has usefully gathered together some really obscure and some slightly better known works on this disc. It is a must for committed fans of the composer, but not all of the works here are, shall we say, top-drawer Elgar. The aching, haunting Sospiri is the most familiar piece here, and an unqualified little masterpiece (and it is also rapturously played here by the BBC Concert Orchestra under John Wilson), and it is, honestly, in a different league compared to the rest of the program - something you will probably hear from the first note.That said, the symphonic poem Polonia is very fine work as well. A tribute to the people of Poland, Polonia mixes music by Chopin and Paderewski with patriotic themes, and although there is a bit of bombast here, surely, Elgar could do bombast pretty well without crossing the line to banality. It is also well played, though there is a celebrated Boult recording out there that, as far as I remember, is even more stirring. The other major work, The Sanguine Fan, was a ballet written for a charity concert and although it is perhaps not top-drawer Elgar either, it is enjoyable enough with enough variety, nuance and substance to sustain its duration.The three works for Belgium (inspired by the poems about the country‚Äôs suffering by Emile Cammaerts) are pretty vapid, however ‚Äì but then Elgar didn‚Äôt have the format, narration with orchestra, on his side. Carillon and Le Drapeau Belge are strictly for completists ‚Äì almost embarrassing, I would say. The gloomy Une Voix dans le D√©sert is hardly a great piece either, but at least Susan Gritton does her best to bring light and hope to the scene. Of the three small pieces, Carissima is a lighter, sepia-tinted, nostalgic and ‚Äì I suppose ‚Äì pretty little trifle, and Sursum corda (an 1894 work that doesn‚Äôt really have much to do with the war apart, perhaps, from the mood) is touching. Rosemary (a waltz) is very, very slight, however.In sum, then, this is, indeed, a very valuable collection, even if the musical quality is not consistently first-rate (or even second-rate). The performances are inspired, however, and the sound quality is good. Recommended, though perhaps mostly for already committed fans of the composer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131B89JYDTUZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MOIQ6U#wasThisHelpful","R131B89JYDTUZK","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The more I hear of his music the more I become convinced that Erich Zeisl (1905-1959) is one of the most seriously neglected composers of the first half of the twentieth century. Zeisl was one of many Austrian Jews who left for America in the 1930s, and like his compatriot Korngold he ended up in Hollywood ‚Äì though his success there was definitely eclipsed by Korngold‚Äôs (and by Zeisl‚Äôs own pupil Jerry Goldsmith). Korngold may be an apt starting point for describing Zeisl‚Äôs musical style as well; it is rooted in romanticism, but there is less champagne and glitter than in Korngold‚Äôs music; it is in one sense more ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù, but at the same time more stylistically daring and unconventional. Korngold leavened with Hindemith, perhaps. Or perhaps Miklos Rozsa might be a better comparison, though Zeisl does ultimately not really sound anything like Rozsa. ‚ÄúEclectic‚Äù might be a fitting description as well, but if it is eclectic (and Pierrot in der Flasche certainly goes through a dizzying array of musical styles) the different influences are also melded together into a unified, personal style that is at the same time recognizable and novel.The piano concerto is a major find; marvelously inventive and finely constructed with a spacious, flowing and memorable opening movement, a wonderfully wistfully reflective second movement and a spectacularly enjoyable finale. Yes, much of it is borderline kitschy in the way Korngold‚Äôs music often is, but it never crosses that border and has a tinge of reflective dreaminess that Korngold does not ‚Äì and while the tonal language is rooted in romanticism it is certainly spiced up with some (slightly honed down) angularity and modern effects.Zeisl wrote a number of ballets and Pierrot in der Flasche is a relatively early one (from 1929, though the suite we get here was put together in 1935). It‚Äôs a phantasmagorical, hallucinatory riot. Stylewise it touches on pretty much everything imaginable ‚Äì the setting is modern and urban, illustrated by jazz and contemporary popular music influences, but it contains an extended fantasy setting involving all sorts of fantastic imagery, and in the music there is everything from fake orientalism, blues, Straussian schmaltz to Schrekerian hysteria and elements that don't really sound like anything I recognize, all ‚Äì amazingly ‚Äì put together in something that‚Äôs almost a coherent whole. In any case, it‚Äôs one of the most hilariously enjoyable things I have heard in a while.The performers sound like they agree. The Vienna Radio Symphony performs these works superbly under Johannes Wildner, with all the energy, color, opulence, feeling and imagination one could dream of, and Gottlieb Wallisch is a first-rate soloist in the concerto. The recording is amply spacious, rich and full but clear. Enthusiastically recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0DN68XUCL7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OQDRQO#wasThisHelpful","RG0DN68XUCL7F","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ernst Pepping (1901-1981) enjoyed a career as one of the most important composers of Protestant church music in the 20th century, and seems to have had quite an influence in his time, mostly through his choral and organ music. It is rarely heard these days, as far as I can tell, but cpo should be commended for this collection of his most significant orchestral works. Pepping‚Äôs three symphonies were composed between 1932 and 1944, which would be after he had set aside his earlier ‚Äúuncompromising dissonance‚Äù. And indeed, the style is rather toothless, though it may have appealed to authorities at the time; the second symphony was even recorded by the Berlin Philharmonic under Furtw√§ngler in 1943, a recording that has been intermittently available.The style of these works actually remind one a bit of social realist works; not so much in actual sound world as in the obvious attempt to be listener-friendly and avoid confrontation. All the works here are basically neo-classical and diatonic with just the occasional dissonance thrown in to spice things up. Given the composer‚Äôs background in choral music it is hardly surprising that the music relies a lot on counterpoint, but the textures never clog; the downside is that there is little drama or tension, but nor is there much sense of grandeur and ambition ‚Äì it is really all very nice, easily diverting music that chugs pleasantly along. But although there are few particularly memorable points of interest, there is exactly enough for the listener‚Äôs attention not to flag: these works are, indeed, enjoyable, clean, bright and variegated enough to sustain interest.More precisely, the first and third symphonies are both carefree and happy works; the second is darker. That doesn‚Äôt mean that it contains more drama, however; just that the atmosphere is gloomier and occasionally somewhat oppressive. And to be perfectly honest, I prefer Pepping in a happier mood ‚Äì though not by much, I would actually choose the third symphony as my favorite of the works here. The piano concerto from 1950 really is more of the same: cheerful (though somewhat introvert) and contrapuntal neo-classicism that plays around with its own material with just enough ingenuity to leave a positive overall impression.No masterpieces, then, and little to challenge the listener, yet it is enjoyable enough to merit a listen if you like, say, Hindemith or Blacher. The performances by the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie under Werner Andreas Albert appear to do the music justice (I haven‚Äôt actually heard the Furtw√§ngler recording of the second), and Volker Banfield provides as spirited a performance of the solo part in the concerto as it would be reasonable to hope for. In short, I would recommend this release (and look forward to cpo ‚Äì or anyone else ‚Äì exploring the music of, say, Hans Friedrich Micheelsen, Richard Mohaupt, Kurt Thomas or Johannes Driessler), but if you should miss it your life would probably not be very substantially poorer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RZOUC8059483/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F6YWNK#wasThisHelpful","R2RZOUC8059483","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both of Saint-Sa√´ns‚Äôs string quartets are late works (1899 and 1918, respectively), and probably not among his more familiar works (or even more familiar chamber works). To be honest, I don‚Äôt think the quartets are quite up there with some of his chamber works with piano; the piano seems to have allowed Saint-Sa√´ns let the music flow more freely ‚Äì both string quartets contain passages that sound a bit effortful compared to the composers output in general ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean that there are no musical rewards to be had here. In the e minor quartet I find the first two movements to be the strongest, being based on strong and interesting ideas and plenty of ingenuity; the slow movement strikes me as meandering and the finale a bit lacking in good ideas (though Saint-Sa√´ns could always rely on solid craftsmanship to drive his points home). It is still a rewarding work overall, by all means ‚Äì and quite a bit darker than one may have expected from the composer ‚Äì though not quite on the level of, say, the Franck quartet (of which I am occasionally reminded).The second quartet, in G major, was (apparently) written toward the end of World War I, when the composer was plagued by the effects of the war as well as anxiety about and (it seems) pessimism about the future. That seems to be why he chose to write the first movement in a very Mozartian style reminiscent of the music he wrote in his youth, and the second movement to be a sad response to the loss of that youth (though Saint-Sa√´ns seems, in that case, to have been unable to avoid a bit of self-aware humor). The third movement is primarily a bridge to a moderately effective but a bit nondescript finale. It is an occasionally fascinating work, but one does sometimes get the feeling that Saint-Sa√´ns was tired of it all, that he realized that his best music was behind him, leaving him to offer wry commentaries on his earlier successes.I have few complaints about the performances; the Miami quartet‚Äôs sound is vibrant and full-bodied and they make what sounds to me as the best possible cases for the Saint-Sa√´ns works. As for the companion work, Faur√©‚Äôs late, single quartet is a masterpiece, or at least a near-masterpiece (the piano quintets, cello sonatas and second violin sonata are probably even better) in his typical and utterly captivating late style. Here, however, I do feel that the Miami quartet perhaps lacks the last little ounce of dreamlike, wistful, autumnal magic I think can be realized in the work ‚Äì it‚Äôs a very good performance, to be sure, but my standards for what late Faur√© can sound like are pretty high. So to conclude, the disc contains two excellent performances of good but not great works, and one near-excellent performance of a marvelous work. The sound quality is superb, however.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CGR3BBWDEE1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000024EQ#wasThisHelpful","R1CGR3BBWDEE1Y","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not sure how popular Otto Nicolai‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Merry Wives of Windsor‚Äù actually is anymore, at least outside of Germany (in fact, it seems that record companies have been more interested in exploring the rest of Nicolai‚Äôs output), but it is one of those classic operas that even if it (perhaps like Gustave Charpentier‚Äôs Louise or Flotow‚Äôs Martha) isn‚Äôt particularly frequently staged these days, still deserves a first-rate recording. In fact, it is probably safe to say that this opera is doomed and will never regain its previous status: It‚Äôs a singspiel, and that means that the story is carried by lots of spoken dialogue ‚Äì which is necessary for the drama but also makes some of the passages rather boring. The present version dutifully includes all the dialogue, but it‚Äôs relatively easy to skip if you want to (I suppose the ideal solution in my view is to print it in the booklet but not record it).The music, though, is delightful; from the still relatively familiar overture and all the way through, Nicolai‚Äôs score is brimful of ideas, excellent tunes and a joie-de-vivre surpassing almost anything else ‚Äì it really is a feast for anyone enjoying a sparkling, jolly and brilliant comedic opera. How actually funny it is may be a different matter, but Gottlob Frick certainly tries his best as Falstaff, turning in a performance so colorful and convincing that I imagine it would be hard for me to enjoy anyone else in the role (if I ever get the chance). EMI‚Äôs cast, however, is pretty much excellent throughout even if it is Frick who tends to steal the show.The Chor der Bayerischen Staatsoper M√ºnchen and the Bayerisches Staatsorchester turn in generally first-rate performances as well under the ever-dependable (inspired, actually) direction of Robert Heger, full of wit, sparkle and dramatic momentum. And though the recording dates from 1963 the sound is pretty excellent. The only minor drawback, I suppose, is that the libretto is given in German only ‚Äì there are extended synopses in English and French, but that‚Äôs not quite the same.

"Brahms‚Äôs two late string quintets (the earlier piano quintet also started out as a string quintet) for 2 violins, 2 violas and cello are probably his best chamber works for strings alone, though they are not really that well served on disc. The first quintet was composed in 1882 and is cast in three movements, the first a generally gloriously joyous Allegro non troppo ma con brio, the second a deeply poignant slow movement with two livelier interludes and a wonderfully heartfelt ending and a dancing, songful and superbly crafted finale. The second quintet, composed in 1890, is in four movements; the first movement contains a particularly superb second subject; the slow movement is almost a self-standing work based on an initially ghostly motif for the viola that is masterly developed to a glorious conclusion; the third movement is a kind of yearning minuet and the finale again dance-like, though less outgoing than the finale of the earlier work.The performances here, though, are not unproblematic. There is already a debate over whether Trampler is playing in tune ‚Äì perhaps he is, and perhaps it is partially the use of vibrato that is putting me off, but the results don‚Äôt sound as beautifully textured as I think they could ‚Äì the wistfulness of the op. 111 third movement, for instance, is missing, and the second movement certainly is rather far from sublime ‚Äì as others have pointed out, the players don‚Äôt really achieve ‚Äúan ideal blend‚Äù. That said, the sound of the Juilliard Quartet is full-bloodied and they succeed rather well in the stormier passages. Perhaps it is just my awareness of the discussion that makes it sound to me as if Trampler is the main problem; perhaps it is just that the sound is less than ideal. Oh well, I shouldn‚Äôt exaggerate ‚Äì these are still very rewarding recordings, especially in the faster movements. As such, I am willing to recommend this release, though with some caveats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UNSTKFICVSSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002C16#wasThisHelpful","R3UNSTKFICVSSU","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beyond his operas Richard Wagner did, in fact, write a number of orchestral works. Apart from the Siegfried-Idyll and the Wesendonck-lieder they are usually overlooked and of questionable quality with most (including some later works such as the Kaisermarch or the American Centennial March) being rather strikingly bad. The 14-minute fragment for the Beethoven-inspired Symphony in E major from 1834 (not the same as the slightly more familiar completed C major Symphony), is perhaps not strikingly bad, but far from distinguished in any sense and containing not the faintest trace of a promise of what was to come, and is hardly interesting enough musically to be of interest to many other than those with a special biographical interest in the composer.The models for the Overture to Das Liebesverbot (from the same year) are contemporary French and Italian comic opera ‚Äì again there is little trace of the mature dramatic work, but the overture is actually rather enjoyable on its own terms. The Faust Overture (1840-44) doesn‚Äôt actually contain any premonitions of the later works either ‚Äì illustrating instead how far Wagner had to go before reaching his famous later style. The work hasin fact managed to retain a toehold in the repertoire, but although it is vastly superior to earlier overtures such as Polonia and Rule Britannia, it is doubtful that it would have avoided sinking without a trace were it not composed by Wagner.The Faust-Overture is certainly not on the level of the more familiar overture to Rienzi that concludes this program and of course endlessly inferior to the Wesendonck-Lieder. What we get here, however, is not the Wesendonck-Lieder as you know them but ‚Äì and this is really poorly advertised ‚Äì the reorchestration for chamber forces by Hans Werner Henze. Though skillfully done, the character of the work becomes very different, with textures and colors and an austerity far closer to Webern than to the original work.Marjana Lipovsek sings them well, however, and she is sensitively accompanied by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Wolfgang Sawallisch, who is also appositively fiery in the Liebesverbot overture and the symphony. In Rienzi and Faust, however, they are arguably more splendidly stately than dramatic. All in all, this is an interesting program, but I do think it is primarily aimed at people with a particular interest in the composer rather than the general listener.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KHMB0HHNDKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000293CD6#wasThisHelpful","R12KHMB0HHNDKJ","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Antonio Bibalo's (1922-2008) main contributions were in opera, but this disc of instrumental works is ultimately rather fascinating. His style is rather difficult to pin down, but he studied with Elizabeth Lutyens and worked as a caf√© pianist in Norway (among a lot of other things) before his operatic breakthrough, and seems to have picked up influences everywhere ‚Äì perhaps the style is ultimately somewhat eclectic, but it is also rather personal. Though the works here are essentially tonal, they certainly owe a lot to twelve-tone music, even avant-garde experimental music, as well as jazz.Sinfonia Notturna, for instance, inhabits a sound world of tone clusters and play with sonorities, but the harmonic base is almost surprisingly traditional ‚Äì and although it seems to meander a bit (the work seeks to describe various aspects of the night, from the vastness of the night sky to peacefulness to misery to restless big-city nightlife to death) the result is never less than compelling and interesting. The performance by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra under Karsten Andersen appears to me to be very good; richly textured, colorful and with plenty of energy.Astrale for wind quintet is also inspired by the universe and the sky, though the inspiration sounds somewhat indirect and the result is certainly less striking than in the Sinfonia Notturna. Autunnale for flute, contrabassoon, vibraphone and piano sounds like a cross between serialism and smoky, jazzy salon music and should accordingly be rather dreary ‚Äì but the result is strangely compelling nonetheless. In the end, the Sinfonia Notturna is by far the most interesting item here, but the two chamber works are still rather compelling and they are excellently performed. An interesting and rewarding release, then, definitely worth hearing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5IJ14A5F2X4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J1EJ74#wasThisHelpful","R5IJ14A5F2X4B","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tom√°s Bret√≥n (1850-1923) did, as so many Spanish composers of his generation, compose zarzuelas but he also endeavored to create a Spanish national opera, and La Dolores, from 1895, is one of the latter. Though a true, through-composed opera, it also exhibits a thoroughly Spanish character and contains some elements more familiar from the zarzuela ‚Äì which is mixed into what is otherwise a rather Italian style. The musical language is, in other words, eclectic rather than very original, but I suppose it works reasonably well, and the end results is a quite enjoyable piece of passionate melodrama that doesn‚Äôt quite manage to meld together into any particularly effective dramatic unity but contains enough excellent music to hold the listener's attention nonetheless.The performances are overall good. Elisabete Matos sings the main role with color and convincing technique, though her voice doesn‚Äôt have that lovable, seductive quality that one might have wanted from the role ‚Äì but that is, I assume, a churlish complaint (compare to the quality that most recorded operatic rarities get and this is quite splendid). Mario Lanza and Stefano Palatchi, the bass-baritones, are very fine (some apparently think Palatchi is too rough, but his performance sounds entirely suitable to the role for me), and Tito Beltran as Celemin is very good as well.But the prize must goes to Domingo, whose versatility is nothing less than astonishing (one more reason to count him as one of the absolutely greatest performing artists of the last 50 years). Well, maybe it‚Äôs just that I have grown to love that voice too much, but to my ears this is yet another superb performance and with a characterization entirely appropriate for the role. In any case, the Chor del Gran Teatro del Liceu, Cor Infantil del Conservatori de Badalona and the Orquestra Sinfonica di Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya under Antoni Ros Marb√† support the soloists well without perhaps managing to bring out that last ounce of red-blooded ferocity I think the music sometimes needs. Oh, well ‚Äì though this is no masterpiece, it is a very enjoyable affair, and we should probably be grateful to have it in performances as (overall) convincing as these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FD5IJ8OU6VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002R2T5#wasThisHelpful","R36FD5IJ8OU6VX","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for something very original, the music of Ferdinand Thieriot (1836-1919) may not be your first choice, but that‚Äôs virtually the only element missing from these works ‚Äì anyone who enjoys the chamber music of Brahms (a lifelong friend) or Rheinberger (Thieriot‚Äôs teacher) or even Dvorak would do well to give this a try. His music was well-received in its day, and the obscurity his music fell into after his death is probably explained partially by changing tastes, but also by the fact that his manuscripts were moved to St. Petersburg after WWII where they were left to gather dust.In any case the piano quintet (1869, revised 1894) is truly excellent, with particularly memorably, muscular and dramatic, Schumannesque-Brahmsian outer movements framing a beautiful, almost languid Adagio and a genial scherzo. It is a splendid work of such constant invention, good ideas and fluency that it deserves a place in the repertoire ‚Äì perhaps it could even be called a near-masterpiece? The Sextet comes without opus number and year of composition and may not quite reach the levels of the quintet ‚Äì it is still a lovely work of great charm and some wonderful ideas, though the ideas don‚Äôt develop quite as fluently as they do in the quintet. Between these works we get a set of variations for the unusual combination of two cellos and piano; if it doesn‚Äôt quite reach the depth of the quintet this is nevertheless not a lightweight work and is inventive and variegated enough to keep the listener‚Äôs attention throughout without much effort.The Hamburg Players turn in perfectly acceptable performances, though there are some imprecisions, rough edges and even some questionable intonation at times. They are not helped by a recording that to me sounds a bit too artificial, especially in the upper registers (I don‚Äôt really possess the vocabulary or technical insight to describe very accurately what I think is wrong but the results are at least not ideal). Still, I am very happy to have been given the opportunity to acquaint myself with Thieriot‚Äôs music; and wrote a lot ‚Äì especially chamber music (including four piano trios, thirteen string quartets, two octets and plenty of sonatas), but also five symphonies ‚Äì that I would like to have an opportunity to discover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120ZU2ISGM3SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TPT0EM#wasThisHelpful","R120ZU2ISGM3SS","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are familiar with several Estonian contemporary composers, but the music of Ester M√§gi (b. 1922) is presumably mostly an unknown quantity in the West. One obvious reason is that her music has little to do with ‚Äúholy minimalism‚Äù, though it certainly owes a great deal to Estonian folk music ‚Äì Tubin, Sibelius and a bit of Bart√≥k (and a whiff of Shebalin and Myaskovsky, perhaps) are influences that come to mind, yet her language is individual and personal enough that no description of influences, it seems to me, will quite capture the sound. Compared to the European trends of the twentieth century, I suppose it is also rather conservative; tonal, certainly, though not afraid of unusual colors and textures.The opening Vesper (1990) is almost national romantic in character; an emotional (though not sentimental), reflective work of significant beauty. The piano concerto (an early work from 1952) is also pretty conservative, even romantic in character, but skillfully constructed and rather effective ‚Äì folksy and enjoyable. Bukoolika is a curious case. Dating from 1983, it is a series of pastoral scenes for orchestra, explicitly ‚Äúcow-pat‚Äù and superficially reminiscent of Delius, unapologetically describing cow bells, birdsong and so on. It is not an ironic work, yet the result is far from quaint-sounding either. (If Rautavaara can successfully get away with Cantus Arcticus, then why not?)The variations for piano, clarinet and chamber orchestra (1972) have sharper edges and more acute angles than the preceding works, with fiercely enjoyable results. Both this work and the Symphony (1968) suggests that M√§gi went through a slightly more modern-sounding phase in the 1960s and 70s, though the language is hardly uncompromisingly avant-garde (more like Bart√≥k). The Symphony is cast in three movements lasting no more than 14 minutes in total ‚Äì the first a forceful, angry allegro assai lasting for 2‚Äô30; the Andante is uneasy, while the finale is a relentlessly strident Presto culminating in a captivating epilogue. Though perhaps not a timeless masterpiece, it is an impressive work, well worth hearing. The performances are uniformly very good, and though the recorded sound varies a bit it is never less than adequate (clear but often a bit too in-your-face).

"A curate‚Äôs egg indeed. It is unfortunate that Hyperion has discontinued its magnificent series devoted to Granville Bantock‚Äôs orchestral music, but it means that fans of the composer will probably want to check out this disc, insofar as it contains two works ‚Äì the Old English Suite and the Russian Scenes ‚Äì not available from Hyperion, in addition to duplicating the Hebridean Symphony (in fairness, Leaper‚Äôs recording is two years older than Handley‚Äôs). On the other hand those two new works are not among Bantock‚Äôs greatest by any measure; indeed, I have to say that the Russian Scenes, at least, are primarily if not exclusively for the Bantock completist.The Old English Suite is not great music either, but at least it is pleasantly engaging. It consists of arrangements of Gibbons, Dowland, Bull, Farnaby and Byrd, dressed up in a wistfully colored, late-romantic garb. The quality of the music is a function of the quality of the originals, of course, and frankly I don‚Äôt know if Bantock‚Äôs arrangements add anything ‚Äì nor, emphatically, does the playing of the Czecho-Slovak State Philharmonic Orchestra under Adrian Leaper, which is just a bit too rough and hesitant to realize the kind of nostalgic gleam Bantock seems to have been going for. At least the results are more interesting than the Russian Scenes. Composed in 1899, they are obviously written by a non-Russian and in fact doesn‚Äôt sound particularly ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù at all ‚Äì not even picture-postcard Russian ‚Äì apart, if it counts, for a few rather Tchaikovsky-like gestures, at least not until the final movement. They are decidedly thin gruel on any terms, and once again the performances lack that last bit of flair and swagger and color that this music needs (in addition to being markedly rough around the edges).The performance of the Hebridean Symphony, however, is quite good ‚Äì not as sumptuous or polished as Handley, to be sure, but Leaper does have more bit and (arguably) dramatic power. In the end, though, I would probably go for Handley, however, for the additional glorious opulence and textural nuances, but partially also because of the superior sound on the Hyperion release (not that this Naxos release has particularly bad sound) ‚Äì and of course because of the couplings. This release, then, is of mostly specialist interest, though I cannot quite get myself to completely dismiss it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDUUUUDQ26G4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005AYEO#wasThisHelpful","RDUUUUDQ26G4O","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really want to, and think I should, like this music. I have enjoyed Chadwick‚Äôs symphonies, and his Liszt-Schumann-Dvorak-mix of a style should have suited the symphonic poem format rather well. Yet, there is something bland and thoroughly anonymous about this music, something almost insistently unmemorable about these scores ‚Äì there is plenty of beauty and style, but little sense of narrative structure and few examples of climaxes that have been built up over a long period of time, for instance; and whenever Chadwick seems to be onto something interesting the music tends to fizzle away into nothing. There is little fire, blood or atmosphere and it is ‚Äì as the topics of these tone poems may suggest ‚Äì as if he is trying to push an essentially late-romantic palette and style into an inoffensive, classically elegant shape.I may be wrong. If I am, it is because the performances here are thoroughly wrong-headed, which I suspect they may be (no one else seems to agree with me, though). Indeed, I often found myself imagining what the music would have sounded like if the Nashville Symphony Orchestra under Kenneth Schermerhorn had tried to go for some hell-for-leather fire in the more dramatic passages, perhaps some elfin, halflit woodland atmospheres in some of the more reflective passages, and generally more glitter, sparkle, mystery and swagger (the approach the Moscow Symphony Orchestra under Adriano took for George Templeton Strong‚Äôs music also for Naxos‚Äôs American Classics, for instance - I sort of imagine that Chadwick's music should inhabit something of the same sound world). I think this would have been eminently possible ‚Äì Serebrier is closer to that kind of approach in a recording of Melpomene for Reference, though still not quite where I think I can imagine this music should be (besides, Melpomene is among the weaker of the works here in any case) ‚Äì so I can only wonder what the music would have sounded like under such an approach.Compared to these admittedly imagined performances, Schermerhorn is workmanlike and dull. The Nashville players do get the notes right (probably not a mean feat), but there is no fire, imagination, atmosphere or spirit in the playing, no real sense of narrative structure ‚Äì no magic, really, and I do think this music needs it. Accordingly, I find it hard to pass any final verdict on the music itself. Euterpe, Aphrodite and Thalia strike me as probably the strongest; Melpomene is a tad non-descript, whereas I am unsure even a stronger performance would manage to make the elements of Angel of Death cohere. In short, I have some serious reservations about this disc, though I guess most of this music isn‚Äôt really readily available elsewhere either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPRPHDC8OTNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000069KFF#wasThisHelpful","R3SPRPHDC8OTNB","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some people might wonder: Given the popularity of Joaquin Rodrigo‚Äôs guitar concertos, why isn‚Äôt any of his other music more frequently heard? This disc does, I think, help answer that question, but raises a new one: Are Rodrigo‚Äôs guitar concertos really particularly good, or is it just that there isn‚Äôt really much serious competition in that genre? At least when Rodrigo turned to genres where comparisons with other composers are easier, he emerges as a composer rather far removed from the front rank; though the music on this disc is occasionally enjoyable and colorful, it is also as shallow as music gets and contains little that sticks in the memory.The ‚Äúmajor‚Äù works are the main problem. The symphonic poem Per la flor del Iliri blau (‚ÄúThe Flower of the Blue Lily‚Äù) was composed in 1934 based on a Valencian fable, and is a ramshackle, episodic and meandering work striving to achieve a sense of unity and narrative structure by little more than repetition. Accessible it is, to be sure, and one may even argue that even in this for the composer unusual format a certain distinctive voice is recognizable. But that‚Äôs not enough, and the result is overall pretty dull . A la busca del m√°s all√° (‚ÄúIn Search of What Lies Beyond‚Äù) is even less interesting. A NASA commission, Rodrigo evidently tried to create an atmosphere of wonder and mystery, and the harmonic palette is somewhat richer and more modern than in any other works of his I‚Äôve heard. But the effort fails miserably. This is inconsequential meandering evolving into sentimentalist banality; a really terrible work.The program as a whole is somewhat redeemed by the shorter works, which at the very least never tries to be anything but light music. The early Three Traditional Dance Airs are engaging and fun; Palillos y panderetas pretty slight but compelling enough (it was actually composed as recently as 1982), and the Two Spanish Dances featuring a virtuoso castanet part probably the highlight of the disc ‚Äì spirited and jolly and innocuous, rhythmically buoyant music in a national style (I‚Äôll refrain from commenting on the castanet part).The performances are decent enough if a bit rough ‚Äì I would perhaps have wished for a little bit more flair and sumptuousness from the Le√≥n Symphony Orchestra under Max Bragado, but I think the recording is at least equally to blame for the deficiencies in that department. Soundwise, this is really not one of Naxos‚Äôs better efforts; it is dry and lacks any hint of bloom or ambience. A bit of a pity, but given that the main items here aren‚Äôt better than they are I am unsure whether this disc would have merited more than a very guarded recommendation in any case ‚Äì I‚Äôll grudgingly give it three stars for the lighter music, but that‚Äôs pretty charitable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K27VZ9S9RVVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008IHW1#wasThisHelpful","R3K27VZ9S9RVVG","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Colina is an American Grammy-award-winning composer with a background in jazz and television music; his ‚Äúclassical‚Äù music appears to stem primarily from the very early and most recent part of his career with a 25-year gap in the middle. Like the other reviewer here, I purchased the disc based on glowing reviews (in the IRR for my part), and I have to admit to being somewhat disappointed as well. Colina‚Äôs musical language is nothing if not approachable; colorful, texture-based, but anodyne and containing little that sticks in the memory ‚Äì ‚Äúelevator music‚Äù is descriptive, though I am willing to go for ""superior elevator music"".  All the music appears to be written as expressions of the composer‚Äôs emotional reactions to certain stories or images, with ‚Äì it seems to me ‚Äì little thought given to how to effectively translate that into self-standing works of music, and seems accordingly (to me) to be the kind of music that is most interesting to those who know Colina personally and are particularly interested in his personal emotional reactions to stuff. I‚Äôm not.Well, that might be a bit mean. Certainly his Baba Yaga, a fantasia for violin and orchestra, is inoffensive enough and eventful enough to be worth a listen. The work does bring to mind Russian romantic music ‚Äì it‚Äôs unabashedly tonal ‚Äì but contains some surprising and quirky twists and turns. On the downside, those unexpected twists and turns also make the music come across as pretty meandering ‚Äì certainly it lacks any strong, bearing ideas. At least it sounds nothing like Mussorgsky‚Äôs take (Colina appears to claim that he doesn‚Äôt even know it).If Baba Yaga is superficially entertaining enough to merit a listen, I can find little positive to say about The Unbearable Lightness of Being, a slow-moving tapestry of diffuse fog that is as boring as you could possibly imagine ‚Äì ‚Äúunbearable‚Äù is apt; of ‚Äúlightness‚Äù there is none. The tone poem Quinta del Sordo, however, is rather effective. Based on the ‚ÄúBlack Paintings‚Äù by Goya, it employs Spanish rhythms and color with a result that resembles the tone poems of Joaquin Rodrigo (not that composer‚Äôs best works, though). It is not very original, nor very profound, but is probably the work here I am most likely to return to.The flute concerto ‚ÄúIsles of Shoals‚Äù seems inspired by Ravel (mostly) and contains several fine things ‚Äì not the least a very effectively written solo part. It is an essentially light work with rather effective, colorful outer movements. The work as a whole, however, is ruined by the middle movement. Based on ‚ÄúSchafe k√∂nnen sicher weiden‚Äù it is certainly beautiful, but that‚Äôs because Bach‚Äôs original is beautiful; Colina‚Äôs adaptation only works to showcase his own lack of good ideas. Seriously, composers: You need to stop doing this kind of thing! The only thing you‚Äôll achieve is to assert your own inferiority as composers. (In fact, Colina draws on Saint-Sa√´ns in the third movement as well, but that attempt is less blatant and glaring and doesn‚Äôt to the same degree stand out like a sore thumb.)The performances are excellent, though. Lukasz Dlugosz and Anastasia Khitruk are splendid soloists (Khitruk‚Äôs tone is perhaps occasionally a little thin), and the London Symphony Orchestra sound rich and colorful under Ira Levin and Ransom Wilson. The sound quality is opulent and ambient ‚Äì perhaps a bit too processed, but certainly apt for this kind of music. Oh well, if you think this sounds as if it‚Äôd appeal to you, it very well might, but I cannot really say that I was more than moderately impressed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBXD5KQ1GS8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JC4VQE#wasThisHelpful","RDBXD5KQ1GS8A","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To some ears this may sound as heresy, but I am very unsure what I really think of Liszt‚Äôs organ works. To me they sound suspiciously like what a first-rate composer for the piano may write when first getting hold of an organ (indeed) and, overwhelmed by the aural potentials momentarily forget most of what she or he knows about composition, melody, counterpoint and so on because he or she is caught up in exploring the sonorities ‚Äì ‚Äúhey, even a plain C major chord sounds majest; let‚Äôs hold it down for five seconds. Wow.‚Äù Whereas composers like Franck or Widor mastered the organ and its potential, the organ seems to have mastered Liszt. And he had access to (and conceived much of his organ music for) the largest organ in Germany at the time; I‚Äôm not sure that helped.That organ has been restored, and is the instrument used on the recording at hand, which should add a bit of interest to this release, both for organ aficionados and Liszt fans. And it does undeniably sound splendid; gloriously grand and colorful. The topic of the release is the connection between Liszt and Bach, and opens with Liszt's perhaps most famous organ work, the Pr√§ludium und Fuge √ºber das Thema B-A-C-H, which is overall excellently performed here, though Michael Sch√∂nheit is perhaps a bit short on drama. The other original Liszt work is the Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen variations, which is a good example, I think, of the worry I expressed above ‚Äì though it sounds imposing in this version (performance and instrument), it is musically a relatively shallow affair.Liszt‚Äôs Bach transcriptions sound good primarily because of the originals. Somewhat interesting bonuses, however, are the original Bach works, the Passacaglia BWV 582 and the Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen prelude, played following 19th century registration plans (by Liszt pupils or colleagues). They sound undeniably romantic ‚Äì stylistically really not such a far cry from Liszt‚Äôs own works, in fact, but better. Overall Sch√∂nheit‚Äôs performances are imposing if lacking a little bit in fire and drama.

"The Canadian composer Murray Adaskin (1906-2002) was relatively productive, though he embarked on his career as a composer quite late in life, and most of his compositions date from after his retirement from his positions as conductor and later composer-in-residence at the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra. Stylistically, his music is in particular inspired by Stravinsky and his teacher Milhaud, and although most of it is abstract, one can, according to Wikipedia ‚Äú[t]hrough his works, [‚Ä¶] feel the presence of landscapes, birdsongs and different local surrounding sounds.‚Äù Well, the landscape of Saskatchewan is, frankly, pretty boring, and so is, I have to admit, much of Adaskin‚Äôs music, at least if the set at hand is representative.Most of the works here are relatively diverting and light; joyful and jazzy ‚Äúwithout subterfuge‚Äù, as they say in the documentary on the second disc of the set (yes, there is one disc of works and a bonus disc with commentary and an interview ‚Äì as such the CBC series on Canadian composers is pretty valuable, even though not all of the music is).

The Divertimento for Orchestra preceding it is less so.Then there is a Suite for Orchestra, which seems most of all strikingly elusive, in the sense that it is almost impossible to remember anything of it after it is over, no matter how hard one tries. In Praise of Canadian Painting in the Thirties is the only non-abstract work on the disc, and probably the most compelling ‚Äì it may be an advantage to familiarize yourself with the works of the painters in question (Paraskeva Clark, Louis Muhlstock and Charles Comfort). It is not a masterpiece, but I have to admit that Adaskin to some extent manages to reflect some of the characteristics of these painters‚Äô styles in his music.The least interesting work on the disc is the final Divertimento no. 5 for percussion and orchestra. It‚Äôs grey and dull; a few uninteresting melodic fragments and contours filled in with some drum bumps here, tam-tams there, and a drumroll or two without any discernible structure or goal. It‚Äôs precisely as bad as such a work could be, which is pretty terrible. The performances, though, are good and the recorded sound generally very good. The music ranges from one-star works (Divertimento no. 5) to almost-four-stars (the Painting suite), but given the production values and the overall value of the whole series I am reluctant to give it less than three stars. But three stars is, frankly, on the generous side.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4M8UOKNGOHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000076DNM#wasThisHelpful","R2W4M8UOKNGOHM","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eduard Napravnik (1839-1916) was a Czech-Russian composer and a central figure in Russian musical life, and, as a composer, he premiered a number of the most famous Russian works of the nineteenth century ‚Äì particularly operas. His own compositions are largely forgotten, but included four symphonies and four operas (his piano concerto and Fantasy on Russian themes have, appropriately, been recorded for Hyperion‚Äôs Romantic Piano Concerto series, but that‚Äôs about it), of which Dubrovsky is the only one to (barely) survive at the fringes of the repertoire in Russia. The libretto was written by Modest Tchaikovsky after Pushkin‚Äôs novel, though it plays down the social commentary in favor of the love story.A great opera it surely isn‚Äôt, and the musical language is far from original ‚Äì Tchaikovsky and Verdi with more than a bit of vaudeville thrown in just about sums it up. There are a few good arias, but they are separated by long stretches of pretty tedious note-spinning ‚Äì and every time the music seems on the verge of going somewhere, Napravnik reverts to inconsequential Verdi-pastiche, effectively undermining any sense of momentum. Still, I suppose the highlights might be interesting enough to warrant a listen. Or they would have been, if the presentation had been better.The male singers aren‚Äôt too bad; Kozlovsky in the title role is very good, and most of the others are far from bad. Vervitskaya is too shrill, however, but that may be partially the recording‚Äôs fault. The Bolshoi Theatre chorus and orchestra under Vassily Nebolsin may be ok, but who can tell? Whereas the voices are generally decently captured by the recording, the orchestra surely isn‚Äôt; it‚Äôs reduced to faint, tinny background ruminations in a distant hall. You can forget about notes and a libretto, and to add insult to injury, on my copy four tracks on the second disc wouldn‚Äôt play at all ‚Äì not that I really cared too much at that point given the quality of the tracks that did play. I haven‚Äôt heard the other versions (or releases of this version), but even with a better presentation I suspect this one is primarily for the specialist. I still hope that some record companies would make parts of the huge Melodiya catalogue of forgotten Russian operas available, however (operas by Aleksandrov, Arensky, Ernesaks, Gulak-Artemovsky, Magomaev, Morozov, Muradeli, Shebalin, Vlasov & Fere, or Zhiganov, to mention a few), but the presentation really needs to be better than this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GR6O4F14K7VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FIGXXU#wasThisHelpful","R1GR6O4F14K7VE","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zygmunt Krauze (b. 1938) was part of what one might perhaps call the golden age of Polish modernism, and although he is less well known than, say, Penderecki and Gorecki, the works on this disc reveals a personal voice characterized by a feeling of excitement in exploring unique sonorities and textures. Despite the use of avant-garde techniques, Krauze‚Äôs music remains relatively approachable, even though Krauze ideas about composition might easily be characterized as ""novel"" ‚Äì it feels more as extending the expressive range of conventional structures and forms than a radical break.Aus aller Welt stammende for ten string instruments dates from 1973, and is an example of ‚Äúmusic about music‚Äù. The basis for the work is four folk-like melodies; each instrument plays the same melody, but they have complete freedom in choice of tempo, dynamics, expression and articulation, and the result is a ‚Äúsoundscape‚Äù (for lack of a better word) in which different interpretations and explorations of the basic tune is melded together ‚Äì according to the composer, in ‚Äúunitary music‚Äù like this ‚Äú[t]he beginning of each composition immediately exposes the entire range of sounds and during the piece nothing new is introduced. There will be no surprises. [...] This music creates the space for a different way of being perceived.‚Äù Well, I suppose some listeners may be a bit put off by the resulting lack of contrast or dramatic impetus, but I have to admit that I found the results often rather mesmerizing.Tableau Vivant (1982) for chamber orchestra is a ‚Äúpiece about silence, fear, anger and obsessiveness.‚Äù The fifteen performers are divided into two groups in a dialogue about and formed by what sounds most like a slow march-like pulse deconstructed in various ways. I have to admit that the musings struck me as a bit inconsequential ‚Äì perhaps I am missing something. The Symphonie Parisienne (1986) strikes me as more successful. The work is based on a single motif that is relentlessly repeated in different scoring, and with different intensity and modes of expression, but the result is far more satisfying than it might sound from that description.Quatuor pour la naissance (1985) was apparently written as a response to the birth of his son, and though the emotions expressed are definitely conflicting, the overall mood is one of optimism and hope ‚Äì indeed, Krauze is intent of bending those conflicting emotions into a unified, homogenous sound where the contrasts are removed. Well, there may be something to the notion that great art is founded on suffering rather than contentment, and I cannot say I was particularly taken with this work ‚Äì yes, in one sense the attempt to create this homogenous sound world serves to bring attention to the contrasts, and the result is very far from a homogenous sound world, but I couldn‚Äôt really get myself to work up much enthusiasm for those contrasts.It is, admittedly, a bit tricky to pass any judgment on the performances, but the strongest works here do indeed come across as compelling, and they are recorded in nice, spacious sound. Not the most captivating disc of contemporary music to have come my way perhaps, but this is definitely worth exploring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C10W67VQHCKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003XNO#wasThisHelpful","R3C10W67VQHCKZ","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The titles of these works suggest that Peter Benoit (1834-1901) was a romantic through-and-through, with a penchant for the atmospheric and fairy-tale-like. What you get, however, is a pretty generic tonal language inspired by Schumann and Weber, with little by way of originality and disappointingly little tone-painting. These two concertos date from 1865, and were apparently Benoit‚Äôs last large-scale instrumental works ‚Äì the rest of his career would be primarily devoted to oratorios and large-scale cantatas. In fact, Benoit didn‚Äôt call them concertos, but Symphonic Tales, and although they follow the usual three-movement concerto form, they have the narrative structures of symphonic poems and, in the case of the piano concerto, a detailed program.The piano concerto opens with a Ballade, structured around two primary themes, one tragic and one noble, though the music is relatively non-descript and certainly evokes none of the ‚Äúsilvery sheen‚Äù or ‚Äúsoaring up in majestic height‚Äù mentioned by the booklet. More importantly, the themes are hardly memorable, and although the music is (barely) eventful and colorful enough to sustain the listener‚Äôs attention it doesn‚Äôt exactly invite repeated listening. The second movement, The Song of the Bard, at least exhibits some of the yearning, lamenting nostalgia it is supposed to, and the Fantastic Hunt in the Night is rather enjoyable, though desperately lacking the drama, urgency and spectacle of, say, Franck‚Äôs Le Chasseur maudit.Romantic, large-scale flute concertos are a rarity, which should secure at least some interest in Benoit‚Äôs concerto. Once again, the movements have programmatic titles, though there is a less explicit program. The opening movement, Will-o‚Äô-the-Wisps, is once again built around two themes, a capricious and nervous one and a more reflective one, and is appealing enough. The Melancholie movement is anodyne and the finale resembles the opening movement, though is less interesting. If flautists are looking for a first-rate romantic concerto for their instrument, this is not it. As a coupling we get the overture to Benoit's comic opera Le roi des Aulnes (The King of the Alders), first premiered in 1859. It is a spirited work, but totally lacking any distinctive or memorable features.The performances sound good enough; the soloists are actually impressive, especially Gaby van Riet in the flute concerto, and they are well supported by the Royal Flanders Philharmonic Orchestra under Fr√©d√©ric Devreese ‚Äì the orchestra could perhaps have benefited from a bit more rehearsal time to smooth out some rough edges, but I‚Äôve enjoyed far worse performances than this. The sound is fine. If this style of music appeals, then I suppose you could do worse than give this disc a try, but it is a far cry from being a mandatory release.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JIMVPOMNY9OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000004654#wasThisHelpful","R2JIMVPOMNY9OB","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like so many French composers of his generation Henri Tomasi (1901-1971) seems to be doomed to be remembered for a handful of wind concertos, in particular a decent but unexceptional trumpet concerto. The Requiem pour la paix, dedicated to ‚Äúthe martyrs of the resistance movement and all those who have died for France‚Äù, was begun in 1944, during Nazi occupation, and finished the following year. Being disillusioned by the war and rejecting all religious faith, Tomasi put the work aside, and it remained in obscurity until 1996. Stylistically it is tonal, airy, melodic, lyrical and touching ‚Äì Tomasi‚Äôs models seem to have been Debussy and Ravel, and although the music is ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù-sounding, there is really not much of the jaunty neo-classicism found in the music of many of his contemporaries.It is not, perhaps, as hauntingly memorable as the far more famous Durufl√© Requiem, but it is an impressive and memorable work, containing plenty of good ideas, sensitively colored and held together by a couple of recurring motifs and gestures. The moods shift between the reflectively serene and the defiant, with all sorts of shades in between. It is all captured here in vibrant, deeply committed performances; the choral contributions from Choeur R√©gional Provence-Alpes-CÙte d‚ÄôAzur and Choeur D√©partemental des Alpes-Maritimes are generally good; the soloists at least serviceable and occasionally very good, and I have few complaints about the Orchestra Philharmonique de Marseille under Michel Piquemal. A little bit more warmth and vibrancy might not have gone amiss, but it really is a minor complaint.As for the couplings, the Fanfares liturgiques are much more interesting than the title might suggest, with some nicely pointed, noble and imaginative touches, while Etre ou ne pas √™tre is brooding and rather non-descript. Once again I have few complaints about the performances, and the sound is generally good. Good notes as well, and although this is hardly a disc to change the world, it is definitely worth recommending. It would be good to hear more of Tomasi‚Äôs works that weren‚Äôt wind concertos or wind chamber music, such as one or more of his operas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ICICI17LP2DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000270PU#wasThisHelpful","R2ICICI17LP2DP","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given the legacy of Ignacy Jan Paderewski as a pianist and politician (as well as being the subject of a particularly famous example in academic philosophy of language), you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be natural for a Polish record company to cover his output as a composer; it might pick people‚Äôs interest given the name alone. Fortunately, Paderewski was a really good composer as well ‚Äì not hugely original, perhaps, but the music is inventive, colorful, sporting strong themes and a decent sense of development and orchestration. Manru is his only opera, and is, essentially, a dramatic one with fairy-tale elements and lots of opportunities to paint vivid, atmospheric mountainscapes and nights by lakes. There are traces of Polish folk elements, I suppose, and also some gypsy-style music (part of the story), and much of it is glorious and beautiful ‚Äì not always dramatically taut, but Paderewski could pull some dramatic scenes with effective climaxes when he wanted to. Stylistically late-romantic ‚Äì Wagner and Tchaikovsky seem to be important role models ‚Äì there are also elements here that, I think, foreshadows Szymanowski. Highlights are probably the duet between Ulana and Manru in Act II and, frankly, most of Act III.The very best music tends to go to the character Ulana ‚Äì who really is, despite the title, the main character ‚Äì sung her by Ewa Czermak. It‚Äôs a role that requires a lot of emotion, fire and drama, and Czermak copes admirably ‚Äì her voice has the necessary power and volatility ‚Äì so much so, in fact, that she tends to overshadow the Manru of Taras Ivaniv, who sounds strained when they‚Äôre together; otherwise, Ivaniv singing is compelling. The smaller roles are somewhat variable, but generally more than acceptable and often good.I have certainly no complaints at all about the performances from the Chorus and Orchestra of the Lower Silesian Opera in Wroc≈Çaw under the sympathetic and convincing direction of Ewa Michnik ‚Äì in fact, this really is excellent playing (as is the violin solos, vivaciously and fiercely dispatched by Stanislaw Czermak ‚Äì the booklet doesn‚Äôt mention whether there is any relation to the soprano). And it is all recorded in very good sound. A drawback that should be mentioned concerns the booklet ‚Äì though information is given in Polish and English, the libretto is given in Polish only (though there is a track-indexed synopsis in English). So, is it a forgotten masterpiece? Perhaps not, but it is surely a deeply rewarding experience, and although five stars might be on the generous side I do wish to thank everyone involved for making this one available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQ9CB8HW10KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002XUW1M#wasThisHelpful","RNQ9CB8HW10KM","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heinrich Kaspar Schmid (1874-1953) is one of a substantial number of late-romantic composer cpo has done an admirable job of digging out of virtually complete obscurity. Schmid was an important organizer and academic, and his compositions ‚Äì at least the ones represented here ‚Äì exhibits an admirably sense of the craft. Though dating primarily from the later part of his career, these works are stylistically conservative and contain few elements that would be out of place in, say, Brahms (no post-romantic, expressive hysteria here, to be sure). They are also inspired by German (in particular, apparently, Bavarian) folk music and overall relatively lightly textured; contrapuntal, but never densely so, and Schmid certainly had a modest gift for melody, though few of the themes are particularly memorable. If I have a complaint - and I guess I do - it is that the music is too ‚Äúnice‚Äù and ‚Äúacademic‚Äù (in the negative sense) and light; there are no chances taken, and accordingly not that much to remember by which to remember this music.The possible exception is the trio for clarinet, viola and piano op. 114. It is a very compelling work, and the opening movement of the trio is the only movement on the disc that contains any real drama. It is followed by a splendid, almost Mendelssohnian, mystic, brief scherzo and a lovely if somewhat inconsequential slow movement. The finale is effective enough if essentially light music. ‚ÄúLight and charming‚Äù is an apt characterization also of the flute sonata op. 106; no profundity, in other words, but there is an appealing playfulness and variety of texture that nevertheless make it an attractive work overall.The two short works, an Allegretto for clarinet and piano and a Capriccio for flute and piano (both from an op. 34 set) contain little to write home about and the viola sonata op. 111 is, I have (and hate) to admit, a disappointment. Once again, Schmid is good at working with textures, but the work as a whole comes across as a meandering, rambling rant about nothing with some decently colorful metaphors thrown in. At least it is idiomatically written for the instrument ‚Äì sufficiently tailored to the specific sonorities of the viola to never sound like a transposed violin or cello sonata ‚Äì but that isn‚Äôt quite enough.Nor am I wholly satisfied by the performance; Nils M√∂nkemeyer‚Äôs playing is expressive and variegated enough, but intonation isn‚Äôt always spot-on, neither in the sonata nor in the trio. On the other hand, I might perhaps have wished for some more expressive nuances in Johannes Zurl‚Äôs clarinet playing (though Schmid doesn‚Äôt really encourage that, it seems). Pirmin Grehl‚Äôs flute parts are pretty good, on the other hand, and I don‚Äôt have any specific complaints about Nicholas Rimmer‚Äôs piano playing ‚Äì the piano is relegated to a distinctively supportive role in this music anyways. In short, this is a modestly interesting disc of some moderately interesting music; not enough to merit a full-scale revival, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind hearing Schmid‚Äôs d minor Symphony, apparently his most celebrated work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZLMK3SASFOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037UTT8Y#wasThisHelpful","R1YZLMK3SASFOB","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These two symphonies by Rudolph Simonsen (1889-1947) have received some rather harsh criticism from certain quarters, so I wish to make a bit of a case for them. They are not forgotten masterpieces, by any means, but they are still overall rather interesting works that should appeal at least to those with a sense of adventure and an interest in the transitional period between late-romanticism and modernism. That said, the Overture in g minor that opens the program is probably unsalvageable ‚Äì it is a lengthy piece of generic Wagnerisms with little content, development or interest. But the symphonies are a different matter.It is, though, a bit unfortunate that the booklet note tries to compare them to Nielsen‚Äôs works from the same period ‚Äì there isn‚Äôt much of Nielsen here (though the first symphony may be inspired on an abstract level by Nielsen‚Äôs symphonies); on the other hand, I think I note some interesting and intriguing connections to the music of Rued Langgaard ‚Äì if Simonsen‚Äôs music fails to exhibit the same level of imagination and ear for sonorities as Langgaard, at least he seems to have something of the same focus; occasionally at the expense of continuity and narrative arches, but the colors and textures of Simonsen‚Äôs gnarly, gritty moving blocks of sound are fascinating enough in themselves, and Simonsen piles them on top of each other to achieve some relatively powerful climaxes, even if a convincing narrative thread isn't always sustained.The first symphony, ‚ÄúZion‚Äù, supposedly depicts the Jewish people‚Äôs struggles on their way to the promised land. The opening movement, ‚ÄúThe Struggle against Slavery‚Äù, is definitely filled with conflict and struggle, and is pretty effective as such. Unfortunately, the long Covenant movement ‚Äì at 19 minutes and divided into clearly delineated sections almost a symphony in itself ‚Äì strikes me as unsuccessful; it is a pretty glum affair (though the mood shifts to a lighter, more peaceful one about midway through) and, frankly, a pretty tedious one. What primarily makes the work worth hearing is the final movement, however: an effective, well-constructed Allegro con brio that builds up to a blazing conclusion that would probably have been more effective if the symphony as a whole had been stronger. Not a bad work, then, but the second movement could have needed some serious trimming.The second symphony, ‚ÄúHellas‚Äù, won a bronze medal at the 1928 Olympic Game (there were no gold or silver medals awarded) ‚Äì yes, that was back in days when various artistic genres were also part of the Olympics. It is a well-constructed work overall, though the themes are not particularly memorable (there are plenty of them, but I am not sure that makes up for it). Though lighter in spirit than the first, it often sounds a bit as if Simonsen was attempting to create a dramatic flow but succeeded only in building up pressure without any release. Oh, well, it is actually an interesting and enjoyable work nonetheless; the grinding, tempestuous first movement perhaps in particular.S√∏nderjylland's Symphony Orchestra at least gives all the works as good of a run for their money as one could have wished for under Israel Yinon ‚Äì any faults lie surely not with the performances. The sound quality is good as well and the liner notes mostly informative. Not a must-have, then, but I am glad to have heard these symphonies, and would probably extend a modest recommendation to anyone interested in music of the period with a sense of adventure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKHDYQ61NDJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RX3KPG#wasThisHelpful","R2EKHDYQ61NDJX","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One can perhaps imagine what challenges a woman composer like Louise Farrenc (1804-1875) must have faced as a professional composer of serious, large scale orchestral and chamber works in the Romantic era France, but Farrenc was, in fact, pretty successful. She was a recognized leading piano professor at the Paris Conservatoire, and her works, including her symphonies and large-scale chamber works, were performed and well received - she didn't write an opera, though, which in France of the time seems to have guaranteed being relegated to the second rank, regardless of the merits of the music itself. The two symphonies here are soundly crafted works with plenty of good ideas. Now, in her time Beethoven dominated what existed of a French symphonic scene, and Farrenc‚Äôs works are heavily indebted to Beethoven, as well as Haydn and Mozart, though there are romantic touches as well ‚Äì some passages remind me a little of Weber, others bear at least hints of an individual stamp.Both works are laid out in a similar manner. The outer movements are dramatic, bold and tempestuous ‚Äì very much reminiscent of Beethoven in style and execution, yet the thematic material is romantic - and extremely compelling. I find her less convincing in the slow movements; these are lyrical and often pretty, but a bit square and ‚Äì it seems to me ‚Äì uninspired; even the good ideas in the slow movement of the third symphony seem to me to be developed without much enthusiasm: I cannot help feeling, at least on occasion, that Farrenc put those movements there because she had to and would much rather get on with the action. As for the third movements, the Haydnesque, classical Minuetto in the first symphony is fine enough, but not as inspired as the sprightly, spirited, romantic scherzo of the third.They are both overall excellent works, though (my slight misgivings about the slow movements should be read as ‚Äúin comparison to the faster movements‚Äù ‚Äì they are still far above the average for composers of the period), and deserves more exposure than they have thus far been given. They are also really excellently performed by the North German Radio Symphony, Hannover under Johannes Goritzki ‚Äì alert, colorful, vigorous and with clear lines ‚Äì and although the recorded sound is a bit dull it is really not an impediment. Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157VOKDHTRAMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000AEOG#wasThisHelpful","R157VOKDHTRAMJ","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had mixed hopes for this release, the final installment in Chandos‚Äôs series of Rubbra symphonies. Having been thoroughly impressed by nos. 2 and 6, and nos. 3 and 7, I found the disc containing nos. 4, 10 and 11 slightly tougher, no. 9 a fatally flawed near-masterpiece (yes ‚Äì Rubbra made one desperately wrong decision that almost ruined the whole work by giving the climax to a narrator), and no. 1 a bit of a disappointment. Well, whatever fears I might have had were quickly put to shame. The fifth and eighth symphonies are absolute masterpieces, among the truly great works of the twentieth century, and this is a magnificent release ‚Äì probably the one I would recommend as a starting point for anyone thus far unacquainted with this fabulous composer.Now, Rubbra‚Äôs symphonies are surely not about surface spectacle and don‚Äôt really give up their goods that easily. They are understated, to a large extent distanced and reflective, and don‚Äôt really contain much by way of drama in the traditional sense. But Rubbra was a masterly musical architect and his melodies, though perhaps not (usually) instantly memorable, are often haunting and tend to flow beautifully toward understated but nevertheless powerful climaxes. It is also the kind of music that requires first-rate performances and a conductor with a clear vision and deep understanding. Fortunately, that‚Äôs precisely what it gets in this series, and as on previous volumes the playing here is little short of amazing.The eighth symphony is apparently sometimes viewed as a somewhat problematic work. It is certainly introverted, poetic and ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù (if that‚Äôs an apt characterization of music at all) ‚Äì indeed, it was dedicated to Teilhard de Chardin. Cast in three movements, the outer movements are generally mellow ‚Äì shimmering and beautiful though not without incident ‚Äì and enclose a superb, dance-like though still reflective central Allegretto con brio. The opening movement is among the best the composer ever wrote (though it requires some concentration on the part of the listener) whereas the final lento is stunningly beautiful ‚Äì even transcendent. A small drawback, perhaps, is that its climactic theme is the sunrise theme from Janacek‚Äôs Cunning Little Vixen. No matter ‚Äì it is magnificently employed for very different purposes here.The fifth is the composer‚Äôs best known work and for good reason ‚Äì though perhaps not ultimately superior to his other symphonies (though it is absolutely marvelous) it is probably his most user-friendly work. The outer movements, for instance, are more obviously dramatic than in his other works, though the structure at least in each individual movement is as clean and compelling as ever; in addition, the finale is less ambiguously optimistic than in his other symphonies (perhaps except the eighth, though here the optimism is of a more reflective kind). The second movement is ebullient, spirited and buoyant (and almost Sibelian), whereas the slow movement is pensive and dark ‚Äì arguably the weak link in this symphony but still powerful stuff.In between we get an Ode to the Queen, a cycle of three songs composed for the Coronation year. It is much more extrovert and joyous than most of the composer‚Äôs works, but does overall not hold a candle to the symphonies in terms of quality ‚Äì as such it feels quite out of place here. But no matter; it is excellently done and I have few complaints about Susan Bickley‚Äôs singing (yes, it‚Äôs hard to hear precisely what she‚Äôs singing, but if you read the texts you realize that you don‚Äôt really want to know). And the two surrounding masterpieces simply must be heard. Very strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPG6856YMIREP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IM71#wasThisHelpful","RPG6856YMIREP","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Howard Ferguson (1908-1999) may have been one of the most important composers to come out of Northern Ireland, but his music isn‚Äôt particularly well known. Ferguson‚Äôs output wasn‚Äôt large, and he stopped composing altogether in the late 50s, ostensibly because he felt like he was starting to repeat himself, but surely also because his unapologetically tuneful, atmospheric, haunting music was rather far out of line with the prevailing trends. Stylistically Ferguson‚Äôs own work belongs to the sound world of post-romanticism; there are touches of Vaughan Williams, to be sure, and passages reminiscent of the music of Herbert Howells or his friend Gerald Finzi. While not hugely original, it is finely constructed and imaginative, with enough personal touches to give it an identifiable, individual voice.I don‚Äôt think the decision to start the program on this disc with the Overture for an Occasion was the best possible idea ‚Äì it is without doubt the weakest work here, and is really a pretty anodyne and unmemorable piece of bluster and pomp (the occasion was the coronation of Queen Elizabeth). The Partita is an earlier but better work, characterized by a fine balance between evocative, wistful romanticism and classical elegance. That said, I do think the movements all tend to go on for just a little bit longer than the material warrants ‚Äì at a total of 25 minutes a bit more substance would have been welcome. The Two ballads op.1 for baritone and orchestra are often haunting and impressively sensitively scored for a composer in his early twenties, but hardly masterpieces.But none of my criticisms of the works mentioned matter in the grand scale of things. The main work here is Ferguson‚Äôs large-scale setting of the late-medieval poem The Dream of the Rook for soprano, chorus and orchestra ‚Äì his last completed work and, I think, at least arguably a genuine masterpiece. It is a wonderfully atmospheric, warmly scored work in the English choral tradition ‚Äì Howells, Vaughan Williams and Finzi spring to mind ‚Äì but so full of magical touches that it surpasses most other works in that tradition. Captivating throughout, it rises to an absolutely glorious climactic chorus (‚ÄúBut the Lord arose‚Äù), and though most of the work is somewhat restrained there is not a passage that is less than deeply impressive.Everything is given committed performances and the sound is spectacular. Although not all the music here is first-rate, given the quality of the Dream of the Rood I cannot justify giving the disc anything less than five stars. Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NIQA691DZWXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000APZ#wasThisHelpful","R1NIQA691DZWXW","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This disc was recorded as a centenary tribute to Sir Thomas Armstrong (1898-1994), a distinguished academic and Principal of London‚Äôs Royal Academy of Music, and that‚Äôs what it sounds like. What I mean is that although the performances sound generally well-prepared and idiomatic, the music is primarily of specialist interest, perhaps primarily to the many whose lives seem to have been touched by Thomas Armstrong. That is not to say that the music is bad, at least not in general, but there are definitely no revelations here.The earliest work, A passer-by, is actually rather fine. Subtitled ‚ÄúA Rhapsody for baritone solo, chorus and orchestra‚Äù, this is a 14-minute setting of Robert Bridge‚Äôs poem from 1922, rather anonymous in style but exhibiting some nice Delian touches that will probably appeal to many of those who like British music from the period. Much the same can be said for the closing work, Friends departed, from 1928 ‚Äì it is more personal in style, to be sure, and more tautly constructed, but still a somewhat anonymous work with some nice touches.The rest is less interesting. The six part-songs are, I suppose, decent enough if you like this kind of thing, but there is nothing memorable about them either, and the London Philharmonic Choir sounds somewhat uninspired (which is understandable). The little Sinfonietta is eminently forgettable, but where things really go bad is in brief the piano quintet, which must surely contain one of the most badly conceived openings in the chamber music literature (seriously), and continues with some meandering string pads accompanied by an ‚Ä¶ ululating, grating piano part. It is not helped by the rather poor balance between instruments exhibited here, but nothing would really have helped this one. It is fortunately short.Apart from some uncertainties and moments of uninspired singing from the chorus the performances are good and the sound is generally fine (apart from the balance in the piano quintet). In sum, then, the disc is worth hearing for A passer-by and Friends departed, which ‚Äì despite lacking any truly individual voice ‚Äì are atmospheric and beautiful enough. The rest was really not necessary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P4A89V6MARUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000007TRJ#wasThisHelpful","R2P4A89V6MARUR","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aleksander Kopylov (1854-1911) is not among the composers usually mentioned among the Russian Silver Age of composers, and perhaps his music doesn‚Äôt quite exhibit the imagination, color and melodic memorability of Glazunov or Liadov, but I think I dare guarantee that if you like the music of those composers you‚Äôll enjoy this one. Yes, stylistically the music belongs to the school of the composers mentioned and owes a lot to the Mighty Five, in particular Borodin, but is none the worse for that.The relatively ambitious Symphony in c minor is a product of the patronage of Mitrofan Belyayev and was dedicated to Liadov. It opens, rather surprisingly, with a 20-minute Andante movement that contains enough incident and good ideas to sustain its length, even if the structure is perhaps not ideally taut ‚Äì and if the orchestration isn‚Äôt as ingenious as that of Rimsky-Korsakov, Kopylov clearly knew a trick or two. The comparatively very brief Scherzo movement is excellent, though the following, second andante movement perhaps a bit too uneventful and untroubled ‚Äì and the main theme not sufficiently distinctive ‚Äì for its 11 minutes, but the majestic, glittering finale is impressive enough. All in all, perhaps not quite a first-rate symphony, but a very enjoyable one and certainly worth hearing.The two shorter works are great fun. The Scherzo is dance-like and vivacious with some good ideas and tunes, whereas the Overture is ‚Äì though rather typical of the time and tradition ‚Äì atmospheric and enjoyable. Everything is played with spirit and panache, and the recording is good. A very worthwhile addition to the catalogue, then, guaranteed to please ‚Äì as mentioned ‚Äì anyone who likes the music of the Russian Silver Age. Apparently Kopylov was, in his time, particularly recognized for his chamber music, especially his four string quartets, which it would be interesting to hear. Or perhaps someone would have a look at, say, the Ukrainian Symphony by Mykhailo Kalachevsky (once recorded on LP by Melodiya) or the music of Georgi Conus (brother of the Julius Conus of the relatively famous violin concerto).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GM3GATP5FW7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009QAL#wasThisHelpful","R2GM3GATP5FW7D","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ASV cycle of Rimsky-Korsakov orchestral works provides a nice survey, and the performances are certainly colorful and dramatic (sometimes borderline breathless) even if they may lack the last touch of both finesse and magic (J√§rvi, Svetlanov and Ansermet, say, are probably preferable in the end, though less comprehensive). In any case, this ‚Äì at least the best of them ‚Äì are works that anyone with even a moderate interest in colorful, atmospheric, romantic music need to know, and the ASV performances, divided between Yondani Butt and Loris Tjeknavorian do the music justice.The disc at hand, with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Yondani Butt, opens with the relatively familiar overture to The Tsar‚Äôs Bride, a splendidly invigorating curtain raiser, though I suppose Gergiev‚Äôs performance as part of the eminently worthwhile complete opera is a tad more exhilarating than this one. As for the Fantasia on Serbian Themes, this is an early work and is somewhat more loosely structured than Rimsky‚Äôs later works ‚Äì yet the atmosphere is certainly there, and the work as a whole is a memorable experience.The first symphony is also a (very) early work (though it was later revised), and is hardly a masterpiece. Stylistically it sounds like a very Russian-nationalistic version of Schumann, and though the thematic material is perhaps not the strongest it does have plenty of character. The performance here is also very good, especially in the best movement, the finale, which really comes to life under the baton of Yondani Butt ‚Äì the ending is truly fiery. But whatever its qualities the first symphony is nothing compared to the second. Rimsky-Korsakov‚Äôs second symphony, Antar, might be a bit more of a symphonic suite than a symphony in character, but it really is, in my mind, one of the greatest symphonic works ever written; its glorious themes really sound like nothing else, and they‚Äôre developed with such magic and imagination that you will (or at least I am) be utterly captivated from the first second to the last. And it really is a one-off ‚Äì nothing else in Rimsky‚Äôs output, nor in anyone else‚Äôs, really sounds anything like that second symphony. That said, I think there is a bit more variety, a bit more magic, to the work than is captured by the performance at hand, despite plenty of color and atmosphere; sometimes I think Butt pushes it just a bit too hard, with the result that the music becomes just a bit breathless.The sound is large but clear and not overly reverberant. Though perhaps not a first choice in the second symphony (albeit arguably in the first), this is an overall very fine disc, well worth acquiring ‚Äì the competition is strong in the main works, but the Serbian Fantasia is at least a very worthwhile rarity that might make this a tempting acquisition even if you need at least to hear some of the alternatives mentioned above in the second symphony as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q80LXNRX2JTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000063CU#wasThisHelpful","R2Q80LXNRX2JTO","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harald Genzmer (1909-2007) is actually pretty well-represented on disc, though those discs might be rather difficult to get hold of at a reasonable prize, and the disc at hand is, I admit, my first and only exposure to his music. And though the music is hardly revolutionary it did make me want to hear more. According to himself, his music ‚Äúshould appeal to performers by being practicable and to listeners by being intelligible,‚Äù which it certainly is, and his declared influences are Rudi Stephan, Richard Strauss and Max Reger. The most obvious influence, however, is Hindemith, and although he lived and worked through most of the major developments of the 20th century, he stuck with his ideals.The music is generally melodic (though not afraid of dissonance) and polyphonic in the manner of Hindemith, yet ‚Äì despite the obvious influence ‚Äì you‚Äôd never mistake Genzmer‚Äôs music for that of the older composer; Genzmer‚Äôs melodic material, his textures and atmospheres are his own, sometimes rooted in German folk music, sometimes ‚Äì perhaps surprisingly ‚Äì suggesting the open-air, blue-sky soundscapes of Carl Nielsen. British commentators sometimes suggest Malcolm Arnold as a comparison, and although Genzmer‚Äôs music doesn‚Äôt really sound anything like Arnold‚Äôs, I sort of see why one might be struck by the comparison, especially with regard to the shifts between darkness and playfulness (though with less sarcasm) in Genzmer‚Äôs music.The 1954 flute concerto is perhaps the work where the Nielsen associations are the strongest. It is a playful, quirky work, though the finale is quite aggressive, at least until the mischievous wink at the end. Andrea Lieberknecht gives a delightful performance of the solo part. Oliver Triendl‚Äôs playing of the second piano concertino with strings (1963) comes across as perhaps slightly more workmanlike, but that might be because the content is slightly more ‚Ä¶ dour, for lack of a better word ‚Äì it is still an interesting and ultimately rewarding work. The viola concerto from 1968 is more restrained and inward-looking, but contains its share of (well-planned) blooming outbursts and small, humorous anecdotes. Lars Anders Tomter gives a very fine rendition of the solo part. Throughout the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbr√ºcken with Werner Andreas Albert provides solid though somewhat unexceptional support and the sound is, if a little gray, fine enough. All in all a rewarding if not ultimately revelatory release, recommended to any fan of tonal 20th century music, especially fans of Hindemith (though, again, Genzmer‚Äôs style is distinctive enough never to sound derivative).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76GX0JCTL8L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MV9PIK#wasThisHelpful","R76GX0JCTL8L0","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Faur√©‚Äôs second opera, P√©n√©lope (yes, he wrote two, though Prom√©th√©e is hardly ever heard and doesn‚Äôt seem to have received a complete recording) is a late work (1913), but although his late chamber music has established themselves pretty firmly in the repertoire, P√©n√©lope has not fared so well, despite being described by e.g. Copland as one of the best operas written since Wagner. One of the reasons may be that the music is, overall, ‚Äúdistinctly non-theatrical‚Äù ‚Äì indeed, the musical style is distinctly written in the flowing, ever-changing and dreamy style of his late chamber works ‚Äì no big arias or easy excerpts here ‚Äì and Faur√© seems to have deliberately avoided much in terms of stage action until the very end (a pity, then, that the libretto is otherwise rather uninteresting). That said, the work does employ leitmotifs, and the two main roles may perhaps require something of a Wagnerian quality ‚Äì apart from that, the music ha preciously little to do with Wagner. Oh, well ‚Äì it is a beautiful, powerful score, and if it is hard to imagine it working very well on stage that matters little when listening to an audio-only set like this.The warmly lyrical rather than dramatic music requires a bit expressive shading and tenderness from the singers, and Jessye Norman in the title role succeeds marvelously, with radiant, warm singing that is especially impressive in the upper register. Equally impressive, however, is her expressive range and thoughtful characterization - some has said that she's a bit emotionally distant but if that's so, isn't that a very valid interpretation of the character? Alain Vanzo is perhaps less convincing in terms of convincing characterization, but at least his singing is beautiful. As a matter of fact, it is hard to find a weak link in the cast (at least among the more major characters). The orchestral playing is first-rate as well, and although the sound is a bit cavernous it certainly does little to ruin the experience. Which is, of course, fortunate given the absence of much serious competition in this work. Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CML67HDMCU41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000005E6N#wasThisHelpful","R3CML67HDMCU41","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Marx‚Äôs style remained thoroughly committed to romanticism long after it went out of fashion, but although his style is conservative and romantic it really sounds like no one else‚Äôs. There is certainly a bit of Reger in it, but also arguably some Italian influences (Martucci and Respighi, though none of the relatively early works on this disc are likely to have been actually influenced by the latter composer). The music is melodic, and if I were to give a brief description of Marx‚Äôs sound world ‚Äì both in the works here and elsewhere ‚Äì his themes and melodic material seem to be in the style of typical (yet often memorable) salon music; but what he does with that material has surely nothing to do with salon music; rather, he puts it to service in convincing large-scale structures and the results are, somehow, as passionate, powerful and profound and as far removed from ‚Äúlight music‚Äù as the music of Brahms or Mahler. You wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd work, but it does.The three works for piano quartet here were all written in 1911 and are all single-movement works; large-scale, ambitious and symphonic in nature if not actually in form (the sonata-form reminiscences are at least hard to discern). The opening Rhapsody is, at 28 minutes, arguably on the long side, but so filled with incident and glorious melodic ideas that I, for one, won‚Äôt complain. It is also, if not exactly formally taut, at least a structurally convincing work in four relatively clearly separate sections. The 17-minute Scherzo is perhaps somewhat less memorable but still a major work well worth investigating for any fan of late-romantic chamber music ‚Äì it is invigorating, fresh and sunny but not without depth.The masterpiece, however, is the Ballade, which at 17‚Äô32 doesn‚Äôt feel a moment too long. It opens with a lengthy theme in the solo cello (reminiscent, I think, of Bach‚Äôs cello suites, which the composer may or may not have known), which launches an expansive fugue with plenty of textural variation and plays with lights and shadows. It really is a wonderful work with touches of impressionism and some truly memorable themes. As a first approximation, one may perhaps imagine a more transparently textured version of Reger, but the thematic material is really nothing like Reger's.In short, this is splendid music, with the best (in particular the Ballade) being at least almost worthy of the designation ‚Äúlost masterpiece‚Äù. The performances are convincing if perhaps lacking the last touch of brilliance and the sound is good. The presentation is good as well, and overall I would rate this as something of a major discovery. Strongly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PE2ZFKD4QZQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MPHA0I#wasThisHelpful","R2PE2ZFKD4QZQC","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tilo Medek (1940-2006) belonged, at least earlier in his career, to what one might perhaps call the ‚Äúlast generation of tonal composer‚Äù ‚Äì meaning that, like the very different musical languages of, say, Treibmann or Sallinen, Medek‚Äôs music is rooted in tonality, but there is nothing ‚Äúneo‚Äù about the language, and it is not really derivative or unoriginal either; rather, the music stands on (rather than breaks with) and develops further the ideas of composers like Hindemith, Shostakovich or Stravinsky. Thus, in his ambitious, four-movement cello concerto (1978) you can hear plenty of things that will remind you of Hindemith, Stravinsky and Mahler, though Medek also seems to be very much aware of the allusions and associations, playing around with them, using them to underline main lines of argument, and taking the associations in unusual directions.That said, the cello concerto is no mere game, but a substantial and very worthwhile addition to the repertoire. The four movements are equipped with literary titles and do sound as if they (as the booklet also points out) are poised between absolute music and program music. Yes, the music is abstract, but there is a clear narrative structure to the music and the conversations between the soloists and various orchestral instruments, all painted on a large canvas that do present you with a unified, clearly structured point. Is it a great work? Well, though the composer manages to keep it together, and although almost every twist and idea is interesting, one does feel that the work would have benefited from some more self-control; it is, in the final verdict, longer than the material can justify.The two remaining works are, I think, among the strongest contributions to the solo cello repertoire I have heard in a while. Stele is a memorial for Bernd Alois Zimmermann and seems on the surface to be written in a slightly less compromising musical language; yet it is a deeply captivating work in which the music both manages to flow freely and ingeniously while also conveying a sense of depth and struggle. Schattenspiele consists of five short, remarkable pieces that do, indeed, suggest an intricate play with shadows and echoes of the music just presented.The cello soloist, Guido Schiefen, is superb in those solo pieces. He is also good in the solo part of the concerto, where the live recording gives the playing an extra dimension of danger and energy, I suppose. The problem is that there are some passages where the performances seem on the verge of falling together ‚Äì particularly in the playing of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Israel Yinon; for the most part they acquit themselves very well, but the music sounds like it sometimes proved a tough challenge and occasionally too much of a challenge. Oh well, this is overall very good performances of some fascinating music, well worth investigating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AA1RFOA78QY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E113NK#wasThisHelpful","R1AA1RFOA78QY2","A33GGROUQRQZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33GGROUQRQZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CPO has certainly done the music of Felix Weingartner a service, and the present disc concludes their cycle of his symphonies with the ambitious, choral seventh, completed in 1942, the year of the composer's death. Those who know any of the previous releases in the series know what to expect ‚Äì Weingartner‚Äôs sound world is that of a polished, post-Wagnerian late-romanticism without any sharp edges; warm, superbly scored and a bit anonymous. Clearly inspired by Beethoven‚Äôs ninth ‚Äì almost too obviously so at times ‚Äì the seventh symphony is, unfortunately, far from Weingartner‚Äôs best; if you follow this series you‚Äôll probably want it, but this is, honestly, pretty thin gruel, and newcomers are advised to start with an earlier work, perhaps preferably the second.The opening movement starts off in a rather Brucknerian vein, which then gives way to a fugato that sounds like it was fun to write but which makes for a less rewarding listening experience. While the first movement is instrumental, the second sets a poem by Friedrich Hebbel ‚Äì Weingartner doesn‚Äôt really seem to care whether the music reflects the meaning of the poem, however, and frankly: Though Weingartner was very skilled orchestrator, writing for voices seems to find him a bit at loss. The instrumental scherzo sounds overall decent, though, and the trio melody is beautiful.The meat of the work, though, is the finale, which lasts more than half an hour. How, you may ask, can anyone but a Bruckner or perhaps a Mahler create a coherent symphonic movement of that length? Well, that‚Äôs the rub. Weingartner certainly doesn‚Äôt, and there is plenty of meandering going on ‚Äì in particular, he spends an awful lot of time in moving between the main elements. Even his choice of text is strange ‚Äì there are two poems, one by Carmen Studen (his wife) and the other by H√∂lderlin, and I, for one, have no idea what the connection may be. At least the ending, when it comes, is very effective with its return to the opening of the first movement, bringing the whole thing to a rather glorious culmination.You may have come to expect exemplary performances by the Basel Symphony Orchestra under Marko Letonja ‚Äì they have certainly done well for themselves in the earlier issues in this series. Here, however, lack of preparation shines through, and in particular the scherzo movement contains some rough and tentative passages. The singers are somewhat variable as well ‚Äì though Rolf Romei and Maya Boog deliver plenty of fine singing in the finale (though also here they are a bit variable), the soloists seem disinterested in the second movement ‚Äì perhaps a result of the clumsiness of the vocal writing. The choir is no more than adequate, though the recording, at least, is good.

"Wow! Those dedicated crate diggers at Soundway have really outdone themselves with this excellent collection of music from Colombia. Even if you have any of the excellent compilations of cumbia music from Colombia's renowned Disco Fuentes label, the music on this CD will be a very pleasant and welcome addition to your collection.The main style featured on this CD is called Champeta, described in the liner notes as  ""a re-invention of afro music in Colombia, mixed with Caribbean psychedelia, afro roots and elements of cumbia and other styles native to the Caribbean coast."" There has long been an African influence in the music of Colombia, thanks in part to the slave trade the came to that country's coast 500 years ago. In addition to that, during the 1970s music from the Congo, Kenya, and South African became very popular in Colombia, further contributing to the melting pot of sounds.The result is an infectious and lively blend of rhythms and vivacious singing. These musicians and singers are holding nothing back! Listen to this CD a few times and I swear you will be singing ""Palenque, Palenque!"" at the top of your lungs ... and maybe doing a dance on the counter top too. Honestly,  this is extremely additive music, the sort of stuff that can Iiven up any party and bring a big smile to your face, even if you don't understand the lyrics.This CD comes with a 36-page booklet that includes a very fascinating history of Champeta and Colombian music from this era written by Lucas Silva. The track listings include songwriter credits, original issue date and original album name, plus song times. Another outstanding compilation from Soundway.

"I grew up during the ""golden age"" of Southern Rock in the 1970s, and I still love listening to groups such as the Marshall Tucker Band, the Outlaws, Wet Willie, Atlanta Rhythm Section, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and many others. Great music that hasn't lost any of its vitality. But for some reason, I missed out on Cowboy during those years .Granted, they only released two albums in the early '70s, but I'm still puzzled why I never heard them until now. Well, this was a belated discovery, but a very welcome one. Add this album, and the other Cowboy release ""5'll Getcha Ten"" the ranks of classic southern rock records.Actually, the sound of this album isn't so much rock, but more country and folk. Soothing acoustic guitar playing and ringing harmonies are the hallmarks of Tommy Talton and Scott Boyer, the two leaders of Cowboy. If I had to compare them to anyone of that era, I'd say their sound was closer to that of a band like Poco. More on the mellow side, but pleasingly so.This CD reissue comes with a 12-page booklet that includes an essay about the band and these recordings written by Scott Schinder, as well as lyrics to all of the songs.

"I bought the two other compilations of songs the Dave Hamilton produced, also reissued by BGP, and I totally loved them. Hamilton was a VERY prolific writer and producer, but never got the props or publicity that his fantastic music deserved. As the back cover says, ""In Dave Hamilton's studio in Detroit the '70s arrived with a funky beat and a sense of experimentation. The results are a wild mixture of lo-fi funk and soul.""As I write this, there is one other review posted on this page, giving this CD only 1 star, citing the ""hideous"" sound of the remastering. I realize that some people are pickier about sound quality and that not everyone hears things the same way, and perhaps I have a higher tolerance for ""lo-fi"" recordings, but I don't find anything on this collection annoying or difficult to listen to whatsoever. I think giving this outstanding collection of music only 1 star is the real travesty.But I digress. There are plenty of rare and obscure soul treats on this generous 22-track CD. Amazon's main product review, and the liner notes, city artists such as Curtis Mayfield, the Temptations, and Funkadelic as having influenced some of these songs. I'd also add the Meters, Isaac Hayes, and female singers such as Bettye LaVette and Candi Staton in some cases too. Some of the tracks here are instrumentals, or vocal versions of songs that WERE instrumentals on the previous Dave Hamilton collections. From what the liner notes say, Hamilton's studio was ""open at all times"" and he recorded a ""vast quantity"" of instrumentals, some of which were created as backing tracks. But you can count on one thing: all of these tracks, whether instrumental or with vocals, have an infectious, vibrant, and funky edge.One of Hamilton's biggest discoveries was O.C. Tolbert (also the subject of a separate CD collection by Kent, ""Black Diamond"" that is well worth seeking out), and his has two wonderful songs on this CD, including one track, ""Love Bandit,"" that was recently discovered after having been mis-labeled as being by another singer. Another highlight on this CD is the funky anti-drug tune ""You Fool You"" by Prophet & His Disciples. Actually, that song takes up two tracks as a Part 1 and a Part 2. Then there is the Bolton Brothers, the Barrino Brothers, Little Ann, Chico & Buddy, another version of Billy Garner's ""Brand New Girl"" and so much more. Really, I can't recommend this, as well as the other Dave Hamilton collections, highly enough. This may be ""messy"" and ""lo-fi"" but it's got funk and feel and good vibes galore. For me, that's what really counts.This CD comes with a 12-page booklet with liner notes by Dean Rudland and some Black & White photos of Hamilton and a few of the recording artists. Fans of late 1960s and early 1970s soul music will find a lot of wonderful discoveries here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W66B7VP1CBKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007I0OQ3W#wasThisHelpful","R1W66B7VP1CBKA","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1975 album still holds up as one of the very best ones that Robert Palmer recorded, but it doesn't seem to get the praise it deserves, sandwiched between his amazing debut solo effort, ""Sneaking Sally Through the Alley"" and his more popular MTV-hyped albums and singles in the 1980s.Palmer does a superb job of covering songs by Toots & the Maytals (the title track), the Lowell George/Little Feat gem ""Trouble"", and Allen Toussaint's ""River Boat."" But perhaps the best material on here are Palmer originals such as ""Give Me an Inch"", ""Back in My Arms"", and ""Fine Time."" Honestly, not a dud in the bunch. This is terrific album from start to finish.And how 'bout those talented backing musicians? Who are they? Well, that brings up my next point. The only reason I'm deducting this a star is the almost total lack of information and liner notes on this Island CD reissue. This is one of those cheap versions with no booklet or details about the recordings, so lacking in info that might as well be a CD-R. The fact that all of the members of Little Feat, including Lowell George, played on this album is not even mentioned. A shameful omission to an otherwise splendid recording. At least Amazon is selling this for a very low price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SAAYOUPPJREK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001FU1#wasThisHelpful","R2SAAYOUPPJREK","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've only recently discovered the music of jazz organist Charles Earland, but I'm hooked! Almost on a whim I tried ""Black Talk!"" and totally loved its addictive soul-jazz grooves. That led to getting ""Intensity"" and then his live album. Once again, very hot stuff. They don't call him ""The Mighty Burner"" for nothing! Then I saw this 1974 album with Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson, two jazz legends in their own right, and I just had to get it CD too. And I'm happy I did; this is another keeper!As you tell by the other glowing reviews, this is indeed a fantastic album, but one where Earland shares the spotlight with his horn-playing buddies. In fact, listening to much of this album, you'd be hard-pressed to call it a Charles Earland solo album with so much great horn playing, not only Joe Henderson on tenor sax and Freddie Hubbard on trumpet and flugelhorn, but another jazz vet, Eddie Henderson, pops up to play trumpet on four tracks. But rest assured that Earland is still playing up a storm on organ, particularly on ""Warp Factor 9"", ""Van Jay"" and the album's stunning closing song, ""Never Ending Melody."" I'm a big fan of jazz organ and I think Earland was one of the most underrated masters of the instrument, but man, you gotta love the horns on this album too, and the way they mix with Earland's organ and the rhythm section is frequently spectacular. This is total jazz paradise!While Earland doesn't hog the show, it remains his album because he wrote almost all of the songs. Except for an excellent version of Hubbard's classic ""Red Clay"" and a cool Joe Henderson song, ""No Me Esqueca,"" the rest of the songs were written by Earland. Yes, he's also an underrated songwriter too. If you're a fan of any of these master musicians --- and let's not forget the amazing Harvey Mason on drums too --- you need to check out this masterful album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBYNEFTFD5XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000ZG0#wasThisHelpful","RVBYNEFTFD5XJ","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is another wonderful musical discovery, unearthed and reissued by the reliable Analog Africa label. Amazon's product review says that this band is from South Africa, but that's not the case. They were from Zimbabwe (or Rhodesia, as it was known back in those days), but were certainly known to music lovers in that region back in the mid to late 1970s. In fact, South African music legend West Nkosi produced many of the songs on this collection.There are plenty of joyous, seductively slinky rhythms that abound in these songs. The Green Arrows fused a bit of that South African township jive sound with a grittier, funkier edge. Of one song on this collection, the liner notes praise the ""gutsy, psychedelic, zim-hoedown style which became the band's signature. It was around that time that the music of the Green Arrows was dubbed 'Waka Waka' by the fans, due to Stanley's guitar sound."" I have no idea what a ""zim-hoedown"" is or was, but Stanley Manatsa (his brother Zexie was the band's bass player and lead singer) did indeed use some creative ""fuzz"" effects for his distinctive guitar sound.This compilation is divided into two parts, the first 10 tracks taken from the ""Chipo Chiroowa"" album recorded in 1974-75, and the other 10 tracks are dubbed the ""Waka Waka Selection"" from 1976-79. Needless to say, this is lively, powerful music with danceable rhythms galore. The CD come with an informative 24-page booklet with liner notes by Samy Ben Redjeb, plus some cool old photos of the band members. This was a talented band that should have been much better known. Sadly, however, that was the case with so many great African artists in the 1970s. In any case, this is a very worthwhile purchase that should excite fans of this golden era of African music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDFN3CFZ80L9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E3LCPU#wasThisHelpful","RDFN3CFZ80L9Z","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD is another very strong addition to the ""Backbeats"" series, this time focusing on songs from the famous Philadelphia International label. The front cover hails this is ""Sophisicated 80s Philly Soul"", but this collection actually includes 9 tracks from the 1970s, plus of the material culled from the '80s, 6 tracks are from 1980.As the other reviewer noted, these selections are not the hit singles from that label. You can find those great but well-played songs elsewhere, but this compilation serves more as ""re-introduction"" to the forgotten album tracks by the label's more prominent names, and perhaps a few songs by singers you might not have heard before such as Anthony White, Dee Dee Sharp Gamble, and one of the label's more prolific songwriters, Bunny Sigler. I love this idea of putting lesser known and rare tracks on these ""Backbeats"" CDs, and this one has plenty of wonderful new discoveries. I was particularly struck by ""Start the Fire"" by Jean Carn, 'You're My Sweetness"" by Billy Paul (you can't go wrong with any of his fine albums), ""Set a Little Trap"" by Phyllis Hyman, an ""Easy, Easy, Got to Take It Easy"" by Teddy Pendergrass. If you love that classic Philadelphia International '70s soul sound, you'll find a lot to like on this 74-minute CD.My only complaint, and it's a minor one, lies with the information in the CD booklet. The song credits list the songwriter and song times, plus the year the song was released. That's all appreciate, But for every song it notes that it is the ""album version"" and not a single edit ... but they don't tell you which album the song originally came from! Other than that annoying omission, this is a fine collection of delicious soul music.

"I've never visited the Ivory Coast, or any country in Africa, but Carol Spindel's evocative descriptions of life in the village where she spent a year with her husband in the early 1980s, doing agricultural research, makes me feel like I'd been along for the adventure. And that's the highest praise I can give this compelling book. Her sense of place, and the way she portrays the villagers and their simple yet fascinating lifestyle, is very well done.Spindel has an empathetic feel for these villagers, but she's also not shy about discussing some aspects of this very different culture that trouble her or are problematic for one reason or another. She also pulls no punches when describing her reservations about one particularly shady character who is helping her husband conduct research in the area. You can't help rooting for Spindel as she makes a concerted effort to learn to speak the local language, and become more aware of the local traditions, dos and don'ts. By the end of the book she has become accepted by this group of villagers, many of whom were either scared of her initially, or who didn't know what to make of the idea of her and her husband living among them.In the book's introduction Spindel acknowledges that she is ""not a scholar, attempting to analyze and explain. Many aspects of life in Kalikaha are never discussed, and many others are treated superficially."" But her honest attempts at observing, understanding, and helping the people she met during her stay are nothing more than a resounding success.I'm sure that anyone who has visited to this part of Africa will find this book to be an interesting read, but even if you're like me and have never visited this part of the world, this book sheds light on a fascinating way of life, and helps us to better understand the whole concept of understanding one another and bridging cultures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NDCNRYY316FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679722149#wasThisHelpful","R2NDCNRYY316FJ","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't feel that I need to offer a lengthy discourse on the greatness of Richard Thompson. Since most people reading this are already familiar with his music It would be like preaching to the choir, right? But I'll just say that I've been listening to Richard Thompson since the late 1970s and own a few dozen of his albums, and consider him one of music's greatest treasures. And to the point: This new album ranks with the best of his many fine albums.Also no need to give a track-by-track breakdown, but there are MANY fine moments on this album (the first disc produced by Jeff Tweedy, and the second disc --- more of an EP --- produced by RT himself) that will please longtime fans of this amazing artist. Yes, he's a talented guitar player with a very distinctive style, but I've always been more impressed with his songwriting chops. This guy can write some killer songs, and there are plenty to savor here. Listening to this new set of songs, there is a familiarity to the tone and the texture of the music, yet nothing feels regurgitated or forced. Thompson remains energized and inspired and still has plenty of new ideas.

"No two ways about it; this set is a vintage reggae goldmine! Two CDs packed with seductive, delightful reggae music, mostly from 1968-1972. As the liner notes say, ""In 1967 Joe Gibbs became one of the new generation of Jamaican music producers who began to challenge the dancehall supremacy of long-established pioneers like Sir Coxesone, Duke Reid, Prince Buster, et al."" On this collection reggae fans will find plenty of familiar names and a few no-names, performing intoxicating original tunes alongside many covers of popular R&B and pop songs of the era. ... but it's all uniformly fantastic!Like the reviewer on this page Comment Man said, I also have a burgeoning collection of reggae albums, including a few dozen compilations, and I too was pleased that there were only a couple of songs on this collection that I'd heard before. So, I think it's a safe bet that even the diehard reggae lover will find many new discoveries on this collection. But don't go thinking that this is just a bunch of obscure reggae songs that were thrown together to fill two discs. No, man, this is reggae gold, all very high quality songs that rank with the best of the stuff that labels like Trojan and Treasure Isle put out. Really, it's that special.The CDs come with a 12-page booklet with a short essay about Joe Gibbs and his musical contributions, plus commentary on each track. There are songwriting credits but no specific recording dates listed for each track, and songs times are not listed. But whatever details that are lacking in the credits is more than made up for by the sheer quality of the music.

"I've only recently -- admittedly, very belatedly --- heard this 1993 album by Al Stewart and I'm very pleased with it. I can't believe that one reviewer called this ""Uneven and Inconsistent"". To my ears that's far from the case. This is a consistently good album, with several excellent songs that that would qualify for another ""Best Of"" collection. Al Stewart has released many fine albums over the course of his career and ""Famous Last Words"" is yet another winner.If you're already an Al Stewart fan, you pretty much know what to expect and he doesn't deviate much from his usual musical template on this album. Those distinctive vocals and well-crafted songs with intelligent lyrics, all backed by Al's impeccable guitar playing and a host of other skilled musicians (including album co-producer Peter White on guitar and keyboards). The end result is a very satisfying and comforting listening experience.  Other reviewers have proclaimed the 8-minute ""Trains"" as one of the album's best songs, and I can only agree. A fine tune that sounds even better with each listen. Other favorites include ""Peter On the White Sea"", ""Charlotte Corday"" (co-written with Tori Amos""), and ""Don't Forget Me"". The CD's booklet includes lyrics to all of the songs.Don't be concerned that there weren't any ""hits"" from this album. Even back in the '90s when this was first released, radio had become a non-factor. The core concern is always the quality of the music, and on that note Al Stewart delivered another strong album. Al Stewart fans, don't sleep on ""Famous Last Words""; this one is a keeper!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34558V2OHNK26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000034AQ#wasThisHelpful","R34558V2OHNK26","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great collection of songs by a woefully underrated American band. But ... as I write this review, Amazon is selling this collection as a CD-R version, and for nearly 14 dollars!!! Sorry, but that borders on criminal. Why sell a CD-R for so much money? And why isn't the official Rhino Records version still being sold? Yeah, you can dig up copies from secondhand dealers, but ""Best of"" collections like this one should not be sold as those rip-off CD-Rs.As for the music, this collection includes all their biggest hits and brings back some great memories from the 1960 (Does anyone remember the appearance of the ""Beau Brummel-stones"" on the Flintstones TV show?!), and more importantly some catchy tunes that stick in your head.

"If you are on this page, most probably you are already a fan of Durutti Column and that ""band's"" creator, Vini Reilly. That being the case, I'm probably preaching to the choir, but just to assure you; this is a fabulous album. Actually, it's a two-for-one package, combining the never-before-released ""Short Stories For Pauline"" album (recorded back in 1983) along with a live concert recording from Brussels in 1981.Many of the diehard Durutti Column fans might already be familiar with some of this material: 9 of the tracks from ""Short Stories For Pauline"" were included on the ""Lips That Would Kiss"" compilation that came out in 1991, although several of those songs have entirely different titles! One track on this album, ""Duet,"" was used by Tony Wilson of Factory Record to ""expand"" an entire orchestral album by the Durutti Column, that being ""Without Mercy."" To further confuse matters, ""Duet"" was re-titled ""La Douleur"" on ""Lips That Would Kiss"" and according to the liner notes it was also released as ""Nighttime Estoril"" and ""A Little Mercy"". In any case, it's one of Vini's greatest compositions, dubbed ""a poignant instrumental for piano and violin"" in the liner notes. That violin part was played by Blaine Reininger from Tuxedomoon. Known more for his distinctive guitar style, Vini also is an outstanding piano player, and he shows his versatility on this track and others.This CD comes with a 12-page booklet with an essay about the recordings and this period of the Durutti Column's history. As to who wrote the liner notes, it doesn't say! Also, at the end of the live CD (an open-air performance at Place de la Monnaie that featured Vini on guitar and vocals with Bruce Mitchell on drums) there is an interesting/amusing interview with Vini Reilly.Not much more to say about this fine package.

"I noticed this book on the shelves many, many times, never bothering to read the blurb on the back cover or finding out what it was all about, before a friend recommended it to me. I am a frequent visitor to Myanmar (Burma) and absolutely love the country, the culture and the people. Finding out that this story takes place in that country's Shan State, an area that is especially dear to me, caused me to get even more excited about reading this novel. Long story short: I found this to be an incredibly captivating, inspiring, and beautiful novel, the sort of book that you wholeheartedly want to recommend to other reading friends.You can read the synopsis of the story elsewhere on this page, but I found this to be much more than a ""love story."" It also had elements of a riveting mystery, making it quite the page-turner, the reader wanting to find out what happened to Tin Win and Mi Mi. The author's writing style (or at least the style of the translator) is straightforward and uncluttered, yet also very evocative and descriptive. He does a fantastic job of capturing the feel and color of the Shan State town of Kalaw, plus describing the slow pace and unique way of life of the Burmese; in the towns, the teashops, and the monasteries. Like Tin Win, I can close my eyes and hear the myriad sounds and feel the presence of these special people.As much as I loved this novel, there were aspects of the story that required the reader to suspend belief, or accept some things with a grain of salt. But that's the magic and madness of fiction; it doesn't all have to make sense. But speaking of sense, the author's use of ""sense"", in the case of a describing how a blind character uses his other senses (the ""hearing heartbeats"" in the book's title), is particularly effective. To call it enchanting and magical would not be an understatement. This is one very special and moving novel.Because I love the setting of this novel so much, I may be biased in my reaction to the story, but honestly I think this is the sort of book that will appeal to a wide range of readers, regardless of their knowledge of anything Burmese.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR2I3OJENB99T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590514637#wasThisHelpful","RR2I3OJENB99T","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And this new album is indeed like going to a reunion of good friends and sharing good times.Many others have remarked about how strong this album is, and how it brings back memories of JT's great early 1970s albums, and I can only agree with those opinions. It's certainly not an exaggeration: It's as if James Taylor has been drinking from the musical fountain of youth, sounding as youthful and buoyant as he did back in the day, on albums like ""Mud Slide Slim"" and ""Sweet Baby James.""I won't bore you with a song-by-song breakdown of the tracks on this album. Suffice to say that these new tunes sparkle and shine, supported by strong melodies, Taylor's ageless vocals, and some impressive lyrical depth. If you've been a James Taylor fan over the years (decades!) then I think it's safe to say that you will be very satisfied with this excellent new album.

"I've been a Yo La Tengo fan for many years --- oops, I think ""decades"" would be more accurate at this point! --- and their ""Fakebook"" album of mostly acoustic cover tunes remains one of my very favorites, one of those recordings that is so amazing and so life-affirming that it would qualify as one of my Desert Island Discs.That love of ""Fakebook"" perhaps explains why I'm not quite as enthusiastic about this new Yo La Tengo album --- one that many are calling ""Fakebook 2"" ---- as I would be normally. Not to say that I don't like it; that's far from the case. I would wholeheartedly agree with reviewer Charlie Quaker who called this album ""a quiet little gem."" Indeed, this album is packed with sweet, wonderful songs, most of them cover versions (you can read about the who-what-when in other reviews), plus a couple of new Yo La Tengo  songs and a few re-makes of their older recordings. It's all good to great, but for me it's just not quite as magical or powerful as ""Fakebook"" was, and still is. But I applaud Ira Kaplan and his Yo La Tengo band members for at least attempting to recapture that acoustic magic. They came close to hitting it out of the park , but it only ended up being a ground rule double (sorry, I had to put in a baseball reference for Ira's benefit!).The CD doesn't come with a booklet or any liner notes to speak of, but the digi-pack folds out to reveal a listing of each track that informs the listener who did the original version, or which Yo La Tengo album the previous version came from. Once again, this might not be a classic, but it's still a mighty fine album; tastefully chosen tunes, performed with love and passion and harmony. And for me, that works very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELXRB0PCI2G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQIFWVY#wasThisHelpful","R2ELXRB0PCI2G8","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of this guy before buying the CD, but I had read some favorable reviews, plus seeing that the CD was reissued by the dependable Light in the Attic label made me feel like that this was a safe bet. Well, I have to admit that I'm not as knocked out as I had hoped. It's a decent album, with a couple of very good songs, but for the most part I didn't hear much that made a strong impression.This album was recorded in 1972 and obviously didn't make a big splash at the time, so after this one lone album, Bob Frank left the music business for a few decades until recent interest in his music helped to get back in the studio and make some new albums again. The main Amazon review tosses out a few names for comparison, and I certainly do hear a hint of Dylan in some of these songs, but also a bit of artists such as John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, and even Jesse Winchester. Plus, he's in the same ballpark as another neglected Memphis musician, Sid Selvidge.Perhaps one reason that I wasn't that thrilled with the album was Bob Frank's vocals. On many of these songs he uses an affected vocal style, as if he's trying to sound like some revered old bluesman. But alas, he was just a young musician from Memphis playing some fairly interesting folk-blues songs. Again, not bad stuff at all, but this album doesn't strike me as any sort of lost classic. And be forewarned about the length: the album only clocks in at 28 minutes and for some reason Light in the Attic did not add (or did not locate) any bonus material. The CD does, however, come with a very informative 24-page booklet that includes an interview with Bob Frank about his early days in the music business and comments on each track by Bob Frank.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9S8WGV5AG5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWTY292#wasThisHelpful","R3O9S8WGV5AG5O","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If someone had told me that this CD was intended as a ""Best Of"" Roy Ayers collection, I wouldn't have blinked or doubted it at all. This assemblage of ""unreleased recordings"" truly shines, offering the same delightfully addictive mix of soul and jazz grooves that Roy's better-known songs all were known for having. The period when these songs were recorded, from 1976 to 1981, was obviously a fertile one for Roy Ayers, and even unreleased ""scraps"" like these are of high quality.The only disappointing thing about the CD is the packaging. As another reviewer noted, Roy's liner notes --- basically, his comments on each of the album's songs --- are not much more than rambling gibberish, reading more like something an obsessed, and very young, fan would have written. Hey, at least he seems to remember most of the people that played on each track! In fact, after he's finished with his meandering memories of each song, there is a full listing of all the musicians and singers who appeared on each track, as well as songwriting credits. Missing, however, are the recording dates for the songs as well as the absence of song times.But hey, I'm nit-picking at this point. The music is what counts and there are plenty of great tunes on here --- over 75 minutes of music --- that burst with that distinctive Roy Ayers musical magic; pulsating vibes and generous grooves that will put the listener in a blissful orbit! If you're a Roy Ayers fan, don't miss this collection!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XGBAR2YZRMD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007YMUMU#wasThisHelpful","R1XGBAR2YZRMD2","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this compilation, ""The Down Home Soul of Z.Z. Hill"" is slightly misleading. When I think of ""down home soul"" of think of the gritty and soulful tunes recorded by southern R&B masters such as Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, George Jackson, and Wilson Pickett. It's not that Z.Z. Hill doesn't belong in that select company --- he was certainly a master in his own right --- but these early recordings that he made (except for two later tracks, these songs were all recorded from 1964 to 1967) show a smoother and slicker side of Z.Z. Hill. Part of the reason for that is that arrangements of the songs, produced and arranged by Maxwell Davis and his orchestra.I may be a bit harsh in giving this collection only 3 stars, but it just didn't move me, or soothe me, or impress me as much as the other albums that I have by Z.Z. Hill, particularly his excellent 1971 album, ""The Brand New Z.Z. Hill"" (produced by Swamp Dogg) or the fine 2-CD collection of his ""United Artists Recordings"" that spanned the years 1972-75. The early recordings on this CD are also a far cry from the acclaimed early 1980s blues albums that he made for the Malaco label, just before he tragically passed away in 1984.My misgivings about this album aside, there are some great tracks on here, songs that allow Z.Z. Hill to show off his earthy, buoyant vocal style. The songs that are strongest, in my opinion, are the ones recorded in 1967, such as ""You Can't Hide a Heartache, a cover of Sam Cooke's ""Nothing Can Change This Love"" and a very bluesy version of the Jimmy Hughes gem ""Steal Away."" One song that Hill wrote himself from that year, ""You Don't Love Me"" also shows his soulful, grittier side.In later interviews, Z.Z. Hill said he was ""uncomfortable"" with some of the earlier recordings, and yet he told another interviewer that ""the records were great."" Mixed feelings perhaps, which is sort of the way I feel about this album. As a vocalist, Hill shines throughout these recordings, but some of the weaker material, plus the slicker string arrangements combine to dampen my enthusiasm.This CD was compiled by Kent Records and distributed by Ace, but the booklet and liner notes fall a bit beneath their usual excellent standards. The CD comes with a thin 4-page booklet that has an essay about Z.Z. Hill written by Cliff White. That gives you a good background about Hill's entire recording career, but it doesn't really go into a lot of detail about these particular recordings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7K4VZTJK8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000026F1M#wasThisHelpful","R7W7K4VZTJK8R","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The reviewers that praised these two soundtrack albums as ""masterpieces"" and even ""superior"" to Isaac's famous ""Shaft"" score are both right; these are indeed outstanding albums, either as soundtracks to the films or as stand-alone works. Pure soul-jazz bliss!I had heard a few songs off these albums in the past, thanks to a ""Hits"" collection that I have by Isaac Hayes, plus the fabulous ""Pursuit of the Pimpmobile"" which is on a couple of compilation albums that I have. But most of the music on these albums was totally new to my ears. And what a delight it was do discover these two 1970s soundtrack gems, both of them released in 1974. The result is less of a typical ""Blaxploitation"" sound --- one that Isaac and other musicians pioneered that decade -- that you would associate with soundtracks of the era, but more of a varied and complex musical palette, mixing soul and funk with atmospheric and jazzy instrumentals, plus a few mellow vocal tracks. Singing or arranging, Isaac Hayes shows his mastery throughout these recordings.The first soundtrack, ""Tough Guys"" was a single album when first released, while ""Truck Turner"" was a double-album set. One this 2-CD reissue, the first disc (which includes songs of both soundtracks) runs 52 minutes, while disc two (all ""Truck Turner"") is 55 minutes. One reviewer mentioned the better packaging on the Ace reissue, and I'd be curious what extras that version had. I have the Stax/Fantasy CD version that includes only a thin insert that lists the tracks and recording dates, but doesn't have any booklet or essays about the recordings. The only details (if you even can call them that) are the credits that say that Isaac Hayes supplied the vocals ""with Rhythm by The Movement and Strings by the Memphis Symphony Orchestra."" And that's it for any information.That lack of detail in the liner notes is slightly disappointing, seeing as how tremendous both of these albums are. Nevertheless, Amazon is currently selling this 2-CD set for a very reasonable price, so if you're an Isaac Hayes fan, or anyone who loves 1970s soul, this set is a must have, two of Isaac's underrated masterpieces!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LWCLBNQVQAIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000ZN1#wasThisHelpful","R1LWCLBNQVQAIN","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had only heard 2 songs by the Notations, but they were great ones, so when I saw that they now had a full-length CD available, I didn't hesitate to order it. This one certainly met my expectations. This is sweet Chicago soul, very reminiscent of the music made by Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. In fact, the Notations cover a Mayfield song on this collection (""I've Been Trying"") and after meeting the famous man himself, they wrote another song (""Superpeople"") specifically for him. Disappointingly, ""Superpeople"" is not on this collection, but it apparently was ""rediscovered"" on the Northern Soul circuit in recent years and has helped to create a renewed awareness of this fine group.The Notations got their start after soul legend Syl Johnson signed them to the Twinight label that he was also recording for at the time (early 1970s), I first heard their song ""I Can't Stop"" on Numero Group's excellent 2-CD collection of Twinight songs ""Eccentric Soul: Twinight's Lunar Rotation."" The other tune I heard, ""I'm Still Here"" was on the Kent collection ""More Perfect Harmony: Sweet Soul Groups"". Both of those captivating songs are also on this collection, which also has been reissued by the Numero Group, another indication that you are getting some high quality music.One of the more distinctive aspects of the Notations was the vocals by singer Cliff Curry. When he hit certain notes there would be this cute little yelp, almost like someone had stepped on his foot! A bit unusual, but endearingly so. It turns out that his ""yelp"" had come from an attempt to challenge Syl Johnson's suggestion that he try something ""original"" when recording the song. Curry is quoted in the liner notes as saying he ""hated that for a long time"" but eventually came around to the realization that ""Sly knew what he was talking about"" and ended up liking it. And for good reason; this is a terrific tune.In addition to that song and the Mayfield cover, there are plenty of other tunes on this collection that offer ample evidence that the Notations were a supremely talented vocal group, one that could have gained wider national notice if only they had gotten the exposure and the breaks, Another song of interest is ""Young Girl,"" the last track on this CD. This was a Curry-penned song that had touches of Drifters-like doo-wop. If the recording sounds rough, there is a reason for that: it was recovered from a nearly-lost cassette tape. But even the lack of fidelity doesn't diminish the power of this great song.After some other label moves and a brief move to the big time with a single for Mercury, the Notations kept on keeping on, despite the lack of any major commercial breakthrough. A shame, because they certainly had the talent. Nevertheless, the band has persevered and from what the liner notes say, they are still performing today, even though original member LaSalle Matthews died in 2002.The CD comes with a 12-page booklet with a history of the group written by Ryan Boyle. Another very interesting, and soul satisfying reissue from the Numero Group. If you are a fan of 1970s soul vocal groups, don't miss this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV70Q7HNGTB4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXQ27JU#wasThisHelpful","RV70Q7HNGTB4F","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Admittedly, I'm VERY late in discovering this band, but oh what a joy they are to hear! I first heard their recent ""Shattered"" album earlier this year and was very impressed. Memorable songs with hooks, a passionate singer, and a tight band. Wanting to hear more by this talented and energetic band, I decided to get this 2002 release, Yow! Once again I'm smitten and knocked out. Now this is rock and roll!First impressions: they sound like Paul Westerberg and the Replacements teaming up with David Johansen (early solo albums, without the New York Dolls), and having Booker T. play the organ. In other words, crunchy, melodic rock with grit, grooves, soul and passion. I'm stumped that I never hard of this band until recently, but delighted and excited to have finally discovered Reigning Sound.My rock and roll has been satisfied, but I need to hear more by Reigning Sound: two albums down and more to go!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17C2GN3ZIQQ56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000068FPF#wasThisHelpful","R17C2GN3ZIQQ56","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic collection of female soul singers (along with a few duets with some fellows!) that were produced, mentored and nourished by James Brown. Most of the material spans the years 1960 to 1974, with one track from  1975 and another from 1977 tacked on for good measure. For certain, J.B. fans will find a lot to like on this 2-CD set, but by no means is the appeal limited to diehard James Brown fans. This is simply great soul music, ranging from early 1960s sweet soul ballads to early 1970s funk groovers.Most J.B. fans have heard some of these songs before, particularly the hit singles by Lyn  Collins and Marva Whitney. Both singers have a lot of material on these two discs, but another of the more impressive singers is Vicki Anderson. Some of her songs, such as ""The Message From the Soul Sisters (Parts 1 & 2)"" and ""You're Welcome, Stop on By"" (this is a Bobby Womack song, and this version is a duet with Bobby Byrd) are absolute gems. Another very cool Vicki Anderson cut is ""Don't Throw Your Love in the Garbage Can,"" Written by the legendary Clarence Reid (also known as Blowfly) and soul diva Betty Wright, this song was recorded at T.K. Studios in Miami and also features the underrated Little Beaver on guitar.Many of these tracks feature members of the JBs, ace musicians such as Bootsy Collins (and his brother Catfish), Fred Wesley, Bobby Byrd, Maceo Parker, and of course James Brown himself. A few other 1970s cuts include appearance by jazz legends such as the Brecker Brothers, Jon Faddis, Joe Farrell, and  Cornell Dupress. Needless to say, ALL of these tracks -- with the JBs or others --- sizzle and satisfy.The CD set also comes with a very informative 24-page booklet that includes a complete lineup of musicians on each track, songwriting credits, song times, and original recording date. A very well-done package of vintage soul and funk music, with a definite J.B. touch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJJ90C0KSDE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000067L7#wasThisHelpful","R2JJJ90C0KSDE1","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are an Elvis Costello fan, I'd venture to say that this endearingly oddball compilation of singles, covers, outtakes, and previously unreleased material is a must have for your collection. Released in 1987 by Demon Records, most of this material was recorded from the early to mid 1980s, a fertile musical period for Mr. Costello. As others have noted, while these songs didn't make the cut on any of his studio albums, they are still of high quality.The album leads off with ""Seven Day Weekend,"" a fun duet with Jimmy Cliff. It's a good tune, but there are better ones that follow. Another duet, ""The People's Limousine"" with T-Bone Burnett, is much more interesting, and the cover of Burt Bacharach's ""Baby It's You"" with Nick Lowe also sparkles. Three other cover tunes are also worth noting: a lively version of Smokey Robinson's ""Head to Toe"", a beautiful version of Richard Thompson's ""Withered and Died"", and a particularly creative take on Yoko Ono's ""Walking on Thin Ice"", perhaps the best cover of a Yoko Ono song I've ever heard (granted, there aren't that many out there!).Costello also re-invents himself with very interesting alternate versions of ""American Without Tears"" and a total revamping of ""Big Sister."" I could go on and on, listing yet more memorable songs on here, but hopefully you get the gist of this album. It's similar to ""Taking Liberties,"" the other 1980s collection of Costello B-sides and rarities, but it's a strong collection and highlights some true nuggets from this period of Costello's career, a time when he was clicking on all cylinders and could virtually do no wrong. Ah, I miss those days.

"My entire knowledge of Brewer & Shipley was having heard ""One Toke Over the Line"" on the radio back in the 1970s. Great tune, but I had no inkling that they had recording plenty of other albums, including this gem of an album a few years previous to their big hit. But after reading so many glowing reviews for this CD reissue, I was intrigued enough to order it from Amazon. Excellent decision; this album is wonderful!All of the rave reviews are certainly justified. This truly is a magical gem of an album, packed with melodic, echanting and radiant tunes, combining what could be called orchestral pop with some more folk-sounding arrangements. The result is simply beautiful. And the more I hear this album, the more I am also struck by the passion and power of the lyrics.Calling this album unheralded and underrated would be an understatement. This truly is a magnificent collection of songs. Thanks to the other reviewers who shared their love for this album.

"If you have any of the other excellent ""Nigeria Special"" compilations from Soundway, you know what to expect: plenty of lively and propulsive songs with plenty of rhythm happening. In the liner notes, the compilers pledge to bring us listeners ""some of the more obscure and unheard names and recordings from what was undoubtedly a time brimming with sonic treasures."" And rest assured there are plenty of such musical jewels waiting your discovery on this CD.The compilation starts with an early, fairly rare, version of ""Who're You"" by Fela Kuti from 1971, a song that he re-recorded for his Fela's ""London Scene"" album. Most of the reviewers on this page have dismissed this song somewhat, but I think it's an exciting, vibrant tune with some intense rhythms and wild organ playing. Among the other songs that impress me on this CD are the intense ""Mind Your Business"" by Saxon Lee & the Shadows International, the jazz-infused instrumental ""Gboymojo"" by Segun Bucknor's Revolution,  ""Hankuri"" by Madman Jaga, and the slightly psychedelic ""trance-like"" feel of ""Ariwo Yaa"" by Bob Ohiri & His Uhuru Sounds. Another one of my favorite Nigerian musicians, Orlando Julius, contributes ""Afro-Blues"", a percolating instrumental propelled by ""raw organ stabs and Orlando's sweet saxophone"". Interestingly. the last track on this collection, the pleasing ""Ole"" is by the Black Santiagos, a band from Benin, but included here because the record was pressed and released in Nigeria.As you would expect from Soundway, the CD comes with a 20-page booklet that includes a short essay about this period of Nigerian music, written by album compiler Miles Cleret, and capsule summaries of each track. The songs span the years 1971-78.

"As usual, the musical archeologists at the Numero Group have unearthed another treasure chest of obscure soul treats, this time from the San Antonio, Texas-based Dynamic label. The music on this collection is culled from the years 1965-1968 when the Dynamic label, headed by local businessman and music fan Abe Epstein, was putting out records galore, and good ones they were!The first track on this collection, ""Hey It's Love"" by the Commands is enough to turn your head around right off the bat; a ""commanding"" song indeed! The lead singer, from what I can gather by the liner notes, was Dan Henderson, accurately described as having a ""mesmerizing alto."" I'm scratching my head, trying to think of who his voice reminds me of, but it's a distinctive, tuneful one that draws every ounce of emotion out of the song. A pure soul treat. The Commands were one of the groups that could have/should have been a much bigger name, if only they had received the right breaks and a bit of luck. They have a total of 6 songs on this CD, including another fantastic tune, ""No Time For You,"" which was later covered by the O'Jays. The members of the Commands were also in the Air Force and most of their ""tours"" during that time were appearances at other Air Force bases! After losing some of their original members, Henderson kept the Commands going. A new record was scheduled with RCA, only to have that deal apart. The liner notes tell us that ""following a horrific 1969 break-in at Henderson's home, the singer left San Antonio and was never heard from again. A true loss for soul music. This guy had an amazing voice!The second track on the album, ""Give Your Love To Me"" by Little Jr. Jesse & the Teardrops, is another incredibly catchy tune, but more pop than soul, sporting some quasi-surf guitar licks. Another group that caught my ear was the Webs. Briefly signed to Atlantic, they have 3 songs on this CD, including the wonderful ""Don't Ever Hurt Me"". Another armed forces-related group on the label was Doc & Sal, two singers stationed in the Navy. They have 4 songs on this collection, including the lovely ""Laughing to Keep From Crying.""The liner notes estimate that Abe Epstein (who passed away in 2012) recorded close to a thousand tracks for the Dynamic label, along with two earlier record companies. The cream of that crop is planned for an additional release on Numero. Meanwhile, soul fans can enjoy these melodic and memorable soul treats. The CD comes with a 24-page booklet with exhaustive details about the label and these artists.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSO0P5T8NKED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2FMG7C#wasThisHelpful","RLSO0P5T8NKED","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm no expert on the subject of Amelia Earhart, nor have I read any of the many books written about her, save for an old copy of Fred Goerner's ""The Search for Amelia Earhart"" that I read when I was in high school back in the mid 1970s. I've always been interested in the ""mystery"" of what happened to Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan during their attempted flight around the world in 1937, so I looked forward to reading this author's account of ""Finding Amelia"".At first, I was a bit skeptical of how good this book would be.The cover art looked cheaply done and I wasn't familiar with the publisher. Would this be a legitimate investigative book or some sensational mumbo-jumbo? Well, to put it briefly, it WAS a worthwhile read, both well-written and well-researched. In fact, it's so full of facts and figures and details, that I think most casual readers with no deep interest in the subject might have a hard time wading through these detailed chapters. So many dates and time zones and degree lines and positions and people; this plethora of names and numbers will spin your head around. For me, it was all hard to keep track of and understandable at times.Nevertheless, the author does a good job of keeping the story flowing, describing both the events leading up to that final flight, the communications ---or lack of --- between Earhart and those on the ground, and the frantic search for her and Noonan afterwards. The author also offers plenty of interesting and enlightening facts about Earhart and her skills --- or again, the lack of them --- that help to dispel the idea that she was an ace pilot.The biggest disappointment for me was the lack of any satisfying ending or conclusion. Of course, due to the fact that we still don't know what happened to Earhart or her plane, even after all these years, that's a difficult task. But on the back cover it tells us that the author is ""an internationally recognized authority on the Earhart disappearance and has led 8 archaeological search expeditions to the Pacific,"" so with that in mind, I would expect some sort of ""expert"" analysis or educated guesses as to what he think happened. But we never get that in this book. Instead, the author gives us a 1-page epilogue in the form of a short telegram sent in 1940. This is supposed to shed some light on the mystery? Sorry, but I feel cheated.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q4E4KMY4O1PM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591143187#wasThisHelpful","R1Q4E4KMY4O1PM","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always on the lookout for obscure soul and funk albums from the 1960s and 1970s and this one caught my eye while surfing on Amazon late one night recently. The reviews were mostly positive and the fact that the always reliable Eddie Landsberg recommended this CD made the purchase a no-brainer for me. I'm delighted to say that the music more than met my expectations; this is hot stuff indeed!The Counts were a band from Detroit and previously known as the Fabulous Counts in the late 1960s. In those early days they had a minor hit with their instrumental ""Jan Jan"". That song is not on this album (there is a separate CD for The Fabulous Counts), but the songs that are on ""What's Up Front That Counts"", originally released in 1971, are mighty tasty in their own right. Both the instrumentals and vocal cuts exude a vibrant funky soul vibe. At times they sound to me like a cross between early Tower of Power and early-1970s Temptations, gritty and powerful, horns blasting and guitars wah-wah-ing away. Other tracks sound vaguely like The Meters or even the underrated Rasputin's Stash (another must-buy band, also recommended by Eddie).This is a relatively short album, with only 34 minutes of music, but pleasing minutes they are! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was due to the drab CD packaging. This CD was reissued by Westbound in 2005, but they offer you nothing in the way of a booklet or any liner notes. The inside insert lists songwriting credits, and song times are listed on the back cover, but there isn't a list of the band members nor any information about these recordings. A real shame, because this was obviously a talented band with some cool tunes, and I would have liked more background information on them (I only learned about their previous incarnation as the Fabulous Counts from other sources). Those complaints aside, this is a very good album that fans of 1970s funky soul will surely appreciate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9TM0DHB9F26S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004ST26#wasThisHelpful","R9TM0DHB9F26S","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Orleans was a band that had a few hit singles --- ""Still The One"" being the one that most everyone has heard --- during their relatively brief recording career, but they deserve much more recognition and respect from critics than they've received. I think that this single disc compilation from Rhino of their ""best"" tunes is the best one that's available.Orleans tends to get pigeonholed as a ""soft rock"" or ""pop"" group, but they showed a musical versatility that belied such simple generalizations. I like this paragraph in the liner notes that sums up their sound: ""Good-time party band of serious-minded songwriting vehicle? Purveyors of uplifting love songs or messengers of politically-charged rock broadsides? R&B/reggae groove-meisters or harmonizing folkies? All of the above could be applied to Orleans.""Indeed, this band really WAS able to play with chameleon-like dexterity, blending sounds and shifting musical focus when they wanted. Perhaps those traits didn't endear them to critics, but as you can say from the many reviews on this page, the fans loved their music. One of their earliest songs, ""Half Moon"" was also recorded by Janis Joplin, and later by Chaka Khan and Rufus. That song showed the funkier side of the band, but as the liner notes indicated, they could play some tenderly beautiful ballads, uptempo rockers, or even songs with a reggae rhythm. Lead singer John Hall wrote many of these songs with his wife Johanna, some of which touched on environmental issues. You could say that Hall was one of the first artists to express concern about climate change in a song, using ""Cold Spell"" as an example.This CD comes with a 16-page booklet with a history of the band and comments from some of the band members, who later regrouped and recorded new songs in the late 1980s and early 1990s (none of which are included on this collection).One side note: Reading the reviews for this CD, many people have compared the music of Orleans to that of other 1970s bands such as Firefall, Ambrosia, Player, and even Poco. One fan went so far as to rate Orleans behind Ambrosia, but ahead of Poco and Firefall. I'd put it the other way around. As much as I like Orleans, I don't think they are/were quite in the same league as a pioneering band like Poco. But I certainly would rank Orleans ahead of the other bunch of ""soft rock"" 1970s acts. They really did have many good songs, with hooks, harmonies, and lyrical substance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPO79UW9KDN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003439#wasThisHelpful","R2UPO79UW9KDN4","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several other so-called ""Hillbilly"" compilations and enjoy them thoroughly. There is something that is so pure and fun about this style of country music. This 2-CD set is no exception; it's packed with fun and funny hillbilly tunes, or ""good old-fashioned mountain music"" as the liner notes call it.If you're like me and already have similar collections of hillbilly music, you may have heard a few of these songs already, perhaps the tracks by Merle Travis, Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Spade Cooley, and Red Foley. But there are a whole bunch of songs that I had NOT heard before, thus making this set a very satisfying purchase. And the fact that Amazon is selling is so cheap is an added bonus.These songs swing and sway with unbridled energy, plus the lyrical content (providing that's it's not one of the fantastic instrumentals) can be a bit risque, if not just darn funny. Honestly, these songs will make you smile big time! CD 1 clocks in at 65 minutes, while CD 2 offers 63 minutes. The oldest song on here is from 1936 and the most recent is from 1960, but the vast majority of the tracks are from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s.The CD comes with a thin 4-page insert that has brief liner notes about some of the artists represented, but is by no means comprehensive. At the bottom of one page is a listing (in very tiny print) of the release dates for each track, along with songwriter credits. Not a fantastic package in that respect, but the lively and vivacious songs more than make up for the lack of information about the artists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54T9A6AB77W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00555IB7O#wasThisHelpful","R54T9A6AB77W4","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All in all, I found this compilation to be very satisfying, another fascinating addition to the Backbeats series that has exposed me to some new sounds. The front cover hypes this is ""Soulful Jazz Licks From the 70s"", and that's true for the most part, but to be a stickler for details, there ARE three tracks from 1980 included here also.Most of these tracks are extended instrumentals, the highlights including Reuben Wilson's steaming cover of the War classic ""The Cisco Kid"", Funk Inc. (billed as Funk Incorporated on this CD) offering a wicked version of Curtis Mayfield's ""Give Me Your Love"", Jimmy McGriff's ""Red Beans"", and the Gamble & Huff Orchestra's take on ""Is It Something I Said,"" which as you would expect is is a Gamble & Huff song. Two other cover versions are also memorable: ""Lionel Hampton's take on the Buddy Miles classic ""Them Changes"" and someone named Hysear Down Walker with an enchanting version of ""Killing Me Softly."" Of the handful of tracks with vocals, my favorite is Lou Rawls singing ""Trade Winds."" Anything that man sings is gold and this song is no exception.The tracks on this collection are licensed from four labels: Philadelphia International, Brunswick, Groove Merchant, and Fantasy. It's a nice batch of tunes that flows very well, and with nearly 76 minutes of music you get your money's worth. That said, I certainly agree with some of the criticisms of this package by reviewer ziontrain. Yes, like other volumes in this Backbeats series, they waste too much page space giving you a needless rundown on status of the series and a fairly generic overview of the jazz and R&B scene of this period. Like ziontrain, I would have been very interested in reading more about these tracks and some of the lesser known artists on this collection, such as Hysear Don Walker and Mike Longo. Then again, Backbeats is a budget reissue label so I don't expect exhaustive liner notes like I'd get with a compilation from Kent or Ace Records.The meager liner notes aside, the music on this collection is actually quite good, and I daresay there will be a few pleasant discoveries awaiting anyone who enjoys the late 1970s and early 1980s period of soul-jazz fusion. Good grooves galore await you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6IURUMLEPHPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XGMOCA#wasThisHelpful","R6IURUMLEPHPW","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard a track from Tame Impala's previous album, ""Lonerism"" but wasn't overly impressed so I never bought the whole CD. But after reading some reviews of this new one, I decided to take a chance, especially after seeing it in stock at a local CD shop. The verdict: I'm favorably blown away by this album. It's definitely one of my Top 10 favorite albums this year.Not having heard the band's previous albums, I can't offer any comparisons or make a guess as to how they/he have progressed or matured as a songwriter or performer. All I can tell you is that these songs abound with hooks and good grooves and lovely harmonies. These songs float and soar and lift the spirits. Some definite synth-pop magic at work on this album. I'll throw a curveball in the way of comparison and say that some of these songs remind me of New Musik's wonderful ""Straight Lines"" album from the early 1980s, albeit with a more modern production touch.This album was definitely not what I expected, and perhaps that helps to make me love it even more. Shimmering would be my one word to describe these songs. I'm so impressed by this album that I'm going to go back and give ""Lonerism"" a try too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTB3TOM9M9SV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO1YR7K#wasThisHelpful","RTB3TOM9M9SV4","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm delighted that I stumbled upon the listing for this CD --- an album I had never heard of by a band I had never heard of before! --- but more importantly I'm delighted by the excellent music. As others have described it, this is classic roots-rock reggae spiced by sparkling harmonies and a rock-solid cast of musicians. The liner notes call this album ""a definitive high point in Jamaican close harmony singing"" and that's very true.  Most of the lead vocals are by Roy Cousins and Errol Wilson, but reading the credits reveals that a grand total of 8 men sing the lead on these songs, in addition the MANY who are singing harmony. Let's just say: these guys could sing!This album was first released in 1977 on the small Wambesi label, so perhaps that explains why many reggae fans outside of Jamaica have never heard this group's music. But that lack of attention does not mean that this is a minor, insignicant recording. Far from it; this is first-rate stuff indeed. These songs are full of those lilting, uplifting reggae rhythms. and songs with sweet singing and lyrical depth. The cast of supporting musicians includes reggae royalty such as Aston 'Family Man' Barrett, Robbie Shakespeare, Ernest Ranglin, Earl 'Chinna' Smith, Ansel Collins, Tommy McCook, and others, plus harmony vocals from members of the Meditations and the Heptones.The first paragraph of the liner notes succinctly sums up this band: ""The Royals seem to have remained as the last great unsung Jamaican vocal group from reggae's 'Golden Age' in the '60s and '70s, and their work is still relatively unknown outside of a small coterie of serious reggae students despite their having made some of the most sublime and enduring music of the genre.""This CD includes an 8-page booklet with an essay about the band and these recordings written by Harry Hawke. This CD is a welcome discovery for anyone who loves the classic sound of 1970s reggae.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3GC0GZIWGYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000682WX#wasThisHelpful","R1T3GC0GZIWGYS","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed many of G.M. Ford's books, both the Frank Corso series and the Leo Waterman series. Ford is both a talented writer and a deft storyteller. This novel, however, was the weakest one that I've read by him. I may be a bit too harsh in giving it only 2 stars, but the story had so many flaws and lack of focus that I almost didn't even finish reading it.One of the main problems with the novel is that the protagonist, Frank Corso, plays a relatively minor role in the story. Instead, we are forced to follow the violent actions of two prisoners, a female TV news reporter who is battling marital turbulence, and a dysfunctional company trying to operate the correctional facility. It wasn't until the final 100 or so pages that I finally find myself becoming interested in what was happening. There are a few saving graces to this book. Ford demonstrates his writing talent with several poignant and powerful passages, and I liked the way he highlights the for-profit-blight that is the state of the US prison system. I'm not that squeamish when it comes to reading about violence, but also thought that parts of this book were too over-the-top in describing the ways that various characters were killed. I really don't think it added to the suspense factor or made things any more realistic, just disturbing.If you haven't read any of the books in the Frank Corso series, I would NOT recommend that you start with this one. A very disappointing entry in what is normally a well-done series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13MM6O3B6VE3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060554843#wasThisHelpful","R13MM6O3B6VE3J","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harvey Mandel is one of those names that I knew, mainly as for his guitar-for-hire appearances on other artists' albums, but I had never actually heard anything he had recorded before I ordered this CD. I wasn't sure if this was the best one to get. A couple of his studio albums have received rave reviews, but in the end, I wanted to hear some sort of retrospective, a ""Best Of"" as this CD is titled, so this was the one I picked. All I can say is: WOW! These are masterful instrumentals! Mandel is indeed an amazing guitarist, one with flash and style, but also one that uses those talents to create some very listenable and engaging songs.I would concur with Steven's recommendation that fans of Joe Satriani and Eric Johnson might like this album. Mandel is most definitely someone that fans of hot-shot guitar players will appreciate. But he's not a one-trick pony, either in the way he plays the instrument or the type of music that he records. As other reviews have noted, he fuses blues with rock and jazz, plus adds some funky and soulful touches too. You can hear clear jazz-rock fusion on some cuts, uptempo blues on others, and some get-down boogie at other times. This guy has the flair and the touch and the just the right feel to make it all work.While the music is superb, the packaging of the CD is somewhat of a letdown. The liner notes offer a brief history of Mandel's recording career, with a few quotes from his old keyboard partner Barry Goldberg, but no comments from Mandel himself. The booklet that comes with the CD (just a thin 4-page insert) does not have any songwriting credits, no recording dates, no song times, no list of which albums the tracks originally were on, and no lineup of the musicians who play with Mandel on these songs. Very disappointing not to have more details about these recordings. My copy of this CD was put out by Fuel in 2011.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJ44OFXERY89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWL0SO#wasThisHelpful","R2NJ44OFXERY89","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon's main product review says that anyone wanting to hear Kottke's music for the first time should start with his acclaimed ""Six and Twelve String Guitar"" album. Well ... I'm not so sure about that. As fantastic as that album is --- and it DOES rank as a classic --- I think this 2-CD retrospective of his work on the Takoma, Capitol, and Chyrsalis labels offers a fuller and better balanced overview of his music, showcasing not only his dazzling instrumental guitar virtuosity but Kottke's ""other"" side too, that being his songs with vocals. Kottke is obviously a great guitarist, but also a great singer and songwriter.As other reviewers have noted, Kottke has frequently been compared to John Fahey for his impressive guitar skills, but like someone else noted, I think Kottle's work is more listenable and entertaining. Yes, he dazzles on the strings, but he also is astute enough to know when to slow down and caress a song, offering sweet, lovely tunes, and at other times charming and quirky ones. And if you've ever had the pleasure of seeing this man in concert, you will also know that he is a charming and funny fellow too, the consummate entertainer.So yeah, if you are looking for a place to start your Kottke collection, this 2-CD is an excellent place to begin. It cuts off in the early 1980s, before he started recording for the Private Music label, so you miss some of songs from that period (and there are plenty of good ones on those albums too!), but for a satisfying sampling of his earlier years, some would say his prime time, this collection is wonderful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFAAVGWNR3NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000033X4#wasThisHelpful","RZFAAVGWNR3NT","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seemingly an odd idea for an album --- covers of ""English Rebel Songs"" dating back to 1381 --- works smashingly in the hands, and vocal chords of Chumbawamba. Protest songs were never so beautifully sung!If you are already a Chumbawamba fan, you will definitely want to hear this one, but be forewarned; it doesn't sound like anything else the group has ever done. Not only due to the theme of the songs --- although this band has certainly never shied away from political or social issues in the past --- but because it's mostly an acapella album and lacks the ""normal"" instrumentation that the band uses. A bare bones approach, but one that actually fits with the tone of these folk songs of struggle and rebellion.This collection of songs was originally recorded by the band in 1988. To quote the liner notes, the members of the band ""were determined to stir up a rout in our tiny anarcho-punk community by swapping guitars and drums for acapella singing .... fifteen years later, we felt we'd learned enough about our voices to try again, updating and rearranging the songs against the backdrop of US/British warmongering. The songs were discovered in songbooks and in folk clubs and on cassette tapes, chopped and changed and bludgeoned into shape with utmost respect for the original tunes.""That respect and sincerity comes shining through in these brilliantly performed songs. And the voices; oh, those voices. Mesmerizing and lovely only begins to tell the tale as the harmonies soar and float. Listen and learn and appreciate what this band has done. This truly represents a milestone in their recording career. Maybe not their most catchy batch of tunes, and it's relatively short at 31 minutes, but this ranks as one of their most important albums.If you are not a Chumbawamba fan, this would probably not be the best able with which to start in journey in discovery one of music's most versatile --- and vital --- bands. Then again, this collection of songs is so thought-provoking and passionate, that the more people that hear it the better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B1M0E0BS23XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012X6FC6#wasThisHelpful","R2B1M0E0BS23XH","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew the name Luther Allison, but until recently had never heard anything by this legendary guitarist. A friend let me borrow his copy of this CD recently, but it took a while to finally get around to playing it. Looking at the track listing, my first thoughts were: ugh ... another guy playing boring old blues standards. Not sure if this is something I'm going to like very much.Well, after the first time through this CD, I liked it very much indeed. In fact, I was riveted. Not only was Allison obviously a gifted guitar slinger, I really liked his interpretations and new takes on these tried and tested --- and often tired --- old blues tunes. Yeah, we've heard some of these songs many times already by dozens of other acts, but Allison puts a fresh, imaginative spin on these dusty old tunes. Plus, the originals of his on this album also sparkle. I especially love the two extended jams; the 7:26 title cut and the sprawling 10:44 opus, ""It's Been a Long Time."" Whew, this guy is beyond impressive. But as hot as Allison's guitar playing is, he's backed by a very tight band. I especially like the piano playing of Paul White. Never heard of this guy before, but he can pound those keys!Since playing this one to death, I've bugged my friend to lend me more of Luther Allison albums, and it that doesn't work, well, there is always the Amazon site to place yet another order. Right now they are selling this CD for an insanely low price, so if you're sitting on the fence and love electric blues guitar, don't delay on getting this one. It's a total gem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZD1ZE5HAJQ8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B7GR#wasThisHelpful","R2ZD1ZE5HAJQ8K","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the (many) 5-star reviews for this novel used the word ""riveting"" to describe the story, and that's the exact word I was going to use, expect in a negative sense: this one was far from riveting! And that's disappointing because I have always found the other books in this series by Silva to be very engrossing, entertaining, and yes, riveting. Not so this time around.Silva definitely has his formula down pat and anyone who has read other books in this series pretty much knows what to expect. That's comforting on one level, but it's also a bit predictable and wearisome. The same characters are doing the same things and saying the same things, and we're reading the same stuff, with slight variations, over and over again.That's not so say that this book is a disaster. Silva is far too good a writer --- but perhaps more accurately, a very good storyteller --- to write a book that is going to put you to sleep. But for the first time ever reading one of these Gabriel Allon tales, I have to say that there were a few lackluster chapters and a general lack of tension and suspense.Like other reviewers, I will no doubt want to read the next book in the series, but I'm hoping that Silva will make an effort to break out of his predictable formula and give us a few surprises. At this point, this series needs a tune-up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OV05AYU9Y8YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062320130#wasThisHelpful","R1OV05AYU9Y8YA","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perhaps you need not to have been a devotee of the author's famous Creation Records label to appreciate this books, but I think it's safe to say that your enjoyment of this tome would benefit from having heard and enjoyed some of the bands that Alan McGee signed and managed, acts such as Primal Scream, Oasis, My Bloody Valentine, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Libertines.Creation Records was indeed an influential and exciting label and in addition to some of the well-known acts, the label released great records by terrific lesser-known bands too, including Biff Bang Pow, a band that McGee himself was a member of. This book is more than a tell-all tale of the bands that McGee signed or hung out with, but it also delves into his own turbulent journey in life, one that was dominated for many years by excessive drug use. McGee pulls no punches when it comes to those decadent days, but I found the endless drug-fueled tales a bit tedious after a few chapters. Okay, you were a mess; we get it. Much more interesting to me was reading about dealing with, and recording with, bands such as House of Love, Ride, and the prolific, underrated genius Ed Ball.While some passages of the book are entertaining, informative, or just plain funny, other parts meander and drift, or are just confusingly presented. McGee is a colorful character with plenty of wild tales to tell, but he's not much of a writer and the book suffers from weak prose, lack of continuity, and his use of too much Scottish slang. There were times I would stop in the middle of a paragraph, wondering what --- or who --- he was rambling on about. Where were the editors? On one hand, you could call McGee's writing style refreshing and true to his maverick spirit, but on the other hand reading such gibberish can be maddening for the reader.All in all, though, this was a fun read, and a book that will be of interest to anyone who was immersed in the ""indie"" music scene of the 1980s and 1990s.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMIUBRX5D2UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1447225910#wasThisHelpful","RJMIUBRX5D2UF","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is one of those instantly likable albums, so good that you want to tell all your kindred musical pals. This guy is the real deal!Seeing as how this is my introduction to Malin and his music, I obviously can't compare this new effort to his past albums. I've read through the older reviews and seen him compared to everyone from Springsteen to Dylan, but I don't hear those two artists much in these songs. Okay, maybe there's an ever-so-slight Springsteen touch in the songwriting, but if I were forced to compare him to anyone I'd offer up a mix of Paul Westerberg, Ryan Adams, and a quality throwback such as Garland Jeffreys. In other words; this guy can write some excellent songs, ones with both acute hooks and meaningful lyrics.The CD version of this album comes with a 16-page booklet that includes lyrics to all of the songs and a full lineup of all the musicians who play on each track.

"Now here is a ""Soul Shop"" that is worth paying a visit. The photo on the cover did indeed come from a real shop that was run by Bill Curtis of the Fatback Band, offering the ""Best Bands for Hire"" in various musical styles. And that's the beauty of this compilation of Curtis and Fatback-related music; there is a pleasing diversity of soul music styles to be found.The songs on here were recorded from 1967 to 1971 and aren't nearly as funky as the stuff that Fatback would do later in the '70s. That said, the 3 tracks featuring Johnny King and the Fatback Band are pretty funky in their own right, sounding like a cross between Sly & the Family Stone and Eddie Kendricks. The second track on here is a wicked instrumental titled ""The Cat Walk"" by Gerry & Paul and the Soul Emissaries. It's hailed in the liner notes as ""a classic dance record"" of the Northern Soul scene. I can hear why. Very infectious tune.And there are plenty of more gems on here, including the 4 sultry soul tunes by Mary Davis, and 4 tracks by The Four Puzzles (sometimes simply called The Puzzles). Those Puzzle tracks were written by members of the Diplomats, or just by that band's main member, Samuel Culley. The Diplomats don't have any songs on this CD, but they DO have a very good career retrospective released by Kent/Ace, and of further interest is the other band they formed, Skull Snaps. Essential soul music, as is this collection.This CD comes with an 8-page booklet with an essay about Bill Curtis and his soul shop and these unfairly neglected recording artists, written by noted soul authority Ady Croasdell. . If you are a fan of late '60s and early 70s soul music, by all means check this one out.

"I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews for this excellent album, the debut by Songhoy Blues. Confusingly, Amazon has separate listings for the import and domestic versions of this album, both of which have identical track listings. In any case, this is a very impressive album by a band that was ""born of violence and displacement,"" having to flee their native Mali due to the conflict with Islamist extremists. The final straw for guitarist Garba Toure was when he was threatened with a few lashes and a smashed instrument if local rebels saw him carrying his guitar around town again. Time to hit the road!Together with two other guys also with the last name of Toure (none of them related) and a drummer, they formed Songhoy Blues. Although these guys come from the Songhoy tribe in Mali, their music reminds me a lot of that Tinariwen, who hail from a Touareg tribe in the same country. Both groups weave atmospheric strands of blues together with western sounds to create fascinating music. Songhoy Blues have more rock influences in their songs --- or at least the liner notes tell us they listened to many western bands growing up --- and yet the music sounds closer in spirit to what legends like Ali Farke Toure or even Amadou and Mariam have recorded. The liner notes call the music of Songhoy Blues ""a modern amplified spirit, built on traditions centuries old."" Indeed, there is a certain ""timeless"" quality to this mesmerizing pieces, songs with layers and vibrant rhythms that lodge in your consciousness with each repeated listen.This CD comes with an 8-page booklet that has an essay about the band written by Andy Morgan. In addition to the four regular band members there are several other guest musicians on this album, including Damon Albarn from Blur who sings on one track.

"This is another marvelous vintage soul treat, rediscovered and reissued by the Numero Group label. If you've heard the ""Eccentric Soul: The Capsoul Label"" compilation from Numero, then you HAVE heard this talented group; they had 3 songs on that collection.The Four Mints did indeed record for the Capsoul label, but only released five singles in their recording career. The label deemed that enough material for a full album, thus they put out ""Gently Down Your Stream"" in 1973, the band's --- and the label's --- one and only LP! For this CD reissue, those diligent crate-diggers at Numero found ""one brilliant song saved from the cutting room floor"" along with some rehearsal versions of two songs from the album, taken from the archives of one of Capsoul's main songwriters. It's not a long album in terms of minutes, but the quality of the material is strong.If you are a fan of 1960s and 1970s soul music and haven't heard the Four Mints before, you are in for a real treat.  This Columbus, Ohio group had a sweet soul sound that reminds me of classic soul acts such as The Impressions and the Miracles, with a bit of Chi-Lites in the mix too. In other words; these guys could sing!The CD comes with an 8-page booklet that includes a short history of the group and a lineup of the members and musicians who played on these songs.

"This is an amazing live album that unfortunately, due to almost non-existent distribution, has never been heard by those who would most it appreciate it, especially the diehard Dwight Twilley fans out there. If you can find a secondhand copy online from Amazon or any other dealers, snag it; this one is terrific!The one reviewer who hailed this album as one of the best of the 1970s is not exaggerating or smoking something funny; this really IS a masterpiece of a show, capturing a talented young band in all its sweat and glory in a special moment in time. One thing that struck me listening to this CD was how much FUN the band is having. Instead of going through the motions as some band do, Twilley, Seymour and band sound like they are playing for the sheer thrill of it. Not just posturing, but living it; playing rock and roll with passion and flair.And obviously the audience at the Agora is loving the show too and feeding off the band's energy, which in turn then doubles back and pumps up the band yet even more. Really, this show overflows with energy, and the sound quality of the radio broadcast is surprisingly good too; clear and punchy.I understand the reaction by the reviewer who complained about the CD version of this recording being not much more than a CD-R. I also detest buying a CD online and later discovering that it's only a cheap CD-R. For certain, the lack of credits and liner notes is a big disappointment --- this great band and this great performance deserve better treatment --- but the Agora show is so intense and so magical that I can almost forgive the packaging slight. The bottom line is the music, and this delivers big time.The CD contains 45 minutes of music. Here is the full track listing:1. Shakin‚Äô In the Brown Grass2. Just Like the Sun3. Chance to Get Away4.

"I remember seeing this album in the record bins a few decades ago, but I until I recently bought this CD reissue I'd never heard it before. And that should rank as a BIG act of neglect, seeing as how I was a big fan of Pure Prairie League, and Craig Fuller was the lead singer on that band's first two albums. In any case, I'm very happy to have finally heard this little gem of an album. Maybe it's not quite a 5-star effort, but it's a consistently pleasing one. No duds to be found whatsoever.After leaving Pure Prairie League, Fuller joined forces with Eric Kaz and some other veteran musicians to form sort of a B-League supergroup called American Flyer. They made two albums (which are currently out of print; maybe Real Gone Music can reissue those also!) with that band and then recorded this one as a duo. As soon as the first song, ""Feel That Way Again"" comes wafting through the speakers, the delight begins, hearing that distinctive and comforting voice of Craig Fuller once again. That opening track is only one of many fine moments on this album, radiant songs such as ""Cry Like a Rainstorm"" (many of you may have heard Linda Ronstadt cover this song), ""Til You Come Back"" and ""Annabella"".It's still mystifying why this fine album didn't make more of a splash when it was first released in 1978 on the Columbia label. One theory, according to Fuller, was that the label was totally enamored with another record that came out at the same time --- the first Toto album --- and gave most of their attention to that one, virtually ignoring the Fuller/Kaz album. All these years later, however, I dare say that this group of songs has held up MUCH better than those on that Toto album. If you enjoyed Craig Fuller's recordings with Pure Prairie League, or even more recent efforts with the revamped Little Feat, check out this album too. Some mighty fine songs on here!This CD reissue comes with a 12-page booklet, reproducing the original back cover of the album (that has a list --- in fine print --- of the many musicians who play on this album), plus new liner notes by Ed Osborne. Oddly, no song times are listed, but they do furnish songwriting credits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KP1LYYXOUHKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLXIGXK#wasThisHelpful","R1KP1LYYXOUHKM","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I write this, I'm shocked to see that there are no other reviews for this excellent compilation. C'mon, folks, did these rhythms! This is another exhilarating collection, an unearthing of buried musical African treasures from the crate-digging folks at Soundway Records. If you enjoyed any of the ""Nigeria 70"" collections, or Afro-Beat in general, this is another fine CD to add to your collection.Billed as ""Psychedelic Afro-Rock & Fuzz Funk in 1970s Nigeria,"" this collection delivers as billed. As the liner notes explain, ""At the beginning of the 1970s the rise of afro-centric consciousness started making bands fuse African elements into what had been throughout the 60s mere imitations of western groups."" Of course Fela Kuti was making musical waves around this same time, but there were plenty of other lesser-known bands in Nigeria making equally inspired, albeit ""weird sounding"" music too, thus this compilation.The last song on here, ""Chant to Mother Earth"" by BLO, is perhaps the strangest and yet most enchanting of all the tracks. It sounds almost like a fusion of Santana and Jimi Hendrix mixed with Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac. Haunting, atmospheric, and very powerful. The rest of the tracks are also very good, combining those promised funk and rock strains, some with a pleasing slinky groove. A few of the cuts also sound to me like they were inspired by those class soul-jazz records that the Blue Note label was putting out in the early 1970s; an intoxicating mix of horns, guitar, drums, and very funky organ playing. Hot and hotter! My favorites among the lesser-known acts include the tracks by The Elcados, Mono Mono, the Funkees (who also have a great CD of their own that's been reissued), and Joe King Kologbo & His Black Sound.The CD comes with a 24 page booklet that includes sleeve notes by album compiler Miles Claret, plus capsule summaries of each track. This is one of 3 CDs in the ""Nigeria Rock Special"" series and they are all highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IIGEOYKS3H1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016A8E6K#wasThisHelpful","R2IIGEOYKS3H1S","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The blurb on the cover, saying: ""Were Armistead Maupin to write Tales of the City and set it in Boston, he would have penned The Men From the Boys"", caught my eye and motivated me to buy this book at a secondhand shop recently. It took me a while to get through it; one of those books that you start, put down, pick up again, repeat, until finally something clicks and you feel compelled to finish the damn thing! But in the end, I finished it and liked it quite a bit.Okay, perhaps this isn't a gay classic, and it's certainly not in the same league as the ""Tales of the City"" novels, but I found this to be a very well written and thought-provoking novel. As far as comparing it to Maupin's books, it wasn't nearly as funny or charming, and the characters not as remotely endearing. In fact, I found it hard to generate much love for any of the characters in this novel, although by the end of the final chapter I thing I finally came around to getting a better feel for them and at least empathizing with their tangled relationships and mindsets.The highest praise that I can give this novel is that the story felt very real. Yes, the plot --- if you want to call it that --- was thin, but in many ways it simply reflected the real way that gay men lived their lives. While I may not have liked all of the characters or the way they sometimes treated one another, much of it was painfully close to the truth in regards to gay life, especially as it was in the 1990s when this book was written and published. Because of that timeline, one might complain that the novel is ""dated,"" but I actually enjoyed going back to that time, in all its glory and horror.Another way to gauge whether or not I liked this book was the final question: would I read another novel by this author? And the answer is a definitive yes. Mann impressed me as a very talented writer and I'd like to read other books, novels or not, that he has written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37M27RK9JSFDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452278562#wasThisHelpful","R37M27RK9JSFDA","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the ""Simply Great"" review says, this is indeed a magnificent compilation of Nigerian ""Afro-Beat"" music from the 1970s, sure to please anyone that has enjoyed the ""Nigeria 70"" collections, or most anything from this era, including the main practitioner of the sound, Fela Kuti.""Afro Baby"" might sound like an odd, if not questionable title for a compilation like this, but as the liner notes explain, the term ""Afro Baby"" was a nickname in Nigeria for those people that represented the trends and lifestyles of the time. ""Afro"", we are told, was more than just a sound of the time, but a state of mind that became associated with rebellion. In an essay by Benson Idonije that's included in the liner notes, he explains that ""Afro Baby"" also referred to people who were found to be smart or crafty in their dealings with other people, and it's in that context that the term is used in the song that's the title track to this CD, played by Stephen Olisa (misspelled as ""Osita"" on the back cover) Amaechi & His Afro-Rhythm Skies. This song, says the liner notes, is a perfect example of how musicians traced the highlife sounds of the 1960s to the Afro-Beat grooves of the 1970s.In addition to that track, and songs by familiar names from the era such as Fela, Orlando Julius, and Tunji Oyelana, there are some dynamite numbers by Bola Johnson, the Mebusas, Thony Shorby Nwenyi, and more. These songs invariably catch your attention and kick you upside the head --- and the booty --- thanks to a poly-rhythmic stew of guitars, horns, percussion, and some funky organ playing. Whew, this is hot stuff!This CD comes with a 16-page booklet that includes essays about this music by album compiler Miles Cleret and ""A Nigerian Perspective"" by Benson Idoniji, as well as capsule summaries of each track. An outstanding collection of 1970s Nigerian music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V6Y6YEVPMYXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00020JQOO#wasThisHelpful","R2V6Y6YEVPMYXG","A3U3PA6J2XOVFK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3PA6J2XOVFK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My boyfriend tested this:  it's not an improvement over less expensive models.What's Bad:1.)  It causes irritation. He doesn't have particularly sensitive skin, and he owns two other Phillips Norelco shavers, specifically Arcitecs--and he says they don't hurt.2.)  The charger base is huge. It's about five inches wide, six inches deep including the power cable, and ten inches tall. You'll need a large bathroom counter or shelf to accommodate this.3.)  The included trimmer is a separate unit that has to be swapped with the shaver heads and stored separately. (Although it does fit in the travel case, with the shaver.)4.)  The included cleaner smells like toilet bowl cleaner. It's really objectionable.5.)  The included cleaner made the chemically sensitive people in our house sneeze--reading the instruction manual, unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an unscented version.6.)  This is harder  to clean, than other Phillips models. You have to forcibly take the shaving head apart, so that hair gets everywhere.What's Good:1.) The travel case has a slightly hard shell, and it's reasonably protective.2.) It gives a close shave.3.) This is good for travel.

"For reference, I've never used a pair of noise-blocking earphones, regularly, because I could not find any that worked with my normal-but-small ears. As a result, I've tried several pairs over the last few years.  These will probably be the first pair I've tried that I can actually use.Physical Comfort:  these are the most comfortable HD in-ear-earphones I have ever worn. I have tiny ears, and the smallest version of this fits well; I had not been able to find noise-blocking earphones that were comfortable, prior to trying these.  (I've tried at least four others, without success.)  Also, some noise-blocking earphones cause vertigo, and these do not cause any inner-ear problems.Sound Quality:  the headphone sound is really clear, almost sweet; the dynamic range that is almost a little too good--testing these with Carmina Burana, the quietest parts were a little difficult to hear, and the loudest parts were blowing out my eardrums. The sound is clear; these make it easy to hear vocal pronunciations in foreign languages.Noise Blocking:  these have some noise blocking, but it only blocks about 50% of ambient sound.

"If you've had the round air-filters before, this may be a significant improvement.  Both quieter and easier to place in a room, there is a noticeable difference in allergens in the air when this is turned on, placed parallel to a wall.  (I turned this on its highest setting in an 800 square foot room; I was congested from summer allergies when I went to sleep, and able to breathe much better, four hours later.)Even better than its performance, is the lack of noise this makes during operation. From across a room, it sounds like the steam setting on a dishwasher, when this is on its highest setting. On its lowest setting, it's quiet enough to set next to a bed--but it's not noticeably effective on its lowest setting.The entire unit is about a foot and a half high, and about five inches wide.  It's small enough to fit under one edge of a table, so it's out of the way.  Out of the box, this requires opening the cover and inserting two air filters, and then it is ready to go. This can be used on its side, but I think it gets better air circulation positioned vertically.

"This is a nice tent, but it takes thirty minutes to assemble, with two people working in good weather, in good lighting. It packs up really, really small, and it's lightweight. For the size and weight, it might be worth it.When this first showed up on my doorstep, I thought it was something else.  This is only slightly larger and more heavy than a package of printer paper.  It's perfect for longer backpacking trips, as long as you're not going ultra-lightweight, and you're not planning on breaking the tent down every morning.The tent comes in a bag with mesh sides, so it can dry out, a little, when you pack it up.What's in the bag:Four parcels--1.) It has a separate waterproof nylon bag that contains four tiny guylines (little ropes that anchor the tent supports to hold them vertical) and ten ground stakes.2.)  A nylon bag for tent poles. (12 by 3, and several ounces in weight.)3.) The actual tent.4.)  The rainfly. (Tent cover.)5.) Ribbons (not cords, ribbons) that tie the rainfly and tent--and they are almost too short. It took two of us to tie the tent parcels back together.6.)  Instructions. There is a single legal-sized instruction sheet. You should probably already be familiar with tents before reading the instructions.  If not, you'll have to learn some new words:  ""tent fly"" (the rain cover), ""guy cords"" (the tent stake ropes), ""ridge pole"" (tent support).This does not include a footprint (another new word), which is a sheet of nylon to protect the tent and keep it dry.The materials are pretty standard, and the construction is solid. The tent has two doors, which is a nice feature. The interior tent height is comfortable. The tent body is entirely mesh, which might work well in a hot climate; this is pretty roomy for a two-person tent; it has small interior pockets and hooks for gear lofts; the tent has windows on the sides that could be used for star watching. However, I can only give this three and a half stars to four stars--it takes thirty minutes to assemble, if you have two people working on it.This would be good for camping in hot, wide open, star-heavy country; in rainy or colder climates, the fact that it takes so long to assemble might make you be pretty unhappy, while you are assembling your tent in the cold or rain.For reference, I put this together with a family member--who then showed me a much older  off-brand tent with fewer stakes, that he has had for fifteen years--his old tent took five minutes.  Because this particular tent is complicated and has a lot of parts, it takes quite a while to set up.

Otherwise, this could be a very expensive mistake.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37DMP7OQI2C3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WMFXE5O#wasThisHelpful","R37DMP7OQI2C3A","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following the story of a near-future assassin who wakes up with his memory wiped after every kill, you'll start reading this, thinking it's one sort of book, and then it becomes something entirely different.  When the plot shifts, it becomes an alternate-history earth, story.  If that's not your thing (I stopped reading both Connie Willis', ""The Dog at Nighttime,"" and Gene Wolfe's, ""The Long Earth), keep going.  This is an incredible book.Reminiscent of Ian Banks', ""Use of Weapons,"" the author's writing is amazing because it describes almost continuous action, very coherently. It also manages a neat set of moral conundrums, without creating anything maudlin. This author does foreshadowing, depth, angst, and all the emotional twists that make up science fiction worth reading. Very Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YE7LLND75MQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391267#wasThisHelpful","R1YE7LLND75MQD","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are like sponges, but in an almost-paper towel-like thickness. They work like paper towels--which means no paper waste.  Wet, they're flexible. Dry, they're like large flat sponges. They can be machine or hand washed and take about twelve hours to dry.  While they don't pick up quite as much as paper towels, for jobs that will require multiple passes, these can save a lot of paper waste.Also, because they're flexible, they work better than sponges at getting into nooks and crannies.I tested them cleaning out an old pantry that had dust, dirt, plant food, and, and moldy bags scattered in it. These picked up most of the debris, with no problems, and washed out with dish soap, in about five hand-wash rinses.They don't pick up everything--I followed with a paper towel, and still came away with a little more wet dirt. (If I were going to pick up really nasty stuff, I'd use a paper towel, first, to avoid putting the worst messes through the washing machine or into the water table.)After testing these on a pantry, I accidentally spilled baking soda on a greasy, 1950's linoleum floor. I decided to pick the baking soda up and clean the grease off the floor at the same time.  The sponge worked beautifully, cleaning the floor to a high shine, but the sponge itself came away black.  After washing the sponge in a machine washer on hot, there were still faint grease stains.  Also, the baking soda seemed to have started to tear apart the finish of the sponge, a little.These will hold up to even really greasy, abrasive jobs, better than a paper towel. If I were going to commit to these instead of paper towels, I'd buy several.

"Reminiscent of cold iced coffee chilling in the refrigerator, windows open to a summer breeze on windows covered by lace curtains, and the sound of Southern blues somewhere in the distance, these are perfect for hot summer nights with a breeze.The overall quality is the kind of thing you'd expect in a 1950's Austin bungalow, which is where I hung these; the edges are raw machine scallops; the lace is clearly synthetic. If you're looking for period-perfect early 1960-'s to '70's Southern curtains, which are somewhat cheaper construction, these are perfect; for recreating a certain era, I couldn't have found a better pair if I'd looked for a long time.Machine lace like this was designed to allow breezes in, without allowing people to see into a house with open windows at night.  While these aren't as fancy or well made as the best machine-made lace, these work very well for that purpose--they're opaque enough to provide privacy at night, while allowing light in during the day. Covered in a diffuse rose-and-leaf-pattern, the lace is consistently stitched and pretty. These are a good example of a good pair of lower-end machine lace curtains.If you're looking for machine lace reminiscent of a certain era, these are recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPKHQYL6CWB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDXG6#wasThisHelpful","R2XPKHQYL6CWB4","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks like interspecies-fantasy-magic of the Maguire/Andrews/Briggs-type. It is not.  Switching back and forth between the thirteenth century and modern-day, the story follows a twenty-first century author and her boyfriend, as they move into a picturesque old house in the Welsh highlands.  The 13th century storyline includes Merlin, a bit of torture porn, a bit of real porn, servants, adultery, and a vulnerable heroine. The writing is better than that found in most romance novels, so if you're into that kind of thing, it's worth picking up--and if you don't like sexual situations involving coercion and fear, it's not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US4SJTYMC6MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250069688#wasThisHelpful","R1US4SJTYMC6MF","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Narrated by a girl waking up in what seems like a coffin, this is a story about a bunch of teenagers who find themselves in a room full of dust and individual medical bays, and then they find themselves in some kind of huge building.  It's science fiction, so you know there is some kind of adventure ahead--and the author has asked us to write spoiler-free reviews, so I'm going to talk about the writing from here.Reminiscent of the work of Greg Bear, and plotted a little like a made-for-tv movie, this author writes well enough that I actually finished the book, which is definitely not something I always do. This isn't absolutely fantastic writing so much as it's really fantastic plotting.  As far as the overall story arc, this book is really, really good.I'm also tempted to write something like, ""Tensely plotted, tight, and spine-tingling, this is a real page turner.""  And, it is.Although the author tries to delve into Big Ideas, ultimately, the third act devolves a little into a B-movie. Despite that, the overall story is compelling enough, that this is a good escapist rainy-afternoon Saturday afternoon read you won't want to put down.  Appropriate for older teens. Some violence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZ621KNUF989/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553393103#wasThisHelpful","RLZ621KNUF989","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Third Edit:After sending me a malfunctioning unit the first time, causing proxy server problems with the software associated with this, and generally being frustrating, Brother seems bent on digging themselves in deeper.  I got my replacement unit on a Thursday, and sent it back on a Saturday.  I have a UPS tracking number that says Brother has the unit, but Brother is now dunning me for a unit they have had for five days, according to UPS.Brother has had their nonfunctioning first unit back, five days ago, but they are sending me harassing emails. I'm not impressed. I'm leaving two stars, so I have one more to take off if they do anything else wrong.  Pass on this, and save yourself the annoyance.Second Edit:The scanner works well.  It dates each scan, and saves as a PDF.  The printer for black and white is lightning fast for individual pages.--and it's very clear printing. Like most modern printers, the top edge is about 1/20th of an inch off, but it's within acceptable parameters for professional printing.Pros:  You can set this up if your laptop does not have an external CD rom drive,and you're using a USB cord, instead of connecting wirelessly--most laptops without external CD ROM drives (It's the $350 Dell, British knockoff special) will require both USB ports; that means disconnecting the CD rom drive to plug in the printer; it works, even without the CD ROM drive attached. Very nice.Cons:  See belowFirst Edit:The setup will mess up a Chrome browser, as well. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating this machine is.  I've had so many issues with it, that it's infuriating beyond belief.  (I agreed to participate in a Brother product study? It did something to my Windows proxy settings.)Maybe this is o.k. if you don't agree to participate in their study or update software (both use the proxy server).  Also, it doesn't print completely straight. So far, it works--after hours and hours of redoing my laptop.  (At one point in my life, I was a software developer; you shouldn't have to be that to fix whatever the setup for this does to your computer.)Recommended for the cheaper ink, and the fact that it does work at all. It's a huge effort to get it working, between the setup disk interfering with the formatting of your proxy server, and the fact that some of these units don't work at all. This is an exercise in frustration. I hope that they get the bugs worked out.First Review: This is a massive machine. It is a team lift-item. (It only weighs about 37 pounds, but it's so large it's difficult to move.) I spent about 30 minutes trying to clear jams, watching youtube videos about how to clear jams, and  I kept trying to clear a code that showed up on the machine, specifically, ""Unable to initialize 8f.""  I opened and closed all of the compartments and got ink all over my fingers. When the printer tried to work, it made a screeching noise, when it moved at all.  Supposedly that code means there is a clog somewhere. (Yes. The printer carriage does not work.)In addition, one of the hinges was not properly attached, and the scanner cover was not glued on all the way through the top of the scanner.So, I called Brother Customer Service; they were patient.  They put me on hold after telling me that the serial number on the back didn't exist  After another couple of minutes, they came back on the line and said, ""This is a new item. We don't have it in our systems, so it does exist, but I can't help you with it. They then, ""passed me up the chain,"" to try to get it to work.  I never got through to anyone who could get it to work after half an hour of trying to get it to work myself, and then twenty minutes on the phone with customer service, and then the call dropped.  There may be units like this that work on the first try--but I didn't get one.  This unit is too heavy and too expensive to take the risk that it is defective.  The scanner surface, hinges, and printer carriage were not in working order.  As of this writing, my saintly boyfriend has agreed to help me move the printer to the post office in the back of his hatchback, and Brother has told me they will replace it. (After hours of very patient, non-native speaking call reps that, based on their accents, speak Thai and French, or possibly Cantonese and French.)I've been continuing to try to get this to work.  I'm impressed with Brother customer service. They keep calling me back, even though I'm in a Verizon dead spot and my phone keeps dropping the call. The Brother company has said, through tech reps that are in New Jersey (another unmistakeable accent) that they will replace the unit. Stay tuned.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMDAQKQ1ETX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUU7KNY#wasThisHelpful","RJMDAQKQ1ETX8","A175N19FS2B4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A175N19FS2B4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
