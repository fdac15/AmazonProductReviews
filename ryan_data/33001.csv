" 1:13 Mins Suffice it to say that I'm really impressed with this little mic. I run a podcast called Life is Story and frequently interview some of the top names in the Christian fiction and non-fiction world. I've balked at buying equipment other than my webcam because, frankly, I never really thought of myself as that successful. Then I started tracking how many people were listening and knew it was time to get serious. I'm not quite at the ""needs professional podcasting equipment"" stage yet, but did want to upgrade my mic. I use a lapel mic when I speak at church, so I'm familiar with that style and thought I'd give it a try here.The sound quality exceeded my expectations. In the video to the left, you can listen to me test the sound based on my distance from the mic. Sounds best up close (6-12""), but still has good, but quiet quality from farther back. I'll be using this for all my future podcasting needs!*Provided in exchange for an unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRMF5Y93W2C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105AUH02#wasThisHelpful","R2LRMF5Y93W2C7","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I are getting ready for our first child. (We're adopting internationally.) Rather than run crazy to buy everything once we have our child, we're working now to check off a couple of indispensable items every month. We have a stroller, but how to make it carry everything we need? So when I had to opportunity to test this product, I jumped at it.TOP POCKETS - The three top pouches are meant to hold water bottles/juice pouches, whatever you might need. They are easily accessible and hold most normal sized water bottles (5.5"" deep with a 3"" diameter). The two outer pouches are insulated as well. The middle section is slightly larger and has a flap that velcros shut. Good for storing snacks or other small, loose items. The flap has a small zipper area for odds and ends.SIDE POUCHES - The left pouch is meant as a phone case, but at 5"" x 3"", it barely fits my iPhone 5 and will probably not hold much larger phones. The right pouch is zippered and meant to hold keys and other such things. Pretty basic.STRAPS - The velcro straps are long enough to be affixed to any stroller type and will hold securely.Much better than those built-in, one-giant-pouch deals. This is a winner! I would note that it's not a diaper bag substitute, but you could probably fit a diaper or two in, if needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNRNH7OCYYRGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134VAUKG#wasThisHelpful","RNRNH7OCYYRGY","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most stylish iPhone covers I've ever owned. The granite look is absolutely incredible and, unlike other cases of a similar style, the design wraps all the way to the case's edge.With that said, what the case puts forth in style, it lacks in protectiveness. I would not recommend this phone for it's safety features. It does have the typical raised bumper that provides some protection to the screen and will stop scratches and such from the back, but it really isn't made for protection.Another highlight is that the case is very open-access, meaning that you don't have to worry about the aux cable or lightning port not fitting with the case.Overall, a very good stylish case, but minus a star not being super-protective, and that's an important feature to me.*I received this product in exchange for a review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIEVMKJIYO43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V9JSLW0#wasThisHelpful","R3EIEVMKJIYO43","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pocket chainsaw is designed with emergencies or hard to reach areas in mind. Some of the reviews here have compared this pocket chainsaw to a regular handsaw or even an electric chainsaw. Needless to say the electric chainsaw is OBVIOUSLY easier and a handsaw is more convenient. The appeal of the pocket chainsaw is its portability and the sheer fun of using one.In emergencies, this is an easy thing to have stashed in your truck, useful if you're hiking or camping. I've also found it useful to lop off specific branches in hard to reach areas that a handsaw can't get to.The cutting teeth are great, but it does require some amount of effort. Ye olde time lumberjacks aren't going to be trading their tools in for this any time soon. It's a product with its uses and, if you're the type to need something like this, you'll love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6NMYEXW9VC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCNYJI2#wasThisHelpful","RA6NMYEXW9VC5","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This battery operated grinder is the perfect addition to any cook's home kitchen. With just a simple press of a button, you can quickly and easily grind your own salt, pepper, or other seasonings.SIZE - The actual device is 8.5"" tall and 6.5"" in diameter. The grinding area is approximately 4.71 cubic inches, or roughly 1/3 cup. If you're making large batches, you may need to go for a larger device, but for a single meal for a family, this is great.FUNCTION - Simple push button grinder that runs on 4 AA batteries (not included). There's a small screw to twist at the bottom to adjust the fineness or coarseness of the grind.The mechanism seems to handle it very well, though it may take some time to get it all ground.DESIGN - I love the stainless steel look. My one complaint is the loading mechanism. To actually be able to put anything into the grinder, you have to take the large top piece off, exposing the battery compartment. Then you pop off the battery compartment, which acts as a lid to the grinder. I don't like the batteries are exposed every time you load this thing. I thought perhaps I was doing it incorrectly, and there was a way to take the whole thing (large silver top piece and inner battery compartment) off at once, but I haven't been able to do it. Furthermore, the battery compartment piece is separate from the motor piece, but snaps together. This wouldn't be a problem, except the snap doesn't stay half the time, meaning that 50% of the time I take the thing apart, I end up with exposed wiring. Just seems like there could be a better design.Overall, though, it does what it says and the design downfalls haven't reached a bothersome stage (though, we'll see how it holds up with continued use)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1STP8LCCUGHC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MMRYUE#wasThisHelpful","R1STP8LCCUGHC8","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's very rare to have an accessory that I think could either be used by the manliest of men or the hippiest of women, but this Vintage Waistpack manages to do it all. I'm envisioning myself as a carpenter, strapping this on, using the various compartments for my various types of bolts and such, but...who am I kidding...I was interested in this only for the steampunk cosplay. But whatever your reasons for getting this, from manliness to nerdiness to hippie chic, you wanna know about its quality.It holds up. Now one thing that the hippie chic crowd should know is that it's made with real leather (let all the men now grunt appreciatively). If that's not your style, go find an imitation leather alternative. I personally love the fact that this feels real and smells real because it IS REAL. Also, with real leather, the quality just seems a bit better.The three outside pouches are about 4 inches deep by 3 inches in length and about 1 inch wide. They have snaps, but also close magnetically, which helps keep them secure.The main zippered pocket is 5 inches deep by 10 inches in length and about 3-4 inches wide, depending on how far you want to stretch it. It has one internal pocket that's credit card sized, and an inner zippered pouch that's 5"" x 3"".The belt length is my only concern. It's plenty big enough at 50"" at it's longest setting, but is 32"" at it's smallest. If you are petite, you may have to do some finagling to get this to fit securely as a waist pack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11AZNY2QAFXVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012531COW#wasThisHelpful","R11AZNY2QAFXVY","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are SO MANY OPTIONS for women's accessories. Why choose this one? Let me tell you:COLOR CHOICES - I love that this comes in a variety of colors. There's sure to be an option that matches with that perfect outfit, or, go with a neutral tone to make it an everyday hand purse.REAL LEATHER - Just to note, this is made with real leather. For me personally, that was a big selling point. Imitation leather just doesn't have the same smell or feel. But if you morally object, then that's your right and I bring it up just to say that this product isn't for you.SPACIOUS - Despite the small size, the wallet is deceptively spacious. It is a trifold, with space on the left for a driver's license/ID card and two other card slots. The right has four card slots, and the middle zippered section is perfect for little odds and ends (but nothing bulky). The wallet portion works like a typical trifold wallet, but it also includes a secret zippered compartment.Overall, it's stylish and practical...exactly the kind of thing you want!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJ7QHL8JJOMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010L2L9JC#wasThisHelpful","RMJ7QHL8JJOMJ","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You really don't need a product like this for everyday use, but if you're traveling internationally, or anywhere where you're carrying important documents (or money), it's best to keep things close to you. This travel wallet can function as a neck pouch to be concealed under your shirt or can be extended to work as a waist pouch as well.It is just about the size of a US passport inside, which ensures that things cannot accidentally fall out. It's not meant to be a purse or an everyday bag, but some place to keep your valuables on you while you travel.The RFID blocking mechanism is also a nice device.I only take off one star because the elastic strap is rather thin and uncomfortable. It's also just bulky enough that it's not really concealable under a shirt (if you're in a colder climate, then different story).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZ6M4MVGQ6KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010P5U2J8#wasThisHelpful","R1SZ6M4MVGQ6KG","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a must-have for anyone who camps, hikes, or spends any significant period of time away from electricity. It's also a should-have for anyone who drives, providing peace of mind that, if your car battery dies, you have a great backup system already in place.The selling point of this product is it's multi-functional use. Well worth the cost as just a jump starter, the USB connectivity and adapters for laptops makes this the Swiss Army knife of power banks.CAPACITY - The 12000mAh capacity is more than enough for anything you can throw at it. Theoretically, you could jump your car about 20 times on one full charge. You could easily take this on a week long camping trip, use all your electronic devices, jump your car, boat, and RV, and still have charging capacity left.SIZE - At 9.5 x 3.9 x 4.9 inches, the power bank is compact enough to fit into a larger glove box or in a trunk without any hassle.RUGGEDNESS - This thing is built to last. A sturdy carrying case provides even more protection, but the hard plastic exterior is built for the outdoors.COST - At $70, you should definitely shop around before you buy, but $70 to buy peace of mind that you can fix a dead battery anywhere anytime? Yeah, I'd pay that.Overall, I'm very impressed with this power bank. Does everything it claims and then some!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MFPH8G2XUN2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YE5Q132#wasThisHelpful","R3MFPH8G2XUN2K","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Two stories in one book! The Little Bible Heroes flip-over book series is an easy to read and fun to look at retelling of biblical stories in a way that even the youngest of children can understand.I absolutely loved this particular volume (I feel like I’m saying that about all the books in this series, though!) because of the story of Martha. Really, it’s the story of Mary and Martha, but I’ll let that detail slide. Martha is focused on doing things for Jesus; her sister, Mary, is focused on learning from Jesus. In the end, Martha learns that listening to Jesus is just as important as doing things for him. That’s such a great lesson for small kids (and us big kids) to learn.The story on Jesus’ Miracles is really just a brief summary of five different miracles Jesus performed. I’m not sure what went into the idea to mash all of these together in one half-book, because each story could easily have been an entire half-book in and of itself.Because of this, I feel like parents should take their time walking through this one. We look at Jesus’ miracles like it’s no big deal but our young children are rightly shocked and amazed. What do you mean he made a paralyzed man walk? In other words, the book rushes through the information so you, as the parent, will have to slow down and walk your child through it.Despite this small criticism, the book is an overall winner. The illustrations are fun, the colors vivid, and the stories memorable. Little Bible Heroes is a great way to introduce your little one to Scripture!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6K325QBKLPBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433687143#wasThisHelpful","R6K325QBKLPBY","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two stories in one book! The Little Bible Heroes flip-over book series is an easy to read and fun to look at retelling of biblical stories in a way that even the youngest of children can understand.Little Bible Heroes is back with two new adaptations, this time taking us back to the conquest of the Promised Land and the stories of Joshua and Rahab. Victoria Kovacs continues to masterfully break down the biblical story into words and ideas that a preschooler can understand without losing the heart of the message.The Joshua story focuses on the battle of Jericho and Joshua’s leadership of the Israelites into the Promised Land. It brings up the themes of God’s presence and help and how we can do anything through the power of God.Rahab’s story comes in the middle of the Joshua storyline, something that you can point out to your children. The two spies mentioned in Joshua’s story are the same two spies in Rahab’s story! Rahab hides the spies and, in return, is spared from the destruction. Kovacs even mentions that Rahab becomes the ancestor of King David!(Quick mostly-irrelevant theological note. Kovacs specifically says that Rahab is the great-great-great grandma of David. Keen thinkers will realize that there is an almost 400 year period from Rahab to David, which means one of two things: it is possible that every person in these generations lived long lives and had children in their 80s and 90s, or there is a generational gap here. Either is possible.)As always, the Little Bible Heroes stories do well at lending themselves to interaction in the storyline. Ask, ask, ask questions. Don’t just read the words, get your child to interact with them and seek out their thoughts and have a conversation with them. It is so important to cultivate faith at a young age and the Little Bible Heroes series is perfect for doing just that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QU27SRBO14M8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143368716X#wasThisHelpful","R1QU27SRBO14M8","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two stories in one book! The Little Bible Heroes flip-over book series is an easy to read and fun to look at retelling of biblical stories in a way that even the youngest of children can understand.This particular book includes the story of Joseph and the story of The Good Samaritan. As with the rest of the series, the language is very simple and sticks to 2-3 sentences per page. Author Victoria Kovacs does a great job distilling the story into its essentials and rephrasing it in an easy-to-understand way. Mike Krome’s illustrations will draw every reader into the story as well.The story of Joseph covers the events from Joseph’s coat of many colors all the way to their family’s restoration in Egypt. Through the story, you could talk to your child about God’s providence even in tough times. You could also focus on the power of lies—because Joseph’s brothers lied, Joseph’s dad believed his son was dead. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, you could focus on forgiveness. Joseph is able to forgive his brothers and they are reconciled in Egypt.The story of The Good Samaritan closely follows Jesus’ parable. Through it, our young ones will be taught the value of helping everyone, even those who you might see as enemies. Talk about why the priest and the Levite didn’t stop to help but the Samaritan did. Use each page to interact with your child about the story and ask good questions that make them think and learn.I especially love the Parent Connection at the end of each story. It includes a verse straight from Scripture (though I would prefer a version simpler in language than the HCSB). Always draw your child back to the reality that these are true stories from God’s word. It also includes two helpful discussion questions, and a one sentence takeaway thought to remember.Overall, the Little Bible Heroes series does exactly what it is supposed to do: provide children with a fun and engaging introduction to Scripture. Long live the Little Bible Heroes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FSGO5G8K9S03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433687151#wasThisHelpful","R2FSGO5G8K9S03","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Easy Gift (R) Potato Chip Slicer Potato Chips Veggie Chopper Waffle Cutter French Fries Maker was ostensibly named by an SEO manager who thought if they plugged in every possible semi-related phrase into the title they'd make more sales. Unfortunately, even if this is true, they'd only be left with disappointed customers.Simply put, it's too small for functionality. The listing says that it fits ""most potatoes,"" but that's far from being the case. The most common type of potatoes, russet potatoes, will not fit. Even an apple, also pictured in the stock image, will need to be quartered first.The listing also says that it ""doesn't require considerable pressure"" to use, a statement I can only assume was written by a bodybuilder or someone insecure about their strength.

"You never know when your phone battery will die...strike that, you do know: at the least convenient time possible. But, you know, it's the 21st century! You always have access to electricity somewhere, right? Right? Well, usually, so if you're not the outdoorsy type, you probably won't benefit from this product over a regular external battery or charger. But if you're a hiker, camper, or someone else potentially away from anywhere with a wall outlet, this product could save your life. Even if you just have a power outage, this can save your phone.CHARGING CAPACITY - The 5000mAh capacity is more than capable of completely charging your phone. The iPhone 6 has a 1810 mAh capacity. When depleted, a day in the sunlight recharges it to over 50% capacity, meaning that this is pretty much not going to give out on you so long as there's sun.CHARGING MECHANISM - One thing I did find interesting is that the manufacturer says to rely on solar power to charge the device only in the case of an emergency. In other words, when A/C power is to be had, use that. It has me curious as to the effects of long term usage, but the 5 stars stands until I see otherwise. This is something ONLY mentioned in the small print in the instruction manual, not on the sales page here on Amazon. I would have liked to have seen this information listed prominently on the sales page, as it seems rather important.SIZE - This device is roughly the same size and weight as my iPhone 5 in its waterproof case.DESIGN - Sleek and sexy. Quite cool looking. Also it's very rugged. Great for hiking.IN THE END - If you are a hiker/camper, you need this. Throw it in your backpack, don't leave without it. It guarantees that your GPS/phone/whatever else will stay charged and keep you safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXAMNIRVMO02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSRFA82#wasThisHelpful","R1LXAMNIRVMO02","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned a good number of bluebooth headsets in my day and am constantly amazed by the number of styles there are. On ear, over ear, earbud, neckband, wireless...the list goes on. I had never tried a neckband style headset before and wondered if this might solve the problem I always have with headphones: finding the volume and track skip buttons.FIT: If you have an exceptionally large neck or wear a collared shirt, you may have trouble getting this to fit comfortably. For my average sized neck (19""), the two end pieces nestled comfortably on my collarbone. The earpieces fit snugly and the design keeps the cords from getting in the way.SOUND: For a lower-priced model, I was impressed by the sound quality. I primarily used this for listening to podcasts, but even the audio tracks I put on sounded rich and full.PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing can be a pain, but not so here. Even better, it can connect to up two device simultaneously.Another neat feature is that the collar will vibrate softly if you get a call while paired to the device. It's enough to get your attention without being obnoxious. It'll do the same if you go out of approximately 22ft range the device carries.Overall, I'm really impressed with this headset and it just might replace the simpler, smaller, headset I've been using.*Product received for free in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NIYF5P0ADCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R30NIYF5P0ADCJ","A1K2V8BSC895CD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K2V8BSC895CD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Obviously food particles are going to get stuck between the blades. Obviously. It's part design flaw, part what you get when you try to chop herbs faster. These super-scissors come with multiple blades for faster chopping power, and, if you're not put off by having to tap the scissors on your cutting board or brush the herbs out from between the blades, this'll work for you!Not much more to say about these.

"Having never had a golf travel bag before but finding I all of a sudden needed one I was very lucky to receive this one. An extremely well-made and very roomy bag. There are so many things to like here: The area where your club heads are is extremely padded. In fact when you hold up the empty bag the top is almost the same weight as the reinforced bottom. The wheels appear to be very durable. The bag has outside pockets as well for extra storage.This bag is so well-made that I fear my current golf club set is unworthy. I guess I just have to go out and buy a brand new set of clubs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D4E3XJ5PPYJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5VQBU8#wasThisHelpful","R1D4E3XJ5PPYJY","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this ""jug-O-sauce"" from Amazon and just had to pop it open immediately to try. What I found is not what I would call a traditional sweet-n-sour sauce. The flavor is a bit stronger and not so sweet. However it has a nice flavor that seems to go well with chicken. In my opinion it's best used as a short-timed marinade. Just put a few chicken breast filets in a large Zip-Lock, pour in enough sauce to cover, seal, and refrigerate for just a couple of hours. Put chicken on grill (discarding remaining sauce in bag) and cook. You can also add a bit of the sauce from the bottle to enhance the flavor while eating if desired.We're pleased with the flavor. I'm just not sure if I would purchase a 72 oz. bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SBEZ5782W3GU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFOADI#wasThisHelpful","R1SBEZ5782W3GU","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For whatever reason I had not read any of Brian Aldiss' books even though I do love true sci-fi. Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, Gordon R Dickson,and Kim Stanley Robinson are some of my favorites. So when I read the brief description of Finches of Mars I thought it was right up my alley.The book arrived and I was surprised how short it was, just about 180 pages. But that's fine, as long as it was a page-turner. This however was rather pedestrian. It really breaks down to a series of short stories revolving around a central theme/plot. And while at first I thought that could be interesting it ended up not being so. Perhaps it's because I like a central theme with main characters that progress through the plot that I had a hard time with it. This type of plot device could be great as proven by Asimov's great Foundation series where the first eight short stories were packaged together as one book. Bit the Finches of Mars falls way short, possibly not even in the same Galaxy, from that series.Personally I really have no desire to read Aldiss' previous works even though I hear he has some great stories. This one kind of burned me off of his efforts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31EQ8H33SAOMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150400213X#wasThisHelpful","R31EQ8H33SAOMX","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately this is not the first Fisher Price toy we've bought for our three year old grandson that is missing parts. Earlier this year we bought the Fisher-Price Thomas The Train: Trackmaster Avalanche Escape Set and it was missing two pieces of track, pretty much making it useless.

"I discovered the Old Guys Rule line in a small shop at Morro Bay, California. I found one I liked and bought it. Not only was the size (XL) a perfect fit, which seems to be an issue nowadays with many clothing lines, but the shirt is very high quality. These will not wear out quickly as many shirts do now. Over a year later I still wear it comfortably. On our next trip to Morro Bay I purchased two more along with a hat, which is also made well to last.So now I found out that Amazon has these and purchased the Untapped Potential version. As expected it fits perfectly and is of quality material. Seriously this has become my favorite line of what I call ""Lazy-Wear"", not just because of the message but especially for the quality. I will have no hesitation to purchase additional products and expect to do so in the very near future.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTSBJF8W5S8EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYUD8EU#wasThisHelpful","RTSBJF8W5S8EN","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Game of War - Fire Age is the (gasp!) first online game I've ever played. After being pounded into submission by all the TV commercials I finally logged on and started building my city. At first it was fun and interesting. I joined an alliance and quickly built my city and hero up. Within about five days I got my city up to a level 10 with a strong military force. When the leaders of the alliance wanted to eliminate weaker players I was one of the ones they invited to join their new alliance. I was cruising.Then a funny thing happened. I realized that I was basically playing a ramped up, multi-player version on steroids of the old Civilization game I played many years ago. The issue is the game play is just so repetitive. You just keep doing the same things over and over. The quests are nothing more than clicking on an icon and letting the time elapse so you can claim your reward. In other words, you really do nothing. Oh occasionally you can go attack someone else or some monster. But overall the game got rather boring. So after about a week I deleted the app and went on with my life.I may try another online game in the future. But it will have to be less repetitive and more stimulating. Otherwise what's the point?","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUSOM7IV165QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY7PEAA#wasThisHelpful","RUSOM7IV165QE","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The 14 piece Oceanique  bathroom set is a nice but no so inexpensive way to dress up a kids or guest bathroom. The kit is functional in that it includes the shower curtain, shower rings, and bath mat. Please note that the shower curtain is 100% polyester and machine washable which is nice. Also note that the shower curtain is water resistant, not water proof. What this means is with a slight indirect spray the water will bead up but any direct spray will eventually start to seep through. A shower liner is highly recommended but is not included with the set.The bath mat is kind of cheap looking but is non-skid which is great. The bath rings are also a bit on the cheap-looking side but works well.

"Honestly I am not a huge gamer. I play some here and there so I really can't say how great this is during an 18-hour gaming marathon. First as a keyboard, it's decent. The unit itself is extremely sturdy and rather heavy compared to the standard keyboard today. Of course it is not wireless so you do have to mess with that pesky USB port wire.However I am experiencing one issue that prevents me from giving this five stars. I would label myself as a deliberate typist, not the fastest by any stretch. But as I speed up I find a keystroke will miss on occasion, especially if I'm capping the first letter of a word. I have no idea why this is but it does get frustrating. I could see if I were one of those lighting fast typist who can do a paragraph in a matter of seconds. But I'm not that talented.

"OK, I have to admit something. I don't have a baby in the house anymore. I do have a three-year old grandson living with us but currently he sleeps in his own bed in his Mom's room. So no, I'm not going to install this there. Plus when he's not in preschool he usually takes his naps on our bed and I have no intention of putting in that room. So I didn't get this to be a ""baby"" monitor although with all the extras included it would be a wonderful device for that.No, I needed a security cam for a blind section right by the front door. Although I have a cam that points out from the garage overlooking the driveway and street, the small front courtyard is not covered. I work from home so I can keep an eye out when we have UPS deliveries or those annoying realtors who come by and knock at  the most inconvenient times. I can also set it up when my grandson is playing in our small backyard to keep an eye on him.Most of the reviews here already cover all the great attributes this system has so I'm not going to go over them again. Instead I will say that it is a quality product that performs better than expected. While I initially thought the cost of the unit was high, being just under $300 as of this review, I have to say I came away very impressed with it's value.

"First off I'm a huge Kansas fan, otherwise known as a Wheathead. I fell in love with their music the very first time I heard the album Song for America when it was first released. I have all their albums, many on both vinyl (from the 70/80's) and CDs. I just went to their concert in Anaheim California. Loved it. I can say without any doubt that they are my favorite music group, bar none. So please understand that I'm really having a hard time with this review.I received my advanced copy of ""Kansas: Miracles Out of Nowhere"" direct from the Kansas site. It was nice in that you could pre-order direct from the band's site and along with the standard set you also received a bonus DVD. I received the set on Monday 3/16. After watching it I came away underwhelmed and a little disappointed. I think this is a great documentary for those who know Kansas only for Carry on Wayward Son  and Dust in the Wind. For those people this would be an informative and interesting film about the early days of the band. For anyone who has followed the band for years there really isn't much new here. Oh occasionally there is a surprise anecdote that you may not have known, my favorite being the time they opened for Aerosmith and Steven Tyler went nutso. But for the most part the documentary plays out as more of a fluffy marketing piece than a down-&-dirty history of a great band.The film starts at the very beginning and progresses album by album through Point of Know Return. However here is where the film ends. I would have loved for it to continue through Monolith and Audio Visions because that was time that the band began to splinter amid their waning popularity. It would have been interesting to hear what happened during those days and each player's reactions but alas, no. I mean I understand omitting the Elefante years and beyond because the film is about the original lineup. I get that. But to paint this rosy picture but not include some of the dark elements is disappointing. As I said in the title, mostly fluff not enough stuff.The CD that is included again provides nothing new. If you have purchased their albums you'll have all the songs here in their original recordings except ""Can I Tell You"" which was recorded live for the Don Kirshner Rock Concert series. But it's also not new as it was included on the DVD in Sail On: The 30th Anniversary Collection 1974-2004.

"I have been a fan of Kim Stanley Robinson since I read his first book The Wild Shore: Three Californias (Wild Shore Triptych) back in the mid-1980's. His stories have always been very character driven and usually with a strong plot. For whatever reason I had missed the release of 2312 and was just about to start it when I had the opportunity to read the advanced reading copy of Aurora. So needless to say I jumped at it. Is it one of KSR's best? No, not hardly. But overall it's an interesting and (eventually) engaging novel.The basic plot revolves around a group of interstellar settlers aboard a generations ship that has been traveling toward a new planet for about 200 years. This particular generation is destined to land and settle the new world if all goes according to plan, which of course it doesn't. The book offers many interesting twists along with great character development and of course the proverbial rebellion. I did find many wonderful surprises on where KSR takes us in his imagination. But also I found a number of plot twists that seemed to have been put in for convenience, or to resolve an unresolvable dilemma. The solution provided for the group returning to earth seemed a bit contrived to say the least.But overall I enjoyed the book. It wasn't one of those finish-in-one-sitting types but enjoyable and somewhat engaging. I went back-and-forth between rating this at three stars or four. I settled on four mostly because of the author's ability to develop characters to the point where you care about them. If you're a KSR fan I think you'll enjoy this. If you're a first time reader of the author I might suggest starting with some of his earlier and arguably better works, like the Mars trilogy or the aforementioned ""The Wild Shore.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EW3YUL2VNLFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316098108#wasThisHelpful","R2EW3YUL2VNLFL","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say I'm very impressed with the so-called Iron Grip duct tape.  It is much stronger tape than your standard version plus it really has a very strong adhesiveness to it. Personally I would have been happy with a normal everyday product and thought the current price point for two rolls was a bit high. But based on the quality of the tape along with the larger than normal roll I would have to say the value is definitely there. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4T3ZL0FNUH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5R21XG#wasThisHelpful","R1L4T3ZL0FNUH8","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do like to cook but by no stretch of the imagination would I consider my self a chef. My knife skills are, shall we say, amateurish (""Daddy, why is there blood all over the counter?""). So when I got the chance to try this I just had to jump. I mean you see these type of things advertised all the time on TV but you question if it really works. This one is impressive.It slices, it dices, it chops. It makes life easier so I don't have to lug out the huge food processor for small jobs. Seriously I can't believe I waited this long to try something like this. The only issue I have is storage. It's relatively small so not all the separate parts will fit in it between uses. But that is something I can live with because of the ease it brings into my cooking life.

I look forward to reviewing that as well.In this case, the Belkin Apple MFi Certified Car Charger with Lightning Cable is a perfect companion for when you are on the road.

"I have to admit when I was first introduced to Pandora I was rather skeptical. However without a doubt it has become my go to app for music. To be able to build music lists from categories, names, styles, genres, or even song titles is just plain awesome. Even though you can't pick the songs that are played on your list you can help it evolve by giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings. I realize that since Pandora has come out there is newer and more sophisticated music apps coming out but so far I keep coming back to Pandora. Personally I subscribe to Pandora One which has been $36 per year and allows you to listen to music non-stop without commercial interruption.

"OK, so my almost three year-old grandson who lives with us loves the show Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on Disney Junior. Not a great fan of Mickey Mouse in person when we go to Disneyland but loves the show. So the other set of grandparents bought this for him last week, exactly seven days before Christmas mind you, and gave it to him to bring over to our house. Grrrr. So I got to assemble this disaster. Yeah...thanks so much for the privilege.So I take everything out of the box and spread it out. One nice thing...all parts are accounted for. OK we're off to a good start. Unfortunately this is where good goes away for a sabbatical and frustration shows up in full war regalia. First the instructions are 99.9% pictures only. In fact the only ""helpful"" words on the set-up pamphlet is ""NOT INCLUDED"" (written in 15 languages I kid you not) with arrows pointing to the required batteries. The unit requires two AA and two AG13 batteries. OK, AA's I have but what the heck are AG13's and do I have them? Nah, they appear to be like hearing aid size. I'm sorry but at over $65 those non-standard types should be included. The grandson didn't understand and was not amused that the attached flashlight didn't work.The product is cheaply made. You have to be really careful or as your snapping things together you could break the cheap plastic. Fortunately that didn't happen but as a consequence of my being careful one of ears keeps falling off. On the bring side the kid started using it as a bowling ball. On the not-so-bright side the dog was not amused at being used as a bowling pin. She left the room in a huff. Other assembly issues: The slide falls off if you look at it wrong, the stickers don't stay stuck for very long, the one ear that opens so you can put one of the figures in only fits Pluto even though the picture clearly shows Minnie in it (the kid spent five minutes trying to fit Minnie in and almost decapitated her), I still have no idea how the flag that goes up on top actually attaches as the hole for it is WAY too big, and when folded up to store not all the pieces fit in. It's like Rubic's Cube where maybe there is only one combination that is correct except no matter how you put the pieces in there is always ONE piece left that if you put in the unit it will not snap shut. It's just begging for you to lose something.However I did give it two stars because the kid loves it. At least for now as he's only been playing with it for one day. We'll see how long that lasts. But seriously at this price I would pass on it. It is SO overpriced as to make a $10 burger at McDonald's seem reasonable. Stay away, stay far away.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195VKKWQJN5ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TJ58BS#wasThisHelpful","R195VKKWQJN5ZS","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great all purpose cable with decent length. Can be used to charge anything that fits the micro B plug, which I have way too many things that covers. The product comes in multiple colors so you can choose between Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Red, Orange and Purple. I choose red as I'm a St. Louis Cardinal fan. However what I received was not what I would call red but more of a dark salmon. Hence the docking of one star. If you are going to call it red then please make it red.But other than that, works wonderfully.

"I was too young to watch this when it first ran but over the years I've become so addicted to the series whenever I could find it in reruns. For years I've been begging for the powers that be to release it on DVD and for whatever reason they just waited. In fact they probably waited too long as most of us fans are beginning to go senile and forget the old shows. But finally here it is. So far I've purchased Season One and look forward to adding Season Two soon.What made this show special was of course James Garner and Jack Kelly, Kelly being added to the cast after about six shows. But you also have to credit the writers with great scripts as well. The show covered the spectrum of western situations with both intensity and tongue-in-cheek humor. Although most episodes starred either Garner or Kelly alone there were also some that included both. When that happened the chemistry was just perfect.Seriously if you enjoyed the old TV westerns then you just have to have this in your collection. Great characters coupled with wonderful writing equals a great show. My only concern is starting with the release of Season Three the shows are on DVD-Rs which to me spell lesser quality. Plus the price has gotten a bit high as of this review. We'll see when I get there just how much I want to spend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACPWWV4FUXIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AAF3FK#wasThisHelpful","R3ACPWWV4FUXIM","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first HDMI projector. Actually it's my first projector of any kind since the days of 8mm. When reading the manufacturer,s description on Amazon that of course just raved about it I remained a bit skeptical. I was concerned about easy set-up, whether I would need to invest in new equipment, and if the HD images would truly be HD. I need not worry as I came away very impressed.First off, it's an easy set up. I don't have a permanent spot I can put it so it's a roving unit that gets to be used in multiple rooms. The only equipment I will need to invest in is a 3D Blu-ray player, if I want to watch something in 3D of course. I could also invest in a screen but honestly I truly don't need one. I have light colored walls and the images are perfect even in the day time although at night without outside lite sneaking in it's tremendous. One other thing I was concerned about was whether the speakers would provide a rich and robust sound. They don't quite meet that level but they are more than adequate.I have to say that even at the price it's a great investment for your home theater. Without a doubt I highly recommend the unit for anyone looking for that robust entertainment environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34GHYYAU3GZR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJTXW9A#wasThisHelpful","R34GHYYAU3GZR6","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being an older gent I have a ton of old negatives from days gone by. Unlike my grown up children we didn't have that magical image creator called digital. So when I had the chance to order this unit with the promise of taking all those negatives and slides and turning them into digital images I was both excited and skeptical. There also were already a couple of reviews that gave me pause that talked about grainy images. But I figured what did I have to lose? So we gave it a try and I'm glad we did.A couple of things to note; The unit is VERY easy to use although it takes a few tries to get the hang of it. The images are not grainy but they are definitely not high definition either. Not that I was expecting that but I think maybe some of the detractors were? But overall it's a decent solution to digitizing your old photo's at a very reasonable price.

"We've lived in our current house for about 11 years We installed a small fountain almost immediately. The first pump we had (unknown name) lasted about six years. When we went to replace it we were told that particular model was discontinued and this one is the best to replace based on size and power. Five years later we just bought our third and probably last one of this new pump. Both the first two lasted just over two years and died. I've looked but have yet to find a different one that fits the small area our fountain has for the pump.It's not from lack of cleaning. We clean both the pump and fountain at least once a month. In case of high winds when dirt and tree leaves possibly can clog the area we'll clean more often as needed. This particular pump appears to just be made shoddy. If this also dies quickly we're probably going to turn the fountain into a planter.One thing to note, if you do plan on buying this, definitely buy it online. It averages about $25 online versus around $54 if you buy it locally.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3315R672KEKGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006M6MU90#wasThisHelpful","R3315R672KEKGO","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just discovered Firefly last year. I was bored and looking for something, anything on Netflix to entertain me. The Netflix description said something like the ""short-lived but highly loved sci-fi series"" so I thought I would give the first episode, ""Serenity"" a chance. I was immediately grabbed and was never let go of as I watched episode after episode. After finishing up the final show I immediately watched the full length feature film Serenity which attempted to tie up all the loose ends. Since then I've watched it enough times to finally invest in the DVD sets of both the series and the movie.What I liked most about the series is that it was true science fiction without the fantasy elements so many other series throw in there. No weird looking aliens, no magical modes of transportation (""beam me up Scotty""), no ridiculously miraculous medical cures. Just an old fashion character and plot driven series about humans 500 years in the future. The ensemble cast is wonderful and perfectly chosen. Nathan Fillion (best known now from the TV show ""Castle"") as Captain Malcolm Reynolds plays the pivotal role as the leader of a ragtag group of not-so-legitimate space freighters. But as you watch the shows you truly care about each and every character in the crew. They are so wonderfully developed, each with their own special quirks. From the deeply loyal first mate Zoe, to the mercenary Jayne, to the very young female ship's engineer Kaylee, to the flippant pilot ""Wash"", to the registered companion Inara, all have just wonderful personalities that play so well off of each other. When you add the three ""passengers"", the Shepherd (a religious missionary), to the young Doctor and his sister who are fugitives from the authorities, your crew is complete and the plot devices are all in place.While each episode can stand on it's own there are a couple of sub-plots that run through most, if not all, of the episodes that link everything together. The problem with Fox never standing behind the project is that many of those sub-plots will never be resolved. Yes, the subsequent film ""Serenity"" ties up a number of the main loose ends. However we'll never know the Shepherd's background that was hinted as being violent and completely opposite of what he currently was portrayed as. We'll never know what led him to abandon that life and enter the Abbey. Jayne's quote to the Shepherd in the episode Our Mrs. Reynolds perfectly says it: ""Someday you're going to have to tell us how a preacher knows so much about crime."" To me it's one of the greatest mysteries left unrevealed by the quick cancellation.If you're a fan of great Sci-Fi you have to have this. If you're already a fan of the series and have not purchase this, you need to do so. It has some great special features including deleted scenes that add even more dimension to the characters and their motivations, along with the typical making of the series mini-documentary, the proverbial gag-reel, and other features as well. A must have especially at the low price you can now buy it for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W65HSHJVII4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AQS0F#wasThisHelpful","R2W65HSHJVII4K","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a confession to make. I had never read a single Sherlock Holmes book or story by sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I personally find this amazing and somewhat shameful as I love the old-style mysteries. I'm a huge Rex Stout fan, having read and kept every Nero Wolfe book he ever wrote. Raymond Chandler is another mystery author I enjoyed. But for some reason I never read Holmes.This changed when I got the chance to order The Hound of the Baskervilles, A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four (Everyman's Library (Cloth)), three of the four Holmes full length novels in one wonderfully packaged hard covered book. I'm not sure why the fourth Holmes novel, The Valley of Fear, is not included as I don't think it would have made this book format excessively large but what do I know? As mentioned earlier it currently is hard cover with a solid binding and includes the old fashion cloth to mark your place. Very nice construction.Of the stories what could I say that hasn't been said before? They are wonderful. The first, A Study in Scarlett, gives a great introduction to Holmes and Watson with great early character development. It's fun to read the arrogance of Holmes as he not only solves the impossible cases but takes delight in making sure everyone is aware of his genius. The plots are extremely well thought out with a number of characters trotted out as possible suspects only to have the real perpetrator pop up as a surprise. It's one of the reasons I always loved the Nero Wolfe books. You don't know the guilty party until the end, yet when it's explained you can look back and see the clues that should have tipped you off. It's also one of the reasons I have a hard time getting into the new mysteries as many of the newer books I've read you can figure out the guilty person half way through the story. One of the exceptions is the Ruth Galloway mysteries by Elly Griffiths. As a mystery they are very good. However they have their own issue as the plots then to slip in-and-out of being soap opera-ish.I would recommend this to ANY mystery fan. Great who-done-it's in a wonderful hardcover package makes this a must have to mystery book collectors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W05OT8XYVG2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375712674#wasThisHelpful","R2W05OT8XYVG2K","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this last week and have tried using it a few times. I have been using the SKLZ Quick Change Resistance Band System. Compared to that product the Perfect Fitness Bands Pro with Tendon Tech lacks versatility. My first impression out of the box was that it was a little short. At 26 inches it's a little awkward to use if you're standing on an end and using it for curls, etc. The only way to increase resistance is to move your hands closer together which of course shortens up the usage area more. I can see this for someone who is just beginning to do a resistance based workout. But if you've been already doing resistance training then this is probably not very functional.A couple of good points; price wise it's pretty reasonable compared to other products like the SKLZ Quick Change Resistance Band System for example. It is also latex free which I know many people are looking for. For those points plus it being an OK unit for a beginner I gave it three stars. But overall it's just not workable for me.

"I'm not a ""Dirt Devil"" fan. I've tried quite a few of the vacuuming units and have found them wanting. To be blunt, they've sucked and not in a good way. However I really needed something for our downstairs flooring that would do some real deep cleaning. When I had the opportunity to try this I figured to give it a chance. I came away quite impressed.First off, it's very light weight. Second, VERY easy to use. Third, very very effective. I had not realized how ineffective our daily mopping truly was. But this cleaned dirt up that I didn't even know existed. Since we have both a dog and a 2 year-old grandson living with us I am thrilled with this product. It gave me trust again in the Dirt Devil product line. Well, almost.Seriously, I highly recommend this if you're looking for a effective way to clean flooring.

"I truly love real science fiction. You know, the kind with little, if any, fantasy elements. Some of my favorite authors include Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, Kim Stanley Robinson, & Gordon R. Dickson, to name a few. Lately it's really been hard to find good sci-fi and for some reason Peter F. Hamilton has flown under my radar. But I had the chance to read his latest, The Abyss Beyond Dreams: A Novel of the Commonwealth, and jumped at it.First off, I was at a huge disadvantage as the book is part of the Commonwealth series of which I know nothing about. There is a rather detailed timeline at the beginning of the book which helped a little. But the story starts with a group of spaceships lost in what is called the void and it's expected the reader already knows all about the void and the issues revolving around it. I didn't. Add to that, the first part of the book is really sterile. It's introducing some of the important characters and the trouble they're in, which is really necessary as it's a long book. But it's done in a pretty dry manner so it was hard to plod through until I got to some of the good stuff. I can definitely see new readers to the series putting it down forever.However, as you get deeper into the story more background information is integrated and I began to understand the back story and how it affected current events. It still had its sterile moments making the reading experience at times not so enjoyable. But overall I can say I enjoyed the book. It's just not where I should have started.I would definitely recommend this to anyone already into Hamilton and his Commonwealth/Void stories. For the reader just being introduced to the author I would strongly suggest starting with some of his earlier works. It may make this book eventually a more enjoyable read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IS2VK8AURMSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345547195#wasThisHelpful","R2IS2VK8AURMSB","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered what is considered level one of Crazy A's and was very curious about what I would receive. The product description on the Amazon page states ""Crazy A's (formerly called Whizizzle Phonics) is a fast-paced phonics game series that teaches the sounds of the English language."" I was interested to see how it taught those sounds.What I received was a deck of cards. Period. Nothing else. No tape or CD or anything that a young child can listen to that lets them hear the sounds. There is nothing, repeat nothing, that teaches sounds or how to blend those sounds into words. Instead the parent has a three-step written guide where the only phonics instruction is a total of 26 words long. It's up to the parent playing with a young child to truly know what the correct sounds are and then teach them to the child BEFORE playing the game. The cards themselves are just three letter words (bat, rod, rib, etc) and the game itself is just a version of crazy 8's. If anything this so-called phonics game motivates a child to memorize the words more than sound them out.Unless you are purchasing this for a school-aged child who already knows the sounds and just needs practice, pass on this. At best it is a reinforcement tool, not a teaching device. Personally even at the low cost I'm not sure it's worth the price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31PA16EQ1L2R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAR2GAC#wasThisHelpful","R31PA16EQ1L2R1","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, I hate this machine. There are very few things to like about it and in my opinion it's just not functional compared to what I already have (Dyson, Hoover). In vacuuming it doesn't seem to have the ability to pick up deep down dirt. It's no where close in that area to either stand up vacuum I have. For cleaning drapery it's somewhat functional but not very user friendly and actually pretty awkward.The few things I like: It has an auto-retractable power cord. Just push the button with your toe and it sucks it right up. Probably the best sucking feature on the unit. I also like that the user has the ability to adjust the power of the unit, Oh yeah, and it looks pretty cool too.However the negatives far outweigh those couple of positives. Out of the box, I took an instant dislike to the so-called manual. It's nice that it's in multiple languages only I wish each language had it's own section. Instead each instruction alternates in language forcing you to read over 10 pages when two pages per language would have been perfect. Add to that the printing is ridiculously small. My tired old eyes needed both my reading glasses and VERY bright light to read the thing. It is a bag unit VS canister (which I knew going in so my bad). No matter what the product page says, for it's size it's not light weight and it is definitely not easily maneuverable. It's actually a pain in the proverbial rear to pull along.I really don't like posting one-star reviews but with the lack of pickup-ability for deep cleaning, the awkwardness of the unit, and the the continued cost of bags makes this a no-go for me.

"I remember when this made-for-TV was hyped prior to airing. The commercials kept touting the return of the Maverik brothers. I so looked forward to watching it. Probably based on how much I looked forward to it I remember being totally disappointed. The plot was weak and full of holes. Yes James Garner was the highlight of the show and it was great to see him as Bret again. But Charles Frank, who was going to star in the series this pilot was filmed for never seemed to fit into the role. Add to that the ""reunion"" of Bret & Bart Maverik occurred when Bart (Jack Kelly) shows up with about 15 minutes left in the film.Overall I would pass on this unless you are a Bret Maverik freak and want everything that was ever filmed with James Garner in the role. If you're looking for a revival of the old 1957-1962 series you will be very disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28TOW5SZC1XRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013D8M4E#wasThisHelpful","R28TOW5SZC1XRR","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why do I keep starting a book series in the middle? Yes, some series' you can start in the middle and you get caught up pretty quickly. This was not one of them. By itself Harbor Island is a good, well written mystery with a lot of twists and turns. However there are brief references to previous books throughout that don't go into any real detail so you're left to ponder how they relate to current situations. The other problem with starting in the middle is you're not invested in the main characters and without strong and early character development it takes a while before you get into each person.As I said, it's a great mystery that almost can stand on it's own. But I would highly recommend starting at the beginning (Saint's Gate (Sharpe and Donovan)) although a prequel was written later (Rock Point: A Sharpe & Donovan Series prequel novella). Personally I haven't decided yet if I want to do that. But knowing what I know now that is the direction I would go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Y7YDENYZ3JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831653X#wasThisHelpful","R10Y7YDENYZ3JR","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I can't say I've read most of Terry Brooks Shannara books I have read enough to see the author has become somewhat formulaic in his efforts. It's one of the reasons I rarely pick up a Brooks book anymore. But occasionally I do revisit the land of Shannara like I would visit an old friend. There is something comforting about being reintroduced to familiar territory even if the story is a little predictable.This tale takes place about a 100-plus years after the end of the Dark Legacy series, which to be honest I didn't read. Paxon Leah discovers he's magically inclined and better yet; he also has the long-lost magical ""Sword of Leah"". His sister has been kidnapped so it's up to Paxon to rescue her. The story is straight forward and interesting, though not what I would call intense. It's also interesting to note that this appears to be a stand-alone novel as opposed to the typical Brooks trilogy.Overall a nice but typical Brooks-Shannara book. I would recommend it to the die-hard Terry Brooks fan. But also for someone like me who has read enough of his books to understand the lay-of-the-land. It's probably not the right book if you have not been previously introduced to the Shannara realm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7SAQIIGDR4WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540700#wasThisHelpful","R7SAQIIGDR4WF","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to Mark Sava by reading The Colonel's Mistake (A Mark Sava Spy Novel), which was the first book in the series. What I liked about it was that it was not trying to be a ""James Bond"" imitation. The author created a very different character, one who is highly trained and effective but far from the typical fictional spy. In my opinion ""SPY FOR HIRE"" is the best of the three books to date. I can't wait for book four.Sava is a former CIA section chief now out on his own. While he still has connections in the agency they are not always happy to hear from him. It's obvious he has made some enemies within the CIA who would be happy to take him down. We now find him in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan having been kicked out of his previous location of Baku, Azerbaijan. His live-in girlfriend, a former spy in her own right, has now started running a orphanage. A 2-year old child is dropped off at the site and then taken by force by two armed men. She contacts Sava who is able to rescue the child from the kidnappers. However this is only the beginning of the story that eventually drags Sava into butting heads with the CIA, Bahrain intelligence, the commander of the U.S. Naval station in  Bahrain, and the Bahrain  royal family. Before he can give up the child he feels he must find out the truth that makes him so special that members of the intelligence community are willing to destroy anyone in their way.The book is a page turner that is hard to put down. Adding to the depth of the plot, the story becomes very personal for Sava as events unfold that reveal his own past and what drove him to join the CIA in his youth. It is one of the many surprises in the book, in fact the biggest.I absolutely loved this book and am looking forward to the next installment. Highly recommended for anyone into realistic spy stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H09918LIACXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612183379#wasThisHelpful","R2H09918LIACXE","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I've been on the lookout for a nice effective foot massager that would be a good value.  Not a cheap, inexpensive one but a unit that does what it claims without being over priced. Not an easy task to say the least. I had the opportunity to try Ucomfy Acupressure Foot Massager and came away somewhat impressed.  It has a number of settings for heat and massage so it can be adjusted to preference.  However the unit is larger than expected and weighs about 15 pounds. The word that comes to mind is bulky.

Considering with the exception of baseball the school's sports program is basically a division two (maybe even three) program attempting to play division one and not being very successful I have to commend him for being a true fan. So in perusing the internet for something unique I stumbled on this unit. As stated in the title the head does not bobble from the body, the body bobbles from the stand. Not a big deal and actually kind of cool.

"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this as I was expecting a basic speaker with Bluetooth capability. I was getting it more for convenience so as long as it provided decent sound I would have been happy. However the Turtle Shell 2.0 exceeded all expectations tremendously. It really is hard to express how impressed I am with this device.Once charged (approximately 12 hours) it connects easily to any Bluetooth capable device. Once connected I started playing different types of music, from rock to jazz to classical, etc. I was blown away with the sound quality. It's one thing for a speaker to be able to play loud music without distortion but the Turtle Shell also excels on soft orchestral pieces as well. While not Bose-like quality it still has great clarity of sound. The range is promoted at 32 feet which may be pushing it just a bit. It comes close as long as there is a clear signal path. If you have a wall or two between the speakers and your Bluetooth device it drops to about 10 feet at best.Overall I would highly recommend this as a transportable speaker with wonderful sound. Great for the beach or just about anywhere you want to listen to your music library. Highly impressive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R225LHG9VS1TGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDDVDCW#wasThisHelpful","R225LHG9VS1TGA","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the first time in my life I chose jewelry off the internet. The picture truly shows the beauty of the piece and honestly the Sterling Silver Black and White Diamond Halo Pendant Necklace is gorgeous in person as well. At the current price it is also a nice value.However I do have one issue with it. It is small, very very small. I obviously knew that from the dimensions listed on the Amazon page (height 0.57 inches, width 0.31 inches) but I felt the pendent could carry that size off well. It really doesn't. Up close it is a beautiful piece. From a distance of just a foot or two you really lose how intricate the pattern is. Now mind you I'm not a jewelry expert. But in my opinion a small pendent should be able to be appreciated by someone you're having a conversation with. That is really not the case here.Overall for the price it's a nice piece of jewelry, one that will coordinate with a lot. I can see it being a nice gift for a casual friend. But it is so understated that to call it understated would be an understatement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WM79SBDY92WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW5OEJS#wasThisHelpful","R2WM79SBDY92WE","A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being a repeat traveler on international I decided the ""carry on"" that I had wasn't the best selection so going to various stores and trying many spinners/rollers I decided on this model.  The pluses that made this model the model of choice were several - among these1. this carry- on rolled much smoother than other models tested and sailed through cornering and even backing up - it is a no effort roller and in this regard earns a full 5 stars with the next nearest competitor earning only 3.5 stars for not doing well on corners2. the telescoping handle is a bit longer than most of the other models/makers tested - being tall this was the only carry-on of this size that didn't leave me feeling as though I was having to walk leaning over while using the suitcase3. the design is compact but at the same time provides sufficient room for an experienced traveler that is only going to be packing what is truly needed in a carryon suitcase4. price - the price of this model was about mid-point of the suitcases inspected with eye to purchase - least expensive was 69.99 while top price was 129.99 -- this model at the 80.00- 90.00 price point performed better in the various tests used in the store to determine which model to purchase.Each of the models tested were tested for rolling ease both forward as well as backwards also tested doing corners and ease of picking up the unit as if going onto a bus or train.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H3BPDPTDLNQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8MSPIU#wasThisHelpful","R2H3BPDPTDLNQI","A2TSULQ3JDAVJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSULQ3JDAVJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These cartridges do not seem to be able to blend the colors in the printing process -- instead of getting accurate colors the print job comes out with yellows and blues whereas the original image was neither yellow nor blue.In this reviewer's opinion if you are looking for color refills this product is a pass - the black seem to work better but are a bit lighter black than previous cartridges used","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCIWHWMPIBSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATGCG5W#wasThisHelpful","R1GCIWHWMPIBSL","A2TSULQ3JDAVJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSULQ3JDAVJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This travel guide has one advantage over many of the other travel guides on the market and that being that with the right mobile device maps and websites can be accessed directly from the guide.This reviewer has made several trips to London and found the guide while having some useful information also tended to be geared more for the first time traveler - providing information on such things as the various airports and transportation options for getting from the airport to London.  Again for the first time traveler there is somewhat useful information on the various modes of transportation offered while in London itself.  Covered in this section are oyster cards for the tube systems, as well as other options such as bus and taxi serviceThe first half of the book covers various hotels and the various airports that serve London unfortunately the reader is into the second half of the book before actually getting to information about London -- this was a negative for this reviewer especially with the extensive ""here are the best hotels"" section.  Better and more up to date information can be found on travel sites.A first time visitor I would give the book a 4 out of 5 stars with only real reservation being the somewhat awkward layout of the book.

"This book is an improvement on the two volumes which immediately proceeded this release but, there are several weaknesses that keep this book from being the brilliant storytelling of the early Mrs. Murphy and Tucker escapades.  In the earlier works Rita Mae Brown gave the reader the experience of ""being there"" in the story.  Mrs. Murphy, Tucker, and all the other animals seemed so lifelike as to almost expect a bark or meow.  This present work lacks that weaving of the tale so that the person reading leaves the everyday world and is suddenly transported to the town of Crozet, Virginia.The story is not a total lost but in comparing this work to the early works of Ms. Brown I would use the comparison of seeing still photographs of a movie against seeing the actual movie - you get the story line but, not the sense of being in the 'action"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24VP8VMCHLHFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HKXQROS#wasThisHelpful","R24VP8VMCHLHFG","A2TSULQ3JDAVJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSULQ3JDAVJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay depending on what you are looking for this would rate between a 2 and a 4 star rating.  The plus is that it does tend to give more useful vocabulary than many ""learn French"" audio courses - the first few lessons cover the vocabulary for transportation, money, hotel, and directions.  The negative is that the recording is strictly a vocabulary lesson - first the male voice indicates the word for example "" the bus"" and then the female voice repeats the French twice and it is on to the next word.If you are looking for a full French course this audio recording would rate a 2 star - it provides no grammar and seems to default to the masculine form of words when there are different endings for the word depending on how it is being used.If you have some background with languages other than your native tongue and wish to pick up vocabulary for visiting France this would earn a 4 star rating not a five in that it is this reviewer's opinion that both forms of words (where there is a different masculine and feminine ending) should be provided.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5AEMRFUD6HCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LJMJVK#wasThisHelpful","R5AEMRFUD6HCY","A2TSULQ3JDAVJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSULQ3JDAVJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very poor reference work - In this reviewer's opinion this book is a pass for several reasons.  The book provides no useful information regarding Children's Modern First editions - there is one short paragraph on each author individually but beyond that it is a 20 plus year old price guide.  Another major point that this author fails to provide is the significant variation of values of books depending on their condition,  The only breakdown beyond title of book is if the book was published by more than one press,  Using Michael Bond's book 'A Bear Called Paddington' the author of this book indicates 2 publishers - Collins and Houghton and assigns a 'G' Value price (60.00 ) to the Collins edition and a 'C' value for the Houghton edition ( £20.00 up to).For a collector of first editions condition is just about everything with a copy in fair condition bringing a value of less than 100.00 while a copy in fine condition can command thousands.  In the field of first editions this condition value is something that should have never been left out of the book,That said with the price guide being over 20 years old this text is a definite pass with an Internet search providing more accurate information","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7Y6RI54NQ3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0356157415#wasThisHelpful","RW7Y6RI54NQ3H","A2TSULQ3JDAVJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSULQ3JDAVJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Antique Collector's Club really delivers with this book..  The writing is such that the book is perfect for both the novice as well as the established collector.  The book contains many color photographs of specific pieces of ceramics identifying both by artist who created as well as factory who produced the item. In this reviewer's opinion a nice added touch is that the book also provides many examples of the ads that were put in magazines and newspapers for the items when the ceramics were first produced for sale.The book provides a through examination of what is Art Deco and how it developed in France and follows the artistic movement into the British pottery industry.The book is divided into partsPART  1 ------ ""An Introduction""  Which includes the following topics ""On  the European Background"", ""The British Background"",  ""New Ceramics for the New Way of Living"" , "" The Real of Imposters, and ""Modern Art for the Table"".PART  2 -------"" Established Factories""  -- which cover Wedgwood, Spode, Minton, Doulton Art Deco, and Moorcroft.PART  3  -------- ""The Smaller Pottery Companies "" ----- This section covers 19 of the smaller factories including Shelley, Carter,, Stabler, and Adams, Susie Cooper, Crown Devon, Mycott pottery and others.PART 4 ---------"" Less Well-Known Manufacturers""  This section is well organized and provides at least a paragraph concerning these lesser known factories with color illustrations where examples were available.  The lesser known manufacturers cover pages 227 to 251.The book focuses on the Art Deco Ceramics which were produced by the British pottery industry during the late 1920s into the early 1930s.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA5JTOSNAFOGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1851495444#wasThisHelpful","RA5JTOSNAFOGK","A2TSULQ3JDAVJK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TSULQ3JDAVJK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Career of Evil, the third installment in J. K. Rowling’s pseudonymous series about the detective with the unlikely name of Cormoran Strike, we learn a great deal more of Cormoran’s backstory and that of his intrepid sidekick, Robin Ellacott. The one-legged detective, formerly a military police investigator, turns out to have a long history of run-ins with very bad men. Ellacott, who began work with Cormoran as a temporary secretary, possesses both a natural ability as an investigator and an uncanny ability to get herself in very serious trouble. She also has a squeamish and jealous fiancee who will seemingly stop at nothing to make her quit the job.On the surface, Career of Evil is a traditional whodunit, with three chief suspects, all of them highly credible. It’s full of suspense, with twists and turns in the plot and unexpected revelations about the two leading characters. But the book morphs into a psychological thriller that demonstrates Rowling’s considerable depth of understanding of the evil that some men are capable of. The eerie spell that the novel casts is underlined by the often gruesome quotes that appear at the heading of each chapter from the songs of the band Blue Oyster Cult. Never much of a fan of popular music myself, I was unfamiliar with the group but now know enough to stay as far away as possible from its work.J. K. Rowling is, of course, the celebrated author of the phenomenal Harry Potter series, which has sold more than 400 million copies worldwide. In Career of Evil, and in The Cuckoo’s Calling and The Silkworm before it, she has demonstrated more than enough talent to cross over into adult fiction. As the series grows in length, it seems likely that the name Robert Galbraith, the pen name she insists on continuing to use, will come to be considered a worthy counterpart to Ian Rankin, Elizabeth George, Tana French, John Connally, and other writers whose novels of crime and punishment demonstrate considerable psychological depth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLV73L6DR2XD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106E2CO6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLV73L6DR2XD","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VIO3WW4EV99X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKO0L3A#wasThisHelpful","R1VIO3WW4EV99X","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty Girls is the story of three sisters, a marriage, and a gruesome crime. The characters are pretty. The story isn’t.The fulcrum of this tale is the long-ago disappearance of nineteen-year-old Julia Carroll, the oldest of three beautiful blonde sisters. The sheriff and police believe she ran away, but no one in the family believes that. Her disappearance has upended both her parents’ and her sisters’ lives, leading to the suicide of her father, the drug addiction of her youngest sister, Lydia, and the escapism of her mother. There are reverberations of this tragedy that extend to the present.Now, twenty-four years later, another attractive teenage blonde woman, Anna Kilpatrick, has disappeared. The parallel is obvious, but there is nothing whatsoever to link the two cases. Meanwhile, Julia’s younger sister, Claire, is with her husband, Paul Scott, when he is brutally murdered in an alleyway in Atlanta one evening. Now there are several cases to solve. Of course, there are connections among them — this is a crime novel, after all — but absolutely nothing is obvious, and the story about those connections is suspenseful to an extreme. Chances are, you’ll be kept guessing almost to the bitter end. Every one of the central characters has a secret, and they’re all likely to surprise you.Perhaps it’s a coincidence, but the author, Karin Slaughter, is also blonde and pretty. More to the point, she is an internationally bestselling author (30 million books sold) who is best known for fifteen excellent novels about crime and punishment in Georgia, featuring Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and/or Dr. Sara Linton. Pretty Girls is her twentieth book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TMX5SCBWNAQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VES8D6K#wasThisHelpful","R1TMX5SCBWNAQK","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How can you resist a writer who describes a vicious criminal like this: “Eddy Raintree’s photo stared at me out of his file with a face that had the moral depth and complexity of freshly poured cement.” Or who writes about “the redneck, coonass, peckerwood South,” referring to its inhabitants in this way: “Each morning they got up with their loss, their knowledge of who they were, and went to war with the rest of the world.”Are you getting the impression that James Lee Burke is an atypical thriller writer? Truth to tell, the man writes so well that, even if his novels weren’t so brilliantly plotted, I’d be tempted to read them just for the stellar prose. And A Stained White Radiance, the fifth book in Burke’s Dave Robicheaux series, reflects the same writerly attention to atmosphere and character development that I found in the first four.A Stained White Radiance — the title is taken from the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley — is a story about Klansmen, Nazis, and Mafia wiseguys. Years ago, Robicheaux served as a lieutenant in the Marines in Vietnam and as a police officer in the New Orleans Police Department. He’s past the half-century mark now and works as a deputy sheriff in rural New Iberia Parish, running a bait-tackle-and-lunch spot on the bayou on the side. Robicheaux is a fascinating character: tough, shrewd, relentless, with a powerful moral compass.Naturally, since these are books about crime and criminals, Robicheaux finds himself mixed up in extremely dangerous investigations. His cases invariably end up involving his former partner in the NOPD, Cletus Purcell, and complicate the life he lives with his wife (the second wife in the series) and young adopted Salvadoran daughter. Previous entries in the series embroiled him in cases involving the CIA, the DEA, and the New Orleans Mob. In A Stained White Radiance, the crime at the center of the investigation brings in the Mob (again), an American Nazi politician who is a David Duke lookalike, and an assortment of odious lowlife killers, wifebeaters, and other miscreants. The story is complex and brims over with suspense.

"If you’ve ever been exposed to Robert Reich’s “Wealth and Poverty” course at UC Berkeley, perhaps through the film Inequality for All, or heard him speak in public, you know that there are few people alive today who are his equal in the ability to explain complex economic and social issues so cogently and compellingly. And few indeed are as funny as he is, either: the man could make a go of a career with a standup act.capitalismHowever, there’s not a lot of humor in Saving Capitalism, Reich’s fifteenth book. In this brilliant long essay, the former U.S. Secretary of Labor takes on the economic issues of the day from a perspective that rarely comes to light in public discourse: he rejects the widespread assumption that a “free market” exists independent of government.“A market — any market — requires that government make and enforce the rules of the game,” Reich writes. The size of government, the preoccupation of the American Right for the past four decades, is a distraction from the reality that big corporations and the country’s wealthiest people have steadily rigged the rules that structure the economy — through lobbying, massive political contributions, and the courts. Society’s biggest challenge today, inequality in wealth and income, was the inevitable result of the steady shift of power to the “1%” from the rest of us, as Occupy Wall Street so famously pointed out. “The critical debate for the future is not about the size of government,” Reich adds; “it is about whom government is for.” This is a view of American society from 30,000 feet.Reich cites a study by two scholars who set out to gauge “the relative influence . . . of economic elites, business groups, mass-based interest groups, and average citizens.” The study concluded, “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.” In other words, everything you ever feared about the influence of the 1% is true.As Reich explains in a particularly enlightening chapter, “The Decline of Countervailing Power,” the principal reason why Wall Street, the corporations, and the superrich have managed to enrich themselves at the expense of the middle class and the working poor is that the counterweight to what we call the 1% today has steadily withered away since the 1970s. Reich refers to the “interest groups and membership organizations — clubs, associations, political parties, and trade unions — to which politicians were [once] responsive.”The most potent of these factors was, of course, the labor movement. Following World War II, labor stood toe-to-toe with Big Business when it came to employees’ wages and working conditions and wielded huge influence in Washington. As we’re so painfully aware, that is far from the case today — but the decline of organized labor didn’t happen by accident. It was engineered beginning in the early 1970s by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and their Republican allies, working from the top down through the courts, the Congress, and state governments across the country. Reich doesn’t tell this story, perhaps because it’s so well known.Saving Capitalism should be required reading for every American who wishes to understand the way our society works today. Unfortunately, though the book has already begun to climb on the bestseller lists, we can be sure that will never happen in an era when a megalomaniacal reality TV star is topping the polls in the Republican presidential primary competition.Robert B. Reich served three presidents — Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton — in the course of a long and distinguished career in academia and government. Currently he is Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CMFM3ANIMZBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKVWPG4#wasThisHelpful","R2CMFM3ANIMZBG","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"H.G. Wells in War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and countless other authors and filmmakers have imagined what First Contact with an alien race might be like. Get ready now for Saturn Run by John Sandford and Ctein, which paints a picture that’s entirely different from anything else you’re likely to have come across.This book is full of surprises — so many that merely to summarize the plot would be to spoil the story. Suffice it to say that this tale, which begins in the year 2067, describes humanity’s first contact with civilization from beyond the Solar System. However, Saturn Run is “hard” science fiction, based on proven science and engineering, with as little speculation as possible.Because of Sandford’s skill in plotting and character development, the novel is a superior example of the genre. However, for a klutz like me with zero mechanical ability and only the most rudimentary understanding of science, I found myself getting bogged down in what seemed to be interminable passages about the technical side of the story. Sandford and Ctein could have been a lot kinder to general readers like me by taking a red pencil to most of that and compressing the book into a shorter and faster-moving story.John Sandford — a pen name for John Roswell Camp — is one of America’s best-selling crime writers. He’s the author of forty-two novels and three books of nonfiction (Sandford is a former journalist). Ctein, who looks like a refugee from Game of Thrones, is a photographer (he calls himself an artist) and an English and Physics graduate of CalTech who has written more than 500 articles.In a lengthy Authors’ Note at the conclusion of Saturn Run, the two men go into considerable detail to explain the scientific basis of virtually all the technical aspects of their novel. Apparently, Sandford had the original idea for the novel, and Ctein supplied the scientific know-how. I got the impression that Sandford bent over backwards to give Ctein equal time — or, rather, an equal number of pages. The book could have benefited greatly from a less even-handed division of labor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IYHC8X0UHISV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USMCJX6#wasThisHelpful","R3IYHC8X0UHISV","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I’d read enough about World War II and the Holocaust at least to understand what was most important about each of these interlocked, milestone events in the history of the human race. I hadn’t. In Jay Winik’s book, 1944, I learned a great deal, especially about the Nazis’ so-called Final Solution. I recognized the names of the key players, of course — it’s impossible to live through the aftermath of that tragic era and read the news without absorbing those names — but it had never before made clear to me that Hitler and the SS became truly frenzied about exterminating the Jews of Europe only in the final stages of the war, when it was obvious to anyone (except perhaps Hitler himself) that Nazi Germany had lost.I also found it illuminating to read the sad history of the U.S. response to the murder of European Jews. I’d been aware that many officials in the State Department were overtly anti-Semitic — but I’d had no idea of the deliberate steps they took to sabotage any action by FDR’s White House to save at least some of the Jews. Winik recounts this story in excruciating detail in 1944: “the State Department was now using the machinery of government to prevent, rather than facilitate, the rescue of the Jews,” he writes.  “The fear seemed to be, not that the Jews would be marched to their deaths, but that they would be sent to the Allied nations.” Now I know that the Department has the blood of more than a million people staining its already sad record of amorality: yes, in the absence of the obfuscation, foot-dragging, and bureaucratic nonsense from key members of the Department, more than a million lives could have been saved.For much of the war, Roosevelt himself was complicit in this policy. I’d known that. But now I know how quickly he was able to move once he’d been pushed to action. As Winik writes, “He could never quite see beyond the exigencies of winning the war and crafting the postwar structure of peace.”With that said, however, 1944 is a curious book. For starters, whoever titled the book did not have its contents in mind: I suspect the marketing people at the book’s publisher, thinking that 1944 would sell better than a book entitled FDR and the Holocaust. Which is really the subject of this book. In fact, the events that truly took place in the year 1944 occupy relatively few pages.The errant title is just one of the problems I had with 1944. I also found myself confused on many occasions because the author jumped around in time without making clear that he was about to do so. To reorient myself, I was forced to re-read paragraphs that didn’t seem to make sense because they were out of sequence.The author, Jay Winik, is a popular “public historian.” Trained at Yale and the London School of Economics, he has written three major nonfiction works. 1944 is the most recent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25G3NPH8VXTJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434HS4#wasThisHelpful","R25G3NPH8VXTJ6","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The King David story has been told not just in the Bible but countless other times over the three millennia since he reigned over Israel and Judah. Perhaps never before, though, has any author plumbed so deeply into the complex personality that comes to light from Biblical sources and told the tale so even-handedly of his life during the seventy years from birth to death.In The Secret Chord, Geraldine Brooks has portrayed David as both saint and sinner, poet and warrior, doting father and pitiless murderer — a man whose kingdom spanned all the territory from Egypt to Mesopotamia. (Today’s nation of Israel is but a splinter carved from that vast expanse of land.)  This book may be the final word on David; it’s difficult to envision any other author examining the man’s life with such care, compassion, and attention to detail. The narrator of this story is the prophet Nathan (Natan), who served King David as both seer and political adviser. Nathan’s tale is told in an out-of-sequence series of flashbacks that creates the maximum suspense and turns the book into a compulsive reading experience.Some, though not all, scholars believe King David was a mythical figure who figures in history only through the legends created in the years following his supposed reign. Does it matter to us whether the man was real or only a myth? I don’t think so. The true value in David’s story lies in what moral lessons we can take from the decisions he made and the consequences that followed.Geraldine Brooks is an Australian-born journalist who has made a life in the United States. She won the Pulitzer Prize for an earlier historical novel, March, about the exploits in the Civil War of the father of the girls in Little Women. The other three novels she’s written have explored the years of the Black Plague in England, the saga of the Sarajevo Haggadah, and the life of the first Native American to attend Harvard College. She has also written three nonfiction books. Earlier, Brooks was a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, covering crises in Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FN6589WSA7NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI02CHS#wasThisHelpful","R2FN6589WSA7NC","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’re under the age of 45 or so, it would be surprising if you had any active memory of Watergate. More likely, your knowledge of the scandal comes from history books. Certainly, though, if you were born before, say, 1965 — or, for sure, before 1960 — the events of those tragic days are probably burned into your memory. It would have been difficult indeed for anyone following the news during that awful time not to remember at least some of the names of the leading characters in the scandal: Richard Nixon himself, Woodward & Bernstein, John Mitchell, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, Jeb Magruder, John Dean, G. Gordon Liddy, Howard Hunt, Judge Sirica, Senator Sam Ervin . . . and I could go on. How surprising it is, then, that an historical novelist, Thomas Mallon, could weave those characters into a credible story and conjure up all the suspense, the tension, and the excitement of those events in a novel.In Watergate, Mallon artfully uses a third-person narrator to shift from one character to another, eventually taking the reader into the minds of many of the key players in those events of 1972 to 1975. But four true-to-life characters stand out, because Mallon keeps coming back to their inner dialogue again and again: Pat Nixon, Rose Mary Woods, Fred LaRue, and Alice Roosevelt Longworth. Pat Nixon was, of course, the President’s wife. Woods was the President’s private secretary who gained notoriety after she erased a lengthy passage on a tape recording that might have incriminated Nixon. LaRue was a wealthy Southerner who served as a bagman for John Mitchell when he ran the Committee to Re-Elect the President (familiarly known to most of us then as CREEP). And Longworth was the 88-year-old daughter of Theodore Roosevelt, an enfant terrible as a young woman and hell on wheels as an old lady. Mallon’s portrayal of Alice Longworth is especially colorful and a joy to behold.Much of the novel revolves around two extramarital love affairs: Pat Nixon’s with a New York lawyer, and Fred LaRue’s with a conservative Southern woman who turned later in life to progressive politics and served on the staff of the Democratic National Committee. I have no idea whether either of these affairs was based on fact. However, they are both essential to the novel, and one of them is central to a twist in the plot that nicely wraps up the fictional story.Mallon faithfully represents the conservative perspective of nearly all the characters in Watergate. It’s difficult to tell whether that perspective is close to his  own.Thomas Mallon is the author of eight books of historical fiction and seven books of nonfiction. He is much honored for his writing and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2012.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGJH3IHBTAT3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050DIW9S#wasThisHelpful","RGJH3IHBTAT3P","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOW I UNDERSTAND why so many people are crazy about Donna Leon’s detective fiction! Death in a Strange Country, published in 1993, was the second in her series featuring Commissario Guido Brunetti of the Venice Police, and it’s nothing short of brilliant. I’d made the mistake of reading her latest offering in the series, the twenty-fourth, Falling in Love, which I found unworthy of her reputation. Death in a Strange Country redeems her in my eyes.The story in this novel revolves around two murder mysteries and a robbery, all of which Brunetti is assigned to solve. A young man, probably an American, is found dead floating in the water of a Venice canal. He may, or may not, be the victim of a robbery. Later, a young American doctor at a U.S. Army base outside a town near Venice is found dead in her quarters, dead of a heroin overdose. Finally, the Venice palace of a Milano industrialist is burgled and its owner sent to the hospital from a beating. In all three cases, Brunetti smells a story that would rule out the obvious explanation. His investigation of all these mysteries is hemmed in by his boss, a feckless and lazy Sicilian with a fancy title who is interested only in pleasing the powers that be and taking credit for any discoveries made by defying his orders.Donna Leon has lived in Venice for twenty-five years. Her books have been translated into many languages — but not, at her request, into Italian. The true subject of Death in a Strange Country is corruption. Leon’s depiction of Italian society and especially the Italian criminal justice system is unsparing.

Just how badly broken it is comes into sharp focus in a remarkable new book by Bryan Stevenson, who was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship (“genius grant”) at an early age for his work defending prisoners victimized by the system — work he has continued for two decades since then.Stevenson’s perspective on the issue is clear: “we have to reform a system of criminal justice that continues to treat people better if they are rich and guilty than if they are poor and innocent.” Amen to that! And if you don’t agree with that statement, you’ll be sure to reach the same conclusion if you read Just Mercy with an open mind.Just Mercy revolves around the relationship between the author and Walter McMillian, an African-American businessman in Alabama who was wrongly imprisoned on death row for six years. McMillian had been convicted on the strength of absurdly contrived evidence in a criminal justice system that could most charitably be called unmerciful. Interspersed among the chapters detailing Stevenson’s long and arduous campaign that led to McMillian’s release are less detailed stories of dozens of other victims of a system that is based on the premise that “capital punishment means ‘them without the capital get the punishment.'”Stevenson is a law professor at NYU as well as the director of the Equal Justice Institute, a nonprofit law firm he founded in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1989. Though Just Mercy is built around the tragic story of Walter McMillian, Stevenson weaves into the story an abundance of relevant information about a host of issues related to capital punishment: mass incarceration, racism, overspending on jails and prisons, the rise of private prisons, and the incarceration of the mentally ill (“over fifty percent of prison and jail inmates in the United States have a diagnosed mental illness”). Each of these developments is a factor in the flagrant injustice of the system. In a more general sense, the problem can be seen as the failure of the legal profession to rise to the defense of the people who need their help the most.As Stevenson concludes, “My work with the poor and the incarcerated has persuaded me that the opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice . . . The true measure of our [national] character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.” By that measure, our character is sorely lacking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UPYK29Y55BIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYWVYLY#wasThisHelpful","R1UPYK29Y55BIG","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Opium is at center-stage in Flood of Fire, which traces the consequential history of the British, their Indian allies, and the mandarins ruling China just before and during the First Opium War. Though it occurred nearly two centuries ago, this historical event is worth revisiting today for its lasting influence on today’s Chinese rulers, whose memories are vivid about the humiliation visited on their country by the British, other Europeans, and (later) the Americans. Few of us in America today can appreciate the intense feelings this nineteenth-century conflict continues to conjure up in the minds of educated people in China.Flood of Fire is the concluding novel in the monumental Ibis Trilogy by that Indian giant of historical fiction, Amitav Ghosh. It’s the sequel to Sea of Poppies and River of Smoke. Taken together, the three books tell the story of the Indian opium-trading ship Ibis and the colorful, polyglot personalities who are connected to it, during the momentous four-year period from 1838 to 1841.Flood of Fire, as well as the two novels that preceded it, is remarkable in two ways. First, the author’s documentary research was exhaustive and clearly required years of reading old documents and traipsing from one library to another: in an Epilogue, Ghosh includes eight pages of references tightly packed together into paragraphs. Second, Ghosh’s love of language is palpable, with every character in this novel displaying a distinctive mode of speech that seems to reflect accurately the way people spoke in mid-nineteenth-century India and China.The principal characters in this third volume in the Ibis Trilogy all appear in the earlier stories as well: Kesri Singh, a havildar or sergeant in the military service of the British East India Company; Zachary Reid, a young mulatto from Baltimore who begins his career as a ship’s carpenter; Benjamin Burnham, the fabulously wealthy opium trader who owns the Ibis; Burnham’s wife, Catherine, who lives under the shadow of a dark secret; Shireen Modi, a Parsi (Zoroastrian) mother of two in Bombay who is now the widow of Seth (“sir”) Bahram Moddie, a penniless youth who had risen to the top of the opium trade by taking audacious chances; Neel Rattan Halder, the former Raja of Raskhali, who has become an adviser to the Chinese in their standoff with the British; Zadig Bey, an Armenian trader close to Seth Bahram; and assorted other soldiers, sailors, traders, officials, and hangers-on. It’s what Hollywood used to call “a cast of thousands.” This is an immensely complex story and sheer pleasure to read.At times, Flood of Fire is hilarious. There are extended passages about masturbation which highlight the Victorian obsession with sex and brilliant examples of the malaproprisms that result from people attempting to communicate in their third language, or their fourth. For example, “‘You must meet me at Strand, with money-purse, at 5 p. m. Kindly do not be late — I will be punctually expectorating.'” It takes a writer with the talent of Amitav Ghosh to make this stuff up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27M27LQQ1Y880/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S54VT5I#wasThisHelpful","R27M27LQQ1Y880","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If we can take Henning Mankell’s word for it, Roseanna is the granddaddy of all contemporary Scandinavian detective fiction — and who better than Mankell, author of the celebrated Kurt Wallander series, can make this claim, as he does in the Introduction to this intriguing detective novel? Originally published in 1965, Roseanna was the first in a series of ten mystery novels written by the husband-and-wife team of Maj Sjowall (the wife) and Per Wahloo (the husband). The last of the series, The Terrorists, appeared in 1975.In reintroducing the Martin Beck series to a contemporary audience, Mankell points out that Sjowall and Wahloo, both Marxists, were the first Scandinavian crime writers to recognize the social setting in which their stories were set. “They realized that there was a huge, unexplored territory,” Mankell writes, “in which crime novels could form the framework for stories containing social criticism.” However, though this perspective may be evident in the later novels in the Martin Beck series, social criticism is difficult to find in Roseanna. Much more obvious are the pains the authors took to underline the tedium and wasted time and effort of real-life policing (in contrast to the accelerated progress we see from most crime writers). Roseanna is, above all, a classic police procedural, tracing in meticulous detail the efforts over many years of Beck and his colleagues in the Swedish police as well as an American detective to solve a devilishly complex murder case.Martin Beck is a First Detective Inspector with the Homicide Bureau of the Swedish National Police, based in Stockholm. Summing up their physical description of the man, the authors write “Some women would say he was good looking but most of them would see him as quite ordinary.” Beck treats his wife in a way that today we would call disdainful and sexist, but that was nothing out of the ordinary in the 1960s, in Sweden or anywhere else in the developed nations of the world.Sjowall and Wahloo write in a matter-of-fact style devoid of literary flourishes. Every once in a while they offer up a clever remark: “7 January arrived and looked like 7 January. The streets were full of grey, frozen people without money.” This is about as far as the authors go in entertaining the reader. Instead, by focusing on the most minute details from the very beginning, Sjowall and Wahloo attempt — and largely succeed — in conveying the frustration felt by the detectives involved in the case.If you’re among that minority of readers of detective fiction who favor police procedurals, you should love Roseanna. If you’re looking for a fast-paced thriller, you won’t find it here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134ZB3UEDHPH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047747EW#wasThisHelpful","R134ZB3UEDHPH5","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where is the line between peaceful and legitimate protest and terrorism? Though the answer to that question might seem obvious, it’s not — and Berkeley-based author Steve Masover’s debut novel, Consequence, explores that territory with skill and sophistication.Consequence tells a tale dominated by three characters: Christopher, a brilliant writer and researcher who lives in a small San Francisco collective dedicated to peaceful action against genetic modification; “Romulus,” a computer hacker who is prepared to participate in a violent protest against GMOs; and “Chagall,” who clearly believes that nothing short of violence can turn the tide on this issue that all of them believe threatens the survival of the human race. The three have connected anonymously online to collaborate on a high-profile protest that they hope will break through the public’s apathy about GMOs. Apparently all men, the three are unaware of each other’s identities, and they go to great lengths to keep things that way. The codenames are Christopher’s shorthand for identifying his co-conspirators.Masover sets his tale in late 2003 and early 2004, during the period when the American public is coming to recognize the disastrous consequences of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The photos of American’s brutal mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib come to light in the course of this story. Against this backdrop, which illustrates the vast scope of officially condoned violence, Masover dramatizes the contrast between the three conspirators’ violent protest and the nonviolence of the Triangle, the collective of which Christopher is a member.While Christopher, Romulus, and Chagall are exchanging secure communications online to plan their action, the members of the Triangle are making extensive preparations for a dramatic action of their own. During an upcoming conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco for molecular biologists engaged in genetic research, the Triangle is getting set to stop traffic on the San Francisco Bay Bridge to hang an enormous banner high on its superstructure. Alternating chapters describe the two plans as they develop.Consequence is a talky novel, with characters exchanging highly intellectual and well-edited remarks about the issues at the heart of the story. The author is also extremely well-informed, not just about the topic of GMOs and the technical aspects of cybersecurity but also about the mechanics of terrorism. It’s all a little frightening, really. If you’re inclined to discount the threat of GMOs, you probably shouldn’t read this book.Steve Masover is a life-long activist. A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and an employee of the University since 2007 in its information technology division, Masover has published short fiction and collaborated on a screenplay for a documentary about the anti-apartheid movement. This is his first novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONFBBR0P7NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01527I9XU#wasThisHelpful","RONFBBR0P7NM","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scandinavia exports as many thriller writers as Japan exports cars — or so it would seem. Here comes Camilla Lackberg on the heels of . . . well, if you read crime fiction, you’re familiar with the authors of the many Scandinavian thrillers that have cracked the U.S. bestseller lists. (Oh, okay: Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell, Jo Nesbo, Jussi Adler-Olsen, Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall . . . need I go on?) And, even though I’ve just discovered Ms. Lackberg, it turns out that The Drowning is the sixth book in her series about small-town police detective Patrik Hedstrom, and her novels about him and his travails and triumphs are of the sort that are marketed here as “international bestsellers.” Which means, I suppose, that they were translated into German, French, and maybe Italian and bought (perhaps read, too) by lots of Europeans.So, let’s take a look at Detective Hedstrom and the world he inhabits, as depicted in The Drowning. He seems to be the equivalent of an English police inspector, with less senior detectives under his command. They show varying degrees of competence and reliability, but Hedstrom’s boss, the police chief, is a lazy, headline-hogging incompetent. Hedstrom’s wife, a writer of true-life crime books, is probably at least as good a detective as he is, and she seems bound to prove it by surreptitiously digging into her husband’s files at night and meddling in his investigations. So far, so good.However, Hedstrom doesn’t come into the picture in The Drowning until well into the story. Before that point, we’re immersed in what is clearly shaping up to be a psychological thriller of large proportions. A popular, forty-something man in town goes missing at the same time as a close friend of his is gaining nationwide renown for his brilliant first novel. Meanwhile, the novelist is agonizing over mysterious, unsigned letters he’s been receiving at intervals — and someone (else?) in town appears to be having nightmares about a tragic event in his (or her?) past. Both men (as well as the dreamer?) are friends of . . . you guessed it: Patrik Hedstrom and his very pregnant and very inquisitive wife.Lackberg shows great skill in maintaining the energy and suspense of this complex, offbeat tale. I found the resolution to become obvious, but only about two-thirds of the way through the book, which is better than in the case of most crime novels I’ve read. This book is a superior effort that lives up to (most of) the extravagant language in the jacket copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M2I1SGLJ6SZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXPW7ES#wasThisHelpful","R3M2I1SGLJ6SZF","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After enjoying the first three books in Cara Black’s series of detective novels featuring Aimee Leduc, I found Murder in the Bastille to be disappointing. Granted, Aimee and her partner, Rene, were their usual engaging selves, the portrait of a bureaucratic and sometimes dysfunctional Paris police force rang true, and the plot was devilishly complex. But the historical weightiness of the first three books was missing. The Holocaust was the backdrop for Black’s first book in the series, Murder in the Marais. The second, Murder in Belleville, centered on a 1990s French refugee crisis not that much different from today’s. And the violent, home-grown European terrorism of the 1970s was the centerpiece of Murder in the Sentier, the third novel in the series. Though there were echoes of history that sounded in the background in Murder in the Bastille as well, the book was a pedestrian murder mystery by comparison with the earlier entries.Is it possible that Black ran out of French historical crises after her first three novels? I hope not: I’m on to #5 and looking forward to more. All told, there are fourteen Aimee Leduc stories to date. Black, a best-selling, San Francisco-based mystery writer, has been writing an average of nearly one per year since 1998.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAGAW72OMQQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HYHATE#wasThisHelpful","R3HAGAW72OMQQQ","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve ever thought much about money, you may have wondered what gives it its value, especially if you’re aware that Richard Nixon took the dollar off the Gold Standard more than forty years ago. And if you’re at all involved in the world of finance and investment, you know perfectly well that very little money is tangible in any way: it’s almost all electrons, whizzing around the Internet at unspeakable speeds — and the ways in which we store and transfer money (bank accounts, credit and debit cards, checks, cash) are all notoriously vulnerable to loss, theft, and misappropriation. Wouldn’t it stand to reason in this age of the Internet that there should be a better, faster, more secure, and more reliable way to transact business?That’s the thinking that has led many venturesome individuals to create alternative currencies. Traditionally — and unsurprisingly — most of these alternative currencies have been paper-based. (Yes, there are dozens of them.) In recent times, though, especially since the advent of the Internet, innovative thinkers have been programming computers to create entirely new forms of money that are completely divorced from material reality. After all, there are just three fundamental functions that money must perform:  “providing a medium of exchange, a unit for measuring the cost of goods, and an asset where value can be stored.” And none of these requires that money must be something you can hold in your hands.Enter Bitcoin, the best-known of a long line of software-based alternative currencies. Introduced in 2009 by someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto (probably a pseudonym), Bitcoin has attracted more media attention than all the other alternative approaches combined. The early adopters of Bitcoins were self-styled libertarians who saw the new currency as a way to free society from the grip of government everywhere. However, Bitcoins didn’t rise to the attention of many others until one early adopter — an anarchist, really, despite what he might have called himself — set up a website for drug dealers and arms traffickers called Silk Road. The enormous traffic in Bitcoins created by Silk Road raised the level of activity manyfold and helped Bitcoin gain wider acceptance.Later, more mainstream investors and entrepreneurs became involved in the Bitcoin phenomenon, and government agencies inevitably took notice. “The unmistakable irony of these wild days,” writes Nathaniel Popper in Digital Gold, “was that a technology that had been designed, in no small part, to circumvent government power was now becoming largely driven by and dependent on the attitudes of government officials.” Not just in the United States, either. The Chinese government cast an even more jaundiced eye on Bitcoins than the U.S. government.As the word about Bitcoin spread through the financial marketplace, word leaked out that JPMorgan “began secretly working with the other major banks in the country . . . on a bold experimental effort to create [a system based on the technology behind Bitcoin] that would be jointly run by the computers of the largest banks and serve as the backbone for a new, instant payment system that might replace Visa, MasterCard, and wire transfers.” In other words, what began as a libertarian and anarchist effort to seize power from the hands of  the Federal Reserve Bank, Wall Street, and the other arbiters of our financial lives might end up granting them even more power!“[T]he system was set up so that, like gold,” Popper explains, “Bitcoins would always be scarce — only 21 million of them would ever be released — and hard to counterfeit. . . With a hard cap on the number of Bitcoins, users could reasonably believe that Bitcoins would become harder to get over time and thus would go up in value.” In fact, though Bitcoins were worthless when first created, the going price at this writing is now $235, having topped out last year at nearly $1,200. The price of Bitcoins is volatile, to say the least.Just in case you’re thinking of taking a flyer and filling your piggy bank with Bitcoins, you might ponder its vulnerability. “Bitcoin itself is always one big hack away from total failure,” as Popper writes.On several occasions, hackers have raised questions about the security of the currency: the holes they uncovered have been plugged, but it’s anyone’s guess whether there’s more to be discovered.Digital Gold represents a thorough job of research. Its picture of the many strange characters who have played seminal roles in the development of Bitcoin is colorful — worth reading for its entertainment value alone. If you’re interested in finance and money, you’ll enjoy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N8LWSCMY0MGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6TZLOU#wasThisHelpful","R1N8LWSCMY0MGP","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"X is my first exposure to Sue Grafton’s popular and long-running series of alphabetical novels featuring the private detective Kinsey Millhone. It’s the latest volume, the twenty-fourth in the series, and I’m not quite sure what to think of it. The jury’s out.Among the many conceits of contemporary detective fiction is the cynical, hard-bitten fighter for justice who is equally proficient with a computer keyboard and her fists. Kinsey Millhone is different. Fists? No way: she doesn’t seem to have a lot of fight in her. And she is most definitely not cynical. In fact, the only way in which she seems predictable is what others might call a soft spot: the overwhelming urge she feels to right wrongs, whether or not there’s money in it for her. Not only does she appear to be indifferent to money — she goes through all the experiences described in this novel without earning a cent. And she’s not a great guesser, either, so you can write off “woman’s intuition.”X is set in 1989, when Kinsey Millhone is thirty-eight years old. As is all too often the case in detective fiction, she is drawn into seemingly impenetrable mysteries because friends of hers are involved. One is the eighty-nine-year-old man who is her landlord; she lives in a converted garage behind his house. His problem is that he’s a fanatic about saving water — this is Southern California, in the midst of an earlier drought than the one that afflicts us today — and his water bills are mysteriously high. The other friend is the widow of a detective with whom Kinsey worked many years ago — a man she’d thought was a scumbag. The IRS has called the widow to ask that she present records she destroyed many years earlier.Granted, in solving these two seemingly innocuous mysteries, Kinsey eventually uncovers shocking crimes. But it all just seems a little too unlikely.Sue Grafton has been writing her alphabet series of novels (A Is for Alibi, etc.) about Kinsey Millhone since 1982 and has won several literary awards along the way. There are echoes of the work of the late, great Ross Macdonald in her writing, beginning with the Southern California town of Santa Teresa where Kinsey is based. However, her father, C. W. Grafton, was also a detective novelist.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217WJQOLR4Y1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZKJA#wasThisHelpful","R217WJQOLR4Y1L","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finally figured it out. Earlier in life, when I devoured science fiction by the carload, I paid little attention to details such as references to contemporary culture, products, or figures of speech. I’d suspended disbelief, of course. Now these things jump out at me. They grate. And I found myself on edge at a number of points in Hugh Howey’s Beacon 23 because it was too much of a stretch to believe that characters in the late twenty-third century would talk like people in 2015 or that products such as WD-40 (the iconic all-purpose household lubricant) would show up in the narrative. But now I’ve got it! What’s going on, really, is not that the author is attempting to write a story that we will believe is “true.” Instead, he’s relating a long, complex dream that could easily incorporate elements that are extremely unlikely to be found together. You’ve dreamed dreams like that, right?So, tell me, Hugh: is this the way I should look on your work? I’ll say that I enjoy your writing very much — your humor, your lively imagination, your skill in laying out a plot. I was alternately amused and intrigued as I read through Beacon 23. I enjoyed your battle-scarred, empathic anti-hero and the odd characters who came on the scene with him. I found the many references to aliens imaginative to the point of implausibility, but they were certainly entertaining. I imagine you had a lot of fun writing this novel. I hope so, anyway.Beacon 23 is a novel that first appeared online as five Amazon singles, assembled only later into the Omnibus Edition. Very clever, that. Probably very profitable, too.Hugh Howey is one of the crop of the younger generation of science fiction writers who has found success in the newly fractured publishing environment. He favors writing in chunks. Howey’s breakthrough was the five-part dystopian novel, Wool, followed by a three-part prequel entitled Shift. I’ve recently read and reviewed both books. I loved them both.

"It was the era of the Cold War, Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, John Le Carre, Don Draper’s Mad Men, and, of course, nonstop consumption of alcohol. The Berlin Wall was new, and the capitals of divided Germany — Bonn and Berlin –teemed with spies. “It was like postwar Vienna in the movies,” Ross Thomas writes in The Cold War Swap, “where Orson Welles went around muttering so low and fast you couldn’t understand what he was saying except that he was up to no good.” Swimming in this cauldron of intrigue we meet “Mac” McCorkle, veteran of World War II in the Burma Theater and now co-owner of a pub in Bonn with a shadowy, polyglot character named Mike Padillo.Padillo, “half Estonian, half Spanish,”  speaks six languages like a native and works in some mysterious capacity for an unnamed American agency (not the CIA) that is somehow involved in espionage and possibly murder. He disappears from the pub for weeks on end on assignment in other cities throughout Europe. In The Cold War Swap, McCorkle suddenly finds himself caught up in one of Padillo’s capers behind the Berlin Wall. Need I add that danger is afoot? Some sort of prisoner swap is about to go down in East Berlin, Padillo is in the middle of it, and now so is McCorkle.

The Cold War Swap, published in 1966, was the first novel he wrote after a career as a PR man and political strategist.

"Practically nothing works. Government, police protection, buildings, cars, roads, appliances, telephones — whatever: they’re either falling apart, damaged beyond repair, or, if you’re lucky, barely functioning. Welcome to North Korea in the 21st century, where nothing gets done without a bribe, and it’s even difficult to find a cup of tea when you want one.Just for example, “The train to Pyongyang was late. Not like some places, where a late train means twenty minutes, even an hour on a bad day. This train didn’t come that day, or the next.”Based in Pyongyang, the country’s largest city and its capital, Inspector O — yes, his name really is “O,” which is a common Korean surname, though more often spelled Oh, Oe, or Au — is an investigator with the Ministry of People’s Security, his territory a large swath of the capital. (The Ministry is apparently what would be called the police in other countries.) Shortly after O’s boss, Chief Inspector Pak, meets with the secretive “Captain” (really, Colonel) Kim, from Military Security Command, Inspector O’s reasonably predictable life begins to unravel. It soon emerges that a high-stakes feud is underway between Colonel Kim and Deputy Director Kang from the rival Investigations Department, an agency that seems to be analogous to the CIA. And there seems to be an uneasy connection between Kang and Pak. For starters, then, we’ve learned about three warring police agencies, and the word “warring” is no exaggeration. It transpires that “something big” is about to happen, something that seemingly will alter the destiny of all three agencies and prove to be a matter of life and death for O, Pak, and Kang. It has something to do with Japan, but we’re never quite sure what.Yes, it’s all monumentally confusing, and the story doesn’t get any easier to understand until near the end. The author spoon-feeds us the backstory through a series of conversations between Inspector O and an Irishman named Richie Molloy, who is apparently an officer of Britain’s MI6. Molloy has cornered O in a hotel room in Budapest or Prague while O was on a mission for Pak and is recording his account of Wang’s comings and goings. These conversations alternate with the slowly unfolding story of O’s investigation into a murder that doesn’t actually take place until midway through the book! Apparently, Wang has something going for himself in Finland, and the murdered man is a Finn, as is an attractive young woman who turns up in O’s investigation. Why there should be so many Finns showing up in North Korea is beyond me. Yes, confusing.Perhaps, though, that confusion is really the point of the tale. As Inspector O declares in an exchange with Richie, “where I live, we don’t solve cases. What is a solution in a reality that never resolves itself into anything definable? . . . I don’t connect dots. Unnecessary, because I know that nothing is a straight line. Everything is circles, overlapping circles that bleed into each other . . . For me, life consists of badly limited possibilities, but I know the parts are endlessly rearranged, always shifting, always changing. Nobody puts down their foot twice in the same place.

"Did I get your attention with that headline? Good. Now, what if I explain further that this is not simple one-on-one sex but three-way and five-way sex? Intrigued? Well, I hate to tell you this, but it’s not so exciting.For starters, this novel, the concluding entry in Octavia Butler’s Xenogenesis Trilogy (also packaged as Lilith’s Brood), follows the misadventures of one of Lilith’s innumerable offspring. It — because you can’t call it he, she, or he/she, since it’s a third, distinctive gender — is named Jodahs, a sibling of Akin, who was the protagonist in Adulthood Rites, the preceding novel in the trilogy. It is the product of a Human female (Lilith), a Human male (Lilith’s long-dead lover Joseph), and three Oankali, a male, a female, and an ooloi. (Don’t ask. Just know that the ooloi is the key to making the whole thing work.) Only by collaborating in a five-way reproductive process that is nowhere described, presumably out of a sense of delicacy, could Jodahs come into being. However, to the great surprise of its four living parents, Jodahs has not emerged as either a future male or a future female but as something entirely new: a “construct” — the product of Human and Oankali parentage — who grows into an ooloi-like being, though featuring both Human and Oankali characteristics.Confused? I understand. I was, too. Unfortunately, Imago is full of explanations like this — tediously so. After the startling strangeness of Dawn, the first novel in the trilogy, and the competent follow-up in Adulthood Rites, Imago is a disappointment. It’s practically all about sex — I kid you not! I yearned for more action and less talk about sex.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JD1UFATLGEUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HALNJW#wasThisHelpful","R1JD1UFATLGEUI","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forget James Bond. Six-foot-one, 250 pounds, with flaming red hair, Morten Storm is the real deal. This guy really did infiltrate al-Qaeda and operate at the highest levels of the network for many years. And, apparently, he’s still alive (somewhere) to tell the tale.If Agent Storm were a novel, you wouldn’t believe a word of it. It’s not. The co-authors wrote the book based on weeks of interviews and months of documentary research to confirm what they learned. In an author’s note that prefaces the text, they write that “What makes Morten Storm’s story unique is the extraordinary amount of audiovisual evidence and electronic communications he collected during his time as a spy, which both corroborate his story and enrich his account.”Much later, in Storm’s acknowledgment at the conclusion of the book, we learn that co-author Paul Cruickshank, a British journalist, “is now CNN’s terrorism analyst and the editor of a recent five-volume collection of scholarship on al-Qaeda.” Like Cruickshank, co-author Tim Lister had “reported on al-Qaeda terrorism and international security for many years.” And the book includes snapshots of much of the documentation that Storm so carefully collected over the years, which help to confirm the context surrounding the clandestine recordings of his conversations with his Western handlers.So much for any doubts about the credibility of this astonishing tale.Written as a first-person account, Agent Storm relates the experiences over a decade of a young Danish man who describes himself as, early in life, a “biker, boozer, and boxer.” Raised in a violent, alcohol-fueled home and a veteran of criminal gangs in adolescence, Morten Storm turned to Islam at the age of twenty-one and made his way with the fierce and sudden conviction of a convert into radical jihadist circles. Gradually drifting into the heart of al-Qaeda in Yemen in the late 1990s, Storm was seen as a valuable asset by the terrorist network and eventually given an audience with Anwar al-Awlaki. Awlaki was the radical American Muslim cleric who rose to head what became the most powerful arm of al-Qaeda following the death of Osama bin Laden many years later; he was widely considered to be the successor to Ayman al-Zawahari, the man who took over following bin Laden’s death. Eventually, Storm became a close and trusted aide to Awlaki. The cleric even entrusted him with the job of recruiting his third wife, a blonde Westerner, as well as funneling money and supplies to him and his followers (as directed by Western intelligence agencies). Awlaki, you may recall, was the first American to be targeted and killed by a US drone strike — and the authors make a very good case for demonstrating that Morten Storm provided the crucial link that led to the cleric’s assassination.This account of Storm’s evolving beliefs over the years, and his 180-degree turn into becoming a spy for Danish intelligence, MI5 and MI6, and the CIA, is an intensely suspenseful tale that stacks up to any novel of espionage as a cliffhanger. It is also a carefully measured condemnation of Danish intelligence and the CIA, and to a lesser extent of the twin British agencies — measured, because Storm is critical of no one more than himself. The details about distrust and conflict among the various agencies are worth the price of the book in their own right. (Hint: they thought little was wrong with undermining one another’s operations — and these were all allies.)If you’re looking for insight into the minds and mores of radical Islamists and a true account of how Western powers practice the craft of intelligence, Agent Storm is an eye-opening introduction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EANGJQW4KAKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JD07IJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3EANGJQW4KAKB","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“[W]hen physicists talk about reality with precision, they do it with formulas; when they discuss it in general, they sound like monks.”Welcome to the strange new world of quantum mechanics! A word of warning, though: stay away from The Flicker Men unless you have enough of a grounding in modern physics to understand the language physicists use; I do just barely, since I’m familiar with many of the words but grasp nothing of the underlying reality or the mathematics on which it’s based. (Yes, there are even a few opaque mathematical formulas in this very strange book.)In reality, this novel is really two books in one. In the first half, you’ll find yourself in the world of high-stakes physics research, with scientists engaging in abstruse conversations about quantum mechanics and its implications. (As you may be aware, quantum mechanics implies the impossible, but I won’t go into that here.) You’ll also witness what can only be described as discussions in which the characters confront the theological implications of their work. Much of this flew far over my head, of course, but it was engaging enough that I stuck with it to the halfway point in the book.Then something else happened, and The Flicker Men became a tension-filled, science fiction thriller, replete with brutally violent scenes and a mysterious quest that is set off by the research described in the first half of the book. The suspense never lets up even though the storyline is at times very difficult to follow.

"When you think of Southern writers, the names William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Robert Penn Warren, Tennessee Williams, Margaret Mitchell, James Dickey, and Harper Lee may come to mind. I’ve read many books by these and other illustrious authors from the American South, but none has called to mind a more evocative picture of the region than the superb detective novels in James Lee Burke‘s Dave Robicheaux series. However, chances are slim that you’ll find Burke on any list of eminent Southern writers, since genre fiction apparently doesn’t qualify as Literature. Too bad, because the man writes like an angel.The Cajun detective, Dave Robicheaux, a twice-wounded Vietnam vet and former New Orleans cop, has returned to law enforcement in this fourth of the twenty novels that comprise the series to date. He’s back with the sheriff’s department in southern Louisiana’s New Iberia parish to earn enough money to get himself out of hock.While transporting two convicted killers from the local jail to the state pen, where they’re destined for the electric chair, Robicheaux’s fellow deputy sheriff does something stupid. The killers escape, grievously wounding Robicheaux and killing his partner. Months later, even as he teams up with the DEA to go undercover with the New Orleans Mob, he is fixated on hunting down the man who nearly killed him, a psychopath named Jimmie Lee Boggs. The tale that unfolds is deliciously complex and compulsively suspenseful, and it celebrates the rich tapestry of sights, sounds, and smells that is southern Louisiana. This is not a tourist’s-eye view of the South but a deeply textured portrait by a native.Twice winner of the Mystery Writers of America’s Edgar award for best novel of the year and named a Grand Master of the field, James Lee Burke is is 78 years old as of this writing.

"It’s puzzling to me why an American author living in the United States would choose to write one novel after another in a long-running series of detective novels set in a foreign land. Cara Black, whose Aimee Leduc series is set in Paris, is by no means the only example of this phenomenon. For instance, think Elizabeth George and Deborah Crombie, two of Britain’s leading writers of detective fiction despite the fact that they’re both irredeemably American — and those are just the ones who come quickly to mind. I suppose they all like to travel a lot. (I got my fill of that years ago.) They would have to do so, since all their work reeks of authenticity.In Black’s Murder in the Sentier, private investigator Aimee Leduc is drawn into a dangerous search for the murderer of a famous author. Willy-nilly, she finds herself suddenly caught in the middle of a violent clash among the survivors of a notorious gang of 1970s radicals — among whom, apparently, was her mother. Risking her life and her livelihood, Leduc pursues the increasingly elusive truth, coming into conflict along the way with the Paris police, several old revolutionaries, and her business partner, Rene, a computer wizard.At least in the first three of the fourteen novels in the Aimee Leduc series, Black takes on substantive subject matter. In Murder in the Marais, the first novel in the series, she writes about the legacy of Nazi terror in 1990s Paris. The second novel, Murder in Belleville, takes on the refugee crisis in early-90s France (reminiscent of today’s headlining conflict). Black clearly knows Paris well, and she does solid research for her novels. I plan to continue reading the series in order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0OA92Y0Y4V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026UNZUY#wasThisHelpful","R2H0OA92Y0Y4V4","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this worthy sequel to Dawn, the opening book in Octavia Butler’s much-admired Xenogenesis Trilogy, the focus shifts from Lilith Ayapo to her son Akin (“AH-keen”). The infant is a “construct,” the product of a Human mother and father, and the three other Ooankali individuals (male, female, and a third gender) who are necessary to bring Akin into the world. As a construct, Akin possesses many of the extraordinary powers of the alien species even though he looks very much like a Human: he begins speaking in complete sentences as an infant, he remembers everything he’s ever seen or done (including his experiences in Lilith’s womb), and he is capable of killing Humans with the sting of his tongue.Science fiction? Maybe. But there’s little science in this engrossing trio of novels. Most would call this science fantasy.However it might be characterized, this is, indeed, a very strange tale. The conceit on which it is based is that humanity has virtually destroyed itself and devastated Planet Earth in the process, leaving tiny pockets of survivors scattered across the globe. The Ooankali have descended on Earth in what they consider a mission of mercy, intent on allowing the human race to go extinct because of the self-destructive Contradiction in our genes between Intelligence and Hierarchy. The newcomers have been using their extraordinary powers at sensing and manipulating DNA to maneuver a handful of Humans into producing constructs like Akin who will join them on their quest to scour the universe for new opportunities to absorb other sentient species.Adulthood Rites dwells on the increasingly violent conflict between the Oankali towns, which include some humans like Lilith, and the “resisters” who are scattered about the countryside and essentially warring among themselves. Akin seeks out — and eventually finds — a way to persuade most of the resisters to cease their attacks.Octavia Butler writes with skill and a fine-tuned if dark appreciation for the self-destructive behavior of the human race.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FP343K1UNVBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HALPTU#wasThisHelpful","R1FP343K1UNVBP","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If it’s true that “God is in the details,” wouldn’t it stand to reason that history can best be understood through the stories of the individual people who experienced it? It often seems that way, doesn’t it? Certainly, the reality of life in times past is far easier to get our arms around when we read about the lived experience of individuals rather than the kings, generals, presidents, and other muckity-mucks who tend to dominate the history books.Avenue of Spies is a case in point. Despite all the reading I’ve done about World War II — dozens, and perhaps more than a hundred books — I found Alex Kershaw’s account of one extraordinary American family’s experience in occupied Europe during the war to be at least as revealing as the best political or military histories. I learned things that would never turn up in conventional history books, things that gave me the feeling that I was getting at least an inkling of what it was really like to live in Nazi-occupied territory while despising the Nazis and everything they stood for.The title refers to the Avenue Foch, the widest thoroughfare in Paris. There during World War II the Gestapo had commandeered one venerable mansion after another, turning some into offices and others into torture chambers. This was the headquarters of Nazi efforts to deport French Jews to concentration camps and to destroy the French Resistance. The same street was home to an American surgeon, his Swiss wife, and their adolescent son whose house lay within yards of the headquarters of Hitler’s secret police. The doctor, Sumner Jackson, was the wartime head of the American Hospital, which he operated as an escape route for scores of downed American and British pilots. Jackson’s home on the Avenue Foch served as the Paris hub of one of France’s principal Resistance networks, courtesy of Jackson’s wife, Toquette. There, virtually under the noses of the Gestapo, Resistance fighters and couriers visited under cover as patients of Dr. Jackson, dropping off or picking up communications from their comrades.Kershaw focuses not just on the heroic Jackson family but also on Helmut Knochen, the Gestapo’s chief spy-hunter in France and, later, effectively the ultimate authority in the country outside of Vichy France, the fascist client state established under the aegis of the German occupation. Knochen and his staff were notoriously effective in hunting down, torturing, and killing scores of Frenchmen and women who volunteered for the Resistance. Along with the French militia, the Milice, and the pro-Nazi leaders of the Vichy government, they were also ruthless in searching out and deporting many thousands of French Jews, nearly all of whom perished either in the Nazi death camps or by being worked and starved to death in German factories.In other words, if you’re looking for light reading, this book isn’t it. However, it would be difficult to find a fictional account of the times that is equally suspenseful, and if you want to gain deeper understanding about the day-to-day reality of life under the Nazis in occupied Europe, Avenue of Spies will open your eyes.Alex Kershaw is a British historian, journalist, and nonfiction author who has written six popular previous nonfiction books about World War II.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1TPU3Q5RU9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEPR6QW#wasThisHelpful","RE1TPU3Q5RU9G","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some writer or critic — I forget who; it was somebody who gravitates to Literature with a capital “L” — defined the content of a novel as “something happens.” The late Joseph Heller even wrote a novel with that title. (Not a good one, actually.) Stuff happens in Owen Sheers’ I Saw a Man, but it’s just not very interesting stuff because the story drags on so . . . very . . . slowly . . . that when something happens, I’m ready for the next thing to come along without my having to wade through all the tortured internal dialogue Sheers loves so much. In other words, this novel seems to be an attempt to create Literature along the lines of those books that tend to win the Booker Prize, which I generally find tedious.A more generous critic might categorize this novel as a murder mystery. There’s enough death in it to qualify, and, truth to tell, there are surprises here, too. The problem is, when I finally got to those points, I didn’t care all that much.I recognize that the author was probably reaching for insight about the human condition. Maybe other readers will find that in I Saw a Man. I didn’t. It seemed to me that Sheers was simply trying to work something out in his own mind, readers be damned.Oh, and by the way: I’m not sure where the title comes from. It doesn’t seem to fit the plot. Maybe it refers to something that should have happened but didn’t. Or even something I should have picked up on but fell asleep instead.My opinions notwithstanding, Owen Sheers has won numerous literary awards. He’s also a poet, an actor, and a TV presenter. He’s Welsh (which might mean something to readers in Britain). Sheers is a young man — just 40 at this writing — so maybe he’ll learn to write for readers instead of himself and come up with more interesting books in the future.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ZCZE9ZE327F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NKDMBQA#wasThisHelpful","R13ZCZE9ZE327F","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sara Paretsky writes for me. I’m convinced of it. Her consistently excellent series of V. I. Warshawski detective novels features a believable central character, a handful of her charming friends, and a finely tuned appreciation for the depths of big-city corruption in the place that invented its modern manifestation: Chicago. In contrast to the old whodunits that include roomsful of suspicious characters created just to confuse the reader, Paretsky’s plots are invariably complex and suspenseful rather than contrived. And they’re interesting: I care what happens.Unlike the protagonists in so many contemporary detective novels, Paretsky’s alter ego, Victoria Iphigenia Warshawski, is by no means a superhero. She is impulsive, sometimes foolishly so; she jumps to unwarranted conclusions; and she has a knack for sticking her head into places where it might easily be shot at (and sometimes is). She is, nonetheless, brilliant, and is sometimes referred to as “Chicago’s best investigator.” I may be in love with her.Brush Back opens when Frank Guzzo, V.I.’s high school boyfriend from the old neighborhood in South Chicago, turns up in her office seeking help for his mother. V. I. is curious from the outset, since Frank’s mother has just been released from prison after twenty years for the murder of her daughter, Frank’s sister. He claims his mother was framed and wants V. I. to prove it. In short order, V. I. finds herself caught up in an exasperating and intensely personal fight when the old woman publicly claims that the murder was committed by V. I.’s much-revered cousin, the late Bernard “Boom-Boom” Warshawski, a legendary star on the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team. As the intrepid detective pursues the case in the face of a painful media storm, she comes up against the powers-that-be in her old neighborhood — and their connections to much higher places in the firmament of Chicago politics. In the midst of all this, the old woman keeps up a steady stream of invective about illicit sex, which she claims is at the heart of the murder case.What I enjoy the most in the V. I. Warshawski series is the author’s sharp political eye. More than anything else, these novels spotlight the ugly underbelly of Chicago politics. As you’re aware, I’m sure, Chicago judges have been prosecuted for corruption by the dozen, and four of the last seven Illinois governors have gone to prison. Paretsky understands how and why this happens: her novels prove it. She’s got her head screwed on straight, from my perspective: “When I think of immorality,” she writes, “I think of the payday loans and hidden bank fees, the failure to pay a living wage, the preference for crappy schools in poor neighborhoods. I don’t think about sex.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5TBP5JKA7PY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZO2I#wasThisHelpful","R5TBP5JKA7PY4","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hugh Howey debuted with a big splash as a science fiction writer with the publication of Wool. This three-part dystopian novel (really, a novella plus two full-length books) tells the tale of the Silo, an underground city of several thousand future Americans that descends through 144 stories into the earth. Shift — the three books that together constitute the prequel to Wool — carries readers from the mid-21st century for several hundred years until its central character is about to cross paths with the principal actor in the future world portrayed in Wool. Along the way readers learn the grim explanation for the origin of the Silo.The tale begins in 2049. Donald Keene is a freshman Congressman elected from Georgia with the help of “the great Senator Thurman.” As a freshman, he finds himself at loose ends as he casts about for meaningful work when the Senator recruits him for a top-secret job that engages his background as an architect. We soon learn that Keene, now happily married, was once engaged to the Senator’s daughter. Predictably, this inconvenient fact will complicate the story and loom large down the line. But the complications emerge slowly, building suspense all the while.Shift is dystopian fiction with a twist — several twists, really. Its strength lies in Howey’s cleverly imagined underground world. The writing style is unexciting, the characters not fully fleshed out. But the world of the Silo, and the backstory in this prequel, are bound to fascinate any fan of science fiction. After nearly a century and a half of SF, it’s tough to come up with something new.

"A few very clever people can turn a simple truth into a career. Sam Horn is one of them. Walking the well-worn path trod by Dale Carnegie (How to Win Friends and Influence People), Horn — who is a she, by the way — has crafted a useful little handbook for anyone in the business of communication. Got Your Attention? is a user-friendly, latter-day updating of Carnegie’s 1936 classic. It’s more in tune with today’s impatient strivers. And the world would be a whole lot better place if everyone read this book and heeded Horn’s call to listen more and talk less.In the field of fundraising — my specialty for three decades — it’s often said, “If you want advice, ask for money. If you want money, ask for advice.” Although she never touches on this particular point, Horn makes this lesson clear enough in her clever little handbook.Sam Horn loves mnemonic devices. The word “intrigue” in the subtitle is an acronym that sums up the contents of the book:I: “Craft an INTRO that has people at hello.”N: “Create the next NEW thing.”T: “Win trust by being TIME-EFFICIENT.”R: “If they can’t REPEAT it, they didn’t get it.”I: “Don’t just inform, INTERACT.”G: “GIVE attention first.”U: “If it isn’t actionable, it isn’t USEFUL.”E: “Don’t tell stories, share real-life EXAMPLES.”There’s a great deal of wisdom in all this advice, and it’s all presented in snappy, conversational style. Several other acronyms appear in the book — perhaps a few too many. However, as the author states at the outset, “there are ways to overcome people’s impatience, alienation, and chronic distraction, and this book teaches them.” Amen.Sam Horn, who bills herself as “the Intrigue Expert,” has written nine other books on the art of effective communication (although I don’t recall coming across that word in this book!). Got Your Attention? is a worthy addition to the narrow shelf of personal development books that are actually worth the paper they’re printed on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QVHVMQE4C74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGET4UO#wasThisHelpful","R2QVHVMQE4C74","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Literary awards can be a poor guide to enjoyable reading. Britain’s Man Booker Award-winners, for example, strike me as a mixed bag at best. Generally, though, a book that wins a Pulitzer and is a finalist for a National Book Award deserves more than a casual look. That’s certainly the case with All the Light We Cannot See, an historical novel long at or near the top of the national best-seller lists, winner of the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.Here is a wildly original boy-meets-girl story. Two teenagers are caught up in the frenzy and the mortal dangers of World War II: a German boy who is extraordinarily clever with all things electronic, and a blind French girl who reads Jules Verne. Author Anthony Doerr explores the trajectory of their lives in parallel, moving them inexorably toward a fateful intersection in the book’s surprising climax. Like millions of other Europeans, Marie-Laure LeBlanc and Werner Pfennig are victims of the war, but their stories are fresh: these are uniquely drawn individuals, each masterfully portrayed by a writer at the top of his form.The action in All the Light We Cannot See takes place late in the war, two months after D-Day (June 6, 1944), with the Allies poised to turn back the German lines on all fronts. Marie-Laure is hiding out with her father and great-uncle in Saint-Malo, a coastal town near the Normandy beachhead. Werner has been pressed into service in the German army and (inevitably) is transferred to the town as the Nazis rush to reinforce their defenses in northern France.However, it is the backstory Doerr tells of each of these remarkable young people that forms the backbone of the novel: how Marie-Laure lost her sight early in life and came to live with her doting father in Paris and later in Saint-Malo; how Werner demonstrated genius with electronics as a child and was later maneuvered into making a major contribution to the German war effort. These are full-bodied stories, rich with complexity, detail, and suspense.All the Light We Cannot See is Doerr’s second novel.

"Alternate history is a curious branch of science fiction — or, perhaps more properly, of speculative fiction. Because the factor that limits the author’s imagination aren’t the boundaries of science but those of history itself: reality. To work, alternate history must be believable in the context of what we know of our past. In Ha’penny, the second volume of her Farthing Trilogy, accomplished British science fiction and fantasy writer Jo Walton has achieved that, and more. She has written a gripping, suspenseful novel that illuminates the past with her artful imagination.In Farthing (reviewed here) the first book of the trilogy, Nazi Germany and England had signed a peace treaty in 1941, leaving Hitler dominant on the Continent — before the seminal events that drew the US and the USSR into the war. The “Farthing Set,” the group of right-wing aristocrats credited with ending the war, is poised on the brink of power eight years later. Farthing — combining alternate fiction with a murder mystery — tells the story of the violence that facilitated their ascent to power.How could this have happened in the seat of democracy? It’s not so far-fetched. “England is like a country of sleepwalkers, walking over the edge of a cliff,” Walton writes, “and has been these last eight years. You’re prosperous, you’re content, and you don’t care what’s going on the other side of the Channel as long as you can keep on having boat races and horse shows and coming up to London to see a show . . .” Is this description so far from today’s reality, when the Conservative Party, which has stubbornly kept Britain in recession for five years, has just been returned to office with its biggest victory in thirty years?Ha’penny picks up the story shortly after the Farthing Set has settled into 10 Downing Street. The scene shifts from the country home in the village of Farthing where the first book was set to London’s theater district. There, Viola Lark, one of the six notorious Larkin sisters, has achieved stardom on the stage and is set to begin production of a production of Hamlet, with herself in the title role in the theatrical fashion of the age. Viola cares only about the theater. She’s less than indifferent to politics. But the novel tells the fascinating tale of her gradual immersion in a plot to put an end to the fascist Farthing regime that has recently risen to power.At the center of the story are the aristocratic Larkin sisters. They’re closely modeled on the real-life Mitford sisters, whose divergent paths through life in the 1930s, 40s, and beyond kept the English people variously entertained and enraged. The noted journalist and author Ben McIntyre describes them as “Diana the Fascist, Jessica the Communist, Unity the Hitler-lover; Nancy the Novelist; Deborah the Duchess and Pamela the unobtrusive poultry connoisseur.” In truth, two of the sisters (Diana and Unity) were close to Hitler; Diana married Sir Oswald Mosley, the head of the British fascist party. Nancy and Jessica, both accomplished writers (Jessica wrote the widely acclaimed The American Way of Death pillorying the funeral industry), were also both left-leaning. Jessica, who moved to the US early in life, was a member of the American Communist Party until 1958. [I’m proud to say that I knew Jessica Mitford — she was better known as Decca — for a few years in the 1970s. She had long since settled in Berkeley with her second husband, a leftist attorney. Decca was a brilliant social critic with a wicked, non-stop sense of humor.] With such stranger-than-fiction models for her characters, Jo Walton could hardly be faulted for a too-vivid imagination in writing Ha-penny.Jo Walton has written a total of eleven novels, one of which, a fantasy titled Among Others, won the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel in 2011 and 2012. Farthing, Ha’penny, and Half a Crown form the Farthing Trilogy. They were published in 2006-2008.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXL6MZMBMAEJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003H4I4VI#wasThisHelpful","RXL6MZMBMAEJ4","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's unlikely that a general reader would pick up a book on economic history, and this one -- with a bland main title and not one but two off-putting subtitles -- would appear to be a work that only an economist could love. It's not. The dramatic interplay of personalities that Ed Conway brings to light in The Summit is entertaining enough to please any devotee of serious historical fiction.At its core, The Summit relates the stormy relationship between two towering personalities, John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White. Representing the UK, Keynes was the world's most famous economist and a certified celebrity to boot. He is still widely regarded as the most important economist of the 20th Century. White, little known to the public before Bretton Woods and not much more so afterwards, was his counterpart heading up the US delegation on behalf of the Treasury. Together, these two men managed against all odds to put in place the world's first global economic system in the waning days of World War II -- a system whose surviving remnants include the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The mechanisms negotiated at the Bretton Woods Conference in New Hampshire in 1944 never truly worked as Keynes and White intended, but they did help accomplish the overarching goal of the conference: to maintain world economic stability up until Richard Nixon upended the system in 1973 by taking the US off the gold standard.The details of these events, and of the tense negotiations that led up to them, are to be found in abundance in The Summit. Far more engaging, though -- and no doubt more memorable -- are the portraits Conway paints of Keynes and White. If you think people are necessarily boring if they study economics, you should read this book. It would be difficult to dream up two more fascinating people.John Maynard Keynes was, by all accounts (including his own), a genius. Fresh out of the Versailles Peace Conference that ended World War I, his bestselling book The Economic Consequences of the Peace foresaw with rare prescience the economic turbulence of the 1920s and 30s and the likelihood of a second war. His General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, published in 1936, is often compared to Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations as one of the most consequential books of modern times.But these accomplishments, and many more, were only part of Keynes' story. Friends and foes alike considered him crude, rude, arrogant, overbearing, and disdainful of practically everyone else except his long-suffering celebrity wife, the former prima ballerina of Ballets Russes. For example, on several occasions, when he was dispatched by the British government to negotiate with the US, he so thoroughly alienated his counterparts that, had he not been accompanied by more temperate members of his delegation, he might have torpedoed the US-UK alliance.Harry Dexter White, unknown by comparison, was brilliant, too. He was also almost equally capable of alienating those he worked with. He, and to be fair his progressive policies, made sworn enemies within the State Department, which frequently complicated and sometimes undermined international negotiations. He was also a Soviet spy. Though not a Communist, he shared the prevailing view within the American Left from the 1930s through the end of World War II that the USSR was advancing the interests of humanity. However, unlike most other progressives, White found his way into the arms of the NKVD (predecessor to the KGB and today's FSB). Over the years, he handed over reams of sensitive documents to his handler in the Soviet Embassy -- though, reportedly, nothing top secret. Following World War II, White was caught up in the Red Scare sweeping the country and driven from his government job.It was inevitable that these two personalities would clash -- the hard-driving son of poor Jewish immigrants and the Cambridge-educated son of an esteemed economics professor and a social reformer.Ed Conway, a journalist, is the Economics Editor of Sky News, the 24-hour TV news service in the UK controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The Summit is Conway's second book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFD8R92NIJMXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LADUP06#wasThisHelpful","RFD8R92NIJMXD","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The brooding landscape pictured on the cover of this off-beat detective novel sets the stage for the complex tale within, suggesting the depth of the multidimensional characters whose lives today intersect around a tragic event half a century ago.Fin McLeod has returned again to the Isle of Lewis, the northernmost of the Outer Hebrides Islands off the northwestern coast of Scotland. In The Blackhouse, the first novel in the Lewis Trilogy, McLeod had returned from Edinburgh to the site of his childhood to assist the local police in investigating the murder of a man he had known as a schoolchild. Now, he has just left his marriage and his job as a detective in the capital to return to Lewis, perhaps to stay. McLeod is a troubled soul, tortured by the recent loss of his eight-year-old son to a hit-and-run driver and the failure of his marriage.No sooner has McLeod arrived on the island than a body turns up in the peat, obviously murdered some decades in the past. True to his nature, McLeod soon finds himself assisting, and then leading, the long, convoluted trail to the truth of the victim’s identity and the circumstances of his death. As the investigation moves forward, it becomes clear that those closest to him — his former lover, the son he fathered with her, his best friend from schooldays — are somehow involved in the tale.Although The Lewis Man is a detective novel, a murder mystery, and a good one, it’s equally a portrait of a “wind-ravaged corner of the earth where warring factions of an unforgiving Protestant religion dominated life. Where men and women struggled all their lives to make a living from the island, or the sea, turning in times of unemployment to the industries that came, and went again when subsidies ran out, leaving the rusting detritus of failure in their wake.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA97Z819S7DGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZYBYGE#wasThisHelpful","RA97Z819S7DGR","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Welcome to “Night Soldiers,” the brilliant series by one of our most accomplished writers of espionage novels.Meet Nicholas Morath, 44, is an aristocratic Hungarian living in Paris, where he is a partner in an advertising firm. His uncle, Count Janos Polanyi, is a senior diplomat in the Hungarian mission to France who is engaged in organizing the resistance to Hitler in Eastern Europe. World War II hasn’t yet started in earnest — Germany’s Anschluss with Austria is still weeks away, and the occupation of the Czech Sudetenland on the distant horizon — but Polanyi sees the future with clarity. He presses his nephew into taking on a dangerous mission in Budapest . . . and the trouble begins.Morath, known as Nicky to Cara, his young Argentine lover, is one of those world-weary Europeans who surely abounded on the Continent during the fateful years of the 1930s. “He was doomed to live with a certain heaviness of soul, not despair, but the tiresome weight of pushing back against it. It had cost him a wife, long ago, an engagement that never quite led to marriage, and had ended more than one affair since then.” As war approaches, Morath’s already complicated life becomes ever more challenging. His work for his uncle exposes him to grave danger. The stakes grow as the months go by. And the suspense increases apace.Kingdom of Shadows is the sixth of the thirteen novels in Alan Furst’s “Night Soldiers” series. Each of these finely crafted stories features its own protagonist, typically a man in early middle age engaged in (or about to become engaged in) a love affair who is reluctantly drawn into a role in espionage. The setting shifts from the Balkans to Iberia and Paris to Warsaw, but the cast of characters often overlaps. In this manner, Furst has created a finely textured portrait of Europe before and during World War II.For reviews of some of Furst’s other historical espionage novels, go to Spies of the Balkans, Red Gold, Midnight in Europe, and Mission to Paris.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOKRSLC4G8FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QCSAA4#wasThisHelpful","R1EOKRSLC4G8FO","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine that you live in a town of about 115,000 people. Berkeley, California, say. With only rumors and rumblings in the news media to warn you, an edict comes down from the Federal government that all the Muslims in town must be “relocated” to camps monitored by the US Army. Why? Because, supposedly, the threat of terrorism is so great, and the behavior of many Muslims so troubling, that they must be removed from their homes and placed in detention for the duration of the War on Terror.Couldn’t happen here? Well, it did.On April 21, 1942, the front-page story in the Oakland Tribune was headlined, “‘Japs Given Evacuation Orders Here.’ The article reported, ‘Moving swiftly, without any advance notice, The Western Defense Command today ordered Berkeley’s estimated 1,319 Japanese, aliens and citizens alike, to be evacuated to the Tanforan Assembly Center by noon, May 1.” These Berkeley residents were among a total of about 120,000 Japanese Americans who were interned, two-thirds of them United States citizens — including the adopted Japanese children of Caucasian parents.No doubt you’re aware that, not long after Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the removal of all American Japanese from a broad swath of California, Oregon, and Washington bordering the Pacific and moved them into what even many at the time called “concentration camps.” However, chances are you don’t know the half of it. I certainly didn’t.In Infamy, Richard Reeves brings the full story to light for the first time, working from one-on-one interviews, unclassified files, records of legislative hearings, and published sources to put a human face on this shameful episode in American history. His accounts of the families who lost everything, the children who grew up bitter, and the courageous soldiers of the all-Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team are profoundly moving.Today, many are aware that “the 442″ was the most decorated unit in the history of the US Army and famously rescued the so-called Lost Battalion trapped behind German lines, losing as many as nine out of ten of its own men in some units to bring the surviving Texas National Guard members to safety. However, “[f]or most of the American reporters, the rescued not the rescuers, white men not Nisei, were the focus of the story.” The New York Times ran the headline “‘Doughboys Break German Ring to Free 270 Trapped Eight Days.’ The article did not mention that the ‘doughboys’ were Japanese Americans.”FDR didn’t act alone in setting all this in motion. Far from it. Reeves unmasks the powerful people who lobbied and spoke out for the evacuation. My jaw dropped as I tallied the list: Earl Warren, then Attorney General, later Governor of California and Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court. Edward R. Murrow and other prominent broadcasters. Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Artist and writer Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss). Walter Lippmann and other, less influential but then-famous newspaper columnists. Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy (“‘The Constitution is just a scrap of paper to me'”), later president of the World Bank, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, and member of the Warren Commission. Plus every member of the Congressional delegations from California, Oregon, and Washington.Warren, McCloy, and Lippman appear to have been the most influential in channeling into terms that could persuade the President the upwelling of vicious racism triggered by the attack on Pearl Harbor and early Japanese victories in the Pacific. (However, FDR himself was by no means immune to racism, as indicated by his decisions that adversely affected African-Americans and Jews.) Most of the nation’s newspapers — even the allegedly liberal New York Times — editorialized in favor of the evacuation. Within the Army, which managed the evacuation, the driving force was an ignorant and deeply prejudiced general named DeWitt and his top aide, a pathological liar named Bendetsen.Why did they do this?  Those who championed the evacuation argued that “[t]he Pacific Coast is in imminent danger of a combined attack from within and without.” But economic motives figured in as well: the evacuees were forced to sell their homes, their farms, and their businesses for a pittance to their neighbors or other profiteers, who benefited hugely from the opportunity their government had given them.There was dissent, but not much of it at first. The Navy objected because they knew perfectly well that the threat of invasion was an absurd fantasy; there was a single Japanese submarine off the Coast of California. Eleanor Roosevelt spoke out in her newspaper column. J. Edgar Hoover didn’t like the idea because he had already arrested everyone the FBI had tagged as potential spies and saboteurs starting the day after Pearl Harbor, and he wanted the credit; of course, Hoover’s idea of a “Suspect Enemy Alien” was wildly distorted. In the upper reaches of the Administration, only the Attorney General, Francis Biddle, spoke out forcefully and repeatedly in opposition — at Cabinet meetings and in letters to the President.In 1943, a year after the evacuation, some of its erstwhile backers realized they had made a huge mistake. Despite continued opposition from the Army, regulations were steadily relaxed at most of the camps, with 4,300 young Japanese-Americans released to attend those colleges that were willing to take them and 4,000 more were recruited into the Army to form the 442. (Those 4,000 men “had to be replaced nearly 2.5 times. In total, about 14,000 men served, earning 9,486 Purple Hearts.”) Meanwhile, Lt. General DeWitt and Colonel Bendetsen were quietly relieved of their duties and promoted. The general even received a fourth star.Roosevelt charged McCloy and Stimson with drawing up the evacuation order with great care to avoid giving the impression that the action was racist. Naturally, that’s exactly what it was. There were no concentration camps for German and Italian immigrants on the East Coast.Reeves documents in abundant detail the hysterical wave of racism that swept through the West — in newspaper editorials, speeches by public officials, confrontations between whites and Japanese-Americans, and in the occasional violence directed at individual families.Infamy fills a void in documenting a vital example of the racism that has scarred American history from the time the Pilgrims landed until the present day. The evacuation of American Japanese in World War II paled against slavery or the genocidal war against Native Americans. However, if the shameful treatment of immigrants over throughout our history — Irish, Germans, Italians, Jews, Chinese, and others — were to be ranked in order of severity, the incarceration of more than one hundred thousand Japanese-Americans would top the list. And after the war, thousands of the internees were deported to Japan!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CJ7N8DRCAFXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0F3NBE#wasThisHelpful","R3CJ7N8DRCAFXJ","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dystopian fiction seeks to illuminate the consequences of the bad choices we make today. Goodhouse follows in this tradition by extrapolating into the late 21st Century the intersection of two of America’s most troublesome present-day realities: our counterproductive criminal justice system, which does a great job training young people for lives of crime, and the hubris of a scientific community that seeks to predict human behavior by reading our DNA. As author Peyton Marshall reveals in the Acknowledgments, the “Goodhouse” where most of the action takes place in her novel is modeled on the notorious Preston Youth Correctional Facility, a juvenile rehabilitation center closed by the State of California only in 2011.In Peyton Marshall’s dark-hued future America, the country is engaged in an endless war overseas while on the brink of civil war at home. On one side are the officials who maintain the nationwide network of Goodhouses, where young men tagged as having criminal tendencies are raised from an early age in draconian conditions sure to bring out the worst in them. (“There was no Goodhouse equivalent for girls. The same markers in women were not predictive of criminal behavior . . .”) On the other side are the revolutionary Zeros, who stage massive attacks to annihilate the Goodhouses and all those who live within them because “[t]hey wanted to purify, to cleanse. They didn’t believe in reforming us.”The novel tells the story of “James Goodhouse” — his birth name and origins have been suppressed, like those of all his thousands of fellows — and the trajectory he follows from the equivalent of a low-security youth facility where he was a model citizen to what can only be described as a prison. The Goodhouse shelters a totalitarian mini-society where James is physically and psychologically abused by the former inmates now in positions of power over him.When James is given a rare opportunity to leave the Goodhouse for a day, he meets Bethany, a gravely ill young woman who lives with her mother outside the walls in a home that represents an idyllic world for him. Their awkward relationship unfolds as James is increasingly dehumanized by the Goodhouse staff, and the violent clash between the system and the Zeros gathers force.Goodhouse works — as a cautionary tale, a novel of suspense, and a compelling read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZFW8U47AJPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6U1E00#wasThisHelpful","R1KZFW8U47AJPP","A2X4AEWNWCA1NX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4AEWNWCA1NX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a potentially terrific novel, a police procedural with consummately clever plotting and believable characters, where the reading experience was spoiled for me by the most trivial of writer’s errors: the failure to employ a proofreader!Admittedly, the story is intriguing and suspenseful. Detectives in two different Brooklyn police precincts are simultaneously pursuing three different cases, each very different from the others. As their investigations move forward, the connections among these seemingly unconnected events begin to emerge. Of course, that’s not surprising. Any seasoned reader of detective fiction knows to expect that. What’s surprising is how these disparate storylines are shown to merge into a fascinating whole.Now back to the spoiler.When I was a kid, my mother, a former English teacher, constantly complained about the spelling of “this new generation.” The culprit, as she saw it, was the phonetic approach to reading then in vogue. NOBODY under the age of 25 could spell, she insisted.Well, here we are again. I have no way of knowing whether D. James Eldon learned to spell because he was taught reading by the phonetic method, or whether he suffers from some sort of spelling disability, but I can say this: I have never, ever before understood clearly the value of proofreading.All the Way Gone is riddled with boneheaded misspellings. Throughout the book, Eldon uses “you’re” when he means “your” and “it’s” instead of “its.” He substitutes “loosing” for “losing,” “boarder” for “border,” “coarse” for “course,” “quite” for “quiet” — and those are only the errors I caught on the run. Undoubtedly, I missed a number of others. Where was the proofreader when we needed her?FYI, Mr. Eldon, spellcheck doesn’t cut it in cases like this. (For the record, they’re called “homonyms” — words that sound alike but have different meanings.)

"I needed to get a new screen protector for my co-worker. She has a habit of breaking every screen she gets within the first week or two of having a new phone. I am a huge supporter of the joys of having a screen protector on your phone at all times no matter what type of phone you have. I have also found that having a tempered glass screen gives even more protection for any phone. I like to try all sorts of screen protectors so I know what company is best to meet my friends and families needs. This is perfect. This is a very high quality tempered glass screen protector. This is cut perfectly and when placed properly on the iPhone 6 Plus, this is a perfect match. I am VERY impressed with the high quality of this product.

This is a much better looking and hit the AWESOME factor for my son. He has now put this in a much higher position than any other helicopter that he has.

"This is Amazing! I needed to get something that I could use without having to use my hands. I love to walk with both my dogs but one I need to have more control over and the other one just walks along side of me. With this amazing heavy duty hands free dog leash, I can now have to hands ready for the out of control dog and the calmer dog can walk/run along side with me. I love this. Simply put around my waist with the clip and attach my dog on the hands free leash. It's that simple. My job has become so much easier. I am so impressed with the high quality of this leash as it is much more sturdy and a high quality than most I have used in the past.

"Yes! I finally have a Universal Dashboard Windshield car mount for my parent's car! I drive their car a lot, along with my sister and brother. I have found that the phone mount that we had in the car, it was not a universal one. I didn't have the same phone as my brother so when I would put in my phone is would slide right out. My sister had the same problem so we had to do something. I found this and had to give it a shot. This works for all our phones, my parents: Android LG, my sister's: iPhone 6, my brother's: Samsung S4 and my: iPhone 5. This works for all the phones! There is no issue.

"Oh I love these new Premium Nail Clippers! I needed to get something that I could have in my purse that is portable being I have three children that always seem to get slivers, have long nails or something happens that we need a nail clipper when out of the house.

How wonderful for my son's finger nail beds. Very sharp, durable and a very high quality metal that allows this set to be one of the best I have ever owned.

"This heavy duty car truck organizer is AMAZING! I needed to get something that would fit perfectly into the back of my Pacifica. I was tired of having a bag roll down in between the seat that was down and the middle row of seats only to find a container of sour cream on the floor stinking! I needed to do something and quickly so I found this. Absolutely Perfect!!! I can not only save on bags but also this is very portable. I simply buckle it up so it's kind of like a laptop bag size. When I get into the store, I can load up this by simply unbuckling the sides and expand the middle dropping the two squares that make it stretch out. Then you can place in your shopping cart. Fill up with your groceries, check out and get to the car. You simply lift the side VERY DURABLE handles and place the full thing right in the back of the car. There is no more chances of the items falling behind a seat after it rolled out of a bag. I wish I had this earlier! I love this!!! Now I never go to the store without one. Trust me.. every missing items from the store to the house.. well with this, they are no longer on the floor of the car. They are safely within this organizer.

I put just a dab on my finger tip and rub in after a fresh shower. This soaks into my problem areas, which for me is all over my face down to my neck. I let dry then put on my make up like normal.

" 2:11 Mins We like to drink different wines on different days, and often open more than one bottle depending on the preferences of the wine drinkers that day.  This preserver lets you open those bottles guilt free, because you can keep them fresh until used up.  The idea is simple - air is not the friend of your wine, because air will oxidize your wine & change the flavor.  This pump pumps the air out of the bottle, drawing a vacuum over the wine.  This slows oxidation.The process is simple, as I show in my video.* Wet the special plug* Insert into wine bottle* Place pump on top of plug (they mate together) and pump.  Pump until it becomes hard to pump.  You will feel it.  8 pumps pulled the vacuum on a fairly empty bottle.* To drink the wine, press the button on the top of the plug to release the pressure.  Remove the plug & enjoy.They include 2 plugs & the pump - great to keep a red and white going at all times.  This is a great gift idea - or really great to buy for yourself.

"I love to buy  coffee from local and small batch roasters.  When I travel, you will always find coffee in my luggage from the local roaster I have visited.  But what to do when I haven’t seen some new roaster for a while?  Enter Coffee Crazy.  I could not resist the opportunity to purchase  this French Roast at a discount in exchange for writing up my actual experiences with it.  After all – we are coffee crazy in this house – so coffeecrazy coffee should suit us just right.When we opened the bag – the first whiff was heavenly.  It is dark roasted, but did not have that burnt overtone that some dark roasts have.  This coffee smells sooo good you almost want to have the beans sitting right next to you all day – but then I would drink too much coffee.  This is a dark and bold roast – a perfect complement for milk  (my choice), but my husband goes for it straight.I really like being able to support Fair Trade practices – I like drinking my coffee knowing that someone is making a sustainable living delivering it to me.  Organic is also important, since it reduces chemical exposure to me and to the framers that produce the coffee.  I’ve been to the rainforest – I know that there are ways to farm without destroying the eco-system, and I like to be part of that – while sipping some amazing coffee.  ♥♥♥♥♥ Definite recommend!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AJR63HKQ4N6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YD5U1KW#wasThisHelpful","R2AJR63HKQ4N6T","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very sleek and modern looking when seen in person.  The stainless steel  is a beautiful brushed finish.  This is a battery operated mill – something not mentioned in the listing.  You press the button on the top to grind.  There is a light that comes on the bottom (mine did not always come on).  The pepper that comes out is a mix of grinds – fine to coarse – which is fine for table side, but for cooking I prefer more control over the grind.  Adjusting the screw did not seem to change the grind very much – you cannot get real control of the grind with this grinder.  Also, it comes out slower than my manual grinder – which can be fine for tableside grind, but not ideal for cooking when I want to generate a teaspoon or tablespoon of pepper at a certain grind.So why 2 stars?  They need to look at their packaging.  The grinder came in a box that just barely surrounded the grinder.  The box was shipped in a plastic envelope with no padding from China – so the box was crushed badly.  Not sure if it affected the functioning of the grinder.  When I messaged the seller they blamed the carrier – not okay when their packaging was sub-standard.  I don't really care why it was crushed - I paid for a new functioning item. They wanted me to pay to ship it back to China – which would cost more than the grinder was worth.  They did finally agree to refund, so I give them points for that.

" 2:48 Mins Power plugs aren't always where you want them, and Apple only makes a 3 foot & 10 foot cord.  The 10 foot cord is $39.  What if you want something in between for a reasonable price?  This is where this 6 foot Akiko cord comes in.What I look for in a cable:► MIFI certified: MFi means Made for IPhone, Made for IPad, Made for IPod etc. This means ""that the electronic accessory has been designed to connect specifically to IPhone, IPad, respectively, and has certified by the developer to meet Apple performance standards."" Lightening cables are much more complicated than the previous Apple cables. They must have the proper chip, and be constructed to insert in either direction. MIFI certified means they adhere to Apple standards. I tried those cheap Ebay cables when lightening cables first came out, and they just don't work. Either they don't work from day one, or they stop working at the next software update because their chip is wrong.► Charge & Sync: I used this cable with both my IPad Air 2 and IPhone. The IPad Air is the trickier of the two devices to charge/sync (some third party cables work with my phone & not my IPad Air 2). Absolutely no issues. First I tried charging with the cable, and the cables were immediately recognized. The devices charged with no issues. Next I connected them to the computer. The devices were recognized in Itunes, and data was properly synced.► Durability: The materials at the plug ends are heavy duty, and the connection at each plug end are well fitted & tight. The connectors are nicely made.► Fit: The lightning connector goes into the phone snugly and is recognized. However, the plug that plugs into the Apple device is slightly wider and thicker than the standard lightning cable. It does not work for a Lifepoof case.► Warranty: LIFETIME warranty means they believe in their product. I like that.  I also liked that some people have tried them out on their warranty and they have delivered.► Conclusion:Great charge and sync cable in a useful length at an attractive price. I purchased this cord at a discounted price and was asked for my review based on my actual experiences with this product. This is one of the few third party cables that passed all my tests.  I will always update with further information as I continue to use the cable.  I would definitely recommend this cable, as long as the user's case could accommodate a slightly larger lightning connector.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPOIWQC5V14U7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KO7Q1SY#wasThisHelpful","RPOIWQC5V14U7","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With 6 cloths in this package, it is easy to have one where you want it, and have one clean when needed.  I have many places in the home & car where I need these and now they can be handy.  I will also be putting one in my purse and one in my travel kit. I purchased this item at a discount and was asked for an unbiased review based on my experiences with the product.

" 4:04 Mins I LOVE selfie sticks - add them to a party and it definitely ramps up the fun.  This is my smallest selfie stick yet► Why I use a selfie stick* To be able to capture the scenery behind myself in a selfie* To not have to ask sketchy characters to take my picture* For photos or video* So I don't see that ""fat arm"" in the selfie""* To be able to be in the group shot instead of behind the camera► What's included that's extra? (Other selfie sticks I own did not include these features)* Bluetooth functionality: This allows you to use your selfie stick as a wireless remote for your phone - even if the phone is not in the selfie stick, as long as it is within Bluetooth range.* USB to Micro USB charging cable: Nice short one - easy to use.  Yes I have a bunch, but nice to include* Wrist strap - to carry the stick & keep your phone secure.  This one has an adjustment that allows you to snug it onto your wrist.► Materials: The handle is a nice rubber feel - smooth to the hand.  This is not one of those handles that swivels in your hand. The selfie stick telescoped and collapsed easily. Fully telescoped, this selfie stick easily supported my IPhone 5 or 6 without flexing or collapsing. (Do be careful with any of the selfie sticks of this type to not over-extend, or  it will break.)  The phone cradle has silicone padding top & bottom where it would touch the phone. I was able to secure my phone so that I felt safe extending it. (I have tried some selfie sticks that are so flimsy that they flex from the weight of the phone.) I would not turn my phone sideways in this selfie stick, since there is only top & bottom support. The knob that adjusts the camera angle tightens enough to hold the camera in place.► How do I make it work? NOTE: These are IPhone instructions & may differ for Android.1. Charging: It came partially charged, so you can play with it immediately. If it needs charging, use the supplied cord to plug into the bottom of the handle, and then plug it into one of your USB phone chargers.2. No Assembly required! Woohoo! Just pull it out & play!3. Attach Phone: Loosen the thumbscrew so you can tilt the phone bracket to the position you want. The phone holder is nicely padded on the top & bottom where it grips your phone. It is a spring loaded grip - It was easy for me to load & unload my phone & it felt secure.4. Pair the phone: Turn the Bluetooth to ""On"" by pushing the shutter release until the shutter release pulses with a blue light. Go to the Bluetooth settings on your phone and select the stick (It appeared as D-09 on my phone). When it say ""connected"" you are good to go.5. Snap away: Open your camera App. Touch the camera icon on the upper right to change the camera to selfie mode. Extend the stick & snap away by pressing the round button (with a W on it) on the handle of the selfie stick6. To turn it off, turn off the Bluetooth on your phone, then turn off the stick by pressing the shutter release for 3 seconds. This will save batteries.► Conclusion:I LOVE the fold down feature - it means I can keep this in my purse. I like the Bluetooth functionality, power cord, wrist strap, and secure grip for my IPhone.  The extension is very good for such a compact stick.  This selfie stick is perfect to keep in purse, backpack or glove box for those shots you just can't get any other way.

" 2:14 Mins I need tools that function, but like to make ecologically sensitive choices whenever I can.  Bamboo is a wonderful alternative to plastic or wood cutting boards.  It grows faster - so it is more easily renewable, it does not use up our petroleum resources, and is decomposable at the end of its lifespan - which should be many years.What I like:* SIZE:  Small boards don't work as well for me - it is big enough for all my meal prep chores. (Yes it is slightly smaller than the listing says - 15.5x11 not 16x12, but plenty big enough.) I can cut away without worries of food spilling off the board.* Drain Channel:  This is a feature I like on all my boards.  It lets meat / fruit juices drain off into the channel - instead of onto your floor or counter.  When the channel is full - carry the board to the sink and empty - LOVE it!* Removable Non-Slip Feet:  I like that the keep the board secure, and that they also make it so the board does not scratch the surface it is on.  On my board, the silicone feet stuck up above the board on one side, and were flush on the other.  They remove for cleaning - essential!* Bamboo:  Bamboo is fast growing & easily renewable.  Also, it is easy on my knives.  It is a stacked construction (meaning the edges are facing up) - the only type of bamboo chopping block you should get.  Hand wash like any wood/ bamboo board.* Multi-use: can use as cutting board or as cheese board (I will used one side for each purpose.)►Conclusion:  I am very happy I purchased this cutting board.  This product was purchased at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review based on my actual experiences with the product.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a highly functional kitchen tool that is eco-friendly at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9FGR2QZ0E91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QJZRA2#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9FGR2QZ0E91","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:21 Mins In my review video I tried to address some of the concerns people had about the cap opening on this water bottle infuser.  I am able to use the bottle with no problems once I understood the mechanics.  I like the handle, the leak proof design, and the generous fruit container.  It is easy to assemble and easy to clean.Infused water is a great way to drink wonderfully flavored drinks without all the calories and sugar of per-bottled drinks.  I love that you can customize your drink, and save lots of $$$ from not buying all the fancy, pricey flavored waters in the market.  Be creative & mix the flavors.  I use it with berries, lemon, lime, mint.  Other ideas - cucumber, cilantro.  For the liquid I use plain water, sparkling water, or iced tea.  Experiment with different teas - very different results.  Try the green tea and lime flavor popular at that famous coffee shop - and spend MUCH less.  Always use room temperature or cold liquids - not hot.  I like to infuse for several hours or overnight to get the best flavor.I do like this bottle, with the small concern that the tight keeper (see video) may impact the durability of the lid.  Still, compared to the cost of market drinks, this bottle should save you lots of money while providing you with many yummy drinks.  Also, I like he functional aspects of this bottle better than most.  I purchased this item at a discount and was asked for an unbiased review based on my actual experiences with the product.

" 1:41 Mins I have to admit - I was not so sure when I saw this brush.  It has small metal bristles that curve in the direction you are brushing.  I tried it with some concern - but the cat LOVED it!  I was able to remove a great deal of hair immediately.  She did not like the brush on her belly - but she usually is touchy there, because her fur is thinner.It's easy to remove the hair (once I figured it out) - I fumbled on the video.  One push makes the bristles come out for brushing.  Push again to retract the bristles, leaving the hunk of hair.  Maybe I could go into the cat hair sweater business?My kitty & I both love this brush - great idea well executed. I purchased this item at a discount and was asked for an unbiased review.

"I love to walk barefoot – but then I develop calluses, and if let go too long, my heels crack and become sore & ugly.  So – the need for a callus remover.  The one that came with my pedicure kit was cheap & flimsy, so I counted on the salon doing them when I went.  So – when offered a discounted price if I would do a honest review of the product – I went for it.This callus remover reminds me of the ones they use in the salon.  Nice size – easy to grab hold of – no flimsy feel if you try to put some pressure.  Having two sides with different grit is very nice – I followed their instructions.  I soak my feet first, then dry them, File with Coarse side on dry foot, then rinsed, then smoother side of callus remover to smooth out the skin, then lotion.  Go gently – you can always do more another day.I have got to mention - I love that they put a hand written note in the packages – saying thank you.  Small businesses that care are the backbone of our economy, and this is one who cares that we buy from them.

"Essential oils are great bang for your buck, because they are so concentrated.  Most products you buy on the store shelves have just a small amount of these powerhouse oils (if any).

"My husband & I took ballroom / social dance lessons for a while, but then the teachers moved out of town. After attending a family wedding recently, I realized I really wanted to brush up on what we knew, and add a few more steps.  I purchased theWedding Dance Mastery System, 5 DVD Set: A Complete Instructional Step By Step Guide to Dancing at Your Wedding and this set as well.  This set is a subset of the other set, so if you want to learn more dances, and more steps, I suggest the other set.  If you just want to survive the wedding dance & look good, this set should do it.The description for this item is limited, so:'What's Included - also known as - all the fabulous steps you can learn!* Disk 1 -  Foxtrot/ Waltz:** FOXTROT: The Basic Step, Left Rock Turn, The Sway Step, The Promenade, Promenade with Underarm Turn, The Dip** WALTZ: The box step, the Turning Box, Box with Walk around turn, Progressive Basic, Open Break with Underarm Turn, The Twinkle, The Promenade, The Dip, Wedding Dance Tips* Disk 2 -  Swing/ Rumba:** SWING: Basic Step, Release Break, Right Underarm Turn, Left Underarm turn, Right & Left Turn, The Cuddle, The Dip** RUMBA: The Box Step, Turning Box, Box with walk around turn, Rumba Rocks, Cross Body Lead, The Dip, Credit / Outtakes'Conclusion: This is a simplified version of  Wedding Dance Mastery System, 5 DVD Set: A Complete Instructional Step By Step Guide to Dancing at Your Wedding , which I also reviewed.  They teach you  less steps for each dance(check my review for the steps included in the more complete system), but still teaches you the basics of the dances.  The dance sequences are left out, as is the tips section that appears on some of the other disks on the mastery system.  I prefer the more complete system, but this is cheaper and will get you through the dance.  The Mastery system will keep you dancing after the wedding is long over. I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review based on my actual use of this product. After using it, I will tell you, IT WORKS, and this is a bargain compared to the dance lessons we took. It's less than signing one of us up for the community classes. It would be a great gift for a bride to be (or groom to be), but it's great for anyone who wants to learn to dance.  Please let me know if this review was helpful. I will always update if I get additional insights after further using the product, and I try to answer any questions left in comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMDGLV0Y70A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EI5CHS#wasThisHelpful","RJMDGLV0Y70A8","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:21 Mins Ever been charging your phone in the car and then have to leave the car to go into a building, knowing you no longer had a way to continue charging your phone?  (or vice versus?)  This power block can connect  your mobile devices to power from a car port or from a wall plug.  Compact and versatile, it's a great emergency device to keep in every car.***NOTE: The gray & black versions are identical - I purchased & tested both with no difference in performance.  I used the black one for the video review.► What I like:* Dual plugs - car & wall power source - all plugs fold away when not in use.  (only one should be out at a time)* Compact - easily fits it purse or glove box.  Sharp plugs fold away to give it a smaller footprint and to keep it from snagging on other things* LED indicator - shows power is flowing* Adjustable Car plug - (see video) makes it easier to use in some cars & allows you to position USB ports to your liking* Rubberized finish - pleasant to the touch► What could be better:2.4 Amp TOTAL charging power - With my power hungry devices (see video) I would have preferred to have dual 2.1 Amp USB ports - so I could charge two tablets.  They chose to have 2.4 Amp total, which means you can charge two phones at one - but not two tablets at once.  They don't claim dual 2.1 A, but it would be nice.  (They have a note in the listing that says: ""For charging your iPad, please use the 2.4 Amp USB port and keep the other USB port free"".  I will not deduct a star, because the device is as advertised and is SO useful.Definite recommend.  (I purchased 2 - one for each car).

Don’t be fooled by the cheaper imitation scents.  They never smell as good in your finished product, and the difference is really obvious in aromatherapy and massage uses. Majestic Pure has impressed me repeatedly with the various scents I have tried.  They are pure & undiluted.  The scents are true & concentrated – not musty or off.  Peppermint has a stimulating quality – use sparingly, because it is strong.  Good thing about that – this bottle will go very far.  Highly Recommended!

" 2:57 Mins Travel means accommodating the different voltages & plug types in various parts of the world.  Accommodating foreign visitors has some of the same challenges.  As you see on my video, this handles the plug incompatibilities - but not the voltage issues.  However, the problem is partly dealt with because it does have 2 USB ports that will charge your mobile devices, and many mobile wall power blocks can handle a range of currents.►What I like:* Wide range of plug types* Two 2.1 Amp USB ports PLUS a plug - so I can  charge 2 mobile devices (including smart phones & tablets) without bringing the charger blocks, and still plug in something else.* Case - so it doesn't snag something else and breakThis adapter is a nice combination of utility and portability - great to keep in your foreign travel kit. I purchased this travel adapter at a discounted price and was asked for my honest & unbiased review.  It is now installed in my travel kit.  I will always update if I have new information  as I have further adventures with this product.

"For years I have been growing lavender. Over the years I have probably grown 50 varieties of lavender. Of all the varieties, the Angustifolias are the sweetest scent. They have true sweet Lavender smell, with none of the camphor smell of some of the other types. When I realized this was made from 100% Angustifolia variety, I was delighted! So many products that claim to be lavender don’t have the true scent – but this one really does. Perfect product to use for my soap making and other bath & body products.For me, lavender is a calming, soothing yet refreshing floral scent. I use it in many ways to make bath / body products.• Add to almond, jojoba, grape seed or fractionated coconut oil for a massage. Choose oil based on your preference – lavender will be the scent you smell.• Add to coconut oil as a moisturizer.• Freshen up potpourri – freshen up lavender sachets• Use a few drops to freshen a bathroom• Use with aroma therapy diffuser• Use it in soap making – I like to use it alone or combine with rose or rosemary scents as well. I make lye soap, but you could add it to a glycerin melt & pour soap for a lovely gift.• Scent an eye pillow – very restful scent• Mix with Epsom salt to make a bath salt.The dark bottle is great for keeping the oil fresh, and the dropper is a nice plus that is often not included. Store in a cool dark place ( I use the refrigerator). Remember - it is a concentrated oil - use sparingly until you get used to how much you need. You will be surprised how far this bottle will go. Lovely smell, good value, it’s the real deal. I purchased at a discount in exchange for writing an unbiased review.

"I love multi-use items – as long as they work well. Up to now, I have had to have a heating pad and an ice pack to accomplish hot/cold therapy.  It’s very nice to have one pack that can do both.  It can even double as a thin ice pack in a small ice chest.The plastic outside is a thick material, and I like that that they made a point of not putting ink on the outside – so no staining skin or clothing with ink transfer.In my freezer the pack freezes rather firm – but in a short time it started to become more flexible.  It puts out a lot of cold, so I wrap it in a towel so it does not contact skin directly.Being non-toxic is great, because I will also use this in my small ice chest .From room temperature – about an hour to freeze, about 30 seconds to heat.It has moved into my freezer so it is ready to use when needed.

"I have dry skin, so I am always looking for the magic moisturizers & cleansers that will not over-dry my skin. People say my skin looks younger than my age - and I hope to keep it that way! Argan oil has now taken a place in my skin care regime. I have used it for cleansing - to loosen the dirt / sunscreen /makeup from my face. I rinse my face, then moisturize with the Argan oil - it only takes a tiny amount. The result is my skin doesn't get that tight dry feeling.The smell is light & earthy - no fragrance added. I like the fact that it is 100% cold pressed Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil - aka Argan oil, so there is no surprise reactions to other ingredients.I have tried and loved several other Majestic Pure products - this was no exception.  I like that they have a commitment to freshness and purity - something that isn't even mentioned in some other brand listings.

" 3:21 Mins Ever been charging your phone in the car and then have to leave the car to go into a building, knowing you no longer had a way to continue charging your phone?  (or vice versus?)  This power block can connect  your mobile devices to power from a car port or from a wall plug.  Compact and versatile, it's a great emergency device to keep in every car.***NOTE: The gray & black versions are identical - I purchased & tested both with no difference in performance.  I used the black one for the video review.► What I like:* Dual plugs - car & wall power source - all plugs fold away when not in use.  (only one should be out at a time)* Compact - easily fits it purse or glove box.  Sharp plugs fold away to give it a smaller footprint and to keep it from snagging on other things* LED indicator - shows power is flowing* Adjustable Car plug - (see video) makes it easier to use in some cars & allows you to position USB ports to your liking* Rubberized finish - pleasant to the touch► What could be better:2.4 Amp TOTAL charging power - With my power hungry devices (see video) I would have preferred to have dual 2.1 Amp USB ports - so I could charge two tablets.  They chose to have 2.4 Amp total, which means you can charge two phones at one - but not two tablets at once.  They don't claim dual 2.1 A, but it would be nice.  (They have a note in the listing that says: ""For charging your iPad, please use the 2.4 Amp USB port and keep the other USB port free"".  I will not deduct a star, because the device is as advertised and is SO useful.Definite recommend.  (I purchased 2 - one for each car).

It came with a separate clear Lucite clip that keeps it closed when not in use.  My one issue - it is a little too big for my eye shape.

It has a silky matte finish, and the blue is a great compliment to the Space Gray IPhone 6.  I think it would also look great with the silver phone.* Ports: The ports are well cut out. I can use it with all my third party lightning cables. The camera lens is below the case cutout.  The mute button has a generous cutout, and all buttons function flawlessly* Protection & Grip: I like the combinations of materials. I have nice grip, full use of my screen, screen protection & camera protection when I set it down on either side.This case has protective elements, while still being slim enough to fit in my pocket.

"I  know strong passwords are important, and maybe Enigmaze could help me get there.  I was very intrigued when I was able to purchase this at a discount  in exchange for my honest review.  What arrived were two cards, but absolutely no instructions.  I looked on the web – checked the Facebook page.  I am  still intrigued but did not find enough information to really help me use this effectively.  Some of the places I looked referred to a whole system – notebook, pen etc.  Do I need that?  How would it be different than what I have?  I honestly I have no idea how to use this to change all my passwords to safer ones that I can regenerate when needed.I think this idea has such promise.  Hopefully more information is coming out that will make it possible for me to use the item.  It would be nice if the seller sent an email to each buyer with information on how to use it.  Maybe the seller could include a  card with the product directing people to a website where they can get more information.  Maybe they could sponsor users creating and sharing new ways to use it.

"My family takes their devices everywhere, and someone always needs a  power boost.  This is a great solution to maximize the ability to get power to everyone’s gadgets.► What I like:• Charging Ports – LOVE having 3 ports that can charge my smart phones tablets, Bluetooth devices, etc at full speed.  (2.1A x 2, 2.4A x1)  Don’t be fooled by chargers that split 2.4 Amps between the ports (giving you 1.2 Amps per port if you have 2 devices charging).• Stay cool to the touch – even with three devices.  All devices charged at full speed.• LED Indicator – tells you power is flowing to the charger.  Bright enough to see – not bright enough to distract• Smart Power Technology – can’t test this, but it is important to not overcharge your electronics, so I am hoping they have included this technology, as promised.  I can say my devices did not overheat as they neared full charge.• LOOKS:  This only matters if the function is there – but since it is,  it’s nice if it looks good too!  The bottom plug is shiny black plastic.  The beveled edges at the top are shiny silver.  The rest of the top is aluminum – painted a very nice dark gray metallic.  Quality build.  A very nice look.Great charger for car with limited outlets – or car with lots of tech crazy people !  Best built / best looking charger I have.

" 1:15 Mins This is a well made, but different, phone clamp.  It uses a very effective jaw clamp to grasp your phone.  It holds your phone in a horizontal position, with the ability to swivel it from left to right.► What I like:* Phone Clamp: The Jaw clamp holds the phone very securely.  Silicone pads cushion the phone from the clamp and keep the phone from slipping.  The jaw clamp can be easily positioned to not interfere with buttons or ports.  The clamp does not interfere with my view of the screen.  You can charge the phone while in this mount.  Phone is very secure in clamp.* 360° viewing angles - allows you to swivel left or right - BUT no vertical adjustment is possible* Suction Cup: The suction cup is covered by a special 3M Gel Pad that increases the ability of the mount to adhere to windshield or dashboard.  So far it lives up to their claim of leaving no residue.  (I will report back if that changes)* Install / Removal: One touch lever makes it really easy to apply & remove the mount.* Could be uses as a table top phone stand.* Could be used in a rental car* Money Back Guarantee - always like these - means a company believes in their product*► Possible concerns:* No up / down adjustments - limits viewing angles - so be sure it will work in your car If you position your phone in landscape mode* Only landscape orientation possible* Tricky to remove & install phone (clamp is strong).  I think this would get better with practice► Conclusion:  Nice phone mount - good build quality - lots of attention to detail. You should be happy with this phone mount, as long as landscape orientation of your phone is okay, and you can pick a place on your car that works to adhere it.

" 6:56 Mins I use vacuum seal bags for freezing food and for Sous Vide cooking, so I was thrilled to  find the quality I need for less money.  They can't just be cheaper - they have to perform as well. As I show in my video they works just as well, and the price is much better.► Why I like these bags:* Thick - It is crucial that bones or sharp edges of food do not puncture the bag.  Nothing cheap or flimsy will do when you cook in them.  These bags are a quality weight that will handle all my tasks.  (See video - they were able to handle the sharp edges of my metal powerbank)* BPA free - crucial if storing / freezing or Sous Vide cooking* Air channel design - As you can see from the video, all the air was evacuated - indicated good air channel design. They claim it evacuates the air faster.  Not sure if that is true, but it did pull all the air out - which some cheaper bags I have tried have note* Cut your own size rolls - eliminates waste of pre-cut bags* White panel on bag - for easy labeling with permanent marker* Price - Compare the prices:  The FoodSaver  brand FoodSaver 11"" Roll, 3pkis $27.99 for 3 x 16' (48 feet total) of 11"" roll.  The Fresh brand is $18.79 for 2 x 25"" (50 feet) of 11"" roll.  So Fresh Brand gives you 2' more for much less $$.► Conclusion:  Most importantly for me - it works as well or better than the FoodSaver brand.  It is also cheaper than FoodSaver brand.  When I was offered the chance to purchase this at a discounted price in exchange for sharing my experiences with the product in an unbiased review, I jumped at the chance, because I use a LOT of these every year.  These passed the test, and will be my new replacement brand for vacuum seal bags.  HIGHLY recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234HDSGD5QDVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPRIVPY#wasThisHelpful","R234HDSGD5QDVL","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:02 Mins This case is for the user who wants more protection than all those slim cases offer.  It has three layers that combine to offer many protective features:► What are the layers and what do they do?* Layer 1: Clear screen protector attached to hard bumper - the screen protector protects your phone from accidental scratches & nicks.  Go ahead - Drop it in your purse. Only the camera and the touch pad are exposed - so finger print ID still works, and selfies are crystal clear.  The touch screen is very sensitive - and so far no scratches.  The screen protector is beveled below the edge, so it does not touch the table surface when placed face down.* Layer 2: TPU back & sides - Provides shock resistance and wraps the sides completely to the front and seals with a gasket fit around the bumper and against the clear screen protector* Layer 3: Polycarbonate Back plate & kickstand.  Provides additional impact resistance.  Snaps on.  Kickstand is part of this layer, and will detach if this layer is removed.'► What about the Kickstand?This is my least favorite part of the case, and the reason I will deduct 1 star.  The kickstand is hinged by two tiny plastic pins that look fragile & easy to break.  They are held in only if the back plate is on the case - (see video).  The kickstand snaps into place, but is hard to snap out of its slot.  When you pull out the kickstand, it feels very fragile.  It does not lock into an open position.► Ports:  This case made some good choices for offering moderate to high protection against the hazards of life.  The ports most susceptible to accidental water damage (earphone jack & power jack) are sealed by plug.  However this is not a waterproof case.  The mute button has a very comfortable cutout.  The microphone, home button, camera & apple logo are all exposed by cutouts, giving you much enhanced function over the true waterproof case.  All buttons functioned well, and the touch screen worked very well through the screen protector.► Conclusion:  If you are looking for a classy protective everyday case, this may be your case.  It should serve you well. The phone did take a fall from a table while in this case - phone & case were unharmed. If you are planning to use the kickstand daily - I would suggest you look elsewhere.  Recommend if kickstand is not your main reason for wanting this case. I purchased this item at a discount and was asked for an unbiased review. If you found this review helpful, please let me know.

" 2:23 MinsRunning belts are preferable to fanny packs because they allow you to distribute the weight close to your body. No more bumping of your phone against your body with every step. Although I do use armbands at times, I prefer a running belt when it gets warmer. It keeps sweaty neoprene off my bare arm.  Also, you can put other items in a running belt besides your phone - like car keys & remote, which those key slots on armbands never hold.This is a flip style belt - meaning you place items through the slits in the center seam (see vioideo).  Then you can (if you wish, flip the slits toward your body for extra security.As you can see from this video, this belt is well made.►What I like* Good weight stretchy spandex*  Reflective stripe running the length of the belt on top & bottom* Key clip on elastic cord - so key doesn't slip out & get lost* Customer service is 5 star ★★★★★.  When they realized I had a sizing issue, they contacted me right away and made it right.►So what about the sizing?It's important to get it right.  On the video I show you an XL belt - that measures 32 inches un-stretched. (They say it fits waists 31""-35"")  I can get about 5-6 more inches more when I stretch it - And that is REALLY stretching it. Smaller sizes will have less inches of stretch.  So, you need to consider where you want it to fit (hips or waist) and then whether you can get it on over your head or over your hips when stretched.  So - be sure to measure the widest part of your body  you need to get it over  before ordering.  Ladies - this is going to be more of an issue for you because we have wider hips - going over the head may work better for some people.  It would be nice to know the un-stretched & stretched sizes for SM, Med, L, XL.  In general, my advice is order larger than you think.If you choose carefully with sizing, this is a quality product.

"One of my Yoga teachers introduced me to use of the Yoga block.  In Yoga, it is very important that you first master the correct form, then AFTER that deepen the pose while maintaining alignment.  The Yoga block helps you do  that.  You can start with it in a vertical position, then as your ability to master the pose increases, you can turn it to horizontal position►Ways I use a Yoga Block:• Meditation – Sit on the block cross-legged  at the start or end of practice to relax the back & get a different experience of cross leg pose.  Try forward bends in this position• In triangle pose – I use it for my lower hand, instead of grasping my leg, especially early in the a session• Bridge Pose – I put it under my hips – and then relax – AHHHH• Spread leg or any forward fold – I rest my head on the block – started vertical – in some poses I now use horizontal.Well – the list could go on and on – but this gives you some ideas.  I place it by my mat at the start of practice & use it as needed.►Why this Yoga block:• Size – I have taken a picture of it next to my current block – this one is wider – which makes the difference between horizontal & vertical positioning a more natural step.  Also, it is more table when in the vertical position.  Still, of course, portable in a yoga bag.• Color – When I bring my other plain blue Yoga block – that looks just like all the other ones in the studio – people are always trying to take it and put it away at the end of class.  (People in yoga classes are very helpful!)  This one is distinctive looking  – and in my favorite colors.• Beveled edges – something I always look for – makes gripping it more natural• Non-slip surface has some give, but very supportive.  – surface can be cleaned• Recycled materials – Important to me – Gentle on the earth is a good thing.:It’s so much nicer (and more hygienic) to bring your own block to class (and some studios don’t have them).  My old block will stay at home – this one is going to class with me. ♥Love♥ the bigger size & purple / blue vibe.  Definitely recommend!!  I was delighted to purchase this at a promotional price in exchange for doing a review based on my experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSXKDBBIQXXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUPK6FE#wasThisHelpful","R1PSXKDBBIQXXF","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:11 Mins This file does the job, but it is a little confusing when it arrives.  It looks like half of a pen in a small cardboard box.  The file was stored inside the ""pen top with a clip"", and it was quite hard to remove - it was jammed in there.  Once I removed it, I saw a nice glass file, which could be turned around and fit into the pen top base.  The file has a rounded edge for curved surfaces, and a straight side for sharp edges.  As you will see from my video, it did a great job of smoothing a sharp glass edge.  They suggest filing under running water - but even without that it worked.Great gadget to have around the house - the small size is perfect for small chips.  This will have a permanent place in my kitchen gadget drawer.  I purchased this item at a discount and was asked for an unbiased review. If you found this review helpful, please let me know.

"I use this type of grate a LOT – so much that I finally broke the handle of my previous one (another brand) after many years.  My kitchen gadgets work for a living, and I was wanting another one (because that handle glue job was not doing it – LOL).  SO – I was delighted to try this when I was offered the chance to purchase it at a discount and review it.  Some of the ways I use this grater / zester:• Lemon Zest (or any citrus zest) – This is what they advertised this for.  A lemon zester should take off the yellow part only, not the bitter white part.  This zester performed admirably.  See my picture.• Parmesan cheese – or any hard grating cheese.  I tried it and it worked as expected.  Fluffy billows of fine shredded Parmesan – you will never buy it pre-grated again.  It is so easy to grate it over a finished dish.  Be warned that if the cheese is too hard (and you push too hard) you can compress the shredder blades.  For instance, don’t run the cheese near the rind of the Parmesan across the grater (Just saying – learn from my previous bad experience).• Ginger – lovely ginger taste in your dish without the time of mincing• Chocolate – perfect for garnish.This zester is SUPER SHARP so watch those knuckles.  That is why it works so well.  The rubber handle is comfortable, and it does have a hanging hole at the end of the handle.  I have mine in a utensil crock on the counter.When cleaning, be sure to run any cleaning cloth from handle to blade, and gently, or you will shred it.  Usually I just run it under water with soap or put it in the dishwasher.Conclusion:  There are similar zesters out there, but the lifetime warranty is huge for me – because this zester is going to get some serious use.  Currently it is $14.97 (prices move around on this type of zester).  I wouldn't pay the full price they are showing - $29.97 - but $15  is a good value for this type of zester.  It is now one of two zesters in residence in my kitchen.  I used it last night to top the pasta with fresh grated Parmesan.  It’s a wonderful addition to your cooking gadgets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DWMBB5IT0U7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLWP4OQ#wasThisHelpful","R1DWMBB5IT0U7U","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love being able to keep chilled coffee, soda, sparkling water, flavored water & wine without watering it down.  Once I make a drink, I want it to stay chilled to the proper temperature, and not get watered down.This is especially good for drinking a cold drink over a longer  time. At my desk I use an insulated travel mug to sip iced tea at my desk.  Adding these keeps it chilled for hours without diluting it.  When work distracts me I have often gone back to watery tea or iced coffee before I tried these.It takes about 4 hours to chill them – but with 8 cubes (4 of each) that is not a big problem.  I find myself using the stainless mostly – they seem colder.  Maybe the soapstone is better for desired whiskey temperature?They had me when they said you don’t have to choose between soapstone & stainless – because why choose when you can have it all!  The tongs are nice bonus – perfect for placing cubes in when company is over – me I just use my fingers usually.  The case keeps them from getting lost in the freezer.Altogether a nice set – perfect gift for the whiskey connoisseur - or someone like me who enjoys chilled drinks on a daily basis.

"I have dry skin, so I am always looking for the magic moisturizers & cleansers that will not over-dry my skin. People say my skin looks younger than my age - and I hope to keep it that way!  Argan oil has now taken a place in my skin care regime.  I have used it for cleansing – to loosen the dirt / sunscreen /makeup from my face.  I rinse my face, then moisturize with the Argan oil  - it only takes a tiny amount.  The result is my skin doesn’t get that tight dry feeling.I like the fact that it is 100% Argan oil, so there is no surprise reactions to other ingredients.

"I am always looking for a new twist on my exercise routine, and when I was offered this jump rope in exchange for a honest review, well ----- I JUMPED on it!  I liked the carry bag it came in – easy to take to the gym without it tangling in other stuff in there.  The adjustment for height was easy – I haven’t cut it, but you could if you wanted it only for you.  In my case, I want other family members to be able to adjust it for their use.►What I Like:• Lightweight – took some getting used to – the cable is so lightweight.• Ball Bearing action – the handle is attached to a ball bearing that allows the cable to effortlessly turn without tangling or getting twisted.• Adjustment – Adjustment is easy – just turn the screw (no tools needed) and then tighten where you want it.  (Not too tight or you might puncture the plastic sheathing).  I adjusted evenly on each side, and thought I am short (and quite a bit of cable was protruding), it surprisingly was not bothersome for me. I wish they had instructions on proper length or exercises,  but I easily found the info on google.  What I did was tep on the rope with one foot, then adjust so the cable end was at my chest height.This is a well made jump rope  - lightweight & portable - so much nicer than the ones I remember from school.  Major realization -  it is not as easy as it was years ago to jump rope.  I am not sure how well the plastic coating will hold up. I will always update if I get additional insights after further using the product","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3SIXNSA80KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XV3JQ8A#wasThisHelpful","R1W3SIXNSA80KR","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband & I took ballroom / social dance lessons for a while, but then the teachers moved out of town.  After attending a family wedding recently, I realized I really wanted to brush up on what we knew, and add a few more steps.  This set of videos is just what I needed.  The description for this item is limited, so:►What’s Included – also known as - all the fabulous steps you can learn!• Disk 1 – Wedding Introduction & FOXTROT: The Basic Step, Left Rock Turn, The Sway Step, The Promenade, Promenade with Underarm Turn, Dance Sequence #1/Tips, The Zig Zag, The Back Basic, The Dip, Dance Sequence #2/Tips• Disk 2 – WALTZ:  The box step, the Turning Box, Box with Walkaround tunr, Progressive Basic, Open Break with Underarm Turn, The Twinkle, The Promenade, The Dip, Tips• Disk 3 – SWING: Basic Step (City), Basic Step (East Coast), Release Break, Right Underarm Turn, Left Underarm turn, Right & Left Turn, The Cuddle, The Hammerlock,  Men’s Turns, Women’s Tuck & Spin, The Arm Slide, He Goes, She Goes, The Dip, Tips• Disk 4 – RUMBA: The Box Step, The Turning Box, Box with walkaround turn, Rumba Rocks, Cross Body Lead, Outside Partner Breaks, Fifth Position Breaks, Crossover Breaks, Open Break with Spot Turn, The Dip, Styling• Disk 5: WEDDING TIPS Bonus CD:  The Right Dance for You, Choosing Your Music, Band or DJ, Tips for the Dip, Stage Fright, Footwear, Alcohol, MistakesThe format of the teaching is very similar to what was done when we took classes.  In order for each step:• Introduction of step – why/when you would use it• Men’s Breakdown of the step• Woman’s Breakdown of the step• couple dancing together – no music, talking you through it• couple dancing together – with music, talking you through it►My Tips:• At the end of some of the discs, they sometimes have a tips video segment.  I would suggest watching it before you get to the end of the disc (and maybe again after you have tried it a bit)  There are some excellent tips.• The music for the menu for each disk is in the style of that dance.  It’s in a repeating loop – so use it to practice!►Conclusion: You can use this to learn to social dance for a wedding or other party – you don’t have to be the bride or groom.  Compared to the cost of lessons, this is a bargain, and you can do a few minutes a day to learn it.  It is great bonding time with your partner.  I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review based on my actual use of this product. After using it, I will tell you, IT WORKS, and this is a bargain compared to the dance lessons we took.  It’s less than signing one of us up for the community classes.  It would be a great gift for a bride to be (or groom to be), but it’s great for anyone who wants to learn to dance.  We will be using these CDs until we learn all these steps before going back to lessons.  Please let me know if this review was helpful.  I will always update if I get additional insights after further using the product, and I try to answer any questions left in comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CDZF0P7X75D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P2XNKC#wasThisHelpful","R33CDZF0P7X75D","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first words out of my daughter’s mouth when she saw this case “Wow, that is COOL!  Here did you get that?”  Loved that reaction! For me, this looks like a gadget that Darth Vadar’s Star Wars storm troopers would have had.  This case is rugged, and yet not so bulky that you can’t put it easily in a pocket.  I’ve had it on my phone for a few days, and I am enjoying it more the more I use it.Why do I like it?► Materials:  This is a dual layer case. ★PLUS!!!! ★ You can remove the black outer bumper if you would like an all white case (of course, you would sacrifice some protection).  See my pictures.  The black layer is a silky matte finish – I found myself wanting to hold onto the phone where the black wraps toward the middle of the screen.  The back of the black layer looks like tire tread (but it feels smooth & silky).  It’s a stylish industrial look.  The white layer is shiny & flexible & grippy – thick enough to have good shock absorbance.► Kickstand:  Great for watching movies on the plane, or setting on your desk with clock/weather app.  Turns you phone into a bedside alarm clock.  (I’m having fun inventing new uses for it.)  The Kickstand snaps flat securely, and they use a steel pins for the hinges (a quality touch), which should make it last longer.  Still, I am going to treat the kickstand with care – since it’s a feature I like &  I don’t want it to break.  I think they made it as sturdy as they could with the size / weight of the case, but I would not press on the top of the phone while the kickstand is out, for instance.► Ports & Fit: The case has a nice lip on the front that protects the glass screen when the case is laid face down (or if it falls face down). Its big enough to hold the glass off a table, but set back to the edge.  The only interference with function I found is that is it a bit more difficult to slide up the Control Center when in landscape mode.  In portrait mode there is no interference with sliding the control center up from the bottom.  I had no problem sliding down the Notification Center in either orientation. The covered buttons (power & volume) work well. Mute button cutout is large enough to make muting very easy (this is often not done well on sturdier cases – see my picture).  Speaker & earphone are cut out well. The case is thick enough that the camera does not stick out beyond the case. The lightning port was big enough to accommodate my Apple lightning cable as well as all of my third party cables.  I like the extra strength & protection of cutouts if they are functional.► Style: The grips on the side & back provide shock absorption, grip & style.  I like being able to remove the black part to give a more streamlined look – gives me the option of different style during the day, while still feeling my phone is protected.  I like the logo cutout – an extra they did not have to include but really adds to the look.► Conclusion: This is a sturdy, stylish kickstand case that will help keep your phone safe from the hazards of life.  I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review based on my actual use of this product. After using this phone for a few days, I am really appreciating its combination of form & function.  The kickstand feature is something I am having fun trying out in all sorts of ways.  Definitely recommend!  Please let me know if this review was helpful.

"I own a whole collection of various seasonal decorative cutters, because I love to bake, and I like my baked goods to be beautiful as well as tasty.  What I look for is a cutter that cuts AND embosses a design on top of the cutout, like these do.  Smooth plunger action & good materials (use of metal in the plunger instead of all plastic) are also things I look for and found in these cutters.  I've purchased quite a few at those overpriced kitchen stores (that I can't resist :) ).  These are a unique design & a good value.So what do I use them for?  Let me give you a few ideas.Christmas means pies & cookies.  I like to sprinkle pie cutouts on my pecan & pumpkin pies, and layer them onto the edge of the crust.  I always get OOOHS and AHHS when I bring out a pie like that.  It is  simple to do - use your pie crust scraps.  For scatter decorations (that you put on after the pie is baked) cut them & emboss them, then cook them separately on a cookie sheet.  Use the various sizes for interest & depth in your design,  To decorate the crust, layer cutouts onto the crust edge or the lattice or top crust (for double crust pies like apple).  Protect with foil if needed and bake as usual.You can even decorate streusel or crumbles with these seasonal cutouts.  Gives a very gourmet look to your cooking.  I was delighted to try these at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review.  My reviews – positive or negative – reflect my actual experiences with the product.  I will always update if I get additional insights after further using the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20Z9JVICTI6S0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5QN6VM#wasThisHelpful","R20Z9JVICTI6S0","A3718AY48HRZKA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3718AY48HRZKA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Running belts are preferable to fanny packs because they allow you to distribute the weight close to your body.  No more bumping of your phone against your body with every step.  Although I do use armbands at times, I prefer a running belt when it gets warmer.  It keeps sweaty neoprene off my bare arm.What I liked / noticed about this belt:• MATERIALS:  The outer material (that touches your skin or clothes is a  smooth The material is a smooth silky feeling Lycra / spandex.  The 2-1/2”x1-1/2” buckle & 1-1/2” strap are sturdy & good sized so they distribute pressure.  The pockets are lined with a WATER RESISTANT covering – so no rain or sweat worries for your valuables.  Great for bad weather (or bubble / color fun runs! ')  No more soggy ID!• ZIPPERS: Some running belts just have slits where the zippers are on this belt, and you flip the slits toward your body to secure your goods.  I never feel as secure with those belts.  The zippers on this belt secure the goods.  They are are  nice nylon zippers with a strip of reflective material on each side – giving a nice sliver/green/ silver effect on the one I got.• TWO GENEROUS POCKETS (9.75” & 5.25”):  I have posted photos showing my Iphone 6 laying on the pockets.  The pockets are gusseted (folded) on the back, to allow larger items to easily fit, but give a more minimal look when not full.  My Iphone 6 fit with room to spare.  When not full and folded into gussets, it is about 2” wide.  When expanded, it is about 3-1/4”, without any stretching.  I did not try stretching it.  I like to having 2 pockets so I can separate my phone from my keys.• SIZE:  When adjusted to the smallest setting, it measures 28”, and at largest setting, it measures 36”.  The belt is stretchy, but I’m not sure I would want to stretch it to 45”What matters is how it works – and the answer is GREAT!  I go out daily on a 3 mile loop, and this belt was barely noticeable on my route.  I was delighted to try this at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review.  Running gear is something that gets really used and tested at my house.  My reviews – positive or negative – reflect my actual experiences with the product.

"Great idea for keeping afloat whatever you need to protect from sinking.  I tested it in the tub to make sure it floats. PASS!!!! I like that there are two, so you can float heavier items by using them together, or float two smaller items.  Great for my waterproof camera, but it also can be used for anything you don’t want to sink to the bottom of the pool/pond/ocean.  Kids toys, hats, and all those loose items in boats.  Be sure to test that the weight of the item can be floated by these before you are on/in the water.  You can use multiple floats for heavier items.  (Bathtub is a good way to test - I was surprised at how much weight these could float!)I have a picture showing it on my wrist – it should fit a good sized wrist.

"Like many other reviewers, I have a love/hate relationship with the Assassin's Creed series. I marveled at the first one, but have been disillusioned ever since. There's so much I want to like about it and, when I compare it to the last couple releases, I want to give it 5 stars for effort. But just like in school, we're not graded on our performance against ourselves, but where we should be among our peers. And Assassin's Creed Syndicate is just pulling a C average when I look at it across the landscape of other Xbox One games.For starters, UBI Soft really needs to fix the controls. They're so tedious, they completely impede game play. Like its predecessors, I find myself giving up after I've nearly finished a scenario because my character did not respond to my inputs in the way I intended. There are many other games out there that are models of complexity where you never once feel like your character has a mind of its own and fights against your every wish. I offer up Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 4: Two of Assassin's Creed Syndicate's competitors that are doing it well.Aside from the controls, there are other blunders: Why do I have to play both Frye twins? I want to use the stealthy Evie exclusively, but then I'm forced to play some scenarios with her melee-specialized brother. This is silly. Let me stick with my play style.The game is beautiful and the story telling is rich, but it's hard to immerse yourself in the world when the game pulls you out of the moment by fighting against your actions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KIRM1AH9VGM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X87MH0I#wasThisHelpful","R1KIRM1AH9VGM7","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using B+W filters for my Nikon gear exclusively for over a decade. They're well made and have the finely crafted feel you associate with high-end electronics like Leica. This is important with Circular Polarizers because they need to be tactile and agile, but also hold small adjustments. This filter handles all of that well. But what's most impressive is B+W's new line of filters doesn't sacrifice the f-stops that previous generations did. I love this!

"I've been wearing the UP2 for three weeks now. I own multiple FitBit products and an Apple Watch. I find that I use the UP2 for my everyday, always-on tracking, but my Apple Watch for specific, exercise related tracking (I use a rowing machine, and the UP2 doesn't support it).Here are my impressions of the UP2:// PROSSTYLE: Love the simplicity of the grey  band. It's not bulky and is barely noticeable throughout your day. I wear mine with the clasp on the outside and it looks stylish.WATER RESISTANT: Since I received my UP2 for review, I decided I wouldn't go easy on it. I've saturated the fitness band with three weeks of long, hot showers and it's doing just fine.KEEP IT ON 24/7: Because I can wear it in the shower, I'm able to leave the band on 24/7. A great feature because it garners a more accurate representation of the steps I take. (Whereas my Apple Watch is frequently off my wrist when I'm home.)BATTERY LIFE: So far I'm getting about 7 days per charge. Pretty good, but significantly less than the 10 days it advertises. Even still, I love that I can leave this on my wrist all week and take it off for about an hour each weekend to charge it up.SLEEP MONITOR: Again with the 24/7 wearability! I can't leave my Apple Watch on at night because it needs to charge. So UP2 grabs all of my sleep activity (or inactivity, I should say). It's light and small so I don't notice I'm wearing it.// CONSSLOW DATA EXCHANGE WITH PHONE: For some reason it takes forever for my UP2 to exchange data with my iPhone 6. It's one of the most annoying aspects of the product. Sometimes I just want to do a quick check on where I am with my activity and it's more of a process than I'd like.LOSING IT'S SHAPE AFTER TWO WEEKS: My band is definitely stretching out and morphing a bit, so it looks less elegant. Fortunately it's easy to resize, but the rubber is a bit misshapen after three weeks. (I'll update here if it gets much worse.)Overall, this is a great band. For the price, I'd like to see it connect with my phone a little faster so I can check my progress more quickly and easily since there isn't a light-weight progress indicator on the band itself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZIM8BVU0BNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIG8S#wasThisHelpful","RWZIM8BVU0BNX","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peace of mind found. I've had ""Buy earthquake food"" on my to-do list ever since The New Yorker made all of us Seattleites crazy with its 2015 article about the Sub-Cascadian rupture that's expected to devastate the Pacific Northwest. Problem is, when you live in a city you don't have a lot of space for emergency supplies, so storing a bunch of canned food was stressing me out.Enter Mountain House Just-In Case. The box is light weight and about the size of two large shoe boxes. It's easy to store up high where it can be out of sight, out of mind. I tucked mine away on a top shelf in my pantry with a case of bottled water. And guess what? Mountain House Just-In Case Emergency Food Supply will last for 12 years. That's right, 12 years! Yes, the price is high, but think about all money you'll save over time versus storing a bunch of cans that need to be replaced every year. (Just don't forget to do what I did and store some bottled water with your box, since each of these meals requires that you add water. You might also want to store a camping stove and some gas, because hey, who knows what will work come ""the big one"".)All in all, I love that this box just solved my emergency food supply dilemma and I won't have to buy another for 12 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNZIABC4QUZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ER40RI#wasThisHelpful","R3CNZIABC4QUZK","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I initially had a false start with this game. My friends and I sat down to play it and we just could not understand it with the supplied instructions, so we punted and played something else. A few weeks later, determined to play the game, I sat down with a different group of friends. This time, we watched some helpful YouTube videos and we're off and running. (Seriously folks, the directions in the box are horrible. Check out some online videos and the game will make sense in no time.)My litmus test for a great board game is this: Do I want to play it again immediately after finishing? The answer for Homeland is an emphatic yes! Once you get the hang of it, it's actually quite easy to play and there's a lot of strategy. The fact that you're working as a team with a possible mole thwarting your every move adds some fantastic drama.The gameplay is multi-layered and reminiscent of Pandemic. In addition, the gaming ""engine"" provides a great balance between strategy and randomization making for dramatic twists and turns.

"This is a sweet little game that's easy to pick up. It's perfect for families with older children or adult friends that are looking for something that's easy to teach new players. The negotiation aspect of the game will reveal the personality traits of the people you're playing with--some strive for fairness, others greed, and still others just latch on to a favorite treasure color. The game takes about 30 minutes to play thanks to the egg timer, which keeps negotiation time to a minimum.Overall the game art and pieces are well designed and fun to play with.

"These headphones are vastly superior to the headset Microsoft provides with Xbox One. That said, there's room for improvement. I've used the headphones for a week now with Elder Scrolls Online and Destiny on the Xbox, as well as a couple of phone calls on my iPhone. Here's my experience:// PROSCOMFORT: My biggest complete about the headset that comes with your console is that it's incredibly uncomfortable. The Recon 50X will be an immediate improvement in that department. The phones fit over your ears and provide a cushioned experience that's common to more expensive sets.COST: At this price, the headset is worth the investment for the comfort upgrade alone.SOUND QUALITY: Voices are clear on both ends of these phones, vastly improve communication when compared with the included headset.// CONSSOUND VOLUME: I've used these headphones as the sole source of sound and with the TV on providing surround sound in addition to the headset. They don't provide noise cancelling, so they work best worn in quiet room. That said, even in a quiet room they seem a touch underpowered.MICROPHONE: The microphone is large. It can be a bit distracting. You ""self bend"" it into a position that's right for you, but it does seem more obtrusive than it needs to be.Overall, the headphones are a great deal and an inexpensive upgrade if you find yourself playing multiplayer games. I wouldn't invest in them for anything but gaming, as they're too underpowered to act as headphones for music and video.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VF5N18EKPBR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5U40#wasThisHelpful","R3VF5N18EKPBR1","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fantastic addition to my kitchen. I love this multi cooker. Here's why:EVEN COOKING: The wide, low profile cooking ""pan"" maximizes the cooking surface, whereby ensuring that everything is heated and heated thoroughly.GREAT LOOKS:  I keep the cooker on the corner of my counter between my stovetop and my sink. It fits in perfectly with my stainless appliances and has a minimalist/industrial look.EASY CLEANING: The non-stick surface of the cooking pan is easy to clean. I cooked some chili yesterday and even though it was cooking all day, clean up only took a few minutes. In addition, the pan is so light weight compared to ceramic models--much easier to hand wash in the sink and you don't have to worry about chipping it.OVEN REPLACEMENT ON A HOT SUMMER DAY: Such a perfect way to cook food on a hot summer day.

"I feed my cat Weruva wet food in the morning for her main meal and then give her a handful of kibble in the evening so she won't wake me up for a midnight feeding. I used to be pretty laissez-faire about what I fed her in the evening, after all it was just a snack and as long as she was willing to eat it that was good enough for me. However, she started to develop a pretty severe dandruff problem, so I've been more careful to keep her off of grains and fillers that seem to exacerbate the problem. Unfortunately, the most recent food I tried brought back the dander with a vengeance. Wellness CORE Natural Grain Free to the rescue.

"I played the PC version for a while and took advantage of Bethesda's offer to transfer my account over to my Xbox One console. Quite frankly, I tired of ESO Online pretty shortly after I started playing it nearly a year and a half ago. I was disappointed and found the game to pale in comparison to the other games in the Elder Scrolls series. I was still disappointed (too many connection issues) when I first tried it on Xbox and let my copy languish on my machine for a while. It was initially buggy and reminded me of everything that made my initial experience with ESO less than stellar.A month later I picked it up again and now I'm loving it and totally hooked. This is a fantastic port! Bethesda has ironed out the connection issues that plagued the game when it was first released. In addition, the console port fixes a lot of the tedium that was bogging down the PC version. ESO for Xbox One is a blast! It reminds me of all the joy I had with my favorite Elder Scrolls game, Morrowind. It's gorgeous, responsive, and using the game controller makes it much more fun than trying to slog away on the keyboard.If you haven't tried it yet and you're a fan of the series, you won't go wrong with this version.

"I read China Mieville's ""The City and The City"" shortly before I read this collection. If you appreciated the complexity of ""The City and The City"", you'll enjoy Three Moments of an Explosion.As I learned with ""The City and The City"", Mieville doesn't believe in spelling everything out for the reader. This is particularly true of many of the stories in this collection. They are often difficult narratives that require an attentive reader. You're often left to fill in the blanks (or even the endings) with your own imagination. But when you do, you're rewarded with some fantastic imagery that perhaps, like me, you'll carry with you.Overall I am impressed with the quality and quantity of this book.

"My cat's primary meal of the day is Weruva canned food. She gets half a can each morning. The food is dense and whole and made in a human-grade food processing factory. Each evening, when I come home from work, I feed here half a cup of dry food. It keeps her from waking me up at the crack of dawn to ask for her wet food. She'll eat almost all dry foods, only occasionally does she dislike one. When I fed her the Purina Pro Plan, she loved it.Purina's come a long way over the years. They've, obviously, completely rebranded and are trying to strike a cord with high-end cat food buyers. As other reviewers have noted, this isn't the most ""whole"" food on the market, so I wouldn't feel comfortable with this as my cat's only source of food, but it's likely one of the better options if you're on a budget or otherwise limited to grocery-store variety cat food.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35L7Z1QDZG5Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVMMK7Q#wasThisHelpful","R35L7Z1QDZG5Q9","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this for two things: (1)  Travel and (2) to hold my iPad in front of my ergometer while I work out.I recently took the RND Compact Power Station to Mexico for a week. It was ideal. I had USB ports to charge my devices bedside and could still plug in the light fixture in my room. The size of the Station fits easily in a bag. (Note it does require a grounded outlet, so if you're traveling somewhere that may not have them, bring an adapter.)As an iPad shelf, this thing is fantastic. I workout with a product called ""BitGym"" that allows me to ""tour"" scenic places while I work out. BitGym measure how quickly I'm rowing on my ergometer using the iPad's camera, so I needed something to hold it in front of the machines. This RND Compace Power Station works perfectly. Plus it charges my iPad at the same time. Love it.Overall these are a great solution for any room. If you're an Android and/or Kindle user, the charger is built in.

"As a Vine reviewer, I am required to post a review after 30 days. Because this is well under the manufacturer's suggested time with the product, this review only covers my first experience with the NuFace itself, not its effectiveness.PROSBUILD QUALITY: Other reviewers have complained about the build quality of the NuFACE, but I think it's quite nice and, as a designer, I have a pretty high bar. Granted, it looks a bit like a frog, but overall it's quite nice.ERGONOMICS: The NuFACE feels good in the hand.CONSCHARGING LIGHT: Why oh why do products intended for bedrooms and bathrooms insist on bright, blue lights? Studies show that blue light triggers the brain to wake up. The light the NuFACE emits while charging is bright enough to illuminate my entire (rather large) master bathroom. I really don't need a ""Facial Trainer"" to be the most prominent thing in my bathroom. Nor do I need it to trigger me to wake up every time I make a midnight pitstop. Silly and unnecessary.UNCOMFORTABLE: This isn't the most comfortable treatment. You'll feel a mild sting throughout the process. And if you have a problem with acne, forget about it.

"I've owned a small Jawbone Jambox and a Jabra Soulmate. The Braven LUX borrows from the best of the two.AESTHETICS: The LUX is classy piece of industrial design. It looks sculptural and comes in finishes that are very on trend.CONNECTIVITY: This is a mixed bag. I had no problems connecting to iOS; however, getting the LUX to connect to an Android was a huge ordeal. While iOS took about 2 minutes, Android took over 20 minutes.SOUND: The LUX doesn't have the bass you get with the Soulmate. It more resembles the sound from the small Jambox. I find that if you properly position it near a wall on a resonant surface, you can make it sound pretty good.VIBRATION: I had issues with my Jambox vibrating off of surfaces. The Soulmate designers over compensate for Jambox's flaw by creating a show-like, rubber ""soul"". This worked, but was ugly. The Braven LUX solved this problem elegantly. The rubber foot is more of a perch that's barely noticeable.SIZE: It's the size of a small Jambox. I like that I can connect the LUX to my iPhone and carry them around together as I'm moving through the house listening to a podcast. In addition, it's a great size for travel. The LUX will easily slip into a carry on.Overall, I love it!

"After a week of tracking what I eat for my nutritionist, she told me I need to get a lot more protein at breakfast. Coincidentally, she recommended a protein powder and Amazon Vine  already had the Vega One All-in-One en route. My nutritionist read the label and gave it a hearty two thumbs up. Here's my experience:VEGAN AND GLUTEN FREE: I'm allergic to dairy and gluten and my nutritionist told me to stay off the soy. Very limiting when it comes to all-in-one solutions. Not so with the Vega One. It doesn't have any of these items and it's fully vegan.DECENT TASTE: I'm using the Natural. It's not too sweet or too chalky--two things that usually turn me off of mixes like these. In fact, I like it straight up with water, but you can mix it into a traditional smoothie or some almond milk if you're not a fan of the taste.LOTS OF PROTEIN AND FIBER: One serving has 20g of protein and 6g of fiber. Exactly what my nutritionist was looking to add to my typical breakfast of steel-cut oatmeal.EASY TO MAKE AND STORE: It takes 5 seconds to pull this off your pantry shelf, throw a scoop in a glass, and add some water. If you're looking to supplement your diet, this is an incredibly easy way to go.REASONABLY PRICED: The 15.2 oz, small tub comes with 39 portions. At the list price, that a dollar per shake. Not bad when you compare it to similar, pre-made retail products. At Amazon's price it's significantly less.Overall, I'm excited to find a shake my nutritionist approves of that is allergen-free, easy to make, and tastes good. Thanks Vega!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TV9SEWYYWS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y12VA#wasThisHelpful","R3TV9SEWYYWS2","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The BLU Vivo Air is a smart choice for any Apple fanboy or girl to venture into the world of Android. It has the look and feel of an iPhone right down to the unboxing. After a week with Vivo Air, I'm happy to say I like it. A lot. However it has a few significant flaws that have me reaching for my iPhone after a week with it. Please note that I'm not going to make any comments here about Google's Android OS (because this is a review of the hardware and apps endemic to BLU):// PROSLOOK AND FEEL: This is a gorgeous phone. It's incredibly light-weight and just stunning. I love how it slips into my pocket and barely makes a bump. It has the outward craftsmanship  you expect from Apple.SCREEN: Gorgeous. Photos and text are crisp. A side-by-side comparison with my iPhone 6 Plus and they rendered identically. Not bad at all for the price...which brings me to:COST: $200 unlocked is a flat-out bargain for a smartphone of this caliber. Nice job BLU.CONNECTIVITY: Fantastic! I had fewer issues with WiFi and cellular than I've had with all of my previous phones. BLU definitely got this right.INCLUDED EXTRAS: It comes with a case and a screen protector in addition to the charger and headphones. Really nice perk. I only used the case and it's quite nice. Certainly good in a pinch until you find something that makes better sense for you.BATTERY: The battery life is decent considering I run my phone with every possible signal at full blast and hunting for connections. Why not? This era is about the connected self and I want to take advantage of it: Bluetooth to my Fitbit, Waze on GPS while I'm driving, and so on.// CONSSPEAKER: This is the first thing that irritated me. The speaker is terrible. Calls on speakerphone are very hard to hear. If you use your phone for GPS in your car, forget about it. This is clearly a place where BLU had to make some cuts to keep the phone thin.CAMERA: The photos out of this phone left me wanting. They're not horrible, but also not on par with what I expect in 2015. I tried a few camera apps from the Play Store and it's definitely the hardware. That said, I could totally live with this when traveling because I always have a camera with me.USER INTERFACE: BLU's on-board apps are terrible. I still cringe ever single time I get a call. In fact, when I first received a call I had absolutely no idea how to answer it. This strange card bounces up and down and you have to drag it. Not at all intuitive. (Absolutely no way to one-hand a phone call.) In fact, most of the time I just call people right back because I don't get the interface. There's something a little off about all of BLU's apps. Yes,  you can replace them from the Play Store, but you always have to deal with them in some way, at some point, since you can't delete them.SIM TRAY: Be careful here. The SIM tray has a tendency to get stuck. As someone that plans to use this phone for travel, I will be swapping a card pretty regularly. I found the only way I can get the card out is to use the SIM remover to pop the tray out as far as it will go, which for me is about the depth of a dime, and then press downward on that ledge with a micro screwdriver I uses for my glasses. It took me hours to figure this out.// SUMMARYThis is a fantastic phone for the price. Four stars because there is room for improvement with the speaker, the camera, the UI and the SIM tray. However, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone to any Android user (or iPhone user for that matter). It's a great deal and perfect if you want to stay off contract or replace an on-contract phone before your contract is up. I'm going to be using this as my travel phone. It's so thin and light it's perfect for on-the-go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AMJD1COR49CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5C3BCY#wasThisHelpful","R3AMJD1COR49CR","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the Pro-ject Debut Carbon for about four months. I set the TEAC TN-300 up adjacent to the Pro-Ject. I listened to a dozen albums on both decks hooked up to an Arcam A85 amp and Blumenstein speakers. Here's my assessment:SOUND: Both decks have great sound at this price point. I used the on-board preamp on the TEAC and a Behringer Microphono PP400 with the Pro-ject. The output was essentially equal. I'd say the TEAC sounds slightly warmer. The Ortofon 2M cartridge that comes with the Pro-ject is supposed to be better than the  Audio-Technica AT95E, but I'm not hearing it. Winner: TieUSABILITY: This is where the TEAC blows away the Pro-ject. It's significantly easier to use the TEAC. The on/off switch is on top of the deck; whereas the Pro-ject's is underneath. The TEAC's cue lever has a richer feel to it and the tone arm has more presence. If you want to listen to 45 rpm records on the Pro-ject it's an ordeal. You have to take the platter off and move the belt (this doesn't sound like as much of a nuisance as it becomes, trust me). On the TEAC, the rpm switch is adjacent to the on/off switch. I tested a long-playing 45 rpm on both decks and it was so wonderful to just flip the switch on the TEAC. Winner: Hand's down the TEAC.APPEARANCE: What drew me to the Pro-ject Debut Carbon was its simple aesthetic. It really is a gorgeous piece of artwork for the minimalist at heart. The TEAC is a beautiful machine in its own right (it has a 70's feel, which I love), but there's something sculptural about the Pro-ject that I find more compelling. Winner: Pro-jectVIBRATION: The Pro-ject deck is more substantial. However, its sturdiness makes it prone to vibration. The TEAC's lighter and is coupled with shock absorbent feet that really do work. Winner: TEACSETUP: The counterbalance and anti-skating were significantly easier to setup on the TEAC. In my time with the Pro-ject I've had trouble with the anti-skate weight coming loose--it's held in place by a piece of fishing line. Winner: TEACEXTRAS: Both decks come with dust covers. The Pro-ject's includes an unsightly logo on top. The TEAC's comes with some useful, rubber feet. The TEAC also includes a rubber mat that is substantially nicer than the flimsy piece of felt that comes with the Pro-ject (you'll have to replace it because it will cling to your records). The TEAC also comes with an electrical cord with swappable US and European plugs. Both units include cables, but the Pro-ject's has built-in grounding wires. The TEAC includes a USB cable. (For the record, I think TEAC could have left out the USB functionality as I suspect its superfluous quality will turn off purists.) Winner: TEACSUMMARY: Overall I'm actually quite surprised I'm giving this one to TEAC. I'm torn because I truly love the simple look of my white, Pro-ject deck, but I've fallen for the usability and slightly warmer sound of the TEAC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WYKYE1QMR8GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9WK1BW#wasThisHelpful","R2WYKYE1QMR8GK","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to use a traditional pay-per-month system from a big-name security company. However, the system was prone to false alarms, sending the police out and regularly netting me a ticket. The cost of the tickets coupled with the monthly charge and general hassle became to much. Enter SABRE wireless alarms. I've been using a SABRE system for a couple of years now and it's great.PROS1. GREAT FOR PETS: If you have pets, motion-sensitive systems are a no-go. With a SABRE system, you can alarm all of your windows and doors without the need for a motion detector (the go-to choice of monitored systems) or invasive wiring.2. SIMPLE: Put the alarms where you need them, using a very light-weight, unobtrusive setup. Door alarm is simple and the minimal keypad is all that's needed.3. SET AND FORGET: Until the batteries need refreshing, you can pretty much set these alarms on your first floor windows and forget about them. No other maintenance is required.4. EXPANDABLE: Need more units? Add more units. You can also mix and match from different similar companies based on your needs.5. LOUD: When activated, these are loud. Great for deterring theft, but don't forget to tell visitors, house keepers, and family members that you've installed these. Otherwise you might subject someone to heart failure.CONS1. DOOR UNIT HEFT: The door unit is clunky and a bit unsightly.I've recommended SABRE systems to several of my friends and everyone's been happy with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ABUUPS2G40EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M30SHFU#wasThisHelpful","R2ABUUPS2G40EZ","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a Seattleite and avid Sleater-Kinney fan in the 90s, I was a bit skeptical about the stalwart riotgrrls return. Could they revive their classic sound a decade later? Should they?This album is a definite departure from the Sleater-Kinney we once knew. While they didn't completely divorce from Corin's signature caterwauling or the staccato of Carrie's guitar riffs, they substantially massaged these hallmark sounds to produce their most refined and mature album to date.No Cities To Love is filled with a new-found musicality that will please old fans and welcome many new ones.

"My adult acne results from a combination of stress and hormones. So far, I'm having good results with this system. It's been almost 30 days, and took about 25 to really start working. I actually like it when a product takes a while to work because the effects usually last longer. Some highlights from my experience:1. PERFECT SCENT PROFILE: Finally a product that doesn't smell like cheap perfume. The Benzac system has a pleasant, herbal scent that smells great going on your body but quickly fades. Fantastic. I'm so tired of products trying to compete to be THE smell on my body. Hey companies: I choose cologne for that. I don't want to smell like my acne product. Ok?2. BALANCED AMOUNT OF PRODUCT: This system comes with three steps. I've tried many multi-step systems and I dislike it when one or two bottles run out way before the other(s). It ends up being wasteful--particularly with products that are only sold in kits. The Benzac system is well balanced--the bottles are each about 2/3rds empty after a month of daily use.3. SKIN ISN'T OVERLY DRY: We all know that acne systems dry out your skin and can create a vicious cycle of clearing your skin only to have the requisite moisturizing create further acne troubles. This system isn't drying my skin out like others do. I love that the lotion aspect goes on lightly and leaves my skin feeling soft.I think this is a system I will continue using. It's reasonably priced and has good results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG5EJG8I8L9KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON1VGT6#wasThisHelpful","RG5EJG8I8L9KG","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I buy delicious organic corn in bulk at my local natural foods store, add 1/2 a cup to two TBs of olive oil, 2.5 minutes in the microwave and voila!

"Not what I expected at all! The scent of this product anything but subtle. I couldn't detect a hint of lavender or chamomile. The smell is more akin to the extreme air fresheners found in bathrooms at airports and stadiums.I can't imagine anything about this ZzzQuil product is good for you--the box even tells you not to touch the pads and to wash your skin if it comes in contact with the pads. Really? How are you supposed to get them in there? In addition, we know it's certainly not real lavender and chamomile that could warrant such a warning. What's actually in this thing?

"I just finished using the Tacwise to reupholster four dining room chairs. Here's my experience:PROS• Inexpensive.• It's lightweight and reasonably comfortable.• Easy to use.CONS• Feels cheap and not very durable.•Lacks power.

Not only does the Taylor scale look gorgeous in my bathroom—like a floating piece of silver glass—but the digital output is fast and accurate. The surface area is large making it easy to stumble onto in the morning and the digits are large enough to read without my glasses. Excellent.Only negative: The surface is SLICK.

"As a professional user experience designer, I've been evaluating prototyping tools for my team to use. Since my company subscribes to Adobe Creative Cloud, I decided to give Muse a try.What Asch offers us is a step-by-step tutorial for how to build a pre-packaged, 2004-era website. I'm not sure how the title can be called ""Creative Web Design"" when it's basically a paint-by-numbers book to build exactly one website--the one supplied by the author.  In addition, the workflow it proposes doesn't work with the actual process of conceptualizing a site and building it from scratch. It only works with this kit-of-parts approach to build the tutorial site. Frankly, I wouldn't even recommend this book to someone looking to get into web design because the tutorial workflow would only establish bad habits.I found myself frustrated from the moment I opened the book. I was expecting to use the book to help me translate my already vast of creative web design into Muse. But the book offered no help there, because it's organized in a way that only fosters building the sample site. I found myself wondering why Asch didn't take a more task-based approach that explained things like how to use Muse to setup your information architecture. What to do to translate existing web pages or content into the Muse environment. And how the software's new design environment might fit into an existing workflow.Overall, this book is a poor choice for the professional or anyone with web experience that's interested in adding Adobe Muse to his or her toolkit. If the title were more up front about what the book is, I could give this more stars.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP73RZNIIQSDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415811791#wasThisHelpful","RP73RZNIIQSDI","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I reconfigured my den to install this projector and centered my system around Apple's Airplay. My goals were to (1) keep the system simple with as few wires as possible, (2) focus on setup for movies, assuming that live tv, games, and sports would remain in the living room, and (3) compliment the projector with equipment I already have. Here's what I came up with:WALL MOUNTFirst things first, I needed to mount it. I used the Cheetah Mounts AS1S Single Shelf TV Component Wall Mount Shelving Bracket with 18x16"" Shelf, 15' Twisted Veins HDMI Cable and Cable Management for Cable or Satellite Box, DVD Player, Game Station, Receiver, etc., and Compatible with all LCD LED Plasma F... and it fits perfectly. I'm projecting directly onto a wall with light, taupe paint that's about the same hue as a silver screen. The image is crisp and clear and Epson provides a variety of ways to fine tune your image to your configuration and lighting situation.The PowerLite 3000 comes with two HDMI inputs. I dedicated one to an Apple TV MD199LL/A (Current Version) and attached the 15-foot HDMI cable that came with my Cheetah Mounts shelf to the other (to give me the option to attach my Macbook Air). The tiny Apple TV sits neatly behind my projector on the shelf.AUDIOThe PowerLite 3000 doesn't come with audio out, so you either need to incorporate an A/V receiver between your sources and the projector or use a system built around a wireless technology like Airplay. I chose the latter since I already have an A/V receiver setup in my living room and I didn't want to either invest in or give space over to another one.As a result, I decided to build my sound system around a Tivoli Audio Model Two AM / FM Radio, Black/Silver Finish and Tivoli Audio Model Subwoofer (Walnut/Beige) connected to an Apple AirPort Express Base Station (MC414LL/A) for 2.1 audio. The Tivoli over Airplay provides a beautiful, warm sound reminiscent of a movie theater. (In addition, it's a great little music system for iTunes via the same setup.)APPLE TV (AND HOW I GET AMAZON PRIME)Apple TV gives me my primary sources of movie content (i.e., Netflix, HBO Go, and Showtime Anytime); however, it lacks Amazon Prime Video. Amazon's iOS apps allow you to use Airplay via Apple TV to play Prime content. However, I had significant trouble with audio sync (Airplay from iOS to Apple TV to Airport Express broke down). In order to access Amazon Prime, I've been using my Macbook Air connected to an HDMI cable with one of these: AmazonBasics Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt) to HDMI Adapter. For audio, I unplug the 3.5mm cable from my Airport and plug it into the Air. It's not pretty, but it keeps the audio in sync and the picture is quite good.ROKUBecause I already have a Roku 3500R Streaming Stick (HDMI), I plugged it in and was able to get excellent video quality out of the Epson, unfortunately, the Roku won't broadcast audio to the Airport, so requires an A/V receiver.CONCLUSIONOverall I'm thrilled with this projector. It's perfect for any movie enthusiast that wants a projector that is focused on throwing up a fantastic picture. It is not intended to be the hub of your system and will require an A/V receiver to output wired sound. However, pairing it with an Airplay system is a great way to avoid the bulk and cost of an A/V receiver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMGGGZQWEZVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJTXWOA#wasThisHelpful","RSMGGGZQWEZVD","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this spill-proof travel mug and haven't had any of the upper-lip-burn problems that other reviewers mentioned.PROS1. SPILL PROOF--In locked position, I carried this thing around upside down to see if it would spill. Nope! Leak free. I would actually carry this mug INSIDE my bag. I'm that confident it won't spill.2. CLEAN DESIGN--Very simple and attractive design.3. CLEVER SEAL--It took a bit of getting used to, but opening the mug by popping the SnapSeal is a great way to keep the area of the mug that touches your mouth clean. In addition, I loathe that the seals on other mugs flip down and hit my upper lip or nose as I'm drinking. Really great design.4. MAINTAINS TEMPERATURE--I filled the mug with coffee and it was still hot after four hours of opening and closing the seal.5. EASY TO CLEAN--The mouth piece of this mug is very easy to keep clean.CONS1. SNAPSEAL A LITTLE TIGHT--Sometimes the SnapSeal can be a little difficult to pop when you're driving. It's tight. But that also means it prevents spills.Priced about 30% below the travel mug I used to use, I'd definitely recommend trying this mug to see if it's right for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFDLF9OSWWTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR77HFE#wasThisHelpful","R1KFDLF9OSWWTJ","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Cascade Complete pods (one down from this Platinum) since my local big-box membership club started carrying them. For this review I was able to compare Cascade Complete to Cascade Platinum by doing back-to-back loads of dishes in a Fisher & Paykel dishwasher. I typically include two sections in my reviews: Pros and Cons. However, I don't have a single negative to report with Cascade Platinum pods.CONVENIENT: I am sold on all things ""pod"". I use pods for my dishwasher and washing machine. They prevent mess and eliminate the need to measure products. I'll never go back to traditional powdered or liquid products.CLEAN: Both Cascade Complete and Platinum clean your dishes exceptionally well.* I am not particularly good at pre-rinsing my dishes and Cascade is able to handle crusted on items. Since I started using Cascade pods, my glassware looks fantastic.DISHWASHER CLEAN: Cascade Platinum advertises (see photo in photos section) that it cleans your dishwasher in addition to cleaning your dishes. I have noticed that my dishwasher is cleaner since I switched to the Platinum pods.Overall,  I'm completely sold on Cascade pods for my dishwasher.If you're curious about the difference between Complete and Platinum, I posted a side-by-side picture coupled with a feature comparison chart in the photos section to accompany this review.* According to the comparison chart (see photo in photos section), Platinum adds ""Sparkling Clean Silverware"" and ""Helps Keep Dishwasher Sparkling"". I compared my silverware from two similar loads, one using Complete and one using Platinum. I didn't notice either batch having more ""sparkle"", but overall the Platinum seemed a little cleaner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VXTKK26IPXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFR1HJM#wasThisHelpful","R10VXTKK26IPXN","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to use Feline Pine, but my little adopted cat was declawed and the Feline Pine pellets hurt her feet. So I moved to a litter that is gentler on her feet. I was hoping this Paper Cat Litter would be a nice compromise: Soft on the cats feet with the feel-good benefits of a natural litter, like Feline Pine. There's a lot to like about this litter, but I'm not completely sold. Here's why:THE GOOD1. LIGHT-WEIGHT BOX: Litters are typically so heavy. To get a reasonable supply, I often risk throwing out my back. okocat Natural Paper Cat Litter feels feather-like in comparison.2. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: You can feel good using this product because it's recycled.THE BAD1. PELLETS EVERYWHERE. The pellets are all over the house. For some reason, the paper sticks to my cat.2. DIFFICULT TO SCOOP. The litter doesn't break down well, so scooping ends up removing more of the good pellets than the bad.3. SMELLY. Doesn't mask the smell as well as litters like Feline Pine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KJAY8KQRMKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYI0O2E#wasThisHelpful","R1KJAY8KQRMKK","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm giving these treats 3 start--the average of two reviews from two separate cats.THE ONE STAR REVIEWLet's start with my cat. I saved these for the most stressful of all days: The Fourth of July. I couldn't imagine a more perfect test case. Unfortunately, when I called her to the treating zone in my house and presented two of the Calming treats, she sniffed them, made the most disgusted face I'd ever seen her make, backed up, and ran away. Well, that was a surprise coming from a cat that will try anything.THE FIVE STAR REVIEWAfter my cat's disgusted response, I brought the treats over to my friends' house. Their cat loves them and responded well to them and remained social during a rather large BBQ (an event that would typically result in hiding).Hopefully your cat will have the positive experience that my friends' cat had!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MNXOXMZDRAQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011DHJ2W#wasThisHelpful","R1MNXOXMZDRAQI","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a single negative to report. I recently tired of lugging my DSLR around and picked up a Sony DSC-RX100M II. With my DSLR, I didn't mind carrying a little box filled with SD cards because I typically carried a camera bag as well. With the tiny Sony, I only carry the camera, so having one, huge, Class 10 SD card that could hold a week's worth of vacation photos is exactly what I needed.I've taken photos at two weddings and a few other outings with the 64GB Pro SDXC and I'm thrilled. I've been able to snap quick photos with no write delay, take some videos, and generally just use my camera exactly as I want to. But where this card has really shined in my workflow is when I get home. I can pop the card out of my camera, pop it into my Mac, and Aperture pulls the images of the card with speeds I haven't seen before. In the past, I've typically plugged the card in my computer and left to do other things because it would take ages to transfer the images. Now I can wait and watch as the image pour off the card quickly.

"UPDATE: Changing from 3 stars to 1 star. Soap is seeping into the bottom of other compartments because of poor workmanship. Throwing it in the trash! What a waste.___Does a nice job of gathering together a few of the things that typically clutter up a kitchen or bathroom counter. Coincidentally, my bathroom soap dispenser broke just before this caddy arrived. So I had a need for it. I probably wouldn't have chosen this one because the price is a little high for a plastic soap dispenser. Here are my thoughts:PROS* Nice to have two containers to corral things like tooth brushes, combs, hair brushes, and cotton swabs.* Great space saver for a small spot by the bathroom sink.CONS* Should cost half the price. The unit is made of light-weight plastic.* The worst problem I've found is that the pump doesn't screw into place. It just sits on top of the soap dispenser. Anytime you want to move something from another compartment, you risk dislodging the pump. Obviously this can be a messy situation as the tube that dangles from the pump can fling soap everywhere.Overall, it's a pretty clever design, but it needs a few refinements in build quality to make it worth this price point.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15B3OP4FYEFJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF0FGPU#wasThisHelpful","R15B3OP4FYEFJ6","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First the good: The smell and texture of this product is outstanding. I've been using similar, much more expensive products by Kiehl's and Vivite and this has the best texture. It's cooling, feels great on the skin, is organic, and not tested on animals. At this price point I was looking forward to replacing those other products.Now the bad: You can imagine my disappointment when after several days of using it, my face and neck broke out severely.Even though my experience was poor, I'm giving it three stars because I think the product is good and my experience isn't the norm--just try it on a small patch of skin for a few days before you slather it on like I did!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GF9PADWFWRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CZR3Y0#wasThisHelpful","R14GF9PADWFWRG","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a few iHomes and this is the first one that feels substantial and not like another piece of landfill plastic.PROS• PLUG AND PLAY: Snapped my iPhone into place and the clock immediately synced. I was able to enjoy music from my iPhone seconds later.• BUILD QUALITY: The unit feels solid and the buttons are tactile and have the right amount of play.• APPEARANCE: Looks great. The unit has a nice, small footprint that is suitable for a nightstand or desk (where I have mine).• SOUND: The sound is very similar to a Jambox; ergo, it's quite good for the small size. In fact, I'm surprised by how much base this iHome puts out (particularly when situated close to a wall).• WORKS WITH CASE: I had to slightly modify my iPhone's case by trimming the plastic a bit around the lightning jack, but otherwise it works just fine with the case on.CONS• CONFUSING BUTTONS: The ""-"" and ""+"" buttons are used to change FM stations and to skip tracks on your iPhone/iPod. However, those icons and their placement are confusing. I keep hitting them to adjust the volume and end up skipping tracks or changing channels.• NO AUX JACK: It would be nice to have an AUX jack for easy use with non-Lightning music players (i.e., this is pretty standard fare and found on Jamboxes to Tivoli radios).Overall, a great little unit. Mine's in my office and I'm enjoying the new Lana Del Rey as I write this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9MMHMBE0YKIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HBJRV5K#wasThisHelpful","R9MMHMBE0YKIC","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of Manhattan Portage. I've owned several of their bags. I've only ever replaced an MP bag because it no longer suited my needs, never because it showed signs of wear.This time around I wanted a simple, stylish backpack in black.PROS1. TIMELESS: The look of the bag is timeless.2. VERSATILE: The simplicity of the bag makes it ideal for many purposes--travel, book bag, gym bag, electronics, and so on.3. LARGE BUCKET COMPARTMENT: The main compartment is nice and large. The drawstring coupled with the secure top flap make anything in the main pocket safe from rain and prying hands. I can fit a sweatshirt in there, a laptop in a case, camera equipment. You name it.4. BACK AND STRAP PADDING: The back of the bag is well padded and feels great. Even with larger loads. The stap padding is ample. These are not the most ergonomic straps when carrying heavy loads, but they have ample padding and a slip-free material that keeps them from moving around.5. SPACIOUS FRONT POCKETS: I can fit everything I need quick access to in the front pockets. They're great for sunglasses (in the case), wallets, work badges, even my Kindle Paperwhite fits in the front, snap pocket.6. TOP HANDLE: This is one of the things I count as a must have on my bags.CONS1. EXPENSIVE: This bag is pricey for how simple it is.2. NO BOTTOM PADDING: I would like this bag more if it had just a hint of padding on the bottom of the main bucket. Whenever I set my bag on the floor there's a ""clunk"" as the contents make direct contact with the surface.Overall, the cons are negligible and I'd certainly recommend this good looking bag to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AKQF8990CGRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F17OVJI#wasThisHelpful","R3AKQF8990CGRO","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Super useful for festivals, days at the beach, camping, etc. This is the charger I'm keeping with me now.PROS• Dual amp power ports allow you to charge larger devices, like tablets and camera.• The Power Pack has been able to fully charge my iPhone 5, Sony RX100 ii camera, and Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet.• When the Power Pack is full, it can provide multiple charges. Fantastic!• It's reasonably light considering the substantial power it has.• I actually like that Belkin didn't include a wall outlet.

"I wouldn't recommend this trimmer to a friend. It's a LOT of trimmer for a very LITTLE benefit. The lack of line feeding alone is enough to drive you mad.PROS1. INEXPENSIVE.2. POWERFUL. I have a small yard that I typically mow with an old-fashioned, manual push mower. Oftentimes I will go over the yard with a trimmer before I use the push mower  to handle thick and weedy patches. This trimmer does a great job in that respect.CONS1. LINE WON'T FEED. I have to take the line housing apart at least 3 times every single time I trim. And my yard is not large! This is infinitely frustrating and renders this trimmer almost unusable for anything but the smallest of projects.2. EDGING IS HORRIBLE. First off, trying to edge just chews the line to pieces...resulting in repeated problems with CON #1. In addition, I can never seem to get a nice, straight edge despite following the instructions in the manual. Just can't do it.3. HEAVY. This thing weighs a LOT for an electric trimmer. Wow. The weight makes it somewhat difficult to control. (I've also used a trimmer that was too light, and equally difficult to control. So there's obviously a sweet spot.

"The Karcher Pressure Washer did a great job cleaning my deck and walkway; however, I spent a ridiculous amount of time putting it together and other than the main body of the unit, I don't predict the kind of longevity I'd expect for the price. Rating: Average (3 stars).PROS1. WORKS. The unit cleans well. My deck and walkway look great.CONS1. SLIPSHOD WORKMANSHIP HINDERS ASSEMBLY. It took forever to put together. The pieces don't align well. When attempting to attach the top piece to the main body of the unit, the screw housing piece broke off. This seemed like an absurd amount of assembly.2. QUESTIONABLE LONGEVITY. The unit is rickety. The wheels are practically useless, but very necessary for how heavy it is.3. ENORMOUS PLUB. The outlet plug is large than my outdoor socket housing and didn't seat well.4. REQUIRES STRICT PERPENDICULAR APPLICATION. To get the unit to clean my deck and walkway, I had to a aim the water perpendicular to the surface I was washing. I couldn't angle it like hosing off a sidewalk. This made cleaning horizontal surfaces very time consuming as it limited the surface area I could attack and made for an awkward cleaning stance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDNGJVJJF0PNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFSUL9K#wasThisHelpful","RDNGJVJJF0PNF","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a user experience designer. This book interested me because my target market is often the demographic that Dana Boyd researches. This books sheds significant light on how teenagers are actually using tools like Facebook and Twitter. And it may not be how you think they are. It's Complicated is peppered useful information that is presented in a legible way that omits the heavy-handed approach often found in short-form writing on the topic. For example, Dana Boyd unpacks the teenage population's reliance on social media with regard to their shrinking access to time to congregate and the places to do so. Social media for teens IS their public space, they way shopping malls and parks were to generations before them. They quickly access and connect with their friends in a meaningful way when all of their free time is spent garnering activities and achievements that will help them get into college.This book isn't just for the parents of teenagers or those who work with that population. It's for anyone thinking about what space and place mean in a culture where these things are increasingly restricted or privatized in the physical world. It challenges us to think about place-making online as a necessary component of human connection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRDQLW5MG2Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300166311#wasThisHelpful","R3HRDQLW5MG2Q9","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book showcases a selection of photographs from 11 National Geographic photographers. Each woman's work is preceded by her photograph, a thoughtful quote showcasing her vision, and a brief biography. The photos are expertly curated and peppered with additional quotes from the photographer about what she's trying to achieve on the assignment; concurrently telling the story of the photographer and the assignment.As an amateur photographer, I found the coupling of the photographs with the quotes and biographies compelling. I'm often impressed by an excellent composition or technically difficult shot, but this collection demonstrates the magic that happens when the photographer goes deeper into the spiritual place that all of these women find in their work.

"I've been using the Friedrich 5-Stage Air Purifier for three weeks. I'm allergic to dust, mold, and pollen. My cat is constantly stirring up dust, I live in the Pacific Northwest where mold is rampant, and it's now Spring and everything is blooming. Ergo, it's a perfect time to test an air purifier.Despite all of my allergies, I've never tried air purification. After three weeks of sleeping better and displaying significantly less night-time congestion (the unit is in my bedroom), I'm sold on air purification, but I think Friedrich could improve a few things with the unit.PROS* CLEAN AIR:  Definitely clearing the air of dust, pollen, and pet dander  in my bedroom. Sleep is restful and significantly reduced congestion. The air in my bedroom just feels cleaner than the rest of the house.* INDUSTRIAL DESIGN: Overall the unit looks modern and is well-designed except for the dashboard display (see below).* INEXPENSIVE TO OPERATE: I ran the unit 24/7 and I just received my electric bill and there was a barely noticeable increase over the same period last year. Coupled with the annual cost of Friedrich AP260HFRK Annual HEPA Filter Replacement Kit for AP260  I'm guessing the Friedrich costs about $10/month--definitely worth a few bucks a week to sleep well!CONS* LARGE: The Friedrich is about the size of a roll-aboard piece of luggage. So it is definitely noticeable in your room.* DASHBOARD DISPLAY: Why does it need to have all of these bright, obnoxious lights on the front of the unit? I want this thing to go unnoticed, not to scream ""look at me, look at me!"" I'd much rather have the control panel on the back, leaving the front unblemished by something that looks like a children's toy from the movie Tron. Whoever made the decision to ""showcase"" the dashboard on this thing should be fired.* NOISY: The Plasma Filter sounds like a squeaking fan. I only turn this on when I won't be in the room. It's obnoxious and at first I thought the unit needed lubrication.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RC8O7CDDL19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM34H4Y#wasThisHelpful","R11RC8O7CDDL19","AI5OS4RQQIUMJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AI5OS4RQQIUMJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I use texturizing sprays too help manage my mane, which can get a little unruly depending on the conditions (e.g., moisture in the air, wind, etc.). I've been using this spray for a few, blustery days and it's working well. The hold isn't too stiff and lasts all day. I can do without the perfume smell; however, I have noticed that it doesn't seem to be as pronounced once it's applied and doesn't bother me throughout the day like some other products have.

"I've been PC gaming for about two and a half years now.  I've long wanted to try a mechanical keyboard, having heard they are essential to gamers.  As such, I jumped at the opportunity to use the Lenovo Y Gaming Mechanical Keyboards.  I'm new to mechanical keyboards, so I can't speak authoritatively on the technical specifications, so I'll focus more on gaming use, feel, etc.First off, this is one sharp looking keyboard.  I live the red glow.  Very sharp.  Having not used mechanical keyboards before, I can't compare this one to others, but the build feels pretty solid.  I was a bit surprised that it's entirely plastic (or at least I think it is).  It's neither here nor there, but just an observation.The keyboard's profile feels a bit taller than regular keyboards, so the removable wrist plate is probably better left in place.  I think it'll make a huge difference in typing and gaming, otherwise your wrists might get a bit tired.One thing I've noticed is that I've had to adjust my typing a little bit.  With most keyboards, I'm able to rest my fingers on the keys without any issues.  The Lenovo is so sensitive that you sometimes inadvertently hit keys even you don't actually depress them.  If you press the keys even gently to the side without the key actually clicking, it will register.  Consequently I find myself backspacing and correcting much more than I used to.  I'm sure it's only a matter of getting used to it, but it is an adjustment.I've used this keyboard to play Dead Island, Assassin's Creed Revelations, Black Ops, and a few others and I found that it responds quite well.

"We love trains in our house and have a lot of wooden train tracks. This type of train track is new for us, but my boy (almost 3) was just tickled to see a choo choo train and new tracks! Really, is there anything that little boys love more than trains?  I don't think so.Set up is easy and quick.  It took no time at all.  We love that there is no batteries to deal with (a big plus) and that my boy can scoot around to make this train go. It doesn't stay on track very well, but that doesn't stop my boy from trying over and over again to get the wheels lined up!We look forward to putting it under the Christmas tree for a simple decoration. I do wish there were more tracks but my children are easy to please!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21XF55OU6CKOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAVW6IY#wasThisHelpful","R21XF55OU6CKOX","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are big fans of Fisher Price old school cash register, in fact, we have two!

"I've tried two Travel Money Belts in the last couple weeks and each has their own merits, which I'll get into at the end, but let's go over the basics and some thoughts about the Hopsooken.The Hopsooker is comparable in size to other travel money belts out there.  I did notice that's a bit lighter, probably because of the lack of an interior carabiner hook.  It has the standard two pockets - main and exterior - and the interior pocket has two mesh pockets sewn into the lining for keys, change, or other small items.  As far as I can tell, it's quite durable and should last a lifetime if well maintained and cleaned.The real only difference between the two is 1) the Hopsooken doesn't have the interior carabiner clip.  It may not be a big deal for some, but something to consider.  2) The upside is that this is $10 cheaper than the other brand, so there's significant savings to be had.My only idea for improvements would be to add another 4 inches the elastic band.  I'm an average-sized guy at 5'11'', 185 lbs.  Even at my size this belt was tighter than I'd like.  It's definitely made for slender/slim people.

"This is the kind of product I could never have come up with myself, but after using it I have to say that it's kind of brilliant.  I'll make this short and sweet, so let's get to it.1)  This sucker is BRIGHT.  That's a good thing for people who may have trouble seeing in darker environments.  The light, however, is extremely focused, so it's not going to light up a room or disturb your bed mate.2)  It's very flexible.  I don't know what it's made of, but this thing is very flexible and holds its position very well.  It's not going to move or bend unless you do it or bump it into something.3)  Cheap!  $5.99?  Are you kidding me?  Great deal.  Pull the trigger.The only improvement I would recommend is that they make it a bit longer, or make a longer version of it.

"The 100 Vintage Bottle Caps collection is, for the most part, pretty good.  I don't think ""Vintage"" is the appropriate description, however.  They may be ""vintage-inspired,"" but definitely not vintage.  I had modern-looking caps for Sprite, for example. Some of the caps designs that read ""China Cola"" and ""Pour hard for bubbles"" and other kind of nonsensical things.  The colors, however, are quite nice and I was very impressed with the over designs.But perhaps most discouragingly, a full 12% (12 out of 100) were of a wolf (see photo).  Since when are wolves vintage?  It seems to me like it was filler and honestly, it was pretty disappointing since I have absolutely no use for a wolf bottle cap.I probably wouldn't buy these again, but if you don't mind non-vintage caps or questionable designs, then they're probably suitable for your project.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWFKKU3UG2GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085OI97O#wasThisHelpful","R1HWFKKU3UG2GW","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no idea that fanny packs had undergone a redesign for the new century.  It makes sense if you think about, though, because we unfortunately live in a world full of cheaters and deceivers and taking precaution with your data and information is extremely important.The Zero Grid Money Belt is a great accessory for protecting your stuff.  At 11.5 inches long and 6 inches tall, there's plenty of room to store plenty of important things.  There are two main pockets, with the larger pocket containing to pockets sewn into the  outer lining for things like change, etc. There's also a carabiner clip for keys.  Nice touch.  I have another RFID money belt without the carabiner clip, so it's a nice bonus, but it also makes a few ounces heavier (though still extremely light and manageable).The Zero Grid is awesome for people who bike, walk, or push their children along in a stroller.  You'll have everything at your reach, yet it's completely concealed if you pull your shirt over the top of it.

It comes packaged neatly in a black box with the logo stamped in wax.  Very fancy.The pillow case itself is very nice.  It's silky-smooth and for me people like me, the coolness of the silk is terrific.  I run very hot and I'm always hot, so a nice cool pillowcase is paramount for a good night's sleep.  For this reason alone it's well worth the $20 price point.The case also runs a bit larger than the average pillow, which is great because assuming that there's some natural variation in pillow sizes.

"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the Jelly Comb 2-port USB car charger.  I recently had the opportunity review a USB charger by Haweel, which is great, and I can easily state that the Jelly Comb is just a great as the Haweel.As far as the design, the Jelly Comb is sleek and smart looking.  It's got a slightly futuristic look to it.  I imagine that is the crew of the USS Enterprise used USB chargers, they'd use these.Of course function over form is paramount with these devices and the Jelly Comb excels on all levels.  First of all, it's very convenient.  It's slim design makes it easy to transport in a backpack, purse, or even your pocket.  The dual USB ports means you won't have to fight with anyone else over its use, which is nice.What I didn't expect is that it's also an auxiliary power source.  Before I even plugged it in the first time, I hit the power button on the top, plugged in my phone, and it started charging up.  Didn't see that coming, but it's a very, very nice feature.  I appreciated that aspect of it.It appears its currently unavailable for purchase via amazon, but if and when it becomes available again, I wholeheartedly recommend this dual USB charger.

After using the Pocket Chainsaw, I can state that this little gadget should be a part of your emergency kit, bug out bag, etc.As many others have noted, this is not in any way, shape for form, a replacement for an electric chainsaw nor is appropriate for mature trees.  This is for branches, 2x4's, etc.  In the event there's an earthquake or other natural disasterAlso, it's a GREAT shoulder work out.  Feel the deltoids burn with this bad boy.

"I've had the good fortune to review several Haweel products of late and I come away each time more and more impressed with this company.Luckily for me, I received this product the day before I was leaving for a long weekend trip in another state.  I took my phone and my kindle with me, but I knew I would be on the road a lot, so opportunities for charging my devices would be few.  Needless to say, it was a lifesaver.First of all, I really like the appearance and build.  It feels solid and digital display gives a bit of a hi-tech feel.  It almost feels like a robotic arm coming out of your dashboard or cigarette lighter. The swivel is a nice touch and gives you a bit more flexibility while using it.Secondly, it works like a charm.  I was able to charge both my phone and kindle with ease.  So long as your charging cord has a usb on the end, you'll be able to use the charger.  And like they say, it is a rapid charger.  I noticed a difference is speed when charging with this device as compared to when the devices were plugged into the wall.  The Rapid Charger is noticeably faster.Lastly, you can charge two devices at one, which is great.  I'm a big fan of that.If you need a new charger, I gladly recommend this unit.

"This is a fun monster truck hot wheels set!  One of the best parts about this set is that it comes with three trucks to play with with or without the track.  In other words, no kids fighting or quarreling over trucks.  If you have four kids, that's another story, but if you have a couple of kids, there's enough to go around.  The track is lots of fun as well for my 5 year old and 10 year old.  Once you assemble the dragon head the trick is to use the lever to flip the truck off the jump at the right speed so that the dragon can't get it. If you're too slow or fast the dragon bites down and catches the truck in it's mouth. If you succeed the truck hits a panel that pops a trophy out for you and causes the dragons head to fly off. Either way it's a lot of fun. As far as car tracks go this one doesn't take up too much space.  5/5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NUCXOZH4PV60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD3N3NO#wasThisHelpful","R2NUCXOZH4PV60","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*Disclaimer - I was offered a free set of cutting boards in exchange for my unbiased review*In a perfect world a butcher's block would be reasonably priced and every home chef or wannabe chef would have easy access to one.  Unfortunately, for most of us, that's not a reality.  Yet cutting boards are an essential item for any kitchen and it's good to have one, or two or three.As many others have pointed out, take notice of the size.  These are smaller cutting boards and may not be suited for everyone.  However, here's what I really like about them:  when you get to cooking in the kitchen you often find yourself cutting something, then rinsing or wiping off the board and then cutting something else.  This is especially true if you're cutting meats.  You don't want raw chicken juice in your salad, etc.  With these boards you can cut an onion on one board and a chicken breast on the other.  Two of the these boards take up about the same space as one large cutting board.  So, for me, it's a nice convenience.Storage is also a plus.  Since they're smaller, you can store them in a kitchen drawer instead of the pantry.  Again, it's a convenience.  It may not be a big deal for some people, but I appreciate it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVA2PXE9JQEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKR1LR6#wasThisHelpful","REVA2PXE9JQEG","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Little did I know that when I purchased the double album at my local Best Buy back in 1998 that for the next 18 years it would remain one of the most played albums in my entire collection (which, I say humbly, is not small - about 250,000 songs in total).  I was fairly new to the world of ""Classical Music"" at the time and was listening to a lot of composers, both well and lesser known, trying to find music that spoke to me.  I certainly had an appreciate of Mozart and Beethoven and the other heavyweights, but it didn't necessarily speak to me (I could say the same thing about the Sex Pistols and the Clash, too).Then a friend sent me a cassette tape in the mail (those were the days!) , from Spain no less, that included Vaughan Williams ""Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.""  I recognized the melody from a church hymn (""If You Could Hie to Kolob""), which I had always loved, but didn't know that it was borrowed from Vaughan Williams' original.  Needless to say I was instantly smitten and searched out more, which led me to this CD.  At the time, ""Dives and Lazarus"" was the only composition I knew, but I also immediately recognized ""Fantasia on Greensleeves"" and ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis,"" both equally evocative and beautiful.But nothing compared me for the grandeur that was ""The Lark Ascending.""  18 years after I first heard it, it remains the most played song in my library.  There have been times I've was sitting at my desk alone working on some project, listening to it in the background and tears just well up for no reason whatsoever.  It has that affect on me.  For me it's the most sublime piece of music ever composed.  I heard it a thousand times and I never, ever tire of it.  It's just of colorful, emotive, evocative, and breathtaking as the first time I heard it.  I've heard other recordings, but for me, this is the best of best.  It captures the mood so wonderfully.  I can only assume the recording itself somehow had God's seal of approval and Divine Influence.In addition to this collection, I highly recommend symphonies 3 and 5 (particularly the 3rd movement of the 5th symphony, ""Romanza"") and a someone obscure composition called ""A Dark Pastoral.""Here's hoping Ralph Vaughan Williams reaches a larger audience, especially stateside.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGPN6XXUXIE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VIT70A#wasThisHelpful","R3GGPN6XXUXIE5","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Disclaimer - The seller offered me this Bluetooth Headset at a deeply discounted price in exchange for a review**Previous the seller contacting me, I'd never heard of the YUMMQUA brand, so I was curious to try it out.First of all, let's talk about the device itself.  It's comparable in size to other bluetooth devices.  The construction feels solid and durable.  I imagine it could withstand many, many drops and still function as designed.  The ear hook (I don't know the technical term) is mostly ineffective.  It the photo it's black, but the one I was received was a clear, hard plastic.  It didn't help secure the device in my ear any better than without it.In order to pair the device (I paired it to my Kindle since I don't own a smart phone), you simply have to push down on the top of the device instead of a tiny button on the side.  I really like that.  Pairing was a breeze and my Kindle recognized the device very quickly.

"I was fairly late to the Sleeping Dogs party.  But as they say, better late than never.  Sleeping Dogs, I believe, is one of the great open world games of the last 5-7 years.  I enjoyed much more than ever enjoyed Grand Theft Auto 4.  (Incidentally, I think GTA V is superior to Sleeping Dogs).  I played the standard version of the game on PS3 and PC before plopping down for the Definitive Edition (DE) because I loved it just that much.Well, it's still an amazing game with a lot to do, a fun story, awesome martial artists, good gunfights, Asian Dating, and collectibles galore.  The only difference is that this time around there's even more to do as all the bits of DLC are now part of the game.  Also, the graphics got a nice upgrade.  In the standard edition, the colors looked pretty much out of the tube.  The color palette in this version is much more realistic and nuanced.  The sky is a bit smokier (which you'd expect in Hong Kong), the trees look better, the cars gleam in the sunlight a bit more, etc.  It's a fantastic-looking game.If you've never played the game, definitely splurge on the DE version.  If you have a PC, it regularly goes on sale for $7.50 on Steam and Humble Bundle.  In addition to the original game and loads of cosmetic DLCs, money opportunities, etc, you get the two additional story DLCs which are a lot of fun as some old friends make appearances.I think I can safely say this game makes my all-time Top 10 favorite games list.

"*Disclaimer - The seller provided a complimentary unit for review purposes*On its own merits, the Wisdompro Arm Band is a perfectly acceptable product.  The problem we encountered, however, is that it's not compatible with other after market cases that you would use to protect your iPhone, like Otterbox, Lifeproof, etc. In order to use the armband, those cases would have to be removed in order to slide your bare bones iPhone into the armband case.

"From my sister who reviewed these blankets:I am a new mom and have heard such great things about muslin swaddle blankets. These SwaddleMe swaddles were so darling, I just had to add them to my collection. I love simple and contemporary designs which is a major reason I was drawn to these swaddles (not everyone wants colorful animals plastered on their blankets!). Since aden + anais swaddles are the ""gold standard"" I decided to compare the two. This comparison is between the classic aden + anais swaddle blanket (not the lower quality ""aden by aden and anais"").The first difference in SM and a+a is the size. The SM blankets are 40""x40"" while the a+a blankets are 47x47"". There isn't a huge size difference, but enough worth noting. The smaller SwaddleMe blankets are best swaddling a small baby, while the more generous sized a+a blankets are good for larger tasks like draping over a carseat.The a+a blankets are a little more ""plush"" that the SM blankets. This could be because they are a little more crinkled straight out of the package, while the SM brand are pretty smooth and flat. When I folded both, A&A was noticeably taller (a difference I don't think is completely attributed to the extra 7"" of size). I am including photos ofboth blankets side by side before and after they were washed.After 2 washes the a+a blanket was slightly softer and ""crinkled"" more than the SM blanket. The SM blanket has a slightly tighter weave in the fabric than the a+a blanket. Both blankets are similiar thickness, lightweight, breathable and should get softer with each wash.Whether or not it is worth noting, the white in the a+a cloud design blanket I own is definitely a warm white, while the white in the SM blanket is a cool white. The a+a looks slightly dingy in comparison, but on their own you would never notice.Overall I am impressed with both swaddles and think I will be happy using both. Both are sold in multi-packs. At the time of this review, the SM blankets average $10/ea and a+a blankets average $12.50-$15/ea. A&A has a slight advantage for being bigger and being barely more ""plush"", but the SM blankets are a solid runner up and for the price can't be beat. I will enjoy using the SwaddleMe blankets and would not hesitate to select them again.​","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14QG7UAEIQNOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100O7EHC#wasThisHelpful","R14QG7UAEIQNOZ","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love hot bubble baths, especially in winter! I like the size of these bubble bath bottles; they're easy to handle. The scent it subtle and enjoyable, without smelling too artificial.

She's as high energy as they come, so we rarely get the chance play ""board games"" because her high energy doesn't allow her to sit still for very long.

"The History of flight airplanes set comes with four different planes to assemble. Although this set is for 8 years and above it is probably more of a serious hobbyist's set. My 10 year old found it difficult to assemble by himself. The sticker labels make the planes look very realistic however were a little difficult to get on right and unforgiving when you laid it on incorrectly.My kids loved soaring the airplanes around.

"**Disclaimer - the manufacturer provided me a free set of labels for review**I had never heard of erasable labels when I had the chance to review them.  What where they? How did the work?  I was completely intrigued.  Was it some sort of juju or black magic?  I was anxious to find out.Well, these labels are pretty neat.  They work exactly as advertised.  The liquid chalk marker is cool.  It a lot more liquidy than I thought it would be, though.  You need to be a little bit careful when using it because it's very wet and takes several minutes to dry.  But the cool thing is that once it's dry, you just need a damp rag to wipe it clean and do it again.  It's very cool.This package comes with 48 labels, which is more than you'll probably ever use or need.  So, find someone you can share with and split the cost.  I honestly think 48 labels is probably too many.  I think 24 labels for $7 is a much better deal.I wholeheartedly recommend these cool chalk labels!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RT531A8WNNSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HN0FN6#wasThisHelpful","R3RT531A8WNNSZ","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Disclaimer:  The seller provided me this free product for review*I have to say, I really like like the Haweel Universal Gooseneck Cell Phone Holder.  So let's get to the good stuff.  The construction is top notch.  It feels and is very solid.  The tension on the clasp is outstanding.  There's little to no change that its going to lose its grip wherever you attach it.  I was impressed by this.  Secondly, the goose neck portion is about 25 inches long (see the photo I've uploaded), giving you plenty of maneuverability if you need it.  The clasp you use to attach your phone has the perfect amount of tension, too.  It's very easy to put your phone in and take it out with little to no effort.  Very nice.At $16.99, I think the price is about right, especially if you have children who watch on their phones while in the car.  Whether or not you actually *need* one is entirely up to you.  Some people are more than happy to hold their phones, but if you're making dinner while watching a youtube tu tutorial, this is super duper handy.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHUQOWQ21K3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QTZYJI#wasThisHelpful","R1HHUQOWQ21K3L","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara is an awesome addition to your baby doll collection.  Apart from the slightly creepy appearance, overall she's a very cute and fun doll.The level of immersion is pretty impressive.  Snackin' Sara can do quite a bit: she talks, responds, eats, and even poops.  Although I have to admit that the eating/food stuff you can probably do just as well without.  In my opinion it doesn't necessarily add a whole lot, it's a bit of pain, and a bit of a hassle.  Give it a try, but I don't think it's something that will have lasting appeal.The outfit, however, are great.  It's fun for the little kids to change the diapers, too.  The kids really liked the dress up and baby care aspects (without the poops, of course!).  Sara is the perfect size for 3-8 year olds.  I imagine she's pretty close to life size, which is good/fun practice.The only qualm I have is the price - Sara seems spectacularly expensive for what you get.  Yes, she's cute, but I think she's at least $20 overpriced, so buyer beware.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIR2FRE7Z5SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4VS4#wasThisHelpful","R1UIR2FRE7Z5SM","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before I was contacted by the seller who offered me a heavily discounted purchase price, I had never heard of a neck pouch.  I had no idea what it was.  I had to do a little research and discovered it's basically a wallet on a lanyard that you hang around your neck, especially used for traveling.Well, the day it arrived my sister was over visiting and she was about to head out on a walk.  I said, 'Hey, do you want to try this neck pouch?'  She said, 'sure.'  One hour later she walked in the front door and said, ""Matt, this thing is awesome.  I love it.  There are a ton of pockets.  I can fit so much in it.  I could take the dogs for a walk and bring all my things with me without having to take along a purse or wallet.""I have to agree with her.  The Hopsooken Neck Pouch is perfect for traveling, exercising, dog walking, etc.  It's convenient, has a ton of pockets, is lightweight, and as far as I can tell, is solidly constructed.  I would gladly recommend this pouch to anyone in the market for one.

"If your child loves Minecraft, there's a pretty good chance he or she will love the Terraria line of toys.  In the event you don't already know, Terraria is a PC, scroller video game (as opposed to Minecraft, which is 3D).  They may share a few similarities, but really, Terraria is very much its own game, and a great game at that - some would even argue it's vastly superior to Minecraft, but that's another topic for another day.Still, it's not hard to see some similarities in the toys.  The Multi-level Biome set is a great jumping off point for anyone new to the world of Terraria.  It's a pretty large set.  Our ten-year old absolutely loved it.  He was able to assemble it himself in no time flat and was off and running (it also got him interested in the game, which is pretty great!).  I love how the backdrop is faithful to Terraria's aesthetic - above ground, under ground, and mines.  The track is pretty fun and the character figure about the right size for 5-10 year olds.  It really is a lot of fun!The only drawback is the price, which is fairly steep, in my opinion.  It's probably a $25-$30 set, but I see it going for 5x that here on amazon.  I think it may be partly due to it's apparent rarity, but still.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QB6AK3VLUE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO49MI6#wasThisHelpful","R33QB6AK3VLUE3","ADFLBRY00Y70G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADFLBRY00Y70G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had the opportunity to try the Radio Flyer Red Rider Trike and boy are we glad we did.

I don't know if it's a new innovation, but I think it's a genius move by the manufacturer.The construction, as far as I can tell, is solid and build to last.

"Ay caramba, since their worldwide smash hit with ""La Bamba"" many people think of Los Lobos as a tacky Mexican novelty act. In fact they are from East Los Angeles and started out as a blues band before listening to Richard Thompson and Fairport Convention mixing rock with British folk gave them the idea that they could do a similar thing with their Mexican heritage. It's been five years since their last studio album 'Tin Can Trust' which I thought was very good - although not as good as their previous record 'The Town and the City' - a clever concept album dealing with the place of Latinos in American society - which mixed American roots music and rock with Central American cumbia - much as they've done throughout their 42-year career.We begin with ""Made to Break Your Heart"" a laid-back bluesy shuffle featuring David Hidaglo's heart-rending vocals and his fabulous emotive blues lead guitar, this is followed by “When We Were Free” which has a similar sound but much looser and jazzy, underpinned by Conrad Lozano’s rumbling bass lines and Steve Berlin's occasional piano and sax, until the blues lead guitar once again cuts in, followed by some jazzy riffing. Then there's a nice change of pace for Cesar Rosas' “Mis-Treater Boogie Blues” an uptempo basic boogie blues. “There I Go” is another moody, bluesy shuffle which features Louie Perez's agile drumming and ends unexpectedly... Elsewhere there is variety with the beautiful folky, acoustic title track, the pretty cumbia of “La Tumba Sera el Final” and the semi-acoustic Chicago blues of “I Believed You So”, another track featuring Cesar Rosas. The band also do a different song that is also called “When We Were Free” a bit confusing but it is another great David Hidaglo blues shuffle and to finish there is a nice, atmospheric live track ""Prenda del Alma"".Many of Los Lobos' gigs feature extended instrumental workouts, in the spirit of the Grateful Dead, but the tracks here are all fairly concise, although the whole album seems a bit 'ramshackle' after ""Tin Can Trust"" (and at just over 40 minutes a tad short). I did love most of it - particularly the production which they did themselves and which reminded me of 'Kiko' in places - but after a five year break I would thought that they could have produced something a bit more structured. Some of the tracks reminded me of the British group Traffic and (like Steve Winwood) David Hidaglo is always worth hearing - and the rest of the group also play their part in another very good album - four and a half stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6G37XOAY7WQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012WVVSFA#wasThisHelpful","R6G37XOAY7WQ7","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shemekia’s new album is again produced by Oliver Wood, as was her last wonderful record ’33 and a third’.  The basic band is Oliver on guitar, Lex Price on bass and Jano Rix on drums, percussion and keyboards, with big name guests including Billy Gibbons playing guitar on ZZ Top’s “Jesus Just Left Chicago”, Alvin Youngblood Hart and steel guitarist Robert Randolph.  Shemekia’s old guitarist Arthur Neilson also plays as do guitarists Will Kimbrough and Guthrie Trapp, Pete Finney on pedal steel, Eric Fritsch on organ and Matt Glassmeyer on horns.Like ’33 and a third’ this is very much rock blues – from the driving rock of the opening title track to the fabulous Stones-style rocker “The Battle is Over (But the War Goes On) -  although “Cardboard Box” featuring Alvin Youngblood Hart playing guitar and sharing the vocals with Shemekia is a great downhome acoustic blues.  And as she says on “Drivin' Out Of Nashville”, complete with its pedal steel guitar, “country music ain’t nothing but the blues with a twang”.  “I Feel a Sin Coming On” is a heartfelt soul ballad complete with nice horns and “Isn't that So” is nice N’Orleans rock and roll.For all that I said that this was mainly rock blues, Shemekia’s voice itself is just pure gutbucket blues - listen to her make “Jesus Just Left Chicago” completely her own, ditto Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Long as I Can See the Light”, done as a soul-meets-power ballad.  Shemekia’s old guitarist Arthur Neilson adds his blues lead guitar to Albert King’s funky “Wrapped Up In Love Again” and the final track “Lord, Help the Poor and Needy” is a moody atmospheric closer.I picked ’33 and a third’ as my blues album of the year in 2012 I thought that it was the best album that she’s made and to be honest I didn’t think that she’d be able to top it.  She has – this album is even better, it’s the best record I’ve heard for years, a combination of great playing from all involved and excellent production from Oliver Wood BUT most of all Shemekia’s voice - which is just so full blues feeling that like an alchemist she can transform any material into pure blues gold. 50 stars…","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R314SSXZ5GIW1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RQBGT0#wasThisHelpful","R314SSXZ5GIW1J","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like Gary’s first album ‘Blak and Blu’ this record is a mixture of his influences - blues, rock, hip-hop, soul and folk – indeed the opener “The Healing” starts off as an olden-days work song before turning hip-hop, with the addition of some stinging blues lead guitar.  The whole record is less guitar-heavy than his recent live album but his guitar does feature, even the funky “Hold On” suddenly has a hard-hitting blues guitar solo.  The album was recorded in Austin, Texas, Gary’s hometown, and he produced the record himself, played most of the instruments and even enlisted his sisters as background singers.I like the fact that Gary isn’t afraid to experiment by mixing styles and isn’t prepared just to be the next Texas blues guitar slinger.  Consequently there is more variety here, from the heartfelt soul ballad “Our Love” to the heavy rock of “Stay”, from the echoey downhome rock and roll of “Shake” to the acoustic folky-gospel of “Church”, which reminded me of Ben Harper.  We also get smooth soul in the shape of the short (one minute) “BYOB” and the long (nearly eight minutes) Marvin Gaye-ish “Down to Ride”.Personally I would have preferred more straight blues but I applaud his adventure and versatility, and he's also done a great job with the production, my only worry is that by including all these different styles Gary will end up pleasing no one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWJBWWSBSSLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TT5Q0K#wasThisHelpful","RBWJBWWSBSSLF","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2013 John signed to Eric Corne's Forty Below Records, who produced the recent wonderful record from 1967 featuring Peter Green, as well as last year's 'A Special Life'. 'Find A Way To Care' was recorded at the House of Blues Studios in Encino, California with John's current live band of Rocky Athas on guitar, Greg Rzab on bass and Jay Davenport on drums. It's a mixture of John's own songs and blues classics like Junior Parker's “Mother In Law Blues”, Percy Mayfield’s “River’s Invitation”, Muddy Waters’ “Long Distance Call”, Charles Brown's ""Drifting Blues"" and Little Milton's ""Feel so Bad"". There is more focus here on John playing keyboards (both organ and piano) as well as three songs with horns (Ron Dzublia on saxophone, Richard Rosenberg on trumpet and Mark Pender on trumpet), a couple of tracks with John playing harp and he also plays guitar Muddy's on ""Long Distance Call "".I don't know if it's Corne's production or the sympathetic band or John being newly inspired but I think that this record sounds really good and is one of the best he has recorded in years. We get off to a great start with “Mother In Law Blues” which sounds like one of John's tracks from the 60s - great guitar from Rocky Athas over John's rolling boogie piano. I love Percy Mayfield’s “River’s Invitation” and John's version speeds it up and he plays some nice funky Hammond organ - great version - it's followed by his own “Ain’t No Guarantees” which again is classic Mayall with great Hammond and John's strong vocals. The title song is one of the album's best tracks and ""I Want All My Money Back"" is great rocking blues with John playing Hammond and piano and ""War We Wage"" is a moody blues co-written with British blues guitarist Matt Schofield. On the restrained version of Charles Brown's ""Drifting Blues"" John plays some nice late-night piano and his vocals sound vulnerable, another thoughtful take on a classic blues song.I originally gave the album four stars having been a bit put off by the lyrics of the final track ""Crazy Lady"" but these are similar to many of John's lyrics from his songs in the 60s and the track is redeemed by his great rolling blues piano. Overall this is an excellent piece of work featuring good versions of traditional blues, John's own songs that can stand alongside these classics and some great playing from the band and from John himself who for once gets to showcase his keyboard skills, often overlooked by people focussing on his various guitarists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWIKGXLCDXTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQJWQGC#wasThisHelpful","R3DWIKGXLCDXTT","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listening to this record it's almost impossible to believe that Jon was born and brought up in the county of Kent in the UK and not in the Crescent City - everything in his singing and piano playing just screams New Orleans. Or rather doesn't scream - Jon is just so effortlessly laid back and funky, and it doesn't hurt that he is accompanied by some of New Orleans’ top session men, including guitarist Shane Theriot, keyboard player Nigel Hall and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, as well as members of his own band - the Absolute Monster Gentlemen. We get off to a great start with ""Pump it Up"" which perfectly demonstrates the link between New Orleans and reggae/ska, then the funky ""Boneyard"" probably my favourite track and ""Bringing Back the Home"" is a tribute to the ""Jazz, funk, rhythm and blues, and soul"" that America has given to the world. While Jon's composition the Little Feat-sounding “Love On One Condition” featured on Bonnie Raitt's album 'Souls Alike'. An accomplished album from a very accomplished musician.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6A2JQUMG4TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106C32ME#wasThisHelpful","R3G6A2JQUMG4TF","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This year is the centenary of bluesman/bandleader Muddy Waters’ birth and we have already had one tribute CD from his son Mud Morganfield together with Kim Wilson. That CD was very traditional, whereas this tribute puts a slightly more modern spin on Muddy’s songs and involves a larger cast of guest artists including Shemekia Copeland, James Cotton, Gary Clark Jr., Johnny Winter, Keb Mo', Billy Branch and Derek Trucks. The band is led by two ex-Muddy Waters’ sidemen, guitarists John Primer and Bob Margolin, with Primer also handling some of the vocals, as on the opener Muddy’s theme song “Got my Mojo Workin’” where he shares the singing with Shemekia.I always loved the Waters band’s ensemble playing and these guys certainly do a great job in playing Muddy’s songs without actually trying to replicate that 50/60s sound. When Muddy released “Can’t Get no Grinding” in the 70s it featured electric piano which at the time I thought wasn’t traditional but it shows Muddy was keeping up with the times and I’m sure he would have approved of these updates to his sound. There is variety here as well - ""Rosalie"" goes back to the country blues of the Son Sims Four with Steve Gibbons on fiddle and Billy Flynn on mandolin and ""Why Don't You Live So God can Use You"" is a rare example of a Muddy Waters gospel song from the same era and features Leanne Faine on vocals.Elsewhere its great Chicago blues with soaring harmonica from Cotton, Branch and Vincent Bucher, I particularly liked Billy Branch’s rocked up versions of “Trouble no More” and “Can’t Get no Grinding” and also “She Moves Me” with its blistering harp from Matthew Skoller and great Muddy-style slide guitar. More great slide on “Still a Fool” from Derek Trucks and on “I’m Ready” instead of the original chromatic harp we get the late Johnny Winter’s distinctive slide guitar. I also really liked Keb Mo’s “Last Time I Fool Around With You” which had more nice slide and also great piano from Johnny Iguana. I really enjoyed this tribute which I thought honoured the legend of Muddy Waters, featured some great playing and although it put a slightly modern spin on some of the songs didn’t stray too far from Muddy’s original template.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R101JDO0J37858/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VA3Q7IK#wasThisHelpful","R101JDO0J37858","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Their last album 'Snapshot' sounded like a return to the British R&B groups of the early 60s - the Stones and the Yardbirds (my favourites) - with its snarled vocals, raw guitar and howling harmonica. However, those groups 'progressed' away from the raw sound of the blues to more commercial sounds later in the 60s. The Strypes have made that transition after one record and this second album sees them sounding much less raw, more polished - with better arrangements and more accomplished vocals from Ross Farrelly.  In short a lot more professional, although crucially they have managed to keep that same sense of excitement - even if the overall sound is more like the Arctic Monkeys than the Pretty Things. There are also nods to 70s British New Wave acts like the Jam and early Boomtown Rats, as well as the the originators of 'Maximum R&B' - The Who.The harmonica is mainly on the back burner here, although when they do use it, it just makes them sound so different to all the other guitar bands around, like on the opener ""Get into it"" and on ""Rejection"" and also on ""Status Update"" (which with Peter O'Hanlon's pounding bass is pure Yardbirds) although the harmonica sound isn't grown-up Little Walter it's definitely youthful Brian Jones. Josh McClorey's guitar ain't half bad either, nice tight rhythms and odd bits of stinging lead work, as on probably my favourite track the very catchy ""Scumbag City, and Evan Walsh on drums powers everything along and is very tight and crisp. The four extra tracks on the deluxe version are all of the same standard as the rest of the songs and not just assorted odds and sods added as an afterthought, as on some other records. This is a really good record which manages to balance its youthful enthusiasm with a growing maturity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TB7CAG6NWTNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUSPVSK#wasThisHelpful","R3TB7CAG6NWTNA","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like Vintage Trouble’s modern twist on old-style blues-based rock – for me they were one the real highlights of this year’s Glastonbury Festival in the UK - and this new record sees them carrying on from where ‘The Bomb Shelter Sessions’ left off.  We get off to a great rocking start with “Run Like the River” with its nice slide guitar and “Strike Your Light” (featuring vocals from Kamilah Marshall) and “Another Baby” are other raucous rockers in the same vain.  However, it’s not all flat-out balls-to-the-wall rockers - my other favourite tracks are the lovely soul ballad “Another Man's Words” – this album’s “Not Alright By Me” – and the restrained, thoughtful “From My Arms”.Singer Ty Taylor is in superb form again – this man could sing the phone book and make it sound funkyy – and guitarist Nalle Colt doubles up as both rhythm and lead guitarist, in front of the rock solid rhythm section of drummer Richard Danielson and bass player Rick Barrio Dill.  “Before the Teardrops Start” features some nice bluesy guitar from Colt (ditto “Shows What You Know”) and “Soul Serenity” sees the band in laid-back almost acoustic mode.  I think that this record is certainly on a par with ‘The Bomb Shelter Sessions’ with a similar mix of catchy, well-performed songs and while I liked it, I don’t think that the band have really developed from their first album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HWJ06R9H8K73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKAX9FU#wasThisHelpful","R2HWJ06R9H8K73","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buddy was the youngest of the classic Chicago bluesmen and often angered critics by including popular soul songs in his sets - in many ways he was the first modern blues man. Many of his recent albums have been too rocky for me but when I saw him headlining the Maryport Blues Festival in the UK in 2004 he was absolutely wonderful - subtle but also able to really turn up the excitement levels with searing blues. This latest record is another produced by Tom Hambridge and sees Buddy playing in a number of different styles, it sounds 'modern' but also has echoes of his illustrious past and while the band is very good Buddy is clearly the star of every track. .We get off to a great start with the title song, a slow, subtle rolling blues where Buddy's voice sounds really emotional and slightly vulnerable singing ""I was born to play the guitar and I've got the blues running through my veins"" - I found it very moving. There are two great tracks with ace harmonica player Kim Wilson ""Too Late"" and ""Kiss me Quick"" which evoke Buddy's partnership with Junior Wells and ""Wear you out"" sees Buddy trading guitar licks and vocals with ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons (suddenly all the power is back in Buddy's voice!)  One of my favourite tracks is ""Crying out of One Eye"" real West Side Blues which really reminded me of a mixture of Magic Sam and Otis Rush with its echoey production and nice horns. ""Flesh and Bone"" is a another very moving song, a tribute to Buddy's friend and mentor B.B. King, including vocals from Van Morrison, while the final track is a nice poignant acoustic tribute to another blues great - Muddy Waters.  From the moving to the amusing as Buddy and Joss Stone recreate Brook Benton and Dinah Washington's duet on the 1960 soul classic ""Baby (You've Got What It Takes)"" - you can clearly hear that they are both really enjoying themselves and having a ball.  On ""Turn Me Wild"" Buddy sings ""You can't pick how people remember you, you just hope that they do..."" - people will certainly remember Buddy Guy and when they do they'll say this was one of his best albums - and I'm not even going to mention that he's 79.. doh!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30O9TDPFFN7DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGVMKCE#wasThisHelpful","R30O9TDPFFN7DK","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been a couple of tribute albums to Nina Simone, a unique artist who over the years inspired many artists to cover her songs. This tribute produced by Jayson Jackson, Suzette Williams, Peter Edge, Robert Glasper and Lauryn Hill (who appears on 6 tracks) is to accompany Liz Garbus's documentary film ""What Happened, Miss Simone?"". Rather than the 'cod' jazz of previous tributes this is mainly in the contemporary R&B style and as such it has a pleasing unity and I think that Nina would have approved. Lauryn Hill is all grown up here and even has that world-weariness in her voice that I associate with Nina, most of her tracks are successful but I wasn't convinced by the synthesiser/hip-hop stylings of ""Black is the Colour"" which for me just sounded wrong. Whereas Jazmine Sullivan's upbeat, reggae version of Randy Newman's ""Baltimore"" really hits the spot, as does the eery, unnervinging version of ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Alice Smith, an artist I hadn't heard before.I'm afraid that I found many of the other performances by Grace, Usher, Mary J. Blige, Lisa Simone and even Gregory Porter just a bit bland and predictable (despite being well-produced and very professional), without that edge and sense of danger that I always associate with Nina. I also think that it was a mistake to finish off with one of Nina's own performances because for me it just emphasised the point that no one can compare with her versions of her songs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GFP9TB2OMQBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIQNLE0#wasThisHelpful","R2GFP9TB2OMQBE","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed Damon's first two CDs which showed great promise for such a young singer/guitarist/songwriter and he builds on that promise with this record which is assured and accomplished and if he isn't quite yet the finished article then at this rate he soon will be. It helps that this record is produced by the experienced Tab Benoit who brings the sounds of the Louisiana swamps with him and adds a bit of dirt and drama to Damon's sound. The first song 'Thought I Had It All' is a moody mid-tempo blues-based workout featuring Damon's slide guitar and this sets the tone for the rest of the record, which is very subtle and laid back but still packs an emotional punch. 'Old Fools, Bar Stools' and 'Do It for The Love' (with Tab's nice steel guitar) add a country twang to the mix and Damon brings a bluesy twist to Elvis Costello's wonderful song 'Allison' - complete with a heart-wrenching guitar solo. My favourite song was probably 'Where I Belong' with its understated slide guitar that really reminded me of John Moody.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N5CZHT0NJNKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTSVL0A#wasThisHelpful","R3N5CZHT0NJNKI","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's very hard to classify Paul Cebar Tomorrow Sound's music, it's definitely based in roots music with elements of soul, blues, rock and roll and jazz but it's also full of melody and has the hooks of the best pop music, as well as a sly understated sense of humour.  There is lots of variety from the almost frantic new wave beat (think Elvis Costello and Attractions) of the title track to the smooth soul sounds of ""You owe it to you"", to the funky ""Might be smiling"" and the almost reggae-like grooves of the final ""Like loving people do"".  My favourite track is probably ""Not necessarily true"" a lovely mid-tempo melodic soul ballad. Paul leads the band with his upfront vocals and subtle guitar and is ably assisted by Bob Jennings on keyboards and sax (a bit like the band's Garth Hudson).  The fine rhythm section of drummer Reggie Bordeaux, Mike Fredrickson on bass and percussionist Mac Perkins power everything along to give music that is great for dancing as well as listening to. This is a really nice record that is a great calling card for Paul and the boy's wonderful live shows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IG72420H1IAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HG4JSTW#wasThisHelpful","R2IG72420H1IAG","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The music and Kellin's voice is very influenced by jazz and blues but still sounds modern rather than harking back to the past and is also original without trying to copy anyone. I particularly liked her version of the old blues standard ""Sittin' on top of the world"", which featured Sarah and Christian Dugas as well as Oliver Wood, and had a wonderful imaginative arrangement on a par with anything done by Cassandra Wilson.

"This is the third in the series of 'How Britain got the blues' and represents the records that influenced the London R&B bands, including the Stones, the Yardbirds, the Pretty Things, Downliners Sect etc during the first Blues Boom of the early 60s. Included are gems from the Chess label by Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley including the signature song of the era Muddy's ""Got My Mojo Working"" which every spotty herbert with a mouth organ (including myself) was singing . Also included are very influential electric blues songs by Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker, Sonny Boy Williamson, Slim Harpo etc plus a couple of slightly more obscure cult classics like ""You Don't Love Me"" by Willie Cobbs (later covered by John Mayall) and Billy Boy Arnold's ""I Wish You Would"" (covered by the Yardbirds). So far so good but then the compilation goes slightly off-piste by including a few straight rock and roll songs, some country blues and two early Bob Dylan covers of traditional blues. I accept that these probably would have influenced some bands but so would the Shadows, Lonnie Donegan and Acker Bilk - I just feel that you've got to stop somewhere and I'm afraid that for me these songs didn't fit in with the rest of the excellent songs on this compilation, so it looses one star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OO6VTBV1WFMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXXWR46#wasThisHelpful","R3OO6VTBV1WFMH","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I became a fan of Nina Simone as a teenager in the 60s after seeing her in concert on TV, much to the puzzlement of my friends who considered her 'uncool'. However, I've remained a fan although I never saw her live - I did have the chance to see her at the Bishopstock Festival in Devon UK in 2001 but by that time her voice had gone and I chose not to attend that night and to remember her through her records. There are several biographies of Nina, including an autobiography, which all seem to have their supporters and also their critics, this is the latest and so can draw on these previous memoirs together with fresh interviews to give a comprehensive overview of this unique artist. She wasn't really a jazz singer, a blues singer, a folk singer, a soul singer, a protest singer, a pop singer, a cabaret singer, a show singer or a classical pianist - although her work contained elements of all these genres, combined into Nina's own unclassifiable style.When first skimming through the book I was a bit surprised that her performing career only began from pages 60-odd onwards but these early pages dealing with the lives of her parents and family and her own young life give an excellent context to her later life and also to the place of black people in America at that time. Nina emerges as a determined and very focussed child, who was opinionated and knew her place in the world from an early age (a foretaste of the diva she was to become in later years). Even in her earliest performances she didn't put up with what she considered disrespect but there are also instances of unreasonable behaviour even in her 20s which must have been early indications of the bipolar disorder that she was diagnosed with in later life.The book charts her career progressing from small club dates to international concert appearances, a constantly changing procession of backing musicians, her recording sessions and her fight to get royalties from these records. It also notes Nina's gradual involvement with the civil rights movement and her increasing militancy and sympathy with black power. In line with all these the book also catalogues increasing bad behaviour both on stage and off and although some have criticised other books for focussing on this behaviour unfortunately it was unquestionably a feature of many Nina Simone performances in her later years. However, the book also details how many musicians, promoters and friends remained loyal despite the bad treatment they sometimes received from her and also how audiences still greeted her ecstatically despite late appearances, erratic on stage behaviour and failing vocal and musical powers.I found Nadine Cohodas' book a good, very objective study of the life of a truly unique artist. I've previously read Nadine's 'Spinning Blues Into Gold' - the story of Chess Records - which I also found very interesting but like this book strangely 'cold' - it was so objective that you couldn't tell if she was fan of Miss Simone or hated her. There are some excellent photographs of Nina throughout the book but these are printed on the same pages as the text rather than separate glossy pages, which no doubt keeps costs down but does reduce the quality of the images. The book ends with a comprehensive index, a bibliography, a (very) short list of CD/DVD credits, acknowledgements and 40 pages of notes. The notes contain several very interesting snippets together with the page numbers that they relate to but at the back of the book they are completely isolated from the text - I felt it would have been better to include the notes at the foot of the relevant pages or to annotate the text with reference numbers to link with the notes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF61NYQMQKK63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807872431#wasThisHelpful","RF61NYQMQKK63","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first volume of 'How Britain Got The Blues' that I listened to was volume 2 - How Merseyside Got The Blues - which was excellent, a really good compilation of well-chosen songs that accurately reflect the original R&B, rock and roll and early soul that influenced Merseybeat. However, this collection is much less-focussed (as the title 'Skiffle, Folk, RocknRoll & The British Blues Boom' perfectly demonstrates) with a collection of pre-war folk blues, R&B, electric Chicago blues, country and rock and roll. Although I fully accept that this was exactly how people at the time in Britain listened to music, hearing anything that was available and that the jazz, folk and blues scenes were all interlocking - I think that now in retrospect many of these tracks don't sit well together. I feel it would have been better to have kept this as a mainly acoustic collection of tracks that influenced skiffle and blues, leaving the electric tracks for the forthcoming Volume 3 - How London Got The Blues. However, needless to say there are some classic performancess here from the hugely influential Leadbelly and Robert Johnson sides to the later, just as influential, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf tracks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUBZH8B6XINLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQF1YNS#wasThisHelpful","RUBZH8B6XINLW","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a fabulous compilation, every record is particularly well-chosen and as someone originally from Merseyside this collection really resonates with me. When I first got into music these were exactly the songs that I was listening to - but as covered by British groups. This is a collection of the original American blues, R&B, rock and roll and pop that when mixed together equaled Merseybeat. I don't think that there was any 'overall design' in this, these were just the records that happened to be available in the UK, either as imports or as British releases. There was never a particularly big blues scene on Merseyside and this collection shows the bias towards more tuneful R&B, soul and R&R that fed into what the Beatles went on to write for themselves.Unlike many collections which are bulked out with a few duds this really is ""All Killer, No Filler"". However, I will just highlight what I consider to be particularly key, heavily covered records - the Clovers' 'Love portion no. 9', 'Slow down' by Larry Williams, 'Fortune teller' by Benny Spellman, 'A shot of rhythm and blues' by Arthur Alexander and Bobby Parker's 'Watch your step', together with all the Chuck Berry, Little Richards and Elvis of course.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5S9WWFJQXP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQF1W8U#wasThisHelpful","R2W5S9WWFJQXP2","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really good record with Chas and Dave not doing anything new but giving us their unique blend of rock n' roll, R&B and skiffle together with old-fashioned English pub-style singalong. Joe Henry (Hugh Laurie, Bettye LaVette, Loudon Wainwright etc) produces and keeps everything very simple and direct, letting the music speak for itself. Everything is very relaxed with Chas often bringing in the soloists with comments of ""Go on Martin"" etc but this certainly isn't a chaotic rambling jam - everything here is very crisp and really well-played. There are some top-name guests including guitarists Albert Lee and Martin Taylor, Jools Holland, Hugh Laurie and the Crickets' drummer Jerry Allison but I also really enjoyed the fiddle of Lucy Wilkins and Greg Cohen's double bass.There are some good old blues songs like Jesse Fuller's 'San Francisco Bay Blues', Big Bill Broonzy's 'All by myself' and Leadbelly's 'Midnight Special', together with golden oldies like 'The glory of love', 'Pretty baby' and 'I can't give you anything but love' and rock and roll rarities like 'Look at me' - which are all transformed into the classic Cockney Chas and Dave-style. However, my favourite song was probably the very clever new song 'Lonnie D' - a homage to Britain's King of Skiffle Lonnie Donegan, closely followed by another new song, the single 'When two world's collide'. Great stuff from two British rock and roll veterans who have paid their dues and know their roots music but who have also created their own completely unique sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9P05XXCDUAXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5TP016#wasThisHelpful","R9P05XXCDUAXH","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harmonica Shah is from Detroit and has released half-dozen studio and live discs since 2000, he isn't the world's greatest harp player or singer but this record is nice, unpretentious, authentic urban blues that really swings. Shah is backed by the excellent guitarist Jack de Keyzer, Canadian pianist Julian Fauth and drummer Bucky Berger. Alec Fraser produces with a straight-forward, no-nonsense approach which lets the music speak for itself and he gets a good sound on Shah's harp and on Keyzer's guitar. Apart from ""Worried life blues"" (where Shah shares the vocals with Fauth) the songs are all `originals', albeit with a familiar ring to many of them - for example the title track is a ""Rock me baby"" retread. Nevertheless this is an enjoyable album of raw 50s-style blues with really nice guitar and piano that seem to inspire Harmonica Shah onto greater heights.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TLAFFF12C0OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8RVP8C#wasThisHelpful","R3TLAFFF12C0OV","AC6UTDXWZTIEH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AC6UTDXWZTIEH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before I got this, I would always forget to charge my phone; it'd always be dead at the end of the day. Now, I just listen to my iTunes library all day, while my phone charges -- though to be fair, I guess that'd be true for any docking station like this. What makes this particular product good, in my opinion, is the quality of the speaker system. Another good feature is how small the device is; I can easily fit it onto my cramped office desk.

It has a powerful, satisfying suction that seems to get every speck of dirt out of my carpets -- though that does mean that I have to clean out the dust cup fairly often. It also has a handy carpet setting that ups the suction power. It's pretty quiet compared to what I'm used to, which makes cleaning the house a bit less headachy. It's fairly compact and lightweight, but still a little awkward to lug up the stairs.

"Ideal for adults wanting to improve the look and feel of their skin, Olay's Regenerist Skin Care Kit is the real deal. It advertises results after three weeks or so, but I saw a difference in about a week.Having tried a half-dozen or so of these skin care kits, I was skeptical that Olay had anything different. For one thing, the larger tube had much more of an exfoliant than I was used to, but it felt exhilarating. The creams in the smaller containers felt good when I applied them, leaving my face moist and supple, especially around my eyes.The real difference became apparent in the morning after I slept with the product applied. I could actually tell a difference: My skin looked more glowing and younger.

"We adopted a medium-sized dog who was collar-reactive.  A review of the rescue's records showed that she had experienced neck trauma, arriving in a too-tight collar that had cut into her neck to the point that it had to be removed by a vet.  Her anxiety level with any collar pressure was extreme, so we opted for a harness to help her learn to walk on a leash.We started out with the Freedom No-Pull harness and were very pleased with the dog's natural responsiveness to it, but would like a padded harness for longer walks.We were on the fence between this Chai's Choice harness and the Ruffwear harness. The Ruffwear had our preference of colors and had great customer reviews, but this harness specifically claimed to be ""no pull"".  I assumed that it would give some feedback to a pulling dog, like the Freedom harness does.It turns out that this harness is almost identical to the Ruffwear harness..  Other than a ring attached to the front of the harness, there is nothing to discourage pulling.Thankfully our dog is at the phase in her training where pulling has decreased and she's getting the idea of loose lead walking, as long as no squirrels cross our path!  If there is a close-range squirrel encounter, however, it becomes a matter of sheer strength to wrestle with her as she comfortably strains against this harness (and leash and leader) with all her might!It's not a bad harness, but if I had it to do over again I'd just go with the Ruffwear and/or keep looking for a true ""No Pull"" harness for high risk walks.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCJIJ76Y4GKIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URW5D0S#wasThisHelpful","RCJIJ76Y4GKIK","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like almost every review for this product so far is from someone who received a free product in exchange for a review.I did not.  I bought these at the store because they seemed like an easy option for an extended road trip.They are exceptionally easy to use and they get the clothes pretty clean.They can melt when stored at high temperatures, so don't plan to stock up and keep the extras in the summer garage! (Or travel with them packed in a hot car!)The label warns to protect them from heat, so no stars were deducted for the melting.However, the scent of these is really odd and off-putting.  It smells like flowers mixed with over-ripe apples, and it is very strong.  I'm not a fan, and would expect an apple scent to be labeled ""Harvest"", or ""Orchard"" or some other tell-tale clue.

"Our large terrier mix dearly loves plush toys, but she shreds them quickly.  This year, she has annihilated a couple of Kong plush toys that claimed to be extra tough, a well-reviewed soft West Paw toy, several of the ""unstuffed"" toys that promised to be extra durable, and one made of ballistic nylon labeled as indestructible.This pig is the one and only survivor.  We're on 4 months and counting, and it endures daily abuse sessions of tossing, pouncing and gnawing before she finally takes it to bed for a nap.  The tail was gone in the first 10 minutes and one ear is in tatters, but, other than that, it is holding up great!  She often sneaks it through the dog door to the yard so it has been through the washer and dryer weekly.

"We purchased this bed for our cats.  We love that it is durable, washable, and recyclable.

She's a long-legged and tall for her weight.Despite having a more appropriately-sized bed available, the dog fell in love with the Catalina bed and insists on cramming into it.  It has become her favorite ""safe place"" in our home.The cats have decided that the bed now has dog cooties, and won't go anywhere near it.The people, on the other hand, are now even more impressed with this bed than ever before.

"We purchased this for our terrier mix because she loves plush toys and we prefer to give her something made in the USA by a reputable company.After all, there are no regulations about materials in dog toys, and there are some things I don't want my dog chewing on for any amount of time!She adores this toy and especially seems to delight in how it flops around when she shakes it furiously.With that said, she had the eyes off the toy immediately.  It seems like they came off easily and would be way too easy for a dog to swallow, even with supervision.  Wonder why they didn't go with embroidered eyes?When we became distracted briefly while our dog had the toy, she had the stuffing torn out within five minutes.  Now we have the hollow shell that she still enjoys, but we have to watch that she doesn't pull out mouthfuls of the blue fur.  She keeps getting tufts of blue hair in her terrier beard, which is funny, but also speaks to the (lack of) durability of the toy.Because West Paw didn't make any claims that this was an ""indestructible"" toy, I still give it 4 stars.

"The Sherpa side is very soft, but the other side feels sort of slinky, with an unpleasant sheen.The two sides aren't sewn together except at the edges - there's open space between them.  This detracts from the look and feel of the blanket.In addition, I had hoped that the floral design would be embossed in a more subtle, deeper shade of the same color as the blanket.  Instead, it is stamped in black, which doesn't suit the space where I intended to use it. The floral pattern is far more pronounced than the photos seemed to indicate.  It's pretty tacky.I bought this to replace a Sherpa throw blanket that I purchased at one of the big box stores for about half the price of this one.

"Straight out of the box, this unit did everything we had hoped!  It drastically cut down on dust and pollen and left the house smelling fresh and clean.  I also love that the wheels make it possible to easily place the unit where it is needed most - next to the kitchen when cooking something smelly, near the litter box at cleaning time, etc.We've used the unit consistently for about three years now.  I still love it, but it seems there is a pretty obvious design flaw.  The air intake occurs through wide grills along the bottom of the machine.  Air then passes up, through a fan, and is filtered as it is pushed out through the filters on the top and side.  This is different from most air ""cleaners"", which typically pull air in through a filter.The problem with this Blueair design is that the incoming dust collects, over time, on all of the internal components.  After several years of use, the wiring and fan are caked with thick dust and pet hair.  The performance of the machine seems to be suffering as a result, and I worry that it could be a fire hazard.  I no longer feel safe leaving it on overnight or while we are away from home.  There is no easy way to open the case to clean it, and the product manual makes it clear that doing so would void all warranties.  I'm thinking I may take it to a vacuum repair shop to see if they can clean it with more confidence that I could at home.  For the price point, I feel like Blueair should offer some sort of cleanable pre-filter to at least reduce the problem.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GLAQP3Z2C9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A9JHBW#wasThisHelpful","R6GLAQP3Z2C9W","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you know a young girl who is interested in space, you may have a bit of a challenge finding great space-themed books for her.

A page about constellations includes a photo of a teenaged girl using a telescope.Admirably, the book doesn't relegate all female astronauts to a sidebar about ""women in space"" but includes them naturally throughout the pages. There's nothing here to make this exclusively a ""girl's book"", but is does an exceptional job of avoiding the all-too-common stereotype that ""space is just for boys"".Well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19WO27FW47QTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=075665839X#wasThisHelpful","R19WO27FW47QTT","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. Tweed is a seek-and-find story with a predictable story line.As Mr. Tweed takes a walk through town he encounters a series of friends who need help.  Someone has lost her kittens.  Someone else lost the arrows for his bow, while a third friend has let go of his balloons.Each encounter is followed by a pictures-only, two-page spread.  Here, children search for the lost items, progressing from 1 to 10 missing items as they work their way through the sets of pictures.Those of a certain age who remember pouring over the busy end pages of ""Sweet Pickles"" books may find the illustrations vaguely familiar. Expect line drawings with a retro feel and a quirky color pallet.  Illustrations are odd, including trees wearing sunglasses or shoes, airplanes shaped like birds, and passengers on sea turtles and ostriches mixed in among the vehicle traffic. They're filled with action and unexpected details, making them enjoyable to pore over for all but the most literal of kids.This book won't work for group story times because the audience wouldn't be able to see the illustrations as needed.  Instead, it is for sharing one-on-one or for solo use by a child. On the pages were many items are being sought - such as the page with 8 missing socks - it could help to mark found items with a token, such as a penny. Left to their own devices, children may be tempted to circle items in the book with a crayon.Parents may wish to note that there is a slight imbalance of male and female characters and their roles.  The only female characters with whom Mr. Tweed interacts are Mrs. Fluffycuddle, who has lost her kittens, and Little Penny Paws, who has dropped her flowers.  While this feels a bit tired and stereotypical, the illustrations include many, many gender-neutral characters doing interesting things.The tame story ends with the line, ""'What a great day helping people!' Mr. Tweed thought as he made his way home.""All in all, the book is kind-hearted, quirky, and fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18ATV75X8KBWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909263354#wasThisHelpful","R18ATV75X8KBWE","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely book for the child who likes to study illustrations.  It is creatively composed and has its own, unique style.  I love the bold black and white illustrations with pops of color.  The occasional vertical illustration will intrigue many children, and the map end-pages are a treasure.A few things to consider, as you're deciding whether to gift this book or add it to your child's library:It does not have much of a story line or rhythm.  A little boy asks various people if they've seen his dragon and predicts where his dragon might be.  I expected the text to be semi-repetitive, with the question, ""Have you seen my dragon?"" recurring, but it is not. There's not enough of a pattern to the text for it to be especially suited for interactive read aloud.  For example, text over the course of the first few pages reads:Have you seen my dragon? No? I will look for him.Maybe he got hungry and stopped for a hot dog.Or perhaps he went downtown on the bus.It's possible he went for a swim.It is also not a complex seek-and-find book.  The dragon is easy to spot in every spread, as are the items being counted on each page. This book is better for simple pointing and counting than for poring over the details to find objects or characters.  For older children who enjoy more challenging seek-and-find books, try Mr. Tweed's Good Deeds.The illustrations have a decidedly retro, 1950's feel.  Men wear hats and hold jobs as doormen, hot dog vendors, firefighters, ship captains, and zoo keepers. Women all wear skirts/dresses and high heels as they push strollers, sew, shop, and eat ice cream. Like the classic Richard Scary books, this is not at all subtle about stereotypical gender roles. It's rather in keeping with the period depicted in the book, but... I'm not sure that the child young enough for a point-and-count book is old enough to understand differences between ""the old days"" and today. To ignore it, embrace it, opt out of it, or talk about it is a family choice.  On one hand, I grew up (as a little girl) adoring Richard Scary and don't think it limited my world view in the least, but, on the other hand, I'm a little more aware now of the messages in the books we share with our very young daughters and sons. I've mentioned it here as an FYI, rather than as a complaint about this book.And, finally, the spoiler.  The dragon is finally ""found"" in Chinatown.  Here, he switches from the fairy tale dragon seen on the cover and in action throughout the book - swimming, helping people, playing ball - to a stationary Chinese dragon on the roof of a building. ""There he is!  Right where I left him!"", concludes the book.  Kids familiar with Chinatown may ""get it"", but it is a less satisfying ending for the child who hasn't experienced such a place. Many kids won't care, but some will be puzzled.None of these things are complaints about the book, but, as a combination of elements, this fell just shy of being one of those rare and amazing picture books that belong on every child's shelf to be enjoyed for years.  It's certainly worth checking out of the library or adding to an already rich home or classroom collection, though. For the child who particularly loves illustrations of this sort, dragons, or New York City, it could be a jewel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDRVU6643IHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763666483#wasThisHelpful","R3KDRVU6643IHR","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lovely book has a delightful retro feel, with acetate and paper pages that transition each of  habitat from night to day.The slightly oversized dimensions - 12 inches x 10 inches - make it a great lap book for sharing with a child!Parents of very young children may wish to know that there are some mild depictions of animals hunting:An owl has caught a vole.A wolf chases a hare.A wolverine squares off with a sable.None of it is even remotely graphic or frightening, but the book is best suited for children who are comfortable with the idea that some animals eat other animals.The vocabulary makes this book a very special find for the preschooler's read-aloud library.  I have never seen a better book for encouraging children to use illustrations and context as clues as they puzzle through new words. ""A generuk feasts on acacia leaves"", for example, will naturally lead the child to the illustration to try to figure out what the generuk is.  Who is eating leaves? Well, it's that little deer-like creature in the corner!  Hello, generuk!The powerful and purposeful action verbs in this book would also make it a great ""spark"" for elementary school writing projects.  The twirling moths, scampering mink, shuffling boar, and dancing jellyfish could inspire any young writer.The rich illustrations are the third and greatest triumph of this book.  They are spectacular - loaded with details to pore over and talk about.  It is as fun for a child to pull from the shelf to study alone or with a friend as it is to share as a read-aloud with an adult. The end papers, alone, are a treasure.This book deserves far more positive attention than it has received.In an era when children's books seem to be getting weaker and thinner, this one is a winner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0LEXI0RAYKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909263028#wasThisHelpful","R2C0LEXI0RAYKB","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Other than the person who wrote that it was a great gag gift, I can't fathom the high reviews for this book!The retro-looking cover with foil highlights is neat, but that is where the appeal of this book ends.It is a poorly illustrated mix of mundane information, such as:Bland statistics - ""More than 1/3 of grandparents spend the equivalent of three days a week caring for their grandchildren"" and ""There are around 56 million grandparents in the United States."" (Does anyone find this fascinating???)Really lame safety tips - ""Never leave an iron on near a child"" and ""Never open windows wide enough for a child to crawl out."" (I'm a fan of keeping kids safe, but this isn't what I was looking for in a gift for a wonderful grandparent!)Tips for getting along with the parents.  Here, you'll discover that while the author feels all little boys like toy guns, you should ask their parents before buying them.  Also, the grandparent should apparently avoid weighing in on diaper training, feeding practices, bedtimes, and other parenting practices so as to ""never undermine the confidence of a new mom or dad"".  (Nothing makes a great Grandma gift like a book that says,  ""Shut up"", right?)Tips for having grandkids visit.  Here, you'll find a number of pages of ""helpful"" lists of foods children like to eat (""bread, cheese, tuna fish, jam...""), essentials for baby care (""diapers, wipes, ointment, bottles..."") and ideas for older children (""toys, games, books, clothing..."")The rest of the book is a similar, random mix of articles.  A set of four recipes - lemonade, chicken nuggets, chocolate chip cookies, and fruit muffins - is followed by mini biographies of ""glamorous grandmas"" that focus on vague descriptions of their strict exercise and health regimens.  Apparently, you can be a beautiful grandmother by NOT eating chocolate chip cookies or drinking lemonade.Whole pages are devoted to games such as ""Granny May I?"" and crafts such as a construction paper card that says ""Mom"" in glitter.There are a few times when the author is clearly trying to be funny, but much of the content is so obvious or so condescending that the book offends far more than it humors or inspires.

"We have a young cat who must be ""revved down"" with active play before bed if we want to get any sleep, as well as a senior cat who needs encouragement to exercise.  We keep a collection of wand toys in the closet for special playtimes.I've had my eye on this toy for quite awhile, and finally made the purchase.It is nice, but I don't see the quality or details that I would hope for a toy of this price.  The first thought that comes to mind is ""nothing special"".  The hand grip and wand tip are slick, hard plastic and the toy is chenille and plastic with rubber band-like legs that won't last long.  The eye-hook at the end of the wand was loose and immediately needed tightened.""Nothing special"" was the cats' reaction, too.  Young cat chases it, but not with the reckless abandon and wild ""kitten eyes"" that we see with his favorite toys. After a few passes, he is done.  Senior cat will swipe at if it comes near, but doesn't find it worth getting up for.If price isn't an object or you're in love with the bug designs, it is a cute toy.  After handling it in person, I can't fathom why it costs twice the price of other, similar toys, such as Go Cat's Da Bird or the Vee Purrfect Bouncer/Pouncer toys.

"This is a cute book, with lots of cheerful, colorful drawings of the Sesame Street characters.  In that sense, it is appealing to preschoolers.It also features spiral binding to allow the pages to lie flat, a nice feature on any cookbook.All in all, though, I was disappointed.The pages are very, very thin, and I don't think they will hold up well to being turned by little, less-coordinated fingers.  They certainly won't hold up to any drips or spatters during cooking.Also, not one, single recipe features pictures of any of the steps of the recipe. Photos are of the final product, and the steps are awfully complex for little ones.  For example, step 3 of one recipe reads, ""In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, ricotta cheese, yogurt, sugar, and cinnamon,  With a wooden spoon, stir in the drained noodles and raisins.  Spoon the mixture into the oiled baking dish.""  That's all one step.While I imagine that this was done to limit each recipe to a few ""easy"" steps, that's a lot to process. With preschoolers, draining the noodles is a step.  Stirring is a step.  Spooning is a step, and so on.I would have loved to have see the Sesame puppets used to model and teach safety tips and baking techniques that the littlest kids can manage, such as how to use a whisk, how to measure with a measuring cup, or how to spoon cookie dough onto a cookie sheet. Instead, there are only drawings of the characters with speech bubbles saying things like ""Count the different noodles you see in your pantry."" or ""Most eggs have just one yolk inside, but every once in awhile, there are two.  And that's no yoke!"".  Not terrible, but not as strong as it could be.And, finally, I don't feel like the recipe selection is especially suited to preschool tastes.  While I am not one of those people who limits a child's food choices to ""kiddy foods""  like chicken nuggets, my experience has been that - in the toddler and preschool years - all but the most adventurous eaters prefer simple recipes with limited ingredients.If I'm making chicken piccata for the family, I know my littlest eater will probably prefer a plate with chicken, sauce on the side for dipping, noodles to the side, simple vegetables and so on, rather than everything mixed together.  A plate of ""sorted"" vegetables is preferred over a tossed salad.  If I were writing a baking book for toddlers and preschoolers, I might opt for simple flavors.This book includes things like a carrot-raisin-pineapple cake with Greek yogurt and lemon rind frosting and a casserole with potatoes, kale, onion, eggs, cottage cheese, and tomatoes.The recipes have (kind of dumb) kid-friendly names, like ""Yummy Tummy Biscuits"", but the recipes themselves aren't really written with most little kids in mind.  They seem more suited to young chefs in the 7 -12 year range.  With many recipes calling for 14 - 16 ingredients, these could be expensive experiments if it turns out your little one isn't buying into beets in the red velvet cupcakes or a baked baby spinach and goat cheese egg dish.I purchased as a gift, but am returning the book because I just don't see it being very useful for families in the kitchen.Although it doesn't have the appealing Sesame characters, I very much prefer the Early Sprouts Cookbook for healthy, kid-friendly recipes that children can enjoy preparing and won't balk at eating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y772FBHNV1JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470638869#wasThisHelpful","R2Y772FBHNV1JR","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is in the hallway, but is loud enough to wake me in the night and a distraction when trying to work during the day. It's like a very loud, running toilet day and night - not exactly a soothing or pleasant sound.The pump is not adjustable, and the only way to lessen the noise level is to fill it almost to the brim.

"I'm sure I'll receive some ""not helpful"" votes for departing from popular opinion on this one, but I'm not a Nilson fan.  Or, rather, I'm not a fan of what works to stop Nilson's fits.I LOVE the artwork, and the Amelia-Nilson relationship has tremendous kid appeal.  Kids love stories where children have power over big things. I also like that our little Amelia is shown building with blocks, riding a scooter, playing a ukulele - not just doing ""girly"" things.  She's my kind of kid.The story follows Amelia and her special friend Nilson through a day, with impatient Nilson often on the verge of fits.  Amelia or her mom help him calm down when he gets upset.  Problem is, half of the examples use food to get Nilson to behave:When Nilson can't get his sneakers on.  Amelia calms him by reminding that he can have banana pancakes for breakfast.  Next page, Nilson is seen drinking happily from the syrup bottle.When Nilson wants someone else's banana on the train, Amelia's mom says, ""If you both sit quietly, we'll get banana ice cream on the way home.""  Amelia then covers Nilson's mouth and chants the words ""banana ice cream"" all the way to their stop.I get the gorilla-banana connection, but I wish the book hadn't gone to junk food as a reward. Or, at least, I wish there had been more, other examples to balance it out. We're not fond of promising treats for good behavior.Which brings me to the other quibble with the book: When Nilson gets the last scoop of banana ice cream, Amelia has a FIT.  She drops to the ground, growls, and roars, ""I WANT BANANA ICE CREAM!""  So Nilson gives her his.On one hand, it is a kind, empathetic act.  But, on the other hand, it is rewarding the fit.  I wish the author could have had Nilson offer to share when Amelia started to be disappointed, rather than after the roaring fit.All in all, it is a delightfully illustrated book with just the right amount of repetitive text for storytelling. Older siblings of tantrum-throwing toddlers might enjoy it.

"Lovely, realistic paintings of children at work and play with a variety of construction materials are paired with photos of ""matching"" architecture from around the world, and accompanied by concise, playful poetry.The pairings are well selected and represent not only traditional block building, but also sand play, art activities, nature play, and more. The paintings in this book have beautifully captured the focus of a child at work.My only wish is that the architectural photos paired with each painting were of a more consistent quality.  Some are truly beautiful and well composed, but others feel more like the stock photos that would grace the uninspiring pages of a ten year old textbook.The book still makes a lovely addition to the classroom, where it will support children's interest in building and in the world around them.  It reflects the ways in which young children typically interact with materials very well, and is sure to inspire play and ""spark"" many meaningful conversations about shapes, lines, buildings, and materials.The book has a place on the shelf of every adult educator and advocate, as well.  It has a subtle but strong message about how very valuable concrete, hands-on learning opportunities are for young children, in a format that can be enjoyed and appreciated by early childhood professionals, parents, and policy makers alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20O3GOH3ODPUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600606512#wasThisHelpful","R20O3GOH3ODPUR","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why hang artwork on your walls when you can use these attractive shelves that provide a whole new world of ""vertical space"" for the cats? Ours are in constant use - cats climbing, perching, and napping - and it is like an ever-changing work of art.We used three shelves to create a long diagonal pathway up a large empty wall; the cats have the option of going all the way to the top or stepping off onto the top of a bookshelf midway up.  A low, matching cat tree creates their ""on and off ramp"" at the low end, allowing easy access even for our very old kitty. We bought these shelves for the playful younger cats and never thought our senior would climb, but she LOVES them and spends many days snoozing on top of the bookshelf!  She feels so safe up there that she doesn't run to hide under the bed when the doorbell rings any more.These are pricy but install very easily with no ugly brackets. That was a real selling point for us.I love the rounded, modern appearance, and the magnetic pads on each cloud create a super soft, safe, easy-to-clean surface. Ours have had heavy use every day for about a year; I vacuum them off every now and then, and they still look brand new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRDRBRQWSGHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VH7SVS#wasThisHelpful","RYRDRBRQWSGHU","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These colorful tweezers match the colors of many of our small sorting sets, so they seemed like an obvious fit as a fine motor tool.We can set out a basket of mixed materials and have children pick same-colored tweezers and bowls to pick out all of the items of their color.It works well in theory, but in practice these tweezers aren't so great.They are very large, very stiff, and made of slick plastic.  They slip and slide around in the child's hand and I notice that children often drop the tweezers or end up using both hands to try to make them work, and it seems to cause a good bit of frustration.  Kids who would normally stick with sorting tasks for quite awhile seem to get annoyed and give up with these tools.The youngest preschoolers who would benefit most from color sorting activities just put the tweezers down and use their fingers instead.We ended up switching to metal ice cube tongs and wooden Montessori tweezers, using markers or stickers if color coding is needed. We've had better luck with these materials; kids are more apt to stick with it and enjoy the task if their tools work as intended!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R295DN157DPNVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00361NV88#wasThisHelpful","R295DN157DPNVY","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tube is filled with ""goo"" that appears to be thick, tinted corn syrup, in a funnel-like tube.  There's a top cylinder and a bottom cylinder, with a small hole between to let the goo funnel between the two.We use this in a preschool environment with both typically functioning kids and kids with special needs.They are used in many ways, but our top 3 uses are:1. A rest time toy for kids who need a little help settling down.  They slow down and relax as they watch the slow flow of the goo.  Add slowly blinking twinkle lights and lullabies on CD, and it is magic!2. A basket of toys like these are offered in a soft ""safe space"" where kids can retreat to have time alone if they feel tired, cranky, or overwhelmed.  This is a favorite and really seems to help children calm down and focus.3.  These are a BLAST on a light table!

"I purchased these in hopes of having a way to redirect a young cat who likes to chew pencils, pens, and power cords.If the ingredients had been listed online, I would have kept looking for other options!The ingredient listing on the back of the bag reads: soy protein concentrate, wheat gluten, gelatin, corn gluten meal, chicken meal, and taurine.The soy, corn, and wheat are all very common allergens for cats, often resulting in skin problems or gastrointestinal problems.  While I didn't expect this product to be grain free, I was surprised at the sheer quantity of grains and fillers in these ""treats!In addition, the bag identifies the manufacturer as ""Natural Polymer International Corp."", which means the wheat, corn, and soy products are almost certainly coming from overseas and possibly not from a company with pets at heart.  Not so long ago, there were serious contamination issues resulting in pets dying from low quality, contaminated pet food fillers from China.While it probably still beats eating pencils, I'd prefer to find a healthier, safer option for our cat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DIA7RIMY54V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00061MULK#wasThisHelpful","R1DIA7RIMY54V7","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What fun ""cause and effect"" tools to use with storebought or homemade playdough, modeling clay, or real clay.This is a set of twelve extruders that includes a variety of shapes.There's many sizes and shapes of string/hair/spaghetti(depending on which kid you ask); heart, star, square, leaf and flower shapes; and more.  No two are the same.  The extruders measure about 3.5 inches long and are sturdy and well suited for preschool use.Kids can just press a lump of playdough or clay into the syringe-like tube and press on the plunger to squeeze out a long piece of shaped dough. Some very young children struggle a bit with this skill at first, but it is great for building hand strength and fine motor skills, and with a little persistence and practice they are able to do it easily.Pair these with butter knives or children's scissors so that children can trim the shaped dough as desired.  When they are finished with one project, roll the dough back into a ball, pick another extruder, and begin again! It could also be fun to experiment with the extruders with other substances, such as shaving cream or homemade ""gak"". The results wouldn't be as perfectly formed, but kids would have a blast and would be able to make some scientific observations about properties of solids and liquids.Clean up and be a bit tricky if not done right away.  A pencil can help remove clay/dough from the inside of the tube.  Clean up is easiest if dough is removed right away when finished, or if you wait and let dough dry out completely and then discard. The extruders are also washable.These are a lot of fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GH75J0RYW5K6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003U6VT24#wasThisHelpful","R1GH75J0RYW5K6","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this doll, along with the Asian, Hispanic, and African American dolls, for preschool classroom use.I love that I was able to put together an appealing set of diverse dolls so affordably.Teacher supply catalogs sell ""multicultural"" sets for an arm and a leg, and the dolls are cheap, bland, and flat out unattractive. These JC Toy dolls each have a different, realistic facial expression and the detailing on the hands and feet are fantastic.  They have ""kid appeal"", for sure!Be sure to note the size of these dolls.  The description says ""11 inches"", but ours are closer to 10 inches from top of head to tip of toe.  That's really small! However, it is a cute, quality doll for the price. I'd rather have small dolls that last than cheapy big dolls that fall apart right away.  If price isn't a worry for you and you want a lifesize, high quality doll, check out the Middleton play dolls and the Molly P. Originals play dolls. But if you're on a budget, these JC dolls are a good pick.I disagree with other posters who say that these small dolls are only suited to one and two year old children.  In my experience, children up to age 5 play with dolls of any size, from the Polly Pockets size up to larger-than life size! It's just like how they will play with stuffed animals of all sizes, toy cars of all sizes, etc.  Most preschoolers just aren't concerned about size/scale.  I wish the dolls were bigger, but I have not had a single child complain that they are too small!The only thing I really don't care for are the clothes.  I ordered 4 dolls, and all had the ""colors may vary"" note.  I was hoping for at least a little variety!  All came in the exact same, pink outfit (as pictured).  The quality on the clothes - especially the top - is pretty poor and they aren't going to stand up to heavy duty use in the classroom.  I'm left wondering where I'll find replacement clothes for a doll this size.All in all, this is a great purchase if you're prepared for a small doll.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R46QEM39T2G9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002APDYV0#wasThisHelpful","R46QEM39T2G9A","A2G9M92C9FBUEP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G9M92C9FBUEP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love it.  This is the best book yet in this terrific series and the author really knows how to deliver what this reader has wanted to happen since the first book was published. The road to the heart-warming and tender and emotional conclusion was hard fought but with Savannah at the top of her game and Rafe as handsomely wicked in what he does, nothing was impossible.  The author’s detailed narrative put me in the middle of all the action. The surprised actions of Savannah’s Mother made this drama more fulfilling, especially with everyone doing their part to make Savannah’s dream come true. I like how the mystery was set up and all the key players had a role in solving it.  The author has created a great family dynamics and I like watching the dynamics of this family become more developed as the series progresses. This is great read and I can’t wait to read what happens next in Savannah’s world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NAU11N0B0ZN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW5W6SW#wasThisHelpful","R1NAU11N0B0ZN0","A3MGX52HV1IE0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MGX52HV1IE0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lorna has done again by delivering a brilliantly executed drama that I could not put down until the last page was turned and boy did she keep me in suspense with this thoroughly engaging whodunit.Tricia is once again thrust in another murder and try as she might, she just had to do a little investigating and when she was done, well, you’ll just have to read this book. Everything about it kept me glued to the pages and those twists and turns were explosive with several outcomes I didn’t even expect. Tricia really shined in this book, showing her vulnerabilities, yet still being a determined soul. I enjoyed the direction this story took beckoning with new beginnings with old and new friends.

"4.5 starsI enjoyed the latest adventures with Cait and Bud who are set to marry and of course, what mars this exciting time is Murder.  What I like best about this drama is that all the suspects are trapped inside this castle, which puts Cait and Bud on high alert to uncover the killer’s identity. The author did a great job in the telling of this tale placing me in the middle of all the action, as I wanted to know what role every character played in this intriguing and finely tuned whodunit.

Sarah Booth’s blues is brought to the forefront when her assistance is required when her friend and his bandmates are being threatened and when one is murdered, it will take Sarah Booth, Tinkie, Coleman, Harold and the gang all the strength needed to put out this burning fire. I enjoyed this well-written drama that put me alongside Sarah Booth as she tackled the case in front of her and her personal life.  I like how the author created a story that seemed as real to me as it appeared on the page.

John has a way with the narrative that grabbed me instantly in the telling of this story with a well-written plot and some very intriguing characters that make you believe that you are standing there in the shadow next to Lucas.

"This fast-paced, adrenaline-fuel and action-packed drama immediately pulled me in never letting go until the last sentence was read. The past comes back to haunt Allison and it’s her determination to solve this puzzle that brings her life full-circle in this suspense-filled and intriguing tale that I could not put down. The intensity of each scene controlled my emotions and I was there running with Allison as this case seemed to open up a can of worms that she was not prepared to witness. I like that the author took the time to draw me into the storyline with the visual display of her words and the dialogue that warned me that there was more to come that heighten the level in the dynamic telling of this mystery. Allison is strong-willed, always seeking the truth and is surrounded by a great cast of characters that includes Vaughn, Jason and Mia.

Penny is very likeable and a good team that includes Hayley, Connor, Anne, Ross, Thomas and Antonia completes her inner circle that provides a well-rounded mystery that is a welcome addition to the cozy genre.

The author was very adept at pulling it all together with a sizzle of suspense and intrigue into the characters’ life that enable me to keep up with the story as the search for the killer narrowed down as I moved closer to the end.

I enjoyed how well the murder mystery was played out with suspects that were too good to be true and it was fun watching it all come together until that moment when I knew the killer’s identity.

The glamour of Hollywood’s past is felt in this terrific story of conspiracy, murder and the people who will do anything to protect that “life” even at the cost of a person’s history. The essence of this story took me to a time and place that gave an inside look into the happenings behind a gilded gate. This fast-paced, action-filled tome was enticingly sinful with a mystery that pulled me in immediately and kept me engaged from beginning to a conclusion worthy of a Hollywood finale. Deirdre is a great heroine determined to understand the truth and I felt every nuances of her discovery. The supporting cast was just as superb in their role and interactions.

"This was very enjoyable. I like the way the story flowed easing me into a drama that quickly accelerated as time was running out and the need to know what was behind the murder was top of mind. I like the premise of an attorney and friends who are white collar ex-cons getting together to help the police solve their friend’s murder and of course there’s more going on that is uncovered as the story progresses. The author’s use of the plot twists that appeared gave me pause and made the telling of this story much more rewarding, especially the widow’s reason for why she did what she did. I like the way the author portrays Hollis a strong and determined protagonist; guarded yet shows a vulnerable side which keeps her grounded. This fast-paced, action-filled drama propels you to the end in this exciting mystery that leaves you wanting more.

"I love it. This book grabbed my attention from the beginning and the beautifully written narrative placed me in the middle of all the action in this evenly paced drama. The tone was very comfortable and I liked that it added to my reading pleasure with a suspense-filled mystery that kept me glued to the pages as the author intended. The author did a great job in setting up the murder mystery with suspects that seemed fitted to being the culprit but as the story moved forward, the list narrowed until there was just one. I also enjoyed watching Colleen come into her own about her growing relationship with Bill and her interactions with her co-workers.

I love all of the secondary characters who are eccentrically unique in their own right and help to propel this wonderful story.

From beginning to end, this book captured the soul of the chase and the triumph of justice’s reign.

"I was really excited about trying this after reading other reviews, but it seemed a little weak. We have a small apartment with old renters' smoke smell clinging to to the walls, even after installing new carpet and painting every room. We only used one room shocker in the main room. This room seems to have most of the smoke residue removed. We had it open and treating the room for about 3 days. After throwing the treatment away, the faint chlorine smell disappeared. The main room seems to have a better smell right around where the room shocker was, but the other side of the room still smells like smoke, albeit better than before. I think we will buy these again, but next time put two in each room, on each side of the room. From all the warnings and having to be out of the house during the duration of the treatment, I assumed it would be a powerful, overwhelming change. It wasn't this strong--next time I would put several out around the house while we were away for the treatment to be more effective.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX6TXN4O85B7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HL6HBC#wasThisHelpful","RX6TXN4O85B7N","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This air mattress exceeded our expectations. The pump is so simple and has a nice storage dish for the cord. It inflated fully in about 3 minutes. It's nice and tall off the floor and the top is soft and sturdy material. My fitted Queen sheets fit it snuggly, there's a groove around the base for sheets to cling to, so we didn't have the bedding slipping off during the night. It is surprisingly comfy! You can add or deflate air to make it as soft or hard as you prefer. My husband opted to sleep on the mattress instead of our own bed the night after our guests left because he could fill it up to make a super firm bed for his back (he thinks our usual mattress is too soft). Deflating was quick and easy--I just switched the panel to 'deflate' and in 3 minutes, the entire mattress was flat and compressed, ready to be folded and slipped into the storage bag they provided. It's small enough to stick in the cupboard with some of our other storage items. This is one of the best purchases we've ever made, and I think it will last a long time, it seems to be made of very durable materials.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15UG4OTF6C9N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAW4O0A#wasThisHelpful","R15UG4OTF6C9N2","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great reviews, easy setup for WLAN or LAN with good connectivity, quiet and efficient while printing, and doesn't install all the garbage and updating software that HP does. We've had it for about 6 months now and there's never been a hiccup. I love black and white printers because there's minimal waste and you know ink isn't being wasted to print black when you forget to toggle the settings.You only need to buy one ink cartridge--as opposed to sometimes 4 with color printers--when it's empty and they run about $50 on Amazon. However, the ink cartridge of ""500"" prints is vastly over-exaggerating, but I don't care. Also it will tell you it can't print 3/4 through but if you go online with the IP address you can easily fix it.Would highly recommend and will buy another Brother when we need a color printer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDWZUKR7ORGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00450DVDY#wasThisHelpful","R1JDWZUKR7ORGL","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought my wife a pack of Scharffen Berger for her birthday even though a few of the reviews warned of poor packaging/delivery and a disappointingly average taste. However, one of my teachers raved about it so we had to give it a try. Before eating it, we read all about how they preserve the older chocolate-making traditions so that the chocolate keeps all the subtle flavors it inherently has--which put us both in a hungry mood! And we LOVED it. The chocolate is the healthy medium between brittle and soft. Also, there are so many  subtle, citrus-y flavors in the chocolate bar, we easily devoured three bars in two days!! The chocolate bars are about half a centimeter thick, 3 in x 8 in rectangles, patterned into easily breakable triangles that don't quite fit into your mouth for one bite. The most wonderful part of eating this chocolate is how nibbling only a small amount of the chocolate triangle releases a big taste, enabling you to enjoy small pieces for longer.The flavor is not quite American and not quite European, but you definitely have to try it at least once!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRZ757XVNS3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NVU5BK#wasThisHelpful","R3RRZ757XVNS3H","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you need if you order this break pad: 1) Allen wrenches: in order to tighten the pad in place; 2) an understanding of brake replacement: there are no instructions; 3) A sense of humor: there're four pieces to help fill the empty space between the brake and the wheel but it was already tight on my road bike so I had to stack all four on the outside of the brake chassis BECAUSE it so happens that the screw threads only go down so far (horrible idea for brake pad design). The first time I tightened it--with my hands, I might add, not Allen wrenches--one of the four plastic spacers had already cracked.The brakes work well enough but they could've simplified the design a lot to aid in installment and the four spacers should've been made out of metal rather than out of a cheap plastic; nevertheless, they are appropriately priced so I gave them a 3/5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAGTS33FNDO64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NNX3WG#wasThisHelpful","RAGTS33FNDO64","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Robert Newton Peck wrote A Day No Pigs Would Die as a tribute to his father in a fictional auto-biographical style where he is a young farm boy in Vermont. His father, Haven Peck, a slow, pious farmer, slaughters pigs in order to supplement his meager income as a farmer; however, he slowly gets sicker and sicker. Meanwhile, young Robert fills his bright childhood days roving, exploring, avoiding chores, and playing with his newly-acquired piglet, Pinky. The excitement of Robert’s innocent life is enabled only by an active imagination and appreciation for the world’s beauty while his life is also punctuated by jarring events that teach him of life’s harshness. One such event is a horrible winter where food for the family runs scarce and Pinky might be the only option. You need to read it to find out what happens!The book’s length runs around 170 pages, but even though it’s slim, the book introduces rich characters with poignant dialogue. Haven Peck, the father, is one of my favorite characters since he so beautifully portrays a noble farmer—perhaps in another age or circumstance he would be Scipio. He’s a character who beautifies humility, which is a welcome relief to our modern day obsession with success.You can read this book in a day and then want to reread it a week later because there’s a lot of ruminating and insights into your own personal life.

"Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the blockbuster “Inception,” set in a semi-futuristic world where the subconscious is accessible even to those who want to cause harm. He plays the role of an “extractor,” someone who enters people’s dreams to take information without them knowing, and is put up to the unheard of challenge to deposit, instead of steal, an idea.“Inception” presents a variation on a Matrix theme where the mind houses a perhaps preferable abode than reality. Despite some big names like DiCaprio to advertise the movie, there is considerable fodder for thought about topics like dreams, reality, time, and the power of thoughts. The movie ends up more action than cerebral—and kind of unreal, GI Joe action sequences as well—to cover all possible viewer preferences.

Along the way he meets a warm woman who somehow feels his pain and his sincerity. After witnessing the father refuse any communication with the boy, she agrees to adopt him. Nevertheless, true to the maxim “There’s no rest for the weary” a neighborhood boy of poor reputation sucks the orphan-like kid in by lavishing him with almost patriarchal favors and attention. This scenario threatens his new-fangled peace with the woman who patiently cares for him despite his acting out. Only the viewer can see how the neighborhood boy wields friendship as a lever for crime. You’ll have to watch the rest to see how it resolves!Poignant themes resound throughout of family vs. peers and anger vs. forgiveness while the ultimate question posed is: Can a broken child be mended?Beautifully acted and the boy actor does a tremendous job characterizing how the detrimental seed of neglect grows inside youth. I highly recommend this movie to all who like to feel a character’s plight instead of just observe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JY1MITBZAST5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8QDI1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1JY1MITBZAST5","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine used to say ""Poor people cannot afford to be cheap."" Well... it's true. This charger might be deemed ""affordable"" by some, but it really is CHEAP.Battery chargers should be 2-3x more expensive than this one for one sufficient reason: fires. However, I gave this charger 3/5 because I'm using it: A. as little as possible while my new laptop is arriving and I have to do homework and B. I'm keeping a close eye on the heat of the charger and my laptop. I initially left my T400 charging for half an hour and it resulted in my laptop fan running on all cylinders (which it has never done before even during demanding video games) and the charger itself climbing to the temperatures of a lizard's hot rock. On the plus side, it charges my laptop quickly.So NEVER LEAVE CHARGER PLUGGED INTO THE WALL UNATTENDED (not just your laptop!) if you have to buy this battery charger for a quick fix. As a permanent replacement, NEVER use this battery charger and the subsequent rating would be 0/5.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11822OSIJ2YMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BP03YI#wasThisHelpful","R11822OSIJ2YMA","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Axis and Allies is one of the ultimate military games because it so smoothly integrates probability into strategy—whereas Risk has a measure of strategy but it’s ultimately a matter of luck whether you win a battle or not. It is (mostly) a matter of preparation and insight in Axis and Allies... the dice simply makes it interesting. In this version it is three Allies (US, UK, Russia) against the Axis (Germany, Japan). Other versions exist where Italy is an additional Axis power.This is the real genius of Axis and Allies: the dice is rolled for a unit to hit another unit (e.g. tanks attack on a 3 so rolling a 3, 2, or 1 is a hit) so attacker and defender roll for hits and then choose which units take the hits. On top of that, units attack and defend at different rolls. Within the waging of war, the player must weigh the advantage of units within the imminent battle, the difference in attack/defense (e.g. bombers attack on a 4 but defend on a 1 whereas tanks attack and defend on a 3) and the production cost of the unit.As for history, Axis and Allies tries to closely mimic the theaters of war in the European and Pacific zones during 1941 (WWII). The game setup urges players to actually initiate those decisive battles: Nazis try to take Moscow for production points, Japanese attack Pearl Harbor in Hawaii because of an exposed ship.I never liked probability based games as a kid—Monopoly, Yahtzee, card games—so playing Axis and Allies would’ve been a great opportunity as a child.If you like Stratego, Settlers of Catan, or Risk, you’ll thoroughly enjoy this game. However setup and gameplay is fairly advanced and scenario-dependent with lots of subtleties specific to battles so make sure prospective players are ready to commit to learning and are also patient (perhaps ages 11+) . Additionally, game play can take up to four hours, especially when beginning, so set aside a chunk of time and make sure you play between two meals like lunch and dinner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XH9ZAZKMT4KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TB3R80#wasThisHelpful","R1XH9ZAZKMT4KV","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I waited so long for ""You Will Be My Son"" to come to the U.S. and I was NOT disappointed!!!!Summary: A father continues a successful international wine business when his grown son believes he is under-appreciated and under-utilized. The son is ready for more responsibility--in hopes for taking over the business one day--but the father sees only shortcomings and disaster. A neighbor down the road (who works for the father) contracts cancer, which fetches his son from America.

The Gilles Legrand's fictional lesson is well-timed in this modern era where one might find posthumous renown/success in industry more alluring than success in the family unit. Of course (like in a lot of French cinema), the acting is phenomenal, and Lorant Deutsch (the wealthy father's son) powerfully portrays the passion and confusion boiling in a neglected son.

"I loved these knight figures as a kid! I called them ""Munchkin Knights"" and had a collection of about 40. The arms are the only move-able parts, and the figures are fun-looking because you can only see their noses.Kids between 5 and 11 really enjoy them, and I have to hide them every time a kid goes to my parents house. These knights are so rare now because they were discontinued and replaced with a newer generation of knights which are smaller (unfortunately). My collection--after 25 years or so--is still in good condition so the figures are extremely durable although the paint wears off after a while; especially with hard playing.Although the price is a little steep, it might be appropriate since you can't find them anywhere else!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNE00JSDYX0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVM2YIC#wasThisHelpful","R3HNE00JSDYX0J","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I refuse to pay money to a cable company to rent (e.g. Comcast charges $5/mth), so I went out and purchased a modem and router. (I was nervous about buying a modem/router combo because of the expensive) Installation/setup was a quick transition by the cable guy, and I bought a Netgear router for wireless access as well. Streaming, downloading, online classes all work fine. There have been a few connection problems but they are ALWAYS the routers fault and as long as you're patient and have an ethernet cable nearby, it's fine.If you want more dependability and speed, then maybe a more expensive machine'd work; but I don't see what more you could want from a modem as an average internet user...","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BNFX7V5S58M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JV9LUK#wasThisHelpful","R3BNFX7V5S58M9","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the average, non-tech savvy young professional, Netgear has worked out well. I bought a modem since I don't want to pay the $5/mth fee to rent, and I like the modem/router I purchased. Now there are a lot of people unhappy with the Netgear N300, and it's understandable--knocks you off, sometimes bad connection, daily resets, etc. But honestly, if I'm patient and have an ethernet cable nearby when it lags, I have no problems. There are two on/off buttons (one for power and the other for wifi), but I'd be wary resetting the machine a lot. People include it in their daily routine when if you simply wait it out or use the ethernet cable, it resolves itself.A few circumstances worsen the connectivity with the router. I've noticed that Apple products don't mix well with PC products on the router, too many products jam the connectivity (a collection of iPad, iPhone, laptops, desktops), and the connection varies with products: I have an older Lenovo laptop (loses wireless connection three times a week) and my wife has an Asus (loses connection once a month). Although I haven't noticed a difference in signal if it is positioned horizontal or vertical.If you live an intense life where not a moment can be wasted without wireless, don't get a Netgear. If you can wait a few bugs out and not explode at a cheaper machine in a market dominated by high prices, it's a good deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C3H71B4S73MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AZP8EW#wasThisHelpful","R2C3H71B4S73MH","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not an avid bicycler, but I do commute to school everyday (16 miles total) in a densely populated, and therefore dirty, area. The winter's arriving so I wanted new tires, andI was also tired of replacing tubes since my other tires weren't thick enough for the urban debris. After all the rave reviews, I thought this tire could possibly save me if I were drowning so I gave it a try.I have replaced tires before, but NOTHING came close to the level of difficulty of putting these tires on the rims. I initially thought I ordered the wrong tire but that wasn't it. It took an hour and a half to successfully wrench the tires onto the rim--deploying sundry metal items as levers since the classic plastic tire levers weren't working--and two busted tubes as I tried to fit them on with the tire and the tire pinched a hole in them from the tight fit. After letting the tires stretch for a while, it still was just as difficult to put the tires on the rim in order to replace the tubes.Nevertheless, the inauspicious beginning ended, and I love the new tires. I, out of necessity, must sometimes ride over garbage and glass, and these tires don't flinch. Rain, no problem. Uneven gravely roads, no worries. Good traction even though it's a simple design. And the best part: Made in Germany. I love German quality (I lived there for a while), and these tires have already proven themselves.

"""The Intouchables"" (as titled in the U.S.) is a French movie about the magic that ensues when two individuals open up to each other--especially diametrically opposite individuals. Neither one leads his dream life and initially focuses on present unhappiness. However, Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic, hires a black ex-criminal, Driss, to serve as his hands after a spate of highly-educated Frenchmen fail to meet Philippe's true need: humanity. Driss, uneducated yet fun-loving, pulls Philippe into a ""baser"" but more thrilling mentality of adventure and excitement; in essence, Driss leads Philippe back to living, rather than waiting out, life. Despite some vulgar language (it's an adolescent to adult movie after all!), the movie pulls off an emotive, artistic and personal effect to leave my wife and me rejoicing in the healing capabilities of the human spirit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IDC3BYYC0KV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087IT8FK#wasThisHelpful","R1IDC3BYYC0KV9","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard about Kraft Recipe Makers via several crock-pot blogs, so I decided to try it. I was delighted how tasty our meal turned out! It's very simple: there are two sauces inside. You put a chuck beef roast in your crock-pot, pour in marinading sauce, then let your house fill up with the wonderful aromas (it's a vinegar-y, spice smell--my husband loves it). Afterwards, the meat falls apart upon shredding, it's so tender. Then you add the second sauce, which is a tangy BBQ sauce. My husband usually doesn't like beef roast, he thinks it's dry; he loved this dish and said it was very moist and delicious. For dinner, we put the finished meat on potato rolls with coleslaw (it's a Southern thing!). We later made it for a group of teenage girls from church, and THEY loved it, and devoured it. Since then, I've tried a few of the other Recipe Makers line, but this one is by far the best. Now I stock a few boxes in the pantry and keep a couple frozen beef roasts in the freezer; when there's a craving, I take one out and thaw it overnight for the next day.

"Just recently used Netters Atlas 5e for my block of anatomy during first year of medical school. Lots of medical schools require this book for medical with good reason: it's comprehensive, it's detailed, it's easy to understand, and there's NO TEXT, only labelling; so it's an awesome resource--second only to the cadaver. Anatomical relationships also wonderfully depicted. I had the option to order Netters in an undergraduate anatomy class but, specifically for me, I'm glad I didn't. There's a lot of information and unless you have a class to point out relationships (like anastomoses) you might not quite appreciate the amount of effort and knowledge that went into some of the pictures/plates. There is perhaps minor discussion on a few details between my school and what's portrayed in Netters but, like said, it's minor. If you're in undergraduate and really thirsting after something more detailed and complex, then it would be a good purchase (it's relatively cheap on Amazon); however, even if you aren't quite driven to learn outside of class it will be useful for medical school and a career in medicine later on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKYQTB8EG0M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416059512#wasThisHelpful","R1BKYQTB8EG0M3","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While we still enjoy playing, we miss the 5x5 for its capacity for longer words and more creative plays, while still being just as challenging.It's also easier for younger players to find more words they recognize.

"One of my all time favorites; it's inspiring and insightful. Three brothers stem from a profligate hedonist, Fyodor Karamazov, who also happens to have accrued a fortune by his unscrupulous ways.

"The board game of all board games, it is evidence of modern-day progress. The simplest analogy for the game's premise: where in Risk you take over the world through military might, in Settlers of Catan you take over through economic prowess. Involved are: trading, luck (from the die), strategy, and wisdom with money.Initially the game is for up to four players, and you build settlements, cities, and streets to earn points. The first player to reach the point value wins. Each settlement, city, or streets requires resource cards (Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Clay, and Stone) to buy, and you gain resource cards by building a settlement near a resource on the map (which has a number on it) and the die must role your number. It's a simple premise, learned in 10 minutes of playing, so even some children can play along--although there are children's editions to the game.I bought Settlers of Catan in Germany about five years ago and have played it regularly EVER SINCE. In addition to purchasable fifth and sixth players (brown and green), three expansions were developed to make the game continually exciting and interesting. Whenever I move to college or to home or to a travel for a while in a different country, I bring Settlers of Catan.

"As a religious, politically skeptical--i.e. affiliated with no party--pro-Capitalist ephebe, I found myself either enlightened or cringing depending on what page of Atlas Shrugged lay before my eyes. Never before had such an inner conflict arisen in me by an author--except perhaps Nietzsche who, not surprisingly, influenced much of Ayn Rand's ideology. Yet the personal reaction and tumult, overall, delighted my curiosity and aided my understanding of a whole class of people in our society who zealously subscribe to Ayn Randish theories.The book follows the protagonist and train tycoon Dagny Taggart, and a cadre of business-minded super elite, who fight a demeaning, socialistic government intent on taking over all business models for personal gain. Weighing heavily in philosophy and economics, the novel introduces many of Rand's ideas, which function in a fictitious, primitive world but blatantly not this civilized one.Although the book earned my general approbation, there are many instances where I vehemently disagree with Rand--and her cohort who helped her write the book--and find her annoying or difficult. One main point of exasperation is her need to repeat. Rand displays repetition as the first weapon in her armament to the point of silliness and even embarrassment to the reader. This degree of inculcation would allow me to jokingly suggest cutting out and reading John Galt's speech--toward the end of the book--21 times and you'll have read Atlas Shrugged while also sparing muscle from lugging the voluminous entirety around. In her book, I also feel she's guilty of rewriting (American) history, inconsistently redefining prosaic words, and offending a mighty slew of persons--including intellectuals, government officials, the religiously affiliated, and liberals--to discomfit, or even anger, the majority of readers.On the other hand, her Nietzschean, anti-Communist, anti-religion (she sides with Nietzsche over anti-Communism here) thought experiment offers a fresh breath of man-celebrating air. It's a fight against atrophy, apathy with several ""-pathies,"" entropy, and all other powers not focused on progress or self. Her reveling and admiration for man's work refreshes my taste for the world and what we can accomplish in it. It's true she over-exaggerates the beauty in competition, but she also produces salient opinions on work ethic. The ideas can resonate even in the most hopelessly and unapologetically liberal of Democrats. Of course, the fictional work also serves as a bulwark for modern-day Republicans--for example, distrust for press, accessibility of guns, and a dramatic apocalyptical end of the world if government gets too big.You will disagree with many ideas, but also agree with many.

"I looked for a reliable, classy-looking Polaroid camera as a wedding reception guest book. After thorough research, I determined Instax was cheaper and just as reliable, if not more, than the new Polaroid instant cameras. Both cameras function similarly and use the same film; yet Instax has better reviews and is cheaper. The 8S has a few extra bells and whistles: a clip-on lens for close-up pictures, light/dark and indoor/outdoor settings, the mirror on the front of the camera, and two shutter buttons for either landscape or portrait photographs. Also, the lithium batteries are not hard to find for sale online; I haven't had to replace ours yet, but we know that availability and price would afford on inconvenience. I have loved it; it was perfect for the party and I still use it frequently. The film is fairly inexpensive, so we continue to use it. The pictures are the size of a credit card with white borders, and the camera comfortably fits in a small purse. On our honeymoon, the good quality allowed us to take pictures of us in front of landmarks and beautiful areas. Also, a little mirror resides on the front of the camera to facilitate quick self-portraits, which can be taped later into journals as keepsakes. Learning which lighting settings work best in certain conditions took some trial and error, but every picture turned out vintage-y and fun, so no film was wasted.One last word on durability: I didn't have the wrist strap around my arm and accidentally dropped the camera on a ceramic-tiled floor. The film flew out of the back of the camera, but nothing broke off or dented. The camera still looks great and functions optimally, and I only lost the top film, the rest of the cartridge still printed great pictures. That was a while ago, and I haven't had any problems at all!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182ZQ9TU1FOCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWKJPOA#wasThisHelpful","R182ZQ9TU1FOCN","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm a big proponent of High Endurance so try that kind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LWYE9DKXY8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017WNFXE#wasThisHelpful","R27LWYE9DKXY8Y","A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PC0L6BU3ZF8T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ultra Soft Toothbrushs - Bamboo Charcoal Tooth Brushes, you get 4 packs of two toothbrushes for a total of 8 bamboo charcoal toothbrushes.  There are 2 orange, 2 pink, 2 blue and two aqua color.Each of these tooth brushes, the brushes are ultra soft which is important to me and the brushes are grayish-black colored bamboo charcoal bristles.  The backside of each brush has a texture so you can gently scrape/clean your tongue.  The rest of the toothbrush appears to be made out of silicone and has the grip area in the front where you place your thumb while brushing and is anti-slip.Toothbrushes, in general can be costly especially for a good one.  These are simple toothbrushes and there isn't anything fancy about them.  They will effectively clean your teeth and the gumline without being too hard on the gums.  The price is affordable and having a charcoal bamboo bristles is a plus.  Nowadays, seems like everything is having charcoal and or bamboo in it.  Why not the toothbrushes, too!

"Waterproof iPhone 6 6S Case with Built in Screen Protector Guard - is a rugged and durable iPhone 6 case.This is a very durable iPhone 6 case and it is waterproof, scratch-proof and overall a good quality protective case.  It has remarkable shock and drop protection with the tough polycarbonate frame.  The product description says that the iPhone will be protected in the case if submerged into up to 6.6 feet deep of water and that you can in fact use it under water.It does take some time to install the case as there are little screws that need to be unscrewed to open the case to put the phone in and than to screw it back closed once the phone is inserted inside the case. Really, that may be the only drawback of this waterproof iPhone 6 case.  We have a waterproof and shock resistant case that I paid a lot of money for that didn't involve unscrewing or screwing of the case to use it.  Some people may not care about it or others might.Overall, it is a pretty decent phone case and is priced pretty comparable to similar iPhone 6 waterproof cases.

"Love these battery operated white and brown rattan ball fairy lights and the free metal drop fairy lights.  These are gorgeous!!!  They are ideal for my teen daughter's room!  She loves lights in her room and I thought these would be perfect in her room.You receive 20 handmade white and brown rattan balls on a 2.3 meter wire.  They are battery operated, and it requires 3 AA batteries in order to work.  The switch to turn them on is located on the battery box.  There are two different settings for the lights.  There is either keep the lights on all the time or set them to blink.  I am using rechargeable AA batteries in the lights.These lights can be used as Christmas lights, party lights, used in a sun-room, used to highlight something.  The light string is not very long at all.  I have these lights across the top of my daughter's closet.  If you use them on a Christmas tree, you will need several strings.As a freebie, there is a very small maybe about 3-feet string of gold tear drop lights.  They are also very pretty.  These are not long enough to use on anything big.  The string is very small.  At first, I thought these would look lovely above my daughter's vanity mirror.  She decided to have them in the corner above her bed, which looks really cool when you walk into her room and it does give her some light.  These would be the perfect small string of lights to use on one of those tiny Christmas trees that are about a foot tall, or used to go around or above something small.Overall, these 20 handmade rattan ball fairy Christmas lights and the freebie gold tear drop lights are beautiful!  They are unique and beautifully-made.  I feel the price is realistically priced and well worth it!

"NRGized USB 3.0 4-Port Portable Hub with 2-Foot USB 3.0 Cable - It is a lightweight, compact 4-Port Aluminum Hub.  It is very simple to use and doesn't require any software to use it.This is portable hub is lightweight and measures about 3.5 inches long and about 3/4 of an inch in diameter.  It is a classy silver looking design. There are 4 USB ports, which you will find two on each side.  The USB cord is already built into the hub and it can plug into your computer.  It is compatible with Windows XP or later and Mac OS x 10.6 or later computers.I tested this portable hub with two of my smartphones - my Samsung Note 4 and my HTC.  I have pictures below.  First, I plugged the portable hub into my Windows computer.  Then, I plugged my Samsung Note into the hub to see how it works. As soon as I plugged my Samsung Note into the portable hub, I noticed on my computer screen in the lower right corner a pop up message.  If you follow the easy to read manual, it will let you know what will take place once you plug the portable hub into your computer.  The message says, ""Generic USB Hub - Device driver software installed successfully.  Then, I clicked COMPUTER under the START button on my computer and there I noticed ""Stacy Perez (Galaxy Note4)"" with my other hard disk drives.  I clicked on ""Stacy Perez (Galaxy Note4)""  and it brought up every file that is on my smartphone.  For the heck of it, I clicked the folder that has my pictures and I took a picture which you can see below.I then decided to go ahead and plug into the portable hub my HTC smartphone.  Now, when I click on COMPUTER under the START button you will notice ""HTC6435LVW"" and ""Stacy Perez (Galaxy Note4)"".  Now, I can access the files from both devices on my computer without having to unplug one to view the other.Now, I see the real benefit of this portable hub.  Recently, my son needed to upgrade the amount of disk space on his PlayStation 4.  It was a real pain because he had about 500 gigs of gaming content on his PS4.  I had to buy a portable disk 1 TB to hold all of his gaming content while he manually upgraded the hard disk in his PS4, so he wouldn't lose it all.  Then, I was manually saving files to my computer and then moving the files to another place.  Well, if I would have had the portable 4-port hub I could have saved a TON of my time.  I spent way too much time unplugging a device and saving content to my computer and then plugging in another device to move it.  This 4--port portable hub would have given me access to the two devices without having to unplug one and plug in another and keep repeating the process.Seeing that I can see two devices at the same time on my computer, tells me this is going to be quite the valuable tool! This portable 4-port hub is giving you THREE extra USB ports.  You plug in the hub in one of your USB ports on your computer and it gives you 3 more!  I have my wireless mouse in one of my two front USB ports, so I technically have ONLY 1 useful and available USB port in the front of my computer.  NOW, I can plug the portable hub into my extra front USB port and having 4 at my disposable which is basically three extra ports.Now, I can plug in let's say my son's iPad into the portable hub, an external drive also int he portable hub and let's say one of our smart phones and access it ALL through my computer!  This hub can be plugged into PC's laptops and tablets.  No software or drivers needed. Just plug it in and you are ready to go.  Additionally, it will charge ALL the devices that are plugged into the hub.  My two smartphone are charging right now and the percentage's have increased.  So, basically you can charge up to 4 devices through the hub as long as it is plugged into a PC, table or laptop with your own charging cable plugged into your phone and the hub.From the product description:  ""USB 3.0 saves on syncing time with data transfer rates of up to 5 Gbps (much faster than USB 2.0). Backward compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.1""  This is also what makes this an even more valuable device because your syncing time is much faster!I really hope I made this as easy to understand as possible!!  If you have any questions, feel free to ask me in the comments.Overall, this is valuable and useful tool that can add 3 extra USB ports utilizing while utilizing your open USB port on your computer.  I will get quite a bit of use out of this now moving forward.  I wish I new this existed before getting this now.  Highly recommend this 4-port hub.  The price is ABSOLUTELY perfect and very affordable!  This would make an excellent gift and addition to anyone that has a computer, laptop or tablet.  Would also make an excellent stocking stuffer!!!  received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B26RA2IXCZDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017HWAGZM#wasThisHelpful","R3B26RA2IXCZDB","A3GS5U1FJK8H3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GS5U1FJK8H3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stalion Hybrid Bumper Case is a very nice quality clear case.  I purchased this case for my daughter's iPhone 6.

Your phone easily goes into the hybrid bumper case and it fits securely.  The backside is a harder type of plastic while the sides are softer to protect the phone if it were dropped or bumped.

"This Safari Wildlife White Cobra - I expected something bigger, more detailed and better made.  Product described as 2-inches high and about 6-inches long.  The reason why it is 2-inches high is because it is about how high up the cobra is from the table surface.  This cobra fits in my hand and is small.  I think the price may be set higher than the quality of this product.It is mentioned the Cobra is hand painted.  I would think hand-painted it would say it on the packaging and it would smell like paint when taken out of the package.

"Bluetooth EXO Portable Wireless NFC Speaker, Powerful Sound with built-in Microphone by RIF6 TM.  This speaker is 2.6 x 2.6 x 7 inches big.  It is a decent speaker and not too big.  I have other RIF6 products that I have been really happy with.  Because of the quality of the couple of other RIF6 products I have, I knew this would be a well-made product too!Again, this is not too big and is shaped like a cylinder.  There Is a protective mesh silicone over the speaker which you can see and it makes a cool looking design with the open areas where the speaker is exposed.  The speaker also comes with a USB charging cable, the auxiliary cord and the instructions.  Must pay attention because at first when I took the speaker out of the box, I didn't see the cords or the manual. They were almost hidden at the bottom under cardboard.This is the first bluetooth portable speaker I have owned that had a voice on it.  Example, once you connect your device to the bluetooth, it will say bluetooth connected.  Maybe some may find that annoying while others may not really care.We have connected this bluetooth speaker to our smartphones - Samsung Notes and iPhone 6 and iPad.  Additionally, we have used it with the RIF6 projector.  The product description says you can play 30 hours of music without the battery dying,  I haven't counted the hours. About every third use, I recharge it.  The sound quality of the music or whatever it is you are listening to is pretty crisp and clear.  The volume you can control on top of the speaker.  You can answer your smartphone through the speaker and you will be amazed at how loud and clear your caller sounds on the speaker.  There is a microphone so your caller will be able to easily here you even several feet away from the speaker.I like the mesh silicone outside and the carabiner/clip on the leather strap which is ideal for those who want to carry the speaker on a backpack, belt loop, running belt or bike.  This way it will be protected to a degree when it is moving around or lightly bumping as you are moving.Overall, this is a really nice quality portable bluetooth speaker and the price is realistic to the quality.

"WolVol Friction Powered Big Dump Truck Toy is a decent toy for children ages 3 and up. The truck measures 15 inches, so it is good size.This is really a pretty neat truck.  The funny thing is, not realizing this doesn't take batteries, I moved the black lever on the driver's side of the truck and the yellow dump part of the truck rose up and make noises as it rose.  To make it go back down, you just push it back down until you hear a click.  Because of the noise the dump part makes as it rises and the fact it rises so slowly, I really thought batteries were needed.  There are no batteries needed for this toy.  I like that as it is rising it does it slow and not fast where it can accidentally lose control as it is rising and accidentally injure someone.To make this dump truck toy move, all you do is hold it as you push it forward a few times and than back and then let go of it.  It will move smoothly on the tile floor but on carpet, it will move slower and not as far.  This reminds me of when I was a kid and my brother had little friction toys as a kid.  They were cool back then and when my son was smaller, we go him small friction cars.  We haven't seen anything friction like this big.The back of the dump truck as a non-attached door that just swings.  When the dump is up in the air or as it is raising up, any contents in the yellow dump part will easily exit the back of the truck.  You could put small toys in the dump, dirt, rocks, etc. The truck itself is pretty durable so it should still move nicely when you  have it automatically roll with the friction.I like the fact that because this dump truck toy doesn't need batteries to use the dump or to move it, kids can use it over and over and not worry about it not working.Overall, this is a really nice quality dump truck toy.  My only complaint about this toy is the price.  I feel the price is too high and should be less and that is mainly why I feel it is worth 4 stars.

"Sorker® Newest Mini Lightweight Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Stereo are very classy and well-made.  With these bluetooth headphones, you get the bluetooth heaphones, three earbuds, ear wings, micro USB charging cable and the instruction manual.These are very simple to use!  The earbuds are very comfortable and the ear wings help keep the headphones nicely secured.  Connecting to my Samsung Note is very quick.  The overall sound quality is nice and crisp.  I think what is really neat is the fact it has the most up-to-date technology where the bluetooth can distinguish between voice communication and the noisy surroundings go to clear talking sound.  Now, it gets even better because if you are getting a call, you can voice prompt ""yes"" or ""no"" to accept or deny the call.

They look simple and not gaudy and do not weigh now any of the delicate bush branches.  They are pretty and neat to watch. I never imagined having solar Christmas lights, I like the fact that I don't have electric wires and plugs outside and exposed, especially since we tend to get a lot of snow here in Chicago.Overall, this is a really nice quality solar Christmas light set of 100 LED lights.

The bags are a transparent black color and you can kind of see the contents inside the bags.The trash bags for a 13 gallon or smaller trash can.

"WolVol Voice Recorder Toy Telephone with Lights Music and Sounds is a decent toy for small children.  The box says ages 3+, but I don't see any small parts that would be a choking hazard other than the small cord connecting the phone receiver to the base of the phone, which is probably why it says ages 3+.  With that said, I would recommend this toy or any other toy that says ages 3+ for children being given to under age 3 children should be supervised for the safety of the child.  This phone does not come with any manual and requires batteries.The telephone is light and made of plastic.  The telephone receiver is connected to the phone by a small coiled plastic cord.  The cord isn't very long but if letting a child under age three play with it, I would do so by supervising them.  This is a nice toy for children who like to copy their parent when they are on the phone.The two M buttons, M1 and M2 are buttons that can be pressed to play music and sounds, and then there is a button for hands-free.  There is a neat telephone roller located at the top, right corner of the phone and also there is a button for record and playback.  This phone has lights and plays music.  Also, you can record a couple of seconds and play it back.This toy phone requires 3 AA batteries which are not included with this toy.  To install the batteries, you do so on the bottom of the phone which requires a small screw driver to take the plate off.Overall, it is a decent toy phone.  For the quality of it,  I feel the price is set too high for it  and feel it should be about $15.

"RFID Blocking Leather Wallet for Women is a well-made zip wallet.  The wallet is just gorgeous!  There are two zip pockets.  One is for change anything else as the pocket is pretty big. The other zip pocket is to hold 12 credit cards or bank cards!  This is lady's RFID wallet is made of genuine soft leather and made well.Nowadays, nothing is as bad as having your credit card number stolen while it is still in your possession.  There are electronic thieves that easily purchase these RFID machines and steal your RFID enabled credit card information.  RFID stands for Radio Frequency IDentification chips.  This is a serious problem, and I have personally become victim to it three times with my checking account bank card.  White honestly, I am tired of it!  I am tired of disputing with the bank charges that I clearly did not make.It was recently that I started hearing more about the RFID blocking wallets and became interested!  Any card that is easy susceptible to RFID thieves will likely have:  PayPass on MasterCards, payWave on Visa Cards, Zip on Discover Cards and  ExpressPay on American Express Cards.  Even many company ID cards have the chip.  Regardless, I protect ALL my credit cards, bank cards, driver's licence and anything else that has a strip or chip.You can easily test an RFID blocking sleeve or wallet by having the card you can use in the sleeve or wallet and try to swipe/scan/wave it.  Some gas pumps have this swiping/waving technology, some fast food, some employers and public transportation.  If you can wave your card in front of a scanner inside a RFID blocking sleeve or wallet and it doens't read it, you are good to go.  If it does read it, you may want to consider better RFID blocking protection.I tested this RFID wallet by having my gas card that I wave at the pump.  I waved it using the wallet with my card in it, and it didn't read it.  I was relieved!!!!  This is a good quality RFID blocking wallet and I highly recommend EVERYONE getting protected with good RFID blocking protection like this RFID wallet by Leopardd.  The price is very affordable and well worth the investment.  Think Christmas gifts and get your family and friends protected!  That is exactly what my friends and family are getting this holiday!

"Ozeri BP01K CardioTech Pro Series Digital Blood Pressure Monitor with Heart Health and Hypertension Indicator.  I like that this is compact and doesn't take up much space. I have a blood pressure monitor where you wrap it around your arm and have to plug it in.  This particular wrist cuff blood pressure monitor is compact and can easily be stored.I wasn't sure how accurate a wrist blood pressure cuff would be compared to a typical arm cuff, but when comparing the two, they pretty much came up with the same readings.  What is nice about the wrist cuff is that it doesn't suffocate your wrist like the arm one does.This Digital Blood Pressure Monitor comes with the monitor, the plastic storage case, 2 AA batteries and the manual.This digital blood pressure monitor is easy to use.  Once you put the cuff on your wrist where the digital display is facing on the inside of your wrist and you have your wrist relaxed, you push the on button.  In just a couple of minutes it will read your blood pressure and heartbeat.  This device holds up to 180 readings with date and time or for two people 90 per person.  If someone has an irregular heartbeat, it will detect it too.Overall, this is an accurate digital blood pressure monitor that I have compared with an existing arm cuff.

"This is a really nice PS4 vertical charging stand with cooling fan.  Anyone who has a PS4, to help preserve the life of the PS4, this is an affordable option to help preserve it!When I saw this product, I was very interested because I know these consoles can overheat and get ruined.  My son did just that with his laptop.  Unfortunately because he left it on all the time and ruined his laptop because he didn't use some sort of cooling fan or something.Out of any of his consoles or electronic gadgets, his PS4 is his prized possession and he doesn't like to leave it on when not in use at all.I knew he would be thrilled if I purchased this vertical stand with a cooling fan for his PS4. When it arrived, he was excited!!!  This little stand can do a lot!Once, you put your PS4 on the stand, you can plug the USB cable that is attached to the stand into the PS4.  There is an ON/OFF button that you can control and turn it on when you want.  When you turn it on, the cooling fans turn on.  He said you can turn it on when you start hearing the PS4 getting louder or when you are using the PS4, turn on the cooling fans.  I told him it makes more logical sense to turn the fans on WHEN he turn son the PS4 so it doesn't get to the point of getting louder and overheating.The stand is also a place you can plug your wireless controllers in for charging.  It holds up to two controllers and effectively charges the controllers.Not only is this a nice stand to keep your PS4 cooled, your game controllers charged, but it is also a space safer.  This saves my son space on his messy desk.  He now has extra space to load on his desk because of the PS4 standing vertical.Overall, we highly recommend this PS4 vertical stand with cooling fans.  It is not only VERY afforably-priced but it saves space, keeps your PS4 cooled and is a holding and charging place for game controllers.  If you have or know someone who has a PS4, this is a great investment!  The company sent me this product directly from their warehouse.

"ZealSound HDE-100 In-ear Noise-isolating Wood Headphones with Mic, Fiber Cable -Black are very nice quality headphones.  With these headphones you get the headphones, three soft silicone ear tips, cord clip, carrying pouch and the manual.  It is great these are compatible with the iPhone and iPad as this is what my son will be using them with.We in my househould have always loved in-ear noise-isolating wood headphones. The quality of the sound is really crisp and clear.  For the music my son listens too, he said the sound quality is good. My son in particular only likes these types of headphones versus wireless and other types of corded headphones.  The silicone ear tips are comfortable and do not fall out of the ears.We have reviewed a lot of different kinds of headphones over time and these are better than many we have tested.  For the price of under $22, you can't beat it!  Locally, I have spent $20 on other headphones that didn't last or didn't have the wood quality like these.

"iPhone 6s Case, HaloVa® High Quality Aluminum Bumper Case Hollow Design Full Signal Metal Frame Cover Smooth Skin for iPhone 6s 4.7"" - GoldI got this for my daughter's iphone.  It is elegant, delicate and pretty on the phone without any doubt.  But, it is not a quick process to install.  There are two frame pieces, 4 tiny screws and the small Allen wrench.  It wasn't quite what I expected.  My daughter was a bit nervous about it scratching her phone because of the metal frame.  She was more assured when she saw there was cushion on the inside of the frame.While they say it is a bumper case, which really is beautiful on the phone, I am not sure this is a great case for a teenager because my teen tends to drop her phone occasionally and I question how well it would protect her phone from the screen cracking or any internal damage.  This would be nice for sure for someone who is an adult and takes care of their phone.  My daughter thought it was beautiful on her phone but me as a parent prefers her to use a shock absorbent case that will protect her phone if it drops.Overall, it is a really nice bumper metal frame cover and does highlight the iPhone.

"One of my favorite authors of all time is Neil Gaiman, and the first book of his that I read was Stardust. The story of fairy-like gypsies takes a backseat to the main story line in his book, but with Quickbane, they are front and center in the form of Pyxies. The horse-loving, nomadic people have magic weaved into their culture so deeply that it is second nature to them and they cannot be separated from it, and I love how the author immerses us into the culture of their kind so completely, that we understand the character motivations from the start.Jesobel Vine has been chosen since birth for a destiny she has no idea she's a part of. She and her horse, Firefly, are kindred spirits that were even born on the same day. Together they have a connection that makes them inseparable. If you are a horse-lover, this book will definitely draw you in with the relationship created between Jesobel and Firefly. Luckily, I'm a horse lover as well as a lover of Fantasy, and this intricately woven story grabbed me from the beginning and left me wanting more. This will be a series to watch for!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ENASG0PTGNFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYBAK46#wasThisHelpful","R1ENASG0PTGNFJ","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars - Spiritual warfare, demon-possession, and romance wrapped up in a sci-fi/Fantasy multiverse that was surprisingly easy to follow. I am a reader who loves good characters and a romance that makes sense. This book makes the reader care instantly for the characters and makes their romance perfectly understandable and intense quickly. Although the book is not billed for romance, and is full of action-packed scenes, the romance dominated at least the first half of the book for me, so female audiences should enjoy that aspect. The author did a great job of keeping things mysterious and slowly unfolding each element of the story so that the reader wasn't bogged down with huge info-dumps. Overall, this is a fun read and I'll be looking for the sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11GAV0TPQPYM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E52VRBA#wasThisHelpful","R11GAV0TPQPYM9","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is there any color more vibrant than blue? And is there any character more vivid? In this urban fantasy novel, Blue starts out rough and bitter, jaded by the whole world — so for most young people who have grown up during this “Great Recession,” she’s very easy to relate to. But her character is much more complex than that, and when she meets Kasey, not only does she start to open up, time literally stops.This gradually unfolding story will draw you in and keep the pages turning, the characters are both interesting and charismatic. They will make you feel like they are long lost friends instead of just characters in the story. YA readers will find the underpinning of the story both recognizable as a thread common among the generation today and original enough to stand on its own.

"It's so difficult to find a clean romance, even in the YA Genre, that is interesting, believable, and and not based on appearances. But Beth Honeycutt succeeds. In this well written story, we have a dreamy (literally) new boy who sets his sites on shy, reserved Ellie, even as all the most popular and pretty girls in school throw themselves at him. But why? Why does he give Ellie his complete and focused attention?And why does he keep reminding her of the imaginary friend she's had since she was little?As the story unfolds, we discover a love based on true emotional security rather than lust or love at first sight. This is the sort of love that grows slowly over time as people learn to trust one another with their hearts...and is rare among hormone-driven teens. The sort of love that changes people for the better and gives them confidence.

"Words are a powerful thing. They can help or hurt...even more than sticks and stones at times. But the worst kind of words that hurt are the ones we repeat to ourselves. If we keep telling ourselves negative thoughts about how we're not good enough or pretty enough or whatever, sooner or later we believe them so hard no one can tell us differently.Teenagers have it the worst. Because they are just developing into a separate entity from their parents and learning independence, they are in the midst of determining who they are. In Entertaining Angels, Maddie is an overweight teen. She has told herself that she is not pretty enough or thin enough to be worthy of anyone. Her defeatist self talk has caused her to go about as low as she can.

The distant, omniscient point of view in the book is necessary so that the reader can follow the wide cast of characters. Considering the sheer number of people, and my poor memory, I was surprised at how easily I kept them all apart.

"A very fun, engrossing read. At nearly 40, Addison's story is an excellent combination of romance and ""hen lit"" -- in her search to find herself, she finds a lasting love as well. Even though this is the second book in a series, it works perfectly as a stand-alone. I haven't yet read book one, but didn't feel like I missed much in reading this one first.It's a feel good romance, one that will leave you misty-eyed in places and possibly needing a hanky. The author writes so well, that even though it's a full-length novel, I finished it in one day and didn't want to put it down. It was better than watching a movie. And I love this sort of romantic comedy. Inspirational and motivating, this story will leave you with the feeling that all things are possible with love...and with God.*A free copy of this book was given to me in exchange for an honest, not necessarily positive, review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WAU18BHATVYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUAJKVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1WAU18BHATVYR","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A poignant tale of a woman who, because of her low-self esteem, finds herself attracted to the wrong sort of guy.

"Why did it take until nearly the end of December for me to find my favorite read of 2013. Because after reading more than 120 books this year (a good year, by the way) I have found that book. And yes, it’s this one. Under Different Stars was not at all what I thought it would be. The cover is STUNNING, but I didn’t know that this book would be sci-fantasy by the cover – I thought it would be chick-lit or something. But when the book finally hit Amazon and I found out that it was listed in sci-fi, my curiosity was piqued.And this book. It rocks.It started a bit slow for me, getting to know the characters takes time, so I’m cool with that. Then after about 15% of the book, it takes off like a rocket and it’s hard to find a place to put it down. When explaining what this book is to the avid-reading teens I mentor, I explained that the book has all the action of Divergent or Hunger Games, but with a real romance that you can feel in your chest–like Twilight. And yes, these kids have read all those books, too, so they know exactly what I mean. Now they are all dying to read the book too, and I’m telling you, it’s worth it. This will be another book that I have to buy the paperback of when it comes out so that those without ereaders can borrow it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8APHQJ6UAJRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCJX2PM#wasThisHelpful","R8APHQJ6UAJRK","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A solid sequel to the first book in the series, but switching up some of the main characters POVs and introducing new, lovable characters as well.

"Compared to the first book, Merlin's Shadow was even more of an intricately woven cord. It took unexpected twists and turns, showing loss of hope...and hope regained. Over and over again. No one was immune to this relentless struggle against faith and confidence. My son and I began to think of Bedwir as a forgotten and well abused rag doll. Merlin's struggles in this book were mirrored with his sister, Ganieda. Each character grappled against seen (or unseen) demons which battled for their favor...or their death. Both brother and sister are hunted, enslaved, and given choices which will determine the course of each life, as well as the fate of all Briton. Both my son and I are huge fans of this series now, and impatiently await the next installment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO41566IAV48H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW3K0SG#wasThisHelpful","RO41566IAV48H","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A well-written discourse on human life. Life is pain, but when you keep a positive outlook and rely upon God, you find that you can go from that life of pain to a life of praise through the pain. The author uses personal stories, poetry, and even private prayers to show that the reader is not alone in their pain, and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

"Lily Stargazer is an unforgettable anti-heroine. She was an orphan with a troubled past that has made her tough and talented, but has left her drowning in drug addiction and debauchery to ease her pain. But when a silent Harlequin stuffs an object down her pants and leaps to his death, it sets in motion an adventure that will make Lily face the ghosts of her past in order to see the love that has been waiting at her fingertips.Her story takes us on a tour of Europe and the Mediterranean by way of airship. There are sky pirates and fortune hunters who join the ghosts of her past in pursuit of her. An interesting band of characters surround her, from a tinkerer to a temple ""prostitute"" to a warrior poet.I actually ""read"" this book entirely by audio in my car on a long trip - there and back again (it's not a short read). But I was so immersed in the world the author built that it was a good thing that I was following another car the whole time, or I might have missed an exit and gotten lost... The author's use of setting and costumes build a world that the reader can see, hear, and touch. As a reader of clean fiction, I'd have to rate this book ""R"" for drug use and sexual situations. But, this is a very good story with a great character arc. It's inspiring, charming, and keeps you thinking about the characters long after you've set it aside. This book is easily a stand alone with a TREMENDOUS and complete feel in the end, although the author promises more!Interesting side note...I googled ""Chasing the Star Garden"" and ""Youtube"" and was treated with She Walks in Beauty by Lord Byron...what's awesome, is that Lord Byron is a character in the book ~ and his description here could easily fit Lily Stargazer. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3TTCBIF6IR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXUU6IC#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3TTCBIF6IR2","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So it's October, and half of me is only waiting for The Walking Dead to start, you know? So I've started on a little zombie reading kick. This book fit the bill perfectly. It was short - so I got what I needed and quickly. It has a strong female protagonist, and quite a little badass she is. Likeable, strong, and heroic.

"This is my third book by YI Lee, and it is by far my favorite. And not just because of the horses. Although I've never seen a glass horse quite like the author describes, her rich use of senses and descriptions make me feel like I have. YI Lee is a master of dark allegorical fantasy. Like CS Lewis or Lewis Carroll, her character finds herself falling into another, stranger, fantastical world, where she must complete a task, because she is the only one who can do it. But then unlike Lewis or Carroll the world built beyond the glass is not silly or childish, it is dark and scary with creatures that screech in the night and threaten to steal your heart and soul. And it's not a child who is chosen to overcome herself, it is a full-fledged adult with deadlines to meet and a wee bit of a drinking problem.All these things make Through a Glass more real for me. A less than perfect person finding the strength within herself to do incredible, self-sacrificing things and becoming more than she ever thought she was. Lovers of Dark Fantasy do not want to miss this one, especially if they like a spark of inspiration added in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRFZUMQAV6WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWBI2RA#wasThisHelpful","RSRFZUMQAV6WE","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Often when we deal with being imperfect, of struggling against ourselves or our situation, we can think we're alone in that part of life. And if we're alone, then we also can feel insignificant. But in this book, Ayotte shows the reader step by step that there is ""nothing new under the sun."" What struggles you're going through now, others are going through as well. But as Christians, we have help. And her gentle reminder through anecdotes and stories about her personal life help the reader to gain a feeling of kinship and healing.This book can be a hand of help to those who just keep trying harder. It's a call to rest and trust both in yourself and in the God who helps.

"Sometimes it's hard to commit to a daily walk. We get caught up in life and forget whats truly important. This Bible is like taking a morning walk with Jesus every day.

"Dystopian novels are all the rage, and yes, I jump on that bandwagon, too. I've read most of the popular ones, and many by indies as well. It seems so rare these days to find one that has an original vein in it. The Woodlands succeeds. With a smart, snarky, and heroic main character and a swoon-worthy love interest, the book will draw in many readers of the YA/NA crowd. But then pepper in the dystopian part - the world our dynamic duo live in is cruel and unyielding. Completely and utterly unyielding. Surprisingly unyielding. Yes, I said unyielding three times - because it's that ruthless.And as a reader, I'm left heartbroken for these characters...through the first half.Then we get to the second half. And the hope and love takes a strange, confusing turn. The characters find themselves on an unexpected journey, that seems sort of aimless at first. And they are surrounded by a sketchy bunch of people that aren't quite friends, but not really foes. I had a hard time getting into the journey part as I'm not much of one for an undirected, wanton journey. We know who they are escaping from, but I didn't get where they were going. Then Rosa, the MC, makes some bad, selfish choices and became a little less likable for me. Of course, it just made me love Joseph even more.Overall, the book is a solid 4.5-5 star read. The author's use of color to represent the characters is poetic. Each character is dynamic, and they compliment one another like a well conducted orchestra. The read brings into focus many issues that plague young people today who have broken homes or find themselves with an unwanted teen pregnancy, but placed in a non-confrontational dystopian atmosphere that really works well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39N3XMPS48NA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPF5LSW#wasThisHelpful","R39N3XMPS48NA3","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*This book was given to me by the author in exchange for an honest review.*The opening scene of ""The Doctor"" takes us through a typical teenage horror movie troupe. A group of teens visit an amusement park - at night - on Halloween. Something bad happens...of course. But then the story takes an interesting turn and introduces Jack, Paranormal Investigator, and becomes an amalgam of X-files meets M. Night Shyamalan - without the fixation on the color red.Okay, I admit it, I chose to read this book because I miss Doctor Who, and anything that reminds me of the show gets a longing sigh from me. Additionally, I'm a Stephen King fan, so picking up a thriller/horror novel was right up my alley. I was not disappointed. Creepy but clean--not a lot of blood, but lots of mind twisting, psychologically bent suspense. The novel is ideal for Older YA, 14+ readers, and adults who don't want a lot of graphic gore or sex with their violence.***Review has been done in conjunction with Nerd Girl Official.

"Using caricatures of modern Christian society, Brad Francis has created an edgy, clever, and convicting read. It is ha-ha funny at times, and at other times, it pierces the heart. It skates on the edge of inappropriate at times, and is much too edgy for children. But the book is real. Hard and real, like a snapshot of life.Either way, I doubt that anyone can walk away from this book without feeling some sort of emotional response. Many may even find their fight or flight response kick in over this one. Overall I feel it's a much needed read for the majority of American Christians, and ought to be required reading for the clergy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNPTMUW1S8LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1X34MW#wasThisHelpful","R1KNPTMUW1S8LE","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the first book by bestselling indie author Elle Casey that I've read, but I'm sure it won't be the last. The edge of your seat love story found within these pages is hard to put down. Then when you realize that events in the story are based on a true story, it wrenches your heart. As a victim of sexual abuse, I could connect with the victimized mental state the main character is plagued by. All of this brought on another layer of depth to the story.Although the first few chapters made me feel as though I'd fallen into the middle of the action where a lot of back story was involved, it didn't take me long to catch up. The slow-growing love story between Nicole and her ""superhero"" was well done, and Nicole's slow growth of welcoming her new family's acceptance after a history of abuse was set and a realistic pace. From a reader of clean fiction, the smattering of curse words and one fairly graphic sex scene didn't do much to bluster the story or detract from it. The scenes of violence were necessary to the story line, and not terribly gratuitous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PQ7QIQL2F4RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ5R78O#wasThisHelpful","R3PQ7QIQL2F4RN","A257R44GAG6XXI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A257R44GAG6XXI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I love about the NIV is that it's easy to read, and this devotional does not disappoint. Christians are made to be leaders, when we follow the shepherd, and we make that our focus, others will follow our lead.

"*This book was given to me by the author in exchange for an honest review.*For me, this book would be one of the examples of why I should never read the prologue. The prologue opens with a vampire on the hunt, and the entire scene turned me off to the book. The first chapter follow-up wasn't much better. I was confused, I felt as if there was a lot going on and I was dropped into the middle of it - like someone who didn't know how to swim being dropped in the deep end of the pool. But the writing is solid, and I pressed on, hoping that the book would live up to the promise made on the beautiful cover.And boy, did it. It's not long before we are introduced to the incredibly honorable and loveable pirate captain, Nate Sutton. Swoonworthy like Gerard Butler, his self-sacrificing mannerisms endear him to the reader long before Ilka even becomes aware of her own feelings. The author deserves the title of ""Champion of the Anti-hero."" The book became a fast-paced, easy read, and I found myself immersed in a fantasy world I was loathe to leave by the last page.

"This works great for my tech supplies to keep handy in the living room instead of having cords and stuff all over the place in every drawer and on every counter, on the couch, plugged into every plug etc. All the cords are wrapped with ""Gear Ties"" by Nite Ize when not plugged into a jack and charging, but all the different kinds are handy in here, plus the little screwdriver set for tech repairs and all the little extras, memory cards, screen cleaner spray, little screen cleaner wipes, styluses, everything you always need but are searching for and have sitting everywhere but never where you look for it.As a tool box, really? Maybe for your first tool box when you don't have many tools and you don't have anything big. Also, it has compartments around the edges of the inside but many are really skinny and maybe fit a screwdrive but that's it.  As for the middle portion, its pitch black in there so when you fill it with tools, it is one big pile of tools in a dark bag where you cannot see anything.It works great for my purposes and if I can get it on sale again, I have ideas for a few other uses. It is a great bag - but not for a soft sided tool box bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RI3HFU2A5OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00775COIW#wasThisHelpful","R3RI3HFU2A5OO","A1PO24RPVBV09N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PO24RPVBV09N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love this feeder and have bought several.  It is lightweight, very nice looking, inexpensive, and longer-lasting than many. I am quite surprised that it can be plastic and look so much like pewter - really nice looking. It also lasts over a year and still going.  I bought this one for my dad because mine have been going strong for a year and another for less than a year.  Usually, cheap and plastic cannot survive the weather in Florida much past the summer.  Buy it in March and it's done by September, but you stretch it out until January if you can and then you give up  - hopefully because you got a feeder for Christmas to replace it. I got a feeder for Christmas YAY but now I get to hang an extra feeder because this one from last year is still going and the one from the previous year Is still surviving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P78PQTS3EQU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRPEN9G#wasThisHelpful","R1P78PQTS3EQU4","A1PO24RPVBV09N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PO24RPVBV09N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is the perfect size for a toddler to use in the car with magnets. I was putting together a set for Christmas for a toddler (almost 4 yrs)  and wanted a magnetic sheet that was big enough for use with magnetized paper dolls, but not too big for her lap. and... cheap.

"My wild ducks,geese, and birds of many types absolutely love these. I actually put them in the water dishes for the ducks and whatever spills into the lawn gets picked up by the birds when they are waiting for a spot on the feeder. Only issue I have is my dreaded flock of Ibis' who turn feeding time into chaos and madness when I put these out and therefore I have to wait until they are gone or turn on the sprinkler/sprayer because they will not cross over air-borne water. But this is a problem with a flock of birds, not the worms.  They are high quality and do not have a pile of worm powder at the bottom of the bag like some other brands do.  Somehow, they have found the proper way to package and store these with air in the bag etc. so they are not turned to powder.I WOULD ABSOLUTELY CHANGE THE BAG THOUGH - I AM PAYING  FOR A BAG THAT IS POORLY DESIGNED WHEN I WOULD RATHER THEY WERE CHEAPER AND I HAD TO STORE THEM IN A ZIPLOCK OR SOMETHING.  THE BAG IS A RE-SEALABLE BAG THAT IS USUALLY NOT RESEALABLE IN ANY WAY.  IT NEVER WORKS. I have bought probably hundreds of these bags, because I get a lot when they go on sale and I love my ducks.... I maybe had one or two bags that re-sealed.  These are VERY expensive for us average people so if you could use the same bag without the resealable part, the product would be cheaper and I would have the same situation I have now, I store them in a container anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2S56XY90JE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X7BXYI#wasThisHelpful","R2H2S56XY90JE3","A1PO24RPVBV09N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PO24RPVBV09N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The picture is beautiful - they do not look like this at all.  They were horrible on the tree, although I can see how they zoomed into one spot and it looked good.  I tried one on a wreath and it was okay - it gave it lights, but the gold glitter wire is the problem, it comes like a slinky in the box but not curved over....when you pull it out and try to stretch it or just drop one end and hold up the other, it is not firm enough to stretch it out and have it keep the even spiral shape like the picture so it ends up with uneven spacing and doesn't look nice. However, it does have semi-permanent spiral shape and therefore if you try to wrap it around a wreath or anything else, you cannot really make it shape itself the way you want it. You cannot wrap it like you can wire battery lights.But it does not keep the even spaced spiral shape either.  It is a great idea that was not well executed. It gets three stars because I could be beautiful if you could find the right way to use it....which I haven't yet. It is not cheap and blingy looking, it is a nice spiral-ish wire and the glitter is not over-done but is obviously glitter.  It really could have been fabulous.

But instead they are absolutely horrible. I really cannot believe they are a name brand, especially Wilton.

"I suppose it is what it was supposed to be, and just wasn't what I thought. But I am being pretty generous. I thought it would be phrases associated with flipping someone off, to the extreme. There's about a third of the phrases that are absolutely hilarious, and the rest were so vulgar or mean spirited that the three possible thoughts for this to be used for something really funny, would make it unacceptable. I have no problem with the F-bomb, and this was expected to be a vulgar item - so if every single phrase had it, I would not complain.  However, the worst part of this item is not the swearing, which I would expect, it was the mean phrases of which none will be repeated here because they aren't funny, they are beyond crude and vulgar. I am sorry I cannot explain further, but this is not telling someone to ""shut the F up"" or ""f Off"" this is way beyond that, I can't believe with all the people I know, none of which are offended by anything, ever, I cannot come up with one person that would find it funny if they walked past it enough times to hear all the phrases.

"Made great Christmas ornaments for the purpose of marking a big family vacation, where the one thing in common for everyone was fishing. I had lots of great ideas but it seemed many of them either applied to the girls or the guys but not both, or they were too expensive to get 6 ornaments.  This worked out perfectly, the kids each got one and the couples each got one, and they hung on the tree nicely - a bit big for an ornament but I have a few ornaments even bigger and heavier so it was actually fine, everyone loved the idea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDK6SYZ1VPFHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PC00M2#wasThisHelpful","RDK6SYZ1VPFHR","A1PO24RPVBV09N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PO24RPVBV09N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve been a fan of this series since I found it by chance, and each book just keeps getting better and better for me!  I completely loved Sprite in this book! Seriously, Sprite made the book so enjoyable for me personally.I really enjoyed how even though this is a shorter book, Eight is able to pack a bunch of information into the story but it doesn’t feel like it is overwhelming to me.  All the information that was added was important to the story.  I do also enjoy that even though this is the fourth book in the series, I don’t feel like you have to read the rest of the series.  But there is enough information given that will entice you to read the other books.I did love being able to follow along with the relationship between Sprite and Keir form and develop into something real.  Their relationship was one that formed slowly and ended up being something powerful and wonderful.Overall, I can’t get enough of this series and if your looking for a paranormal story that will draw you in, then I would recommend this one.Reviewed by Crystal Marie for Crystal’s Many Reviewers*Copy provided for review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GNXWBWAHRGDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015YKQY28#wasThisHelpful","R2GNXWBWAHRGDS","A1OO1T6GAZ34S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OO1T6GAZ34S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book completely blew me away.  In more ways that one.  I’ve been a fan of Banks writing every since I found this series awhile ago and each book that I have read is just so much better than the previous one.I do want to be honest and say that the beginning of this book was a bit slow for me.  However, I really do think that that works best for this story because there is so much action and suspense that is happening in the rest of the book that the slow start was great.Honor’s character was one that just … I don’t know what to say about her besides the fact that I wish that I had even a quarter of the courage and strength that she had.  Banks wrote a heroine that is so inspiring and amazing, and it is so different that the types of books that I have been reading lately.  Honor stands on her own and really, she made the book so great for me.Watching as the relationship between Honor and Hancock was also great.  I loved how they both battled the relationship right from the start.  The whole thing was just amazing.  Hancock’s personality was one that was perfect for this book because he really needed Honor to be there for him, and Honor was more than willing to give everything up to help him achieve his goal.I would really recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read a book that will give you strength and the courage to stand up for what you believe in.Oh, and make sure you have a lot of tissues because holy wowzer, this book was great!Reviewed by Crystal Marie for Crystal’s Many Reviewers*Copy provided for review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KD5S42CDQ71R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF6CE#wasThisHelpful","R3KD5S42CDQ71R","A1OO1T6GAZ34S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OO1T6GAZ34S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very strange book for me to review.  When I started it, it had the feel of the Sleeping Beauty trilogy from Anne Rice, but as I got further into the story, it went a completely different way.  Which I enjoyed a lot.This was a very quick read, I would say that it would be a really good lunchtime read if your looking for something that has smutty times, as well as will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next.The twists and turns that Greenwood added to the story certainly made it their own.  And it kept my attention and left me wanting to read more.There is a cliffhanger at the end of this story, at least for me there was, and so I hope that Greenwood will be continuing on with this series in the future.Reviewed by Crystal Marie for Crystal’s Many Reviewers*Copy provided for review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBHBMIXM8LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMDL8BK#wasThisHelpful","R3JBHBMIXM8LQ","A1OO1T6GAZ34S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OO1T6GAZ34S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, SeRine blows me away with the story telling!  I was completely drawn into this story once I started it and I couldn’t put it down no matter what.  The drama and suspense that was on these pages just drew me in completely and I was drawn into a world that I didn’t want to leave.SeRine gave us a hint of what this family (The Dawson family) was about in the novella in the Way of the Warrior bundle.  I will say this, you don’t have to read that novella to fully understand what is going on in this book, but it does give you a bit of back information between one of the couples.There is a lot of stuff happening in this book, and while at times I felt like my head was twisting around trying to keep up, I didn’t get lost.  I was still able to follow along with everything and that is part of what made this book that great for me.  The smutty scenes in this book only added to the story, they didn’t detract from it.  Don’t get me wrong, they were great, but I loved how there was still a story there even if those scenes would have been removed.The chemistry between Kyle and Abby was off the charts, as well as the relationships between Kyle and his family.  That added a “real” feeling to the story that was able to bring me even further into what was going on.This is a great start to a new series and I really can’t wait to read more into the Dawnson family in the future.

"This was an interesting bundle for me to read. I am a fan of Douglas’ works, and have loved every one that I have read in the past, however I have never read anything by Arthur in the past. I started this bundle with the expectations that no matter what, I would still enjoy at least 1 of the stories.That was not the case in the slightest though because even though, once again I was blown away by Douglas’ story, I was equally blown away by Arthur’s story as well. I am a total paranormal junkie and I love reading paranormal books. I do think that Arthur did a great job at creating a world, and the characters, in the book that drew me in and kept me wanting to know more about what was going on. But not only that, I was drawn into the character’s stories and didn’t want the book to end. I do hope that Arthur will continue on with this story and turn it into a series. If that is the case, I will be sure to be reading them once they release.Douglas brought another great new book to this bundle as well. One thing that I loved about it is it is set up for a series, and I do have my fingers crossed that that will be the case. The Feral Passions resort was described in such a way that it was almost as though I was there, and I was so disappointed when the book ended because I didn’t want it to leave. Being a fan of Douglas’ work, there weren’t that many twists or shocks that actually shocked me, but that didn’t deter me from enjoying the story at all.Overall, I would say if you’re looking for a great paranormal bundle, then this is one for you.Reviewed by Crystal Marie for Crystal’s Many Reviewers*Copy provided for review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGFV2HOVINDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDWNK1E#wasThisHelpful","R2OGFV2HOVINDU","A1OO1T6GAZ34S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OO1T6GAZ34S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been a fan of Hunter’s work in the past, I couldn’t resist getting to read the next novella in the vampire series.  I do have to say that while the fully length novels are great, Hunter’s novellas are also equally great.  It takes extreme skill from an author to be able to write an action packed story into a novella size.  And that is something that Hunter has been able to pull off quite well.I loved the characters and the way I could see and feel how they all interact with each other.  No matter how small of a role a character had, they were given a completely different voice than the others.  Tom and Josephine’s relationship was one that amused me because of how it was very typical for that time frame, yet at the same time it was great to see how they came to care about each other – and eventually love each other.Once again Hunter has crafted an amazing story that even if you haven’t read any of the other books in the series in the past, I would say that this will give you a great tease and make you want to read more.

"It’s been awhile since I’ve visited Mossy Glenn Ranch, but I can say that I was very glad to go back there!  Bradford sure does great with the series because even though this is book 7 in the series, we are still given updates on what is happening with the other couples that have already gotten together throughout the series.As a reader, I really enjoy that because when you get wrapped up in a series, you can’t help but wonder what has happened to the other couples.But onto the couple in this book, I have to say that Dan really tugged on my heartstrings! I couldn’t help but feel sorry for him and wanted to give him a hug for everything he had been through – and was still going through throughout the book.  I did like how Bradford though allowed Dan to grow, and it wasn’t an instant overnight change with him, no it was gradual and very realistic.  Now Hector’s character was one that I was instantly drawn to for the simple fact that I liked how cheerful he was.  He really lite up the story in more ways than one.  Being a friend to Dan, and just being an overall great man.Two things that I always know when I read a book by Bradford is that there’s going to be a fair bit of smut, and there’s always a HEA.  Well, I can say that Bradford really threw me for a twist with this one because there is something that happens that just caused me to almost throw my kindle.I won’t say anything else, but this.

"I kind of have a love/hate feeling toward this story because I both liked it and was totally and completely frustrated by it. First off, it took until 40% of the way through the story to hook me and to finally figure out what the storyline actually was. Second, this was a slow read. Third, it was written in my least favorite format: 1st person present tense.Daniel, our protagonist and who is our window into the world of Holiday, is kind of all over the place. His family, well, what a bunch of jerks is all I can say, is one of the reasons he is who he is. While his best friend Ginger and his love interest Rex leapt out of the pages at me, Daniel was a little harder to figure out, which was kind of annoying at first considering he is the one telling the story. However, as ‘who’ he is came out around 40% of the way through, that began to make sense. If a character isn’t even sure of who he is and he is telling the story in 1st person, it makes it hard for the reader to know.My harshest complaint is that this story left the reader with a huge cliffhanger. If I’m already hooked into a series, then a cliffhanger doesn’t bother me as much, but in the first book which was difficult to get through in the first place? It does not make me want to read on. Instead, it makes me growl. There was no sense of completion, or that the hero and his man may someday ride off into the sunset. Instead, I was left with this feeling of “it’s all gonna go to H*LL about five pages after the book is done”.However, there is definitely an audience for this book – so if you enjoy 1st person present tense, a character who is all over the place and doesn’t know where he’s at let alone where he’s going, and a slow bleed of a romance which seems the lesser part of the story, then this might be the book for you. Get your own “The Daniel” (a coffee created in our hero’s honor by a local coffee shop), sit down, and prepare to read.Reviewed by a-nony-mouse for Crystal’s Many Reviewers*Copy provided for review*","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3O5BPLB55Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010P7F6I8#wasThisHelpful","R1M3O5BPLB55Y6","A1OO1T6GAZ34S9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OO1T6GAZ34S9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grabbed this book because it was free. To be honest, I didn’t even read the blurb. I just saw it was M/M, that it was a decent length and thought, why not? Let me just say, I’m glad I got it.Lucas has issues. After a bad breakup with his girlfriend, he’s aimless and has no idea what to do – until seeing an ad in a paper for an acting gig in the Caribbean. He leaps at the opportunity. What nobody tells him until he’s on the island and moved into the cottage with three other guys is that he is part of a gay pirate sex show.You would think that would be difficult enough, wouldn’t you? No, in addition, he loves the place so much he doesn’t want to leave. However, before he has even blinked, he has an enemy in the boyfriend of the pirate captain and has to prove himself if he wants to stay. Also, he’s confused because of the way he feels around Adam – the pirate captain.Turning a straight guy gay stories are usually either great or awful in my opinion. This story was so well written that even though I hated Tyler and cringed for Lucas, as soon as the story was done, I bought the second book to read along. Because – be warned. The story doesn’t end. It gives you a cliffhangar and you need to move on to the next book.Aces to the secondary characters, especially Kip, Ben, and Orinth. They were so well-written and the kind that really stick with you. You will notice if you look up the book on several different eRetail sites, that the cover changes. A lot. That confused me, but believe me. The story is worth it. Don’t expect any full-on anal sex, but there’s a lot of teasing, and one hot 3-way scene as well. This book I think sets up the main storyline for the series, so there’s less sex and a lot of teasing.Now, I must get back to the island. I would love to be the towel girl on that pirate ship.

"Anyone who knows me knows I hate heavy angst in a book. Hate it. Hate it. Hate it. So why do I love Fever Pitch? If you had asked me how I felt about the book during the first 50%, well, I almost put it down several times. Only one problem. The author brought in one of my ABSOLUTE favorite characters from her first book in the series – Walter. And anything with Walter is good, obviously.So, what’s this one about? Aaron and Giles are from the same home town, only Aaron has only barely noticed Giles in high school and while Giles thinks Aaron is drop-dead cute, he also thinks the guy kind of hates him. Until a unique meeting at a party where they both hide in the laundry room to get away from it all. This starts off the angst…Why? Aaron decides after one moment of extreme happiness with Giles to follow him to college. Only both guys are nervous and assume things about the other that isn’t true, but they think it is. It takes half the book –let me repeat that – half the book for that part of the angst to go bye-bye. Of course a new kind of angst takes its place with religious extremism, one of the students on campus being kicked out of his parents’ house for not doing what his parents told him to do; not even allowing him to take his clothes or shoes. And the angst ratchets up with Aaron’s roommate who is a bit of an oddball from the beginning, but when we find out why, well, I couldn’t blame the guy for his offish behavior.This particular book has romance, angst, gunshots, religious zealots, bad parents, good parents, and Walter. Can I just say I have a bit of a crush on Walter :)5 Stars all the way for book 2 of Love Lessons.

"This small photo printer packs a punch!  Great for kids school projects and homework, which unlike the olden days, often ask for color pictures.  Having one of these at home sure beats running down to the local drugstore to pick up a print.

I found that the lowest price for the 320P print packs, which include both ink and photo paper, was on the Epson website.

"This keyboard case is indeed very light but does not compromise on performance.  The keys are spaced about the same as the Apple wireless keyboard, so for me it was an easy transition. The key press is a little softer and less clicky than the Apple keyboard, but not unpleasant, just different.  I really like how the case snaps easily into either of two preset positions with the help of magnets, and the auto on/off is great.  This keyboard has fewer keys than other keyboards, and some of the keys on the right side of the keyboard do triple duty to compensate.  It takes a little getting used to but is a small price to pay for a such a lightweight and well made keyboard case.  The case charges with an included micro USB cable, and one charge is supposed to last up to 6 months, assuming two hours of usage per day.  The only thing I wish it had is backlit keys, but that would probably result in the battery draining much more quickly.

"There is a picture for each recipe in this cookbook, which is great for someone unfamiliar with the cuisine.  The name of each dish is given in both English and Japanese.  This a lovely touch because the written Japanese language, which is a mixture of Chinese characters and two Japanese alphabets, is in itself an art form.Despite the step by step photographs provided for most recipes, this book manages not to feel busy or crowded.  If feel like as much attention has been paid to the layout of the book as to the recipes, with plenty of white space for balance.  The recipes that include step by step pictures are laid out so that the instructions are on facing pages.  You will not have to turn the page, you can see it all at once.  This kind of attention to layout in cookbooks has become increasingly rare.The recipes themselves give amounts by weight in both imperial and metric.  The recipe for ukishima - floating island - looks at once sophisticated and simple.  It's a square shaped, two layer, steamed cake; the bottom layer is matcha flavored and thus green, and the top layer is plain or egg flavored if you will.  Ukishima looks like the perfect lunchbox snack so I can hardly wait to try it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18AHXUNR3SFW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770856064#wasThisHelpful","R18AHXUNR3SFW9","A3MJISYNXNYEQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJISYNXNYEQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very well made case, and fits my phone perfectly.  I left on the glass screen protector I already had on my phone, and the case still fit well.  Of course, with two separate screen protectors there is a noticable difference in sensitivity of the touch screen, but that is to be expected.The buttons for power and volume line up and work just fine, but it takes a lot more pressure to activate the buttons since the the slight squishiness of the case absorbs most of the force of the button press.  I cannot activate the buttons with the hand I am holding the phone with.  I have to hold the phone with one hand, and depress the buttons with the other hand. That is basically my only complaint, and perhaps if I had larger hands tha would not be an issue. The port covers feel sturdy and like they be be able to take a lot of use.  Overall it is a great case that leaves my phone feeling well protected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XWK3TKZVTO3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SX51Q#wasThisHelpful","R2XWK3TKZVTO3O","A3MJISYNXNYEQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJISYNXNYEQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product has a very nice, subtle aroma that doesn't linger unlike its other lower-end competitor creams and lotions.  I noticed I had to use two normal size applications as the cream seemed to diminish to an unsubstantial layer when I spread it over my face.  I was not comfortable enough with only one application as I was apprehensive of my razor catching while shaving against the grain.  On a positive note, the cream did rinse off cleanly without a pesky oily or foamy residue nor did it dry out my skin.  Would recommend however caution that consumption rate will be higher than other cheaper brands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCLCXZGFAQ4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KE40EQ#wasThisHelpful","R2SCLCXZGFAQ4D","A3MJISYNXNYEQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJISYNXNYEQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This beautiful, oversized book is a wonderful introduction to Israeli cuisine.  If you already own the Ottolenghi cookbooks many of the ingredients will be familiar to you, from pomegranate molasses, tahini and harissa to the reliance on fresh herbs such as parsley and mint.  For those new to Israeli cuisine I recommend starting with Chapter 6, Live Fire.  This chapter includes a number of fairly simple kebab recipes that feature various meats - salmon, beef, lamb, pork, chicken, duck - marinated in the distinctive flavors of this cuisine.  It is hard to go wrong with grilled meats!The dessert chapter, Milk & Honey,  is highly approachable.  The recipes do not require a ton of ingredients, and they feature nuts, dried fruit, cinnamon, cardamom, lemon, honey, coffee and chocolate.  The Cashew Baklava Cigars are a different take on baklava than what I have made before, with small ""cigars"" of phyllo enclosing a filling of cashews, sugar and other spices.  The result is more finger food friendly, and perfect for bringing in to share during a class on the foods of Middle East!I will have less use for the recipes involving sweetbreads and pilaf, since I already know I am not a fan of those foods, but I am looking forward to trying the borekas, a savory pastry made with a variety of fillings, and the laffa, a flatbread that is drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with za-atar.  In all, there is lots to try and plenty of beautiful pictures to motivate you in this lovely cookbook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3NGE7PKGZAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544373286#wasThisHelpful","R2E3NGE7PKGZAR","A3MJISYNXNYEQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJISYNXNYEQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my second Dolce Gusto machine. I am an absolute convert to the Dolce Gusto drinks, which are much better than any K-cup I have ever had. This machine is semi-automatic, meaning that you set the fluid level, flip a lever, then press start. On my fully automatic Dolce Gusto machine, I only have to set the fluid level and press start, nearly the same process.The only reason to buy this machine is if you love the drinks. I personally do - whether it is the higher quality coffee Nestle uses, or the 15 bar brewing pressure, or some combination of the both, it works for me! There is nowhere to taste test the drinks before you buy this machine, which is a huge drawback for someone new to Dolce Gusto.I also suspect that Nestle is planning to discontinue their Dolce Gusto line in the USA now that they have the Nespresso Vertuoline. That is their new machine that makes both coffee and expresso, similar to the Dolce Gusto. The Vertuoline does not use a 15 bar pressure mechanism (which is necessary for ""real"" crema) but it has more varieties of coffee and espresso available for purchase than the Dolce Gusto.Milk based espresso drinks are only available for the Dolce Gusto, not the Vertuoline or the Nespresso.  Dolce Gusto also offers coffee, espresso, tea drinks, and hot chocolate.  Additional selections are marketed in other countries and you can usually find them on Amazon if you want to try them out.If you enjoy milk based espresso drinks, the Dolce Gusto is your most convenient option. If you are a bit of a coffee snob, you'll be happier with the Nespresso. If you want the convenience of a machines that makes coffee, espresso, and milk based espresso drinks, the Dolce Gusto is the best choice. I woudn't go with the Vertuoline unless you are willing to do without the 15 bar pressure system.  Since it lacks pressure, the Vertuoline is similar to a Keurig but with higher quality coffees.  That's okay for coffee, but not okay for brewing espresso. I love the 15 bar pressure of the Dolce Gusto - it gives all the drinks you make a thick layer of froth on top!The only thing that holds me back from a five star recommendation is the possibility that the Dolce Gusto line may be discontinued soon.  They closed their online store in June 2015, and now the only place to purchase the full line of capsules is on Amazon or BBB.  Target also sells the capsules, but not the full line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F12AXZNPX99V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5YRPBW#wasThisHelpful","R1F12AXZNPX99V","A3MJISYNXNYEQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJISYNXNYEQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Ms. Slaughter's article in the Atlantic when it came out, and was delighted to read this book.  She writes bluntly about the challenges that women face in the workplace not only at the top where she resides, but also at the lower rungs.  The honesty with which she describes the obstacles and prejudices women encounter is refreshing.

"This entry level video camera is a great choice for someone who wants a basic device for recording videos.  Perhaps someone who feels limited by the memory on their phone or is looking for a video camera that is easier to hold than a phone.  This video camera takes up to a 64GB micro SDXC class 10 memory card, enough for hours of recording even if the highest quality is selected.When I held this camera for the first time, my initial impression was of how light it is.  It literally feels like a toy, with none of the heft I was expecting of a video camera.  There is an adjustable velcro strap that, once properly sized to your hand, makes holding the camera very comfortable and secure.Recording is easy, requiring just the touch of a thumb.  I was disappointed that were not more recording options, such as a slow motion option, but at the entry level perhaps I should not be surprised.  There is a playback option called motion shot video which allows you to view the trajectory of an object (for instance a golf swing) but motion shot videos cannot be saved.I had no issue at all connecting my iPad to the video camera.  There are two separate modes - one for controlling the camera from your phone/tablet, and one for playback and transferring videos to your phone/tablet.To control the camera from your phone/tablet:- In recording mode, press Menu.- Select Wireless, then select Ctrl With Smartphone- The video camera will display its SSID and password.  It is generating its own wifi network, and you use the SSID and password information to connect your phone/tablet to this network.To playback or transfer files from the camera to your phone/tablet:- Select Playback Function, then Menu, then Wireless.- Select Send to Smartphone- The video camera is now creating its own wifi network and will display the information that allows you to connect.  You only have to enter the password on your phone/tablet one time.  After that it should be saved, and in the future you will only need to select the camera's SSID in order to connect.- You have the choice of whether to select the videos/pics you want to transfer/playback from the video camera or from your phone/tablet.  I found it easier to select from my tablet.Low light recording is exceptionally grainy, so consider yourself forewarned.  You will need excellent lighting for crisp video, even if using the Low Lux setting.  At the entry level price point, this is not particularly surprising.In all, I think this video camera is a good product for its price point.  One thing I really like is the built in USB cable so you are never unprepared.  A 5V, 1.5 amp USB wall charger is included, but you can use a common 5V 1 amp smartphone charger as well, it will just take a little longer to get a full charge.Also included in the box are an HDMI cable and a USB extension cable.  There is also an Operating Guide, but it is not very detailed or helpful.

"Great air purifier for the bedroom!  On its lowest setting it is quiet enough that you can sleep in the same room with the purifier on.  The hepa filter is about 1"" thick and has a foam gasket on the back to create a seal.  There is also carbon pre-filter which extends the life of the hepa filter while absorbing odors.  Air is drawn in from the front and expelled from the top of the purifier, so you can put it anywhere, even against a wall.  At this size, you could easily put it on a dresser.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y66D90ZYPDD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHLM8X4#wasThisHelpful","R2Y66D90ZYPDD4","A3MJISYNXNYEQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MJISYNXNYEQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In ""The Nightingale Before Christmas,"" Donna Andrews returns to her home-town writing with many of  our favorite characters.  And while continuing to keep Meg constantly tired and sleepless, at least she didn't bash, stab, or brutalize her.  In fact, the one ""dire straight"" that Meg finds herself in, is a bit of a giggle considering how battered she has been in previous novels.  Let's just say she was, for a short time, restrained by ""passementerie.""Andrews knows how to build a character and she does very well with a house full of competing decorators.  Each one stands out and is memorable.  She is also the queen of the red herring, which I love.  She offers so many possible solutions to the murder that it builds suspense and whets your appetite for what is to come.In this book, Meg's husband, Michael, is slightly more than just Meg's handmaiden.  He has his own stage to stand upon (literally). And the twins have moved from being totally obnoxious to behaving much more like simple lively boys with good imaginations.  I hope they continue to make this transition to civilization.  As for Michael, very odd.  Such a potentially fascinating character, yet Andrews doesn't seem to know what to do with him.  Perhaps he is too good to be true.  Perhaps, like all the other ""loveable characters"" in the family (Rob, Rose Noir, Dad and Grampa spring immediately to mind), Michael needs a few flaws to humanize him, and, of course, flaws are the engines that motivate action in any character.Andrews excels in description in this book.  You can clearly envision each of the rooms being decorated differently in the show house and see how it matches up with the decorator.  Sarah is an interesting character and since Meg doesn't seem to have any girlfriends, perhaps she should be carried over, especially since she and Meg get along so well.  I will say that if the decorating of rooms does not appeal to you, skip this book.  But I found it highly satisfying to see all the colors and designs come together.I'd also like to give a shout out to the fanciful, fun and flip titles Andrews comes up with for her books.  I'd like to see a story where Meg is sidelined in bed and her family has to do her bidding, and all the thousand and one little detective tasks that pop up.  She could be like the Spider and they are carrying out her web of discovery.

"This near-brilliant book so beautifully and thoughtfully written is a joy to read.  Science and its definition is in the process of a profound change.  Eben Alexander is on the cutting edge in terms of the general populace about speaking to this.  Business as usual  will not do any more in the scientific community and these exciting new changes Dr. Alexander talks about are exhilarating.  Basically, they show a firm and enduring connection between the spiritual and the material worlds.The book may appeal to the scientific mind, but only one that has a degree of openness.  Otherwise, the book is primarily aimed at the general, educated or curious reader.  For me, for the first time Plato and Aristotle fell into place in a way I could apprehend them, as did several famous scientists and their theories and experiences, including Einstein, Planck and Schrödinger.  And I'm an English major!Dotted throughout the book and in between Dr. Alexander's clear, sparkling prose (with many nods to Ptolemy Thompkins), are personal stories that have been sent to him, each of which impacts what has just been discussed, or prepares one for explanations and insights to come.  For a ""philosophy"" book, it is, thankfully, not dry, but easily understood.  The book is well-organized and each chapter flows into the next.  We in this world have been under the thumb of a rigid scientific method for far too long.  It is time to evolve -- and Dr. Alexander's ""Map of Heaven"" is a sounding note that heralds a deeper and broader and more truth-oriented way of dealing with life and this world's functioning.This book is an eye-opener and I highly recommend it to anyone with average or above intelligence and a curious mind.  For those who do not fit this description, or who insist upon clinging to the rotted pillars of ancient Christian structures, or who are too mentally lazy to think of a title for their review, don't bother your little selves with this book.  You won't understand it, you will dislike it and then feel emotionally obligated to inflict your ridiculous or hateful reviews on honest folk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VUOV8H2TJFHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476766398#wasThisHelpful","R3VUOV8H2TJFHD","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a bit skeptical about a book like this, yet also intrigued, I began to read Susan Lander's ""Conversations With History"" with mixed feelings.  They didn't stay mixed for long.  For one thing, her humble, thoughtful, respectful tone spoke volumes right there about her character.  The other thing that won me over was that each of her spirit subjects came across as distinct from one another; they did not all sound like Susan Lander.  No one better typified this than Louis Armstrong.  When asked about scatting, he replied, ""I took a little of this, a little of that.  And then just hit it where I was.""  And as you might expect, Gandhi's wisdom had considerably more depth than John Belushi's.  Even their farewells showed the difference. Gandhi said, ""May many blessings be bestowed upon all of you, and may you see clearly the blessings that you already have."" John shouted out, ""Sayonara!""This is a book of wisdom far more than of history.  Know that while most of the questions are interesting, they are not hard hitting, and in some instances when they come close to it, the subject refuses to answer.  I do wish Susan had asked more of them what they are now doing.  Much of the spiritual advice was similar but it was good to have the diversity of expressions.  Walt Disney sums it up:  ""Never -- and I mean never -- underestimate your potential.""  I don't think we poor humans can be told enough how powerful we truly are.I didn't entirely understand some of the coyness.  For example, Frederick Douglas declined to say what he died from.  Can it really matter anymore?  However, he redeemed himself when he talked about slavery in a deeper way.  Says Douglas about modern society, ""There has been a societal decision that says:  it is okay to overwork individuals.  It is okay to pay them less than they are worth.  It is okay to cut their wages, or increase their hours, or cut their benefits that they cherish and count on for seeing them through old age.  It is okay that people do not have access to health care if they should become ill or infirm.  It is NOT OKAY, and I ask you:  How is this any different than slavery?  Though their employers may not beat people physically, they certainly do financially and emotionally.""  (I was reminded here that Denmark's minimum wage is $20. an hour and their corporations do not suffer, nor are prices sky high.)  Perhaps Andy Warhol supplied the answer to Douglas's question when he said, ""Humans are prone to perfectionism, so anytime we are sick or injured or disabled or what have you, we can be very judgmental and harsh with ourselves.""  Gandhi takes this subject even deeper, commenting, ""Any kind of violence goes against all we are as souls.""  And what is more violent than slavery?  I love what Gandhi says about his assassination:  ""I forgive you, I love you.  I do not choose to be victimized twice by carrying negativity, hate, and unresolved feelings toward this man.""  Thus does he continue to teach us.There were some interesting commonalities among these departed spirits.  Many echoed what Henry Ford said, that ""Earth is a very tough place.""  It is also interesting in this context that most NDE'ers (those who have died and returned) have not wanted to come back to their earthly lives, but quite a few of  Susan's subjects expressed the wish to have had longer lives and they say they miss many things on Earth.  Patrick Swayze couldn't say enough times how badly he missed his ""soulmate, Lisa.""  Another thing in common is that an unusually large percentage of those interviewed died from pancreatic cancer.  According to Louise Hay this indicates a sense that life has lost its sweetness.  Makes you wonder.  I also wonder if Susan has heard from any of the friends or family of those she interviewed regarding the messages.I enjoyed every page of this book, especially for its unexpected wisdom, so I highly recommend it.  I think Susan Lander did an excellent job here and I'd like to read her second book on this subject.  Maybe next time she might consider Eleanor Roosevelt or Carlos Castaneda, or Hitler or Queen Elizabeth the I or Robin Williams?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PH63M24V2A1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945376#wasThisHelpful","R1PH63M24V2A1G","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I honestly don't know what people want. To give this perfect gem of a book less than five stars is insane.  But since so many readers mentioned how short the book was I can only think they were so disappointed at having to take less of Sharyn McCrumb's beautiful mastery, that they decided to vent their spleen and give the book less than five stars.  If so, how ungenerous, how short-sighted, how pitiful and how low.""Nora Bonesteel's Christmas Past"" is a blend of two separate stories, each written so precisely that not one word is out of place.  In some circles, the prose could pass for poetry.  Each droll expression, each accurate image, every emotional resonance, each character and all of their traits are laid out like the rolling patterns on the sublime quilt mentioned in the book.  In the end everything comes together in perfect harmony.  The reader has been taken on a journey that is gentle and yet, in its way, fierce, is hauntingly familiar and yet shows a style of life few live anymore, that is fast disappearing even as we turn the page.  And it is a journey well worth taking.  I simply cannot believe (although I've been assured it is true) that these characters are made up.  Surely, Nora and Spencer, Tom Honeycutt and J.D. Shull are McCrumb's ancestors whose histories and stories have been handed down in her family, whose present members even now are humbly putting the book on a shelf, too modest to let the neighbors know it is about them.If you want clash and dash and busyness and boring length padded with nonessentials, this will not be your book.  If you want a most lovely and satisfying experience to savor, with a book written with grace, subtle humor, humanity and clarity, you will fall in love with this book and remember it longer than most.  So what it is short.  Joy usually is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4U8V6ULN9GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426754213#wasThisHelpful","R3L4U8V6ULN9GA","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get immediately suspicious when I see ""Scratch Baking Mix"" on a box. It tells me that the manufacturers are willing to exaggerate or even lie to pull in customers. By definition, ""made from scratch,"" excludes a packaged, boxed mix. True, you have to add two eggs and an entire stick of butter to this mix, but, still, that is not ""from scratch.""  God, I get so tired of all this hype, l don't you? Everything that is sold these days seems to be dishonest in one way or another, from 'natural' products, to houses, from cars to politicians, which tells us just what the money-makers think of us. But can you blame them? We so often let them get away with it.At any rate, in the service of honesty, I must tell you that I hate brownies. In the past 30 years I've eaten exactly one brownie that I absolutely loved. The rest were moderately to extremely inferior to that one special one made by a now departed friend. Her brownies were homemade (even this word has lost its original meaning since some manufacturers are calling their boxed mixes ""homemade "" because you end up putting some ingredients in at your home!), and aside from a deep chocolaty taste, were crisp on top and moist beneath. So now you know what my definition is of an excellent brownie.Immaculate Brownies came out with a good, satisfying chocolate taste, but they were too dry all the way through.  And speaking of honesty, I had to laugh when they put the calories per piece at 200. They claim that there are 16 pieces in the box, but let me tell you, in a baking pan 8 x 8, I got nine medium-sized ones!  You do the math.I followed instructions to the letter and felt that it was unlikely my fault or the fault of my normal-type oven that the brownies came out too dry. I offered them to some friends down the hall who stopped over when they smelled that divine warm chocolate scent and by that time the brownie crumbs had hardened to little pebbles.  Still, my friends agreed with me that, overall, compared to other mixes this one was more chocolaty and even the ""little pebbles"" tasted good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMILKUTQPA5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHSVBRG#wasThisHelpful","R3PMILKUTQPA5Q","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no question that Mario Dirks has taken some smashing photos. The guy has genuine, sometimes exquisite, talent. But what he didn't have, perhaps, is a good editor. Starting with the cover photo, which looks like a clever commercial for a new car, the book is so crammed with pictures that only a few really stand out. The book itself is hard to handle, wants to close up on you, so worshipful appreciation of some of the pictures is well nigh impossible. I wanted to say, ""Slow down, slow down, please."" Some pages hold up to 4-5 pictures which does none of them justice.Also, I thought the layout lacking in finesse and structure. Of course, the thrust of the book is geographical, but it seems to me that categories of people, places, things, landscapes might have worked better. But that might entail more than one book! In fact, the layout could have been more presentable, understandable and beautiful had the one book turned into four. This book almost fell into the category of ""family vacation photos.""Finally, a word about the words. Unfortunately, the prose is pedestrian and often does not give you the details that you want to hear. Sure, Dirks is a photographer and is oriented spatially rather than verbally. He is more familiar with form than sound -- and it shows.  For example, he writes, ""The first (sightseeing tour) is my first-ever ride on an elephant."" So far, so good. He now has the opportunity of using his memory and imagination to rhapsodize about this experience. But all we get is, ""Being carried through countryside some ten feet off the ground is an incredible experience."" Incredible? At least, thank god, he didn't use that ubiquitous word, ""amazing."" But the thing is, because there is so little emotion in the writing, there is also very little depth.In short, the book does not do Mario Dirks' photos justice, but I'm glad we have them anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IVADHBZDCDI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937538362#wasThisHelpful","R2IVADHBZDCDI8","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never been impressed with authors who physically beat up their heroines. They usually do it for one of two reasons. Either they want to ""prove"" that their ""girl"" is ""tough."" or at least as tough as any man, or they are looking for the sympathy vote as they make their heroine a victim. For an author who strives to give her heroine as much smarts, strength and opportunities as any male, Donna Andrews has fallen far short of her goals in this book. As for the victim thing, she is outrageously out of date and out of style for the times. Meg Langslow spends the entire book hurt and getting further hurt and the last 30 pages were ruined for me as she does one stupid, inept, duh thing after another.In ""The Good, the Bad, and the Emus"" Andrews proves once again that she doesn't handle action scenes very smoothly. It's as if she simply cannot imagine the action she is writing about. She takes a competent, strong, smart, imaginative woman and turns her into a total dunce in the last 30 pages.I've read all of Andrews books. They are deliciously unique with memorable characters, lots of fun and plenty of excitement. But when it comes to action they each hold too many characters who fall apart or stand by idly. Michael is one of the most underwritten characters of all -- a temptingly sexy, viral, interesting man who spends all his time standing about or taking care of the kids.  Meg talks more to aging P.I. Stanley than she does to her own husband. What is the point of Rose Noire? A rather fascinating character, she is used only to mention a fact or two, or to spell Meg from mother duties. Dad is a little boy who is always running to and from a scene of trauma. Rob seems to have no sense and so does senseless things or nothing at all. The only truly active character in the book is Spike the Dog, and he can be quite irritating. This book even has a do-nothing chief of police for the most part.So, the last 30 pages. Would any sensible 90-year old woman head butt a Valkyrie? Not on your life? Read it and weep in this book. Would a 90-year old woman jump vigorously up and down on a metal cellar door? Nope. Andrews talks about ""brittle bones,"" but apparently in a failure of imagination, she cannot visualize what that means. But Meg is so passive that even a 90-year old shows her up. She comes to on the floor, the killer leaves and what does she do? Try to get up? No. Crawl away? No. She chats with the woman beside her unraveling some of the mystery. Not the time! But wait, it gets even more laughable. There they are, Meg and the old woman, outside in the still night air with perhaps a hundred people close by who could help them. As they both get away temporarily from the killer they both worry about how to raise the alarm. Hello? Have neither of you vocal cords? A sudden scream would raise all hell at that time of night and be heard for miles, let alone just a 100 feet away! And don't tell me the emus knocked down the emu-proof fence, yet again! But of course they did, for we need to have yet another way to batter Meg. The dogs attack the killer who never thinks of shooting them? No, because for the sake of a laugh, if not common sense, we must be given a picture of a large dog sitting on the killer -- something it has done before in another book. Proving once again that Andrews can visualize doing nothing much better than doing something.Andrews also is timid about emotions. Meg suffers through a whole host of them -- and rightly so -- but alas, no release for her or for us as she keeps them hidden inside. We do not see a crucial reunion -- the two go inside the house and shut the door. Again, no emotional release or full-circle moment. Mother shows up, an incidental character who is the high-hand who shuts off the two who are reconciling in private in a very clumsy way. But the biggest reunion falls flat.  Grandfather, always a man of many words and damn the consequences comes face to face with a hugely important person from his past and all he can do is dither and squeak, ""Morning,"" ""Er . . . likewise,"" ""Um, yes,"" his entire catalogue of emotional outpouring.And, finally, not to be mean, I love kids, but I do not love Meg's kids. Andrews writes the boys as just another pained trial for Meg, who dips in and out of their lives just as they are either entering or leaving some horrible mischief. They have no manners and act like barbarians. They are always disagreeable and always seem to be competitive with each other in a 'boys will be boys' stereotype as odious as the 'female as victim' stereotype. Josh, upon seeing his mother (did Andrews forget what Meg looks like at this point in the plot?) filthy, bruised and bandaged, has his first words be that Daddy has brought you a doggie bag, can I have your bacon. Really? Can we make these boys a little more human?Even though for me the last 30 pages were a bust, and the emus were explained and detailed far too much, still the book had a very good plot and I would lend it to someone to read, if asked, and smile while doing it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1USEJBP46N89C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250009502#wasThisHelpful","R1USEJBP46N89C","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read quite a number of books on animal spirituality, but LInda Bender's ""Animal Wisdom"" is the most intelligent book of them all. She starts off by asking a good question regarding newscasts using cute animal stories:  ""Why is it that we dwell on the parts of a newscast that make us anxious and depressed while dismissing our favorite part as mere fluff?""  She thinks it's odd that a source of our happiness ""at once so reliable and so universal isn't regarded as more significant.""  Well, the dread answer to that, of course, is, that is how our ""survival-at-any-cost"" society faces life. The joke's on us, though, for, as Bender points out numerous times with facts and stories, animals are the measure of how we humans are surviving, either well or not very. At this moment in time, I'd have to say we are struggling toward ""not very.""  Then she lays it out for us with shivering truth:  ""The fewer plants and animals we are able to recognize as individuals -- recognize well enough to name them -- the more alienated we have come to feel from ourselves, the Earth and God, the Source."" Our cultural blinders prevent us from also reporting how many plants, flowers, trees, fields, forests, sides of mountains, parts of rivers and oceans, animals, birds, butterflies, bees and other nonhuman creatures have been decimated in Syria, Gaza, Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, etc. etc. etc.You may ask, so what? These are just soulless creatures, not as important as humans. You'd be wrong. Animals very much have souls and within them is the same altruistic impulses found in the human soul -- and this according to the latest scientific studies. Bender says, ""It is this altruistic impulse in the animal's soul that we violate when, out of a sense of entitlement, we seize and exploit rather than permitting the animal to give."" You may say, ""Well, fields and oceans and mountains and forests don't have souls!"" I would ask you, ""Where would you think to find the soul of the Earth if not in all areas kissed by the Sun?"" Scientists now know with great certainty that the Earth is indeed, one total and complete entity lifeform, a whole system unto itself. If a dog has a soul, which no aware person would doubt, surely the Earth does too!And lest ye forget, we humans are very much ""animals."" Bender clarifies, ""The hierarchical view that holds humans inferior to angels and animals inferior to humans is based on a faulty premise. All of God's creations are perfect, and it is impossible for one perfect thing to be inferior to another perfect thing.""  Thus are we truly all created equal!  Which explains how it is we can all be ""One.""  Some of you more enlightened ones have observed that animals appear to have a ""connection"" to Spirit that humans have to work hard to achieve. Bender teaches us that ""What all creation myths have in common is the idea that whatever catastrophic event put an end to Paradise applied only to humans. Wild animals . . . were fundamentally happy and continue to be fundamentally happy to this day.""  She adds, ""We cannot find our way back to Paradise without them.""This book, though slender in volume, is wide-ranging. One of my favorite sections has to do with St. Francis of Assisi. Lots of interesting comments here as she delves into St. Francis's mystical abilities. She observes, ""Francis's great discovery was that you have to act trustingly before you can feel trust."" A scary proposition, but one that is nonetheless crucial. However, Bender helps us to find our way into trust:  ""You are practicing trust when you give up your attachments to the way you want things to be going at any given moment and surrender to the unwelcome splendor of whatever it is that's happening instead."" I love the phrase ""unwelcome splendor.""Okay, so we hapless humans lost ourselves Paradise. Now what? Well, Bender offers us this definition that we can all understand and relate to:  ""Paradise is a spiritual ecosystem in which every species has some essential role to play."" I get that, don't you? We may not all be able to be saints, but all of us can surely try to live inside this definition.My most favorite chapter deals with William Blake and Job. She lets these men help her understand God.  We are treated to brief, pithy explications of God's words to Job and the famous Blake poem whose first lines can still raise the hairs on the back of my neck, ""Tiger, tiger, burning bright/In the forests of the night."" Bender explains, in part, our disconnect from our understanding of God:  ""To look at an animal's culture from that animal's own point of view is to glimpse some aspect of divine mind that is foreign to the human mind, yet not entirely incomprehensible to it.""The tone of the book, aside from its intelligence, kindness and clarity, is more good-natured than humorous. For example, in her chapter on death, telling neat stories, quoting Rupert Sheldrake, Mark Twain and Dr. Eben Alexander, she says, ""At this point, you are probably expecting me to ask you to join in a rousing chorus of 'The Circle of Life.'  Relax, she doesn't.  But she does remind us that even when we're ""in the trenches"" facing death that ""prayer isn't about asking for things to be different. It's about asking to be shown the blessing that is within the pain.""  Definitely a hard request, but it's necessary to find the courage to do so.At the end of the book Bender gives us some really fine and very doable instructions for communicating with animals, the major action being this:  ""By quieting the mind, focusing on the present, and opening the heart, we create the sacred space in which our souls can encounter the souls of animals.""  I found this out for myself when two red squirrels were fighting and chittering away loudly on my porch railing where I'd set out some birdseed.  I did as Bender instructed, then walked out the door -- which put me only about four feet from them. Ordinarily, they'd freak and leap off the porch. This time, though, both stopped their squabbling and turned to me. I greeted them quietly, pleasantly, saying I hoped they enjoyed the seeds and not to fight over them and requested them  to leave some for the birds. They ""spoke"" to me.  I learned that one was an old male squirrel and the other an almost-full-grown baby squirrel from another family. One needed to keep his energy up to live; the other needed to live to grow up. I asked them to be willing to share and promised I'd continue to put seeds out for them. The fighting stopped. Each ate so much and then left the rest for the birds. I've since seen them together on the railing, eating peaceably after a brief initial exchange of territorial declarations that were quite unselfish.One of the best things about this book is Bender's ability to give us an idea, and then show us how to apply it concretely and specifically. That's a rare gift.  The book is quite accessible to all regardless of education or background. This is the kind of life-saving, world-changing, mind-opening book that we humans need so badly today. Our children's hopes and dreams  may be dying for lack of the information contained in ""Animal Wisdom."" When you can't believe in nor trust anything organic in this world, what do you do? You turn to technology, to metal and plastic, to screens and robots. You think these will provide you with a measure of safety, but that's not how life works. You will still get your heart broken, still become ill, still fail and experience grave loss and then you will find that much of technology was a dead-end road.  I am not anti-technology, and neither is Bender, but the exclusive or near-exclusive dependency upon it, is like sitting on a raft on the ground while expecting the buoyancy of waves to take you where your soul wants to go. You will wait a long, long time. Unless there's a flood which will definitely complicate things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPC3EE736PU1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583947736#wasThisHelpful","RPC3EE736PU1C","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joan Rivers constantly surprises -- and that says it all about a woman whose experience of life is considerable, as is her courage. ""Bouncing Back"" is the best book I've ever read about dealing with adversity and defeat and overcoming it. Sure, it's funny on every page, but it is also wise and practical on every page. In fact, if Norman Cousins had had Joan's book, he wouldn't have needed ""Candid Camera"" reruns and he would have cut his healing time in half.The book intends to reassure in every category. For example, you don't hear much about the second wave of grief in most books on the subject. Joan's insights on the matter are instructive. In fact, her insights are at once both humble and wise and will allow you a different perspective, one that will lead you to healing.Let me say something about her humor. If you're hurting, I'm sure you are not in the market for a ""funny"" book that will poke fun at what you're going through. Don't worry, this book does nothing like that. It is full of warmth, love, support and encouragement. The humor involved tends to be an enlightening sort of humor, or a joke that aims to make you smile, but never does it aim to make you flinch or laugh mockingly at yourself. Some people can't take a joke, even in marriage. (Okay, I had to.) Because some people are unable to laugh at themselves in a healthy way, anyone else joking about others' lives and habits is seen by them as disrespectful and mean. If you have seen Joan in this role, be aware that you won't see that Joan in ""Bouncing Back."" You can, in other words, trust her when it comes to this particular topic.This is also not a braggy book. She writes about herself in a straight-forward way, in the way that people do when they have matured and evolved from their youth. She is the topic she knows most intimately and she gamely uses herself in order to teach you lessons. How awful it would be (as we have sometimes seen) if at 80 we were still as shallow as we were at 20. You won't find that situation here. Frankly, I think if Joan were a man she would be known (as Don Rickles is) as ""An American treasure"" and celebrated at the Kennedy Center Honors. The thing about comedians is that if they don't tell the truth, they don't last long. You may not approve of Joan's making a joke of a Hollywood starlet's unfortunate choice of evening wear, but you must admit that her remark hits home. I saw Joan back in the 60's in NY doing her comedy act when she still had brown hair. The audience was split. Half of it (mostly women) thought she was sharp, edgy and totally hilarious. The other half (mostly men) thought she was uppity. Well, sirs, it was a whole slew of ""uppity women"" who changed the face of American culture, so let's hear it for uppity women in general and Joan Rivers in particular.Here's an indication of how she writes:  ""The other mental tape I like to play is the one that says, as I keep meeting new people, 'I like these people. I'm going to have a good time today.' I'm not saying that you should play that tape at a tax audit or gum surgery, but the prophecy often does become a self-fulfilling one.""I say, tell yourself, ""I like this book. I'm going to have a good time reading it."" Then buy the book! You won't be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LVH7OODGO70Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZYELC6#wasThisHelpful","R3LVH7OODGO70Y","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beethoven is my favorite classical composer, bar none.  I've read other biographies about him over the years.  The problem with Jan Swafford's ""Beethoven,"" however, is that as much as I love Beethoven, I do not love Beethoven himself as much as Jan Swafford does.  Therefore, I could have done without so much (unnecessary) minutiae, such as what the priest intoned in Latin at little Ludwig's baptism.  And we come upon it AGAIN 800 pages in!  Another example:  it takes six lines of type to let us know that Beethoven's birthday is lost to history.If you want history, culture and the wide view of people and the doings of that era, in addition to learning about Beethoven, this is the book for you. For example, Clemons August, Swafford tells us, ""may have"" admired another LVB and summoned him to Bonn.  Ten pages are then devoted to explicating Clemons August.The information is colorful and fulsome, but unfortunately it is organized in such a way that causes confusions and repetitions.  Swafford tells us in Beethoven's own words, which are found plentifully throughout, that Beethoven claimed his models were Socrates and Jesus. But we really never learn why.  Swafford muses a great deal.  He begins Chapter 25, ""Only to youth can love seem easy.  With the years come losses that taint the yearning and the passion."" While this may or may not be true, I looked to find it in Beethoven's life and could not discover that particular conclusion. He seems to have always found love difficult.I will say Swafford does not give Beethoven's music short shrift, but writes knowledgeably about it. Concerning the Missa solemnis, he says, ""There were two streams in Beethoven's music, the secular-humanist and the sacred, and the later had never gotten its due."" He illustrates some of his points with the music in printed form on the page.If you have all the world and time and wish to begin or continue a love affair with Ludwig von Beethoven, this is your book.  It is also your book if you are doing research. While at times Swafford can be tedious, giving way too much information to the reader, overall, perhaps we can say his passion excuses him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R325PV95YKMNVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061805474X#wasThisHelpful","R325PV95YKMNVT","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start with the ""big negative"" first. For me (but possibly not for you) one-third of the book is unusable. That's because I have no interest in following a meal plan, couldn't do it if you paid me! I would have preferred more recipes in that space. A few minor disagreements: too many recipes with salsa, jalapenos, red pepper flakes, black pepper, cayenne in them; too many recipes with too many ingredients in them; too many recipes with arcane (to me) ingredients I've either never heard of or cannot get where I live, such as Malaysian red palm fruit oil, grape tomatoes and coconut aminos, to name just a few. However, she did turn me on to Cumin, for which I'm grateful! There are also a number of exotic recipes that I really didn't understand, such as ""Pork Souvlaki Kabobs with Tzatziki"" and ""Pounded Chicken Paillards."" I wouldn't mind someone else cooking these dishes for me, though. BTW, what is ""smoked paprika""?Many of you will have no problem whatsoever with my ""negatives,"" and if that's so, you will love the entire book. The first part is a goldmine of tips, advice and suggestions for healthy eating, including  ""swapping"" one type of food for another. The recipes, by and large, are appealing and doable. Loved the ""Toasted Macadamia Nut Dressing,"" ""Swiss Chard With Olives,"" and ""Chickpeas With Spinach, Lemon, and Tomatoes"" -- although beware there are 11 ingredients, including black pepper, monk fruit extract, onion and curry powder.JJ Virgin has a pleasing writer's voice and her recipe directions are clear and easy to follow. There's quite a few charts and lists that are invaluable. ""The Virgin Diet Cookbook"" taught me a lot. You will profit from it even if you don't need to lose weight!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8RGIMK214UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455577790#wasThisHelpful","RE8RGIMK214UO","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always had a high opinion of Iyanla Vanzant. She's been through the hardest of times and always picked herself up from them, bringing with her the wisdom she accrued and then disseminating it out to her fellow human beings. For that we are so grateful!This book is a gift box, wrapped up with tape and ribbons. A lovely piece of work. However, that's just the problem. There are so many ""do this's"" and ""do that's"" that it can be overwhelming and feel like a closed system. It seems clear that Vanzant is the type of person who likes to hand herself large chunks of life whenever possible. Some of us can't handle that. The book feels driven, as if you MUST follow each chapter as demanded of you, no matter what. The thing is, I've been through the ""forgiveness mill"" -- and believe me -- if you do not already know -- that ""mill"" can grind your heart to pieces. It can take days, weeks, years to come to the end of one's blame and reach forgiveness. And all the ""tapping"" in the world won't get you there sooner! No allowance is made for this in the book. Instead, there is the idealistic expectation of ""21 days and out!"" Plus, there are deep spiritual reasons why forgiveness is necessary in order to evolve, but most of these reasons are not mentioned. For example, if we agree on another level to everything that happens to us, then, basically, when someone treats us abusively, we have agreed to it. To then not forgive that person is to act the hypocrite. Of course this is a ""mind"" statement and does not deal with the emotional -- another kettle of fish altogether!The wisdom in Vanzant's book is solid and helpful. The stories and anecdotes, while often skimpy on details, nevertheless open your awareness and are certainly interesting. Just know that this is a WORKBOOK and you use it everyday in detail. It is harder to get through than the year-long Course in Miracles because there's so much to do, to feel, to learn, but if you can modify the instructions and take it down a notch, you will be far ahead in the game of life, that much more empowered, free and loving. This book has a lot to teach you -- just be patient with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UH87I2HDYJVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401943616#wasThisHelpful","R3UH87I2HDYJVY","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And that's a good thing!  Some drawing books are too wordy but Chris Hart knows what to say and how to say it with a minimum of verbiage.While the emphasis in ""Fashion Design Studio"" is on, well, fashion, the lessons are so clearly and simply laid out that anyone could profit by it even if they were not interested in fashion.  The drawings and instructions are easy to follow.  You get little important details like how to make creases in someone's clothing, and are shown the difference between squinting eyes and hopeful eyes.The drawings are appealing, as are the ""models,"" but while this may seem to some a picky point, in this day and age I noticed very quickly that all of them are of white women, as I am.  I would have liked to have seen Asians and Blacks represented.  They draw, too.But overall, a delightful book, probably more of a beginner's book, but it holds lessons for anyone wanting to improve their ability with proportions, have more realism in their pictures, and apply useful tips that are inspiring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E10G7Y6ZFASU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936096625#wasThisHelpful","R1E10G7Y6ZFASU","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't expect much from this book, which was a good thing.  I took a ""wait and see"" attitude with a positive upturn.  I read it willing to be enlightened and uplifted, but that didn't happen. The reason is because TS writes in a jumpy, abstract, convoluted manner, saying a few mysterious and curious things about a subject, then moving on without elucidating. You keep hoping he will come back to the topic, but that never happens. The book is basically in a question and answer format, and there are many, many questions that TS never answers. Instead he will pull off to the side, or change the subject. The book should have been edited more stringently.I gave it two stars because he does say some important and good things about surrender.  However, I've been around a long while and frankly there are things I know that clash with what TS teaches, little mistakes he drops into his conversation in the book that indicate he is clueless about a few vital things a spiritual teacher needs to know.  I'll just give one small example because he is a work in progress like all of us and one supposes he will grow and learn like all of us and I do not wish to make a big deal out of it.  He refers to the body as a ""machine.""  It is nowhere near to being a machine.  That is a deep insult on a sacred entity without which we wouldn't be able to be here on Earth.  Also, he mentions love very little -- too little for the level he claims to be on. In life, LOVE is both the message you are carrying and the road on which you travel.  To lose sight of that is to lose sight of the truth, and then you have lost yourself. The best trackers know who they are.I would not recommend the book, although there are a few (too few) exercises in it, some of which are written badly so there are questions about what to actually do.  Other exercises are fine but can be found in other places. Overall, I feel this book is more an offering of ego than of love, yet I do applaud TS's intentions, whose end result, I'm sure, has been helpful to some people..","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTB9F1P6N6B3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591431603#wasThisHelpful","ROTB9F1P6N6B3","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just want to add my two cents in upholding the veracity of George Jacobs memoir of Frank Sinatra. The book is kind but truthful and draws an unusually complete portrait of one complicated man.One of the things biographies do is show us how little we know about anyone. I think about all the ""secrets"" that were shared in this book about famous people and realize how easy it is to idealize someone, especially when you are mostly ignorant about who they are. I expect that we are just as nave today about our ""stars"" be they political or movie or sports stars. This book has soul. And therefore it has the capacity to teach us something about the world and ourselves, to help us grow up a bit. Because of the respect and courtesy Jacobs displays in his stories, we are moved to humility as we realize that people are just people -- like us in so many ways -- no matter what they've achieved or how much money they've made. Life is the school we are all in and despite the ""glory"" and ""fame"" that accrues to someone, they still have to go through the same paces as the rest of us. In that sense, we are all truly equal. But, oh! don't we just love to put people on pedestals!The only confusion I found in the book was that Jacobs claims that Frank believed he was the man who put JFK in the White House, with help from Sam Giancana, yet the ""proof"" was not very forthcoming. There seemed to be no clear cut evidence of this and everything seemed to be merely implied. But my main wish is to know more about George Jacobs. It was clear that FS was the love of his life (nothing sexual intended) and when you receive a betrayal from that person it can easily end your life or defeat your life from then on. We've all seen it. But George had something deep and strong within him. Though his heart mended somewhat I'm sure it always had a bit of a crack in it. Despite that, he managed to grow post-Frank, and give himself a decent, loving life, shaping his formerly sterling character into spiritual gold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFM9247A1RC78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060596740#wasThisHelpful","RFM9247A1RC78","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are post-60 and have a fairly decent life with few physical problems, this book will bring you down faster than turning a page. Billy Crystal (who I love in all other respects) declares in every paragraph his intense focus on the negative, on every rotten thing that can happen to a person as they age. Many of these things DO NOT happen and many of them are fixable. Attitude is everything in life and unfortunately, our Billy has a bad one. He doesn't seem to have any spiritual beliefs or practices (not talking religion here), so therefore he tends to feel he is all on his own in the no-man's land of the elderly. He doesn't seem to connect up his attitude with his experiences!To give him his due, I admit that to be a comedian one must be clever and insightful at seeing ""what's wrong,"" and that's fine, but to project ""what's wrong"" out into your future years is a really dumb thing to do. I believe that for every ""what's wrong,"" in life, there are at least two ""what's right,"" and I find this belief becomes my experience. There is so much ""what's wrong"" in this book that I think it could make some people sick, especially if you have an open nature.It's possible that Billy's long-time insomnia has soured his faith that he can handle his life and make it better no matter how old he is. There comes a time as you age when you begin to realize you control very little in this world, including your own life. The thing is to make your peace with it and then try to understand over time why this is so. I would also say that if you don't find your life getting better, happier, and you becoming wiser as you age, you've taken a wrong turn somewhere and had better back up and look around. Insomnia, in psychological and spiritual terms, indicates you are not trusting the process of life. It is also a control issue. You can't ""let go"" and lose consciousness every night because you have too many fears of what could ""go wrong"" if you weren't mind-meddling in your own and others' lives.If you want to go down the ""poor me"" route as you get older, then by all means, get this book and allow Billy to commiserate with you and make you laugh in the process. But if you prefer being positive, upbeat, optimistic, looking for the joy in each moment, knowing the best is here or close by and wishing to be loving rather than worried and fearful, this book will slam you quickly into a very helpless place where you will find yourself the victim of the world and your body. Empowerment? Forget it! This book is a compendium of all the negative possibilities you could possibly face in old age, so just shoot me now!","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2IGPMOKMSST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805098208#wasThisHelpful","RT2IGPMOKMSST","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was something pure, humble, seeking and appealing in the young woman who first rowed across the Atlantic. You felt she had integrity, a solid spiritual core that was evolving with each pull of the oars. That young woman is no more.The woman who wrote Start Rowing preaches, denounces, takes sides, argues, is negative and focuses on all that is wrong. Even her book title is an exhortation. I submit that drifting is necessary to spiritual growth. Instead of listening to the wind, the waves, the sea life, she fills her mind with books on tape so she is not even present to her own experience. The first woman seemed to know how to listen -- not only inside but to her environment. She appeared to be divinely guided even at her most confused. She wrote a book full of fun, wisdom and wonderful word pictures. She gave you hope and you just knew that Life had singled her out for something special. It feels as if that is no longer the case. In this book she is just another crusader. If you insist on being ordinary, then ordinary is what you will live with.This present woman has little or no wisdom to impart. She has advice instead, suggestions for saving things, overwrought emotional reactions, and, unfortunately, a sort of bored prose. Wisdom and spiritual knowledge most often come in the silence. If you fill your every waking moment with thoughts and opinions, you don't hear what is given to you.Her first mistake was changing the sacred name of her boat:  Sedna. Did she think it meant nothing? That goddess herself would guide and protect her. A pact was made.  She broke it. She changed the name because of commercial concerns, i.e., money, since her main supporter wanted their name on her ship. Thus she began her journey losing a part of herself and insulting her true patron. No wonder she misjudged to the point where she had to abort her trip and return to land.The book is shallow and confusing. It was not terribly clear that she was making actually two trips and would hit land and rest up and recuperate for awhile before starting the second half. It didn't seem on the up and up that she did this. To me, rowing the Pacific doesn't mean stopping in the middle for a vacation. If I don't understand the ramifications of this choice, it goes to the lack of clarity in Savage's writing.In short, the book feels like something she promised to do but then made very little preparations on her trip to fulfill this obligation which she turned into a grinding chore. I can't help wondering if she had been present more often during her row, what amazing insights and revelations might have come to her -- for she does have the ability to receive them. We saw this in her first book. This book is more about research for what is happening in the marine world, than it is about her own experiences and thoughts. Magic touched Roz Savage, but she shrugged it off in favor of the mundane.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144CZ051PNZPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401942628#wasThisHelpful","R144CZ051PNZPY","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People who do not like to think deeply, or use their imaginations, or stray from the 'norm,' or think outside the box will probably not appreciate Shirley's new book, ""What If . . . ""  But if you're the type of person who loves to explore new ideas, put intellectual puzzle pieces side by side and compare them, try to figure out the larger picture, speculate on meanings and causes, then you will have a good time with ""What If . . .""MacLaine's new book is almost a compendium of what many free thinking advanced souls are ruminating about within themselves and with their friends. She runs the gamut from politics to alien DNA, carries on regarding the Founding Fathers and Downton Abbey, references an overview of past lives and life being ""show business,"", dwells on the spirituality of animals and the purpose of UFO's. In fact, this book could be the newest entry in adult party games for the intellectually brave and curious. You'd all gather around and then choose a page at random and read the ""What if . . ."" that's on it. Discussion ensues! Fun! Also involving -- and everyone would learn something and feel exhilarated. Laughter would abound except for those who would take it all so seriously. But isn't that always the way with life and party games?One of my favorite parts was where she gave 140 definitions of ""love."" Some were hilarious; others profound. A few made you cry. But a brilliant chapter. Her comments on ""hope"" are illuminating -- and poignant in their way. And who knew the Dalai Lama had a dirty mouth? She drums up some good possibilities as to why we all seem to be losing our memories, but ignores what, to me, is the most likely culprit:  the world is now so polluted that it has to be affecting the one organ that uses most of the nutrients we take in:  the brain. I don't think her advocating for cynicism would hold up, spiritually. I get her point, but if we create our own reality cynicism would not be our friend. Likewise, I wish she would question her need to destroy us all with some planetary cataclysm, or make us 'victims' of an extraterrestrial race. As Seth says, ""You get what you concentrate on. There is no other main rule.""I found it discouraging to read some reviews that complained because Shirley didn't ""dish"" as they wanted her to, or tell stories, anecdotes (there are a few of these, actually) or get real personal (which she also did a time or two). These people obviously had rock hard expectations that were not going to be met by this book. So they turned away, called it ""boring"" or ""just thoughts"" (what else is there??). In the process they lost a good deal of wonderful mind-stuff to play with and learn from. But maybe they couldn't have handled it in the first place. Here's YOUR test:  If you've read two or more reviews of this book, you can definitely handle it! You've got the mind and curiosity to follow each page down to the ground and up to the heights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12N6UDQ024VQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476728607#wasThisHelpful","R12N6UDQ024VQV","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrea Syrtash and Jeff Wilser won me over quickly when I read, """"Don't trust the rules, trust yourself."" They explain, ""Rules in dating keep you inside your head and out of an experience; they make you question your own instincts. And your instincts are better than what anybody else can instruct you to do (or not do)."" (And don't feel too played by the controversial title. They freely admit the title is just for getting attention.)The two writers interact with one another putting their own slants on the topics. This works fairly well most of the time even as they contradict one another occasionally. It gives the reader some perspective. But what doesn't work are the waste-of-space comments in gray from ordinary people. Most of these comments are lacking. They are inane, stupid, incomplete, confusing and sometimes gross. I think they bring the tone of the book decidedly down. Why would these two clever, witty, informed and insightful people want to put words from people who are not those things on a par with their own?Syrtash and Wilser are a strange pair. Jeff can come off as a dud, even a skunk. He's very funny, quite smart -- yet still has a lot to learn -- probably because he's been in so many shallow relationships and so few really deep, long-lasting ones. These last are necessary for achieving genuine depth since the only thing that really gets you to 'profound' is trust and short relationships do not build enough trust.I also wanted to kick his sexist butt for flapping his mouth here and there about being for equality between the sexes, then putting in a horribly out-dated and cliched sentiment about counseling his daughter to wait to have sex or perhaps join a nunnery. Really, Jeff? Is your daughter going to be so much better than, so superior to all of the women you lied to and fooled? No one who writes this about a ""figment daughter"" is able to give objective, nonsexist advice with any integrity. As for paying on the first date, Jeff, let me just say that when women receive equal pay for equal work, I'll be happy to pay. Or maybe when the glass ceiling is shattered and half of Congress is female. How's that!Some of Jeff's shallowness can be seen in his frequent reference to ""chemistry"":  ""You either have chemistry or you don't."" Oh? Chemistry can change, it can grow, it can diminish, it can disappear and then reappear. He doesn't seem to realize this, or that there are different kinds of chemistry. Some of that chemistry is generated by one's own need for sex -- regardless of with whom. So you can tick off 50% of the chemistry you feel for someone right there! Next, hard as it is to admit, some people are only good for 1, 2, or 3 encounters and then the chem is all used up. You are more likely to realize this over time without sex. It'll just happen. Besides,chemistry isn't necessarily meant to last in promising relationships. It's meant to transform into love at some point -- and down the road a piece, that's where all the excitement awaits.I know I'm picking on Jeff, but he deserves it, ha. Although he does shell out many an apology, as if he were using the book to ""make amends"" to old girfriends. He says he's changed. Perhaps Andrea's influence? One hopes! I must say he keeps the book zinging with his humor, making it worth the read just to have a laugh, such as, ""All relationships end poorly:  either in a breakup or in death.""Andrea does some solid writing in this book, making things clear, giving good examples and being warm and thoughtful. The problem with the book overall is that it assumes everyone is normal and healthy and all they have to do is read this book, see the options and then choose correctly or intuit the right feeling. The advicegiven is really a mere outline. Let's face it, life is just much too complicated and most people are damaged. You can't enter a relationship from your left brain -- which governs rules, logic, reason. Without imagination, intuition and emotion, there is nothing -- unless you want to cozy up to a robot. There's a reason you are attracted to the punks and skanks! Using rules and logic will not make your attempts to connect to someone better. However, reading this book will give you some tips that might help steer you in a healthier direction.Glad the book has an index. I'd recommend getting the book, especially if you are under 30. If you need this book post-30, you are in a lot of trouble and may need a therapist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH77CGIWNF4UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373892780#wasThisHelpful","RH77CGIWNF4UP","AFOV2K4F0MDTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFOV2K4F0MDTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the classic study of the main theological dimensions of Western Mysticism as found in Augustine, Gregory, and Bernard.  There have been lots of other studies since (McGinn's work, for example, covers this terrain), but this study is perhaps even better for the actual practitioner looking for very specific detail of certain stages in the mystical process. Cogent, clear, definitive in its way.  Of course there are other strands of mystic understanding in this tradition -- the desert fathers, Cassian, Bonaventure, Eckhardt, etc. -- but these are crucial figures in understanding the long history.The book is somewhat strangely organized -- Dom Butler added afterthoughts and moved things around in this second edition. The essentials are here: basically a series of excerpts surrounded by exegesis. It is perhaps worth adding that excerpts from other mystics are also discussed, ranging from Dionysius to St. John of the Cross, and more modern figures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0XU7J6E8MJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486431428#wasThisHelpful","R2G0XU7J6E8MJL","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This seems to be just about the only edition currently available online, with only Newman's notes -- the old Ker edition and the old Image edition are out of print. The Grammar is widely considered to be one of the earliest texts in what could be called ""the phenomenology of thinking"" and it is an amazing tour-de-force in detailed differentiation among such concepts as assertion, inference, and assent.  It is, among other things, a defence of certain of the powers of common sense and ordinary life -- in the tradition of Bishop Butler -- with very amusing side glances (into the controversy over Falstaff's line ""a'babbled of green fields"" for one).  It has been widely influential in theology and law, particularly on ""burdens of proof"", etc. There is also a small current flurry of philosophical interest in its anticipation of Wittgenstein's work in ""On Certainty"" (and there is one tiny piece of evidence suggesting Wittgenstein had read some Newman). The new reader should be warned that the first few pages are forbidding, but after that Newman's beautiful style takes over. The only real problem with the book is in the last fifty pages or so, when Newman does a desultory job of putting forward the ""evidence"" for Christianity -- mostly by attacking Jewish post-Temple history as a punishment for its (supposed) failure to acknowledge the Messiah, and producing the testimony of the early martyrs as a kind of counter evidence to Gibbon (!). This is, to put it mildly, not exactly good advertising for his overall position, which is very interesting and powerful in many ways -- students of philosophy would benefit a great deal from working through it.  If you can find the Ker edition I would recommend it over this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QOTQ80U1DHQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UJSKMW#wasThisHelpful","R3QOTQ80U1DHQ5","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a bunch of strange, half-hearted reviews here for one of the great works in modern biography. This volume is even better than the first, which is saying a lot. The whole book is fraught with the tension between Coleridge's endless bouts with failure, and his spectacular mind at work on the whole panorama of life in the early 19th century.  The reader (well, this reader) is constantly on the verge of giving up on Coleridge completely, and then he does something beautiful, and then he wrecks it, and so on ad infinitum (the history with the Morgans is one such).  It remains astonishing that so many people put up with him for so long, they all seem like saints after a while.The only slight issue I have with the book is that the philosophy is not really dealt with in any depth -- but there are lots of other books on that (The recent Oxford Handbook is a great example). The best thing in the book is the whole sequence in Malta -- just dripping with sunlight and big echoey palaces and the Napoleonic war, and an (alas) temporary triumph in Coleridge's life.I knew almost nothing about Coleridge's children until I read this -- Sara Coleridge is very interesting.  There is a discussion of a painting of her which hung over Coleridge's desk (by William Collins), but it is nowhere to be found on the Internet.....The whole book (volumes one and two) are both beautifully considered, and each one is a masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26N2N1YTMJQRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XOZ9HI#wasThisHelpful","R26N2N1YTMJQRJ","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good book on the subject (about which I knew nothing beforehand). I was looking for a general intro, and this provided it. Well written, and with some authorial reflections that were apposite. The first half is an excellent biography of Wesley and his contemporaries -- his parents deserve a bio of their own -- with a lot of general background. The second half is Wesley's theology, which I frankly found fairly ordinary and derivative from the mainstream theology of his day -- except of course for his emphases on salvation and new birth --  what makes Wesley interesting (to an outsider) is his life and practices.  But it would be useful for the intended audience, which is beginning theology students in Methodism.

"Extraordinary.This book has many, many virtues:(1) It is a clear exposition of the elements of the Davos debate between Cassirer and Heidegger. From this, you can get a real sense of what it is like for two masters of philosophy to expound and argue.  Philosophy students would learn a lot about how to argue.(2) The event throws a powerful light on the tensions in Weimar Culture, and the text covers them in exemplary fashion.(3) The erudition of both philosophers shines through: the whole debate centers around the interpretation of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, which both men have at their fingertips.(4) Gordon makes very clear what is at stake between the two interpretations and the world views of Cassirer and Heidegger.  He is very, very judicious between the two. It is not a hatchet job on either man: rather the reader comes away deeply impressed by both figures and their committments.(5) Gordon is an excellent writer. I am in awe of his capacity to navigate through both the narrative and the philosophical arguments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HVDA3ACJUJOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674064178#wasThisHelpful","R3HVDA3ACJUJOV","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had great hopes for this book to get an overview of Cassirer and Langer, but it is a difficult book to review -- Cassirer has had a minor revival recently (conferences, a biography, and a couple of books about the Heidegger/Cassirer debate in Davos), but is now mostly unknown, at least in North America; and Langer, who had a major vogue awhile ago, has practically disappeared from most people's view -- so anything about them is worthy. Also this book is full of detail about their theories. But having said that, it is very poorly written and a struggle to get through. I can only assume that English is not the author's first language: punctuation is spotty, many sentences are hardly English, and it is difficult to make literal sense of some of the arguments.  I find it hard to believe that Routledge allowed this book to go through without some serious editorial scrutiny beforehand.I would suggest that the interested reader head for Cassirer and Langer themselves: both of them wrote well and straightforwardly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUVD6RRCYE3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDR4FNS#wasThisHelpful","RIUVD6RRCYE3W","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deserves a constellation of stars. I have read this book many times, and just recently read it again, and it is even better than I remembered.  There is now an entire literature on the relationship between a gift economy and a market economy, spawned in part by work of Jacques Derrida and others in the higher reaches of theology (e.g. the grace of God as a gift).  But this book was in there first, is still better to my mind, full of sudden insight, easy to read, beautifully written, life changing.  The amusing thing is that the author is under the impression that it is about artists: that is a tiny fraction of its insight -- it is really an attack on the entire world view in which we operate, and opens up whole ranges of spiritual understanding. A well run society would send a free gift copy to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGINL2LCHSNM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GKGB00#wasThisHelpful","RGINL2LCHSNM5","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bowie's book is an extended meditation on Adorno's work -- not for the novice, and not an introduction.  Bowie has written a number of books on early German philosophy (Schelling in particular pops up in this volume from time to time), which I enjoyed, so I picked this one up.  The main theme, using Adorno, is the way in which modern analytic philosophy forecloses on wider or better truths through its narrowness of method and goals.  Aesthetic truths (especially music, naturally) get discussed in a late chapter. This is all linked to the classic theme in Adorno of how science, capitalism, commodification, and reification have ""objectified"" the world as assumed by modern societies in general, and a certain cadre of philosophers in particular.  Bowie fairly elegantly deals with the Kantian and Hegelian influences on Adorno -- especially the critical theme of how much of the framework we contribute to the creation of understanding of the world around us is constant (Kant), and how much is transiently dependent on the influences of temporality, e.g. historical and social change (Hegel).From time to time Bowie brings in contemporary examples, such as the recent economic crash as an example of capitalist rationality out of control (at least Bowie thinks that is what it was.....).I enjoyed the book, but, as mentioned, you need a pretty substantial background in Adorno-ish writings to get much out of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8KJ7G8QYJUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745671594#wasThisHelpful","RR8KJ7G8QYJUQ","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a clearly written exposition of Jonas' thought from the perspective of someone with primarily an environmental concern. Jonas' ontological ethic is one of the few really strong ethical frameworks in environmental philosophy -- much of the rest is a hodgepodge of other forms of ethics bolted on to various environmental issues. Jonas has been much more influential in Europe than in North America. It would serve fairly well as a complementary text for an undergraduate philosophy class on Jonas' ethics.

"This is a worthy entry in this really fine series (I have four of them already), and one of the clearest and most straightforward. I enjoyed it a lot, as someone who has worked on the Gita for years. There is an excellent set of references and bibliography. It is, however, not an exposition or critique of the text in any detail: it is really about the history of the vagaries of the text and its influence. It is interesting in particular how much of the Gita was overshadowed early on by the stories/histories of Krishna as a child, cowherd,etc. as the ""bhakti"" movement gathered force in the medieval period. A chunk of the book is about the use of the Gita as a political force beginning in the late 1880s, in part as a Hindu ""bible"" to counter the prestige of Western ""bibles"". Towards the end of the text there is a discussion of a few recent translations into English (from Van Buitenen to Stephen Mitchell), and a glimpse of various settings where there are oral readings.My study of the Gita was influenced strongly by Zaehner's old Oxford translation and Winthrop Sargeant's valuable word by word translation and exegesis (neither of which are mentioned here) and I have a fondness for Barbara Stoler Miller's elegant translation (which does get a mention).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GFE4A94RJ79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDC6TT0#wasThisHelpful","R13GFE4A94RJ79","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great novel, one of the few that really enters into the life of the native villagers of Sri Lanka in the early 20th century (and before).  It is very oppressive and dark, and captures a kind of inexorableness of both the surrounding jungle and the internal hates and loves of tightly bound village life.  It perhaps assimilates too starkly the natives with the ambient natural world (they are likened to the animal realm from time to time), but then Woolf was a white colonial administrator (and the colonial administration doesn't come off all that well either).  The darkness and oppression of the story are offset by the fabulous writing which gives the whole thing a kind of glow.It is interesting that this novel has never achieved classic status, probably because there are no western heroes, and nothing really redemptive. But parts of it are in the same league as A Passage to India.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FODW8PGME2XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1614276684#wasThisHelpful","R1FODW8PGME2XV","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brandon was a tough minded, compassionate man who toiled in the underbrush of social work and related fields for many years, eventually becoming a Zen monk and a professor.  In the obits after his death it was clear that he was difficult to get along with: had a sharp tongue and mind and didn't suffer fools (including himself) gladly. He wrote many articles and newspaper pieces, and several books on specific topics. His other book in this area is the Tao of Survival (which is, alas, not nearly as good as this one).This is a masterful book, full of insight and hard truths. Beautifully written, I decided to re-read it a few days ago, and it is still amazingly insightful. His examples and ideas come from social work, but they are applicable to any of the so-called ""helping professions"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R693848UGN75N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440598974#wasThisHelpful","R693848UGN75N","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful book, full of zoological detail, and Aristotelian history around the island of (then) Lesbos.  It follows very closely (but with much more detail) the author's earlier version of this that was a BBC TV show in 2009, and which is now available on Youtube (search for ""Aristotle's lagoon"") -- an indispensable complement: for instance, the author cuts open a cuttlefish in the show, which is described in the book, but of course is much more powerful seen visually.  And some of the characters and locations in the book make their appearance in the film: plus, of course, there is the bonus that you get to see a Greek island and vicariously sit and drink ouzo at a cafe by the sea!I would personally have liked to have more background about the other aspects of zoological work Aristotle undertook (Martha Nussbaum's well-known edition of the Motion of Animals is a good example). There is a brilliant outline, background, and discussion of Aristotle's biology on the Stanford University Philosophy site (by James Lennox who has written extensively on the topic) that further complements this book; and another good one at the Internet Encyclopaedia by Michael Boylan, also a well-known specialist.  It is always worth remembering that something like a third of Aristotle's work was on aspects of biology.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNZN0Z3N5OD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INIXJL8#wasThisHelpful","R1LNZN0Z3N5OD5","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a solid biography, based primarily on the letters (it hardly deals with the literature or ideas at all). The last part is a bit tedious -- we get a lot of unnecessary detail about practically everything.  There are very interesting things I learned from this biography that I had missed in others, e.g. how very, very wealthy Voltaire became.  This made him somewhat more invulnerable as his life went on than in his younger days. The biography makes clear that while Voltaire was a great man, he was a very tiresome human being.  It is also well noted in the biography that he was prone to making dramatic gestures and then obsequiously backing away from them.  Still, Voltaire remains surprising: it is not everyone who in their 70s in the 18th century starts up a surprising and profitable watchmaking industry from scratch!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6CYZVOGIEHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LW2ICA#wasThisHelpful","RM6CYZVOGIEHF","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are in the midst of a Diderot boom, and this a good place to start. This is a great biography and should be back in print. Furbank writes beautifully and masterfully, and his choice of quotations and his summaries of Diderot's works are exemplary. Diderot's novels became fashionable again in the postmodern era, and his own political stance has also become the subject of renewed interest in discussions of the pre-French Revolutionary ""pivot towards the republic"".  His writing on the Salons is everywhere in contemporary art criticism. Everything Diderot writes has this fascinating mix of deep committment and pervasive irony -- he is really one of the first modern people, for better or worse. And how much better Diderot comes off than virtually all of his contemporaries as a human being!  It can only have been a pleasure to be in his company.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45PCUWPWCON6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679414215#wasThisHelpful","R45PCUWPWCON6","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an authoritative, reliable, big biography of Machiavelli, rich in detail and learning, covering practically everything Machiavelli wrote in great detail (including letters, poems, etc, as well as the more famous works). Black is steeped in the manuscripts and Italian history of the period -- this is not one of the pop bios that Machiavelli seems to attract these days.  However, it is not easy reading at all and is certainly not for anyone coming to him for the first time.  You will need already to have a working knowledge of Italian history of the period and a pretty good sense of Machiavelli's life and work so as to make the most of this book. The critical discussions of the books most people are interested in (The Prince and the Discourses) are pretty good.I still think Hale's old Pelican ""Machiavelli and Renaissance Italy"" is about the best intro for setting the English speaking reader into the period; and Skinner's Oxford short book is best for the ideas and their background.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NS9TP6CA2VUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0582784069#wasThisHelpful","R2NS9TP6CA2VUY","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I originally read it, it spun me off into reading all the other books he mentioned, and helped me travel to some of the places he travelled as well (alas, I haven't been to the Cevennes, yet).  The idea behind the book -- tracking the author's personal life alongside the subjects he began to study along the way -- could have been a narcissistic disaster, but in fact it is a total delight.  His other books are also great -- The Age of Wonder is, well, a Wonder.  I confess having not gotten completely through the Shelley bio (there are other Shelley bios that are comparable, and that I slogged through back in school); but the Coleridge and Johnson/Savage bios are works of art.

"Leakey was for many years the doyen of English speaking critics of Baudelaire (his Collected Essays and book on Baudelaire and Nature are essential reading for scholars). This is not an introduction for readers just coming to Baudelaire. Rather, it is in some ways an abridged version of some of his other work, and the reader should have already had a reading of Les Fleurs du Mal under her or his belt.  The first section is not where I would start, as it gives an exhaustive review of how the published text was put together in its various versions, which is important for a structural recognition of how different poems lead into and away from each other, but for the reader who is captivated by the power of individual poems (most people, let's face it), this editorial work isn't immediately enticing. The chapter on Baudelaire's craft is exemplary; but the prize of the book is a close reading of Le Cygne which is a classic (and adapted from his famous essay on the same topic).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V9VITGV1R3ST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521369371#wasThisHelpful","R3V9VITGV1R3ST","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is a standard text for French schoolchildren, in the same league as To Kill a Mockingbird or Catcher in the Rye, for American schoolchildren: its power (for them) is that it begins in a rural schoolyard, and then turns into something deep and sad and nostalgic -- evoking a lost France and a lost world of ephemeral magic dreaming.  I've read it many, many times, and it is still intensely powerful and moving.Of course the title is untranslateable (though we do have 'The Great Gatsby', influenced by this novel, and no one seems to object to that title; but 'The Lost Estate' is clunky (it is a pun on a lost place as well as the 'estate of youth', but it is still crummy, and 'The Wanderer' is misleading)).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VEBWF890VDA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RI9S0Q#wasThisHelpful","R1VEBWF890VDA4","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many another reader, I was disappointed in this book.  It is dragged down by various kinds of self-indulgence that don't do the author any favours.  Given the possible audience (people who already know something about Thoreau), it is bizarre that the author felt the need to juice up his prose with ridiculous contemporary ""with-it-nesses"" -- does he think we will suddenly ""get"" Thoreau by likening nature to a hard drive and making reference to Thoreau's MO? There are some irritating typos (""council"" for ""counsel"" in one spot). The final chapter, recounting the author's walk to Walden Pond today, was done better by E.B. White a long time ago.  Having said that, there was some information I didn't have-- the author has read extensively on the subject -- and for that I am grateful.

"This is a pretty good biography, not great. There are chunks of it that are unnecessary filler, ostensibly ""background"".  I don't have any trouble, as other reviewers have had,  with the discussions of Melville's sexuality -- Delbanco seems to be fair and judicious about the assumptions of the period, and the displacements of metaphor. Pierre (as just one example) is seriously strange/incestuous -- you have to be blind not to see that.  The evaluations of Moby Dick and Billy Budd are the centre pieces of the book, and are done well.  Overall, I did feel that with someone like Melville the writing should have been more something -- deeper, more exciting, maybe? Perhaps D.H. Lawrence, Leslie Fiedler and others have just raised the bar too high.  Or perhaps Melville's later life was just so dreary  that we are inevitably disappointed by the protracted waning of his thunderous vastness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CO9YE3Z9R6UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6OVOE0#wasThisHelpful","R2CO9YE3Z9R6UG","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is hardly any philosophy in it (the Ethics is summed up in a few pages), but what there is is very deftly done (the Ethics is placed in the context of a review of neo-Platonic/kabbalistic emanationism).  The best thing about it is the judicious discussion of the complex Jewish and Dutch history of the period, and the strange array of new believers of various sorts who probably/possibly intersected with Spinoza.This is not the book I would give to anyone who wants to work through the philosophy, but, as mentioned already, it is good on the life and times; and the references to various recent articles and books on the context of Spinoza are valuable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMCW0W8XPBG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3E7KHI#wasThisHelpful","RHMCW0W8XPBG0","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can tell (as she states in her Acknowledgements) that she has been marinated in Hardy for many years.  Her special treatment of the poems is particularly welcome -- the sea change in their assessment over the past half century (a tip of the hat to Philip Larkin) shows itself here.

"This is one of a number of recent guides to Spinoza's Ethics. It is solid, and straightforward -- it moves through the text from the beginning, making good points and clarifying as it goes. It doesn't cover the whole range of complexities (for example, it doesn't deal with the crux in IP5 concerning attributes that prompted Leibniz to argue that Spinoza has committed a logical fallacy), but it is a good book to start with.

"This is a very strange book, which (as a seriously besotted Piero fan) I eagerly pounced on. On the good side, there is a lot of erudition (especially in the notes) and a strong narrative, intermingled with interesting material on the rise of neo-Platonism in Renaissance Italy. On the other side, there are all kinds of problems. First, the author is trying to make a deep connection between Piero's work (especially the mathematical) and Platonism, which is perhaps fair, but there is no hard evidence for this. The author admits (in a footnote) that nowhere in Piero's writings is there any mention of Plato or Platonism.  What we get is a lot of maybe's and perhaps, and ""Alberti was in X at possibly the same time, and Piero could have been drinking at the same cafe"" kind of writing.  Large portions of the text are about other people and other events -- all the way up to the burning of Giordano Bruno 100 years later, and then Isaac Newton.  The second half of the book is about the rediscovery of Piero, and not about Piero at all.  Lastly, the book title is misleading: there is nothing significant about Piero and Light together in the book, except that Piero's paintings are in this cool light (in fact, a great deal more could have been made about the relationship between light and dark in paintings like Constantine's dream).  I did learn a few things, for which I am grateful.  Most importantly, it led me to an interactive web site showing, in great detail, the entire sequence of frescos in Arezzo, which is a fabulous resource (Amazon doesn't seem to allow links), but a little searching will bring it up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R206YB4706G1E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HE2JKGW#wasThisHelpful","R206YB4706G1E4","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been reading this translation along with the classic Suzuki translation and the Cleary translation. This is obviously the most reader friendly, with notes and glossary, and straightforward English (sometimes a little too straightforward). Red Pine and Cleary are somewhat easier to read and smoother than Suzuki (mostly because they translate the vast-sounding names and technical jargon), but occasionally Cleary's translation is not in anything like readable English (see below). It is worth noting that the Cleary translation has no apparatus, and no introduction, etc. I would certainly advise having the Suzuki translation (which has a long introduction) to hand as a complement, if you are really going at this sutra. Even better would be to have the Suzuki ""Studies in the LS"", because in the back of it is a substantive glossary to his translation. The Red Pine translation has extensive notes, many of which refer to the Sanskrit original (Red Pine's is from the Chinese), that Red Pine admits he is at dictionary level reading ability. For the interested reader, here are three versions of the same piece (from section VIII of Chapter II, in the Suzuki numbering):Seeing the three realms of existence as caused by the impressions of mistaken ideas elaborated since beginningless time, by mindfulness of the non-origination of the imageless stage of buddhahood, having attained the ultimate truth first hand, the master of one's mind, having attained effortless practice, like a jewel of all colours, maintains certainty in the orderly combination of the steps of the stages by means of subtle created forms entering the minds of beings, through understanding mind alone. - ClearyWho sees that the habit-energy of projections of the beginningless past is the cause of the three realms and who understands that the tathagata stage is free from projections or anything that arises, attains the personal realization of buddha knowledge and effortless mastery over their own minds. And like gems capable of reflecting every colour, they enter the subtlest thoughts of other beings and in their apparation bodies teach them `nothing but mind' while establishing them in the sequence of stages. -Red PinePerceiving that the triple existence is by reason of the habit-energy of erroneous discrimination and false reasoning that has been going on since beginningless time, and also thinking of the state of Buddhahood which is imageless and unborn, [the Bodhisattva] will become thoroughly conversant with the noble truth of self-realization, will become a perfect master of his own mind, will conduct himself without effort, will be like a gem reflecting a variety of colours, will be able to assume the body of transformation, will be able to enter into the subtle minds of all beings, and, because of his belief in Mind-only, will, by, gradually ascending the stages, become established in Buddhahood. - SuzukiIt is noticeable that there are different choices (e.g. is there one 'being' established in Buddhahood, or many?) being made here. Finally, it is worth noting that the Red Pine translation does not include the final chapters that were added on later to the core. Having slogged through the Sagathakam -- a miscellaneous grab bag of earlier sections and some additional thoughts that are somewhat intriguing -- I don't miss it. But the added chapter on meat-eating is interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5I9R1J715EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619020998#wasThisHelpful","R3H5I9R1J715EU","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a much expanded version of an earlier book and set of ideas of Takamaro Shigaraki's, long out of print.  His is a profound re-interpretation of Shin Buddhism, taking into account the Mahayana background and references to Zen, etc.  Perhaps the strongest element of it is the dismantling of interpretations of Shin that assume dualism, and especially a faith in a completely separate power, etc., as if Amida was some kind of deity. The first half of the book is stronger than the second half (particularly for non Shin Buddhists, like this reviewer), because of its focus on this dismantling.  The second half is fairly straightforward Shin/Pure Land teaching.  Among the profound discussions in the book is the interconnection between deep evil and deep mind (roughly, that it is in the graininess of our deepest evil that we discover and are discovered by our spirituality (the darkest shadow we cast is an oblique expression of the brightest light).  Such was Shinran's insight.Parts of this book are on the same level as D.T. Suzuki's old Shin Buddhism book (an entry into the Shin 'mind world"" for Zen practioners) -- one of the great spiritual books of the 20th century.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQHLRLTTVJ2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3M3WUE#wasThisHelpful","R1GQHLRLTTVJ2D","A2KUMYWXAQNARZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUMYWXAQNARZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My original Desk Setup from left to right is Razer Orbweaver Elite, Logitech K750 Keyboard, and Razer Naga 2014.Bought: Perixx PERIBOARD-407BHowever, because the K750 is a full size keyboard, its length intrudes half of my mouse mat limiting the movement of the mouse.I no longer use the Numkey pad too much when i play games, so I needed a ""mini"" keyboard to accommodate the limited space of my pull-out desk try.This perixx is awesome and does just that.ONE THING TO NOTE: I initially thought the keyboard was faulty but the built in NumKey covers the letters from ""Q"" to ""P"" on the QWERTY keyboard layout. The manual said nothing about NUmkey so i thought it wasn't included and actually thought my Perixx was defective. After pressing the keys, I found out there was a FN + NumLock in Blue and corrected the simple mistake.Highly recommend.I wanted to but the Preixx one with Back-lit, however due to overwhelming negative reviews on build quality and bleeding light, I decided to opt for this model as my previous keyboard K750 was not Back-lit so I am not missing out much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C7WUMK3A7P1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053O9ZNQ#wasThisHelpful","R3C7WUMK3A7P1X","A2JWF9IG8PJAOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JWF9IG8PJAOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"TL:DR; I wish it came with a rack. Inner Curved handle bar area takes some getting used to.Incredible Barbell.Barbell on a Pound Scale weighs 10 pounds by itself. Think of a Solid Steel ROD.The two caps on opposite ends have Rubber O-Rings and the Barbell has two Rubber O-Ring inserts. This ensures the Weights added will be gripped in place when caps are screwed on tight.I had to make a Wooden rack for the Barbell as replacing the weights was quite difficult if not held up off the ground.The inner curved handle bar area takes some getting used to but is great for beginners (like me) to help correct posture and breaking down into the basics.Despite teh curved handle, can still do overhead and most of all weight lifting barbell techniques.Depending on your style, preference may prefer the Solid Straight Rod instead of this curled one.Haven been using it for 2 weeks now but due to my own weight-lifting limit, I only load 7.5 lb. on each end for a current total of (7.5 x 2 + 10) = 25 lb.s","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S4N4D79ABFBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X166VO#wasThisHelpful","R2S4N4D79ABFBM","A2JWF9IG8PJAOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JWF9IG8PJAOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great book. I also own ""Black & Decker The Complete Guide to Wiring 5th Edition"", and ""Wiring a House 4th Edition: Completely Revised and Updated."" and ""Home Improvement 1-2-3 [Large Print]""As a comparison:Home Depot 123 is like a manual for quick easy jobs.For people who think receptacles shoot lightning and great for beginners as its simple and easy to understand. Basically the Basics but intermediate enough to mess with circuit breakers and not get electrocuted to death by them.Black & Decker is HARDCORE!They assume you know what you are doing and you won't electrocute yourself with a metal ladder on of a puddle of water while running HOT electric lines. This book goes straight into advanced wiring designs and circuits for projects, electrical codes you need to know to be up to standards, and installing therm-electric floor-warming systems. It also goes lightly into electric appliance repair such as disassembling a burned out lamp circuitry to integrating a back-up power supply to your house.Wiring a House For Pros by Pros (The name says it all)This book teaches you the experience to be an electrician. It emphasizes the difference between an electrician that came fresh out of school and an electrician that has been On-the-job for 30+ years. Words cannot simply describe the ESSENTIAL information in this book. If Black & Decker is hardcore, this book is for Journey Men and Masters of the Trade. However this book does not go in-depth in planning home electrical projects.

"The reason I am only giving this +3 Stars is because of the bad implementation.What I used, ALL are Android Based obviously:-Xperia Z (Phone, 1st Gen) 5"" FUll-HD Display-Xperia Z Ultra (Phablet) 6.4"" FUll-HD Display-Xperia Z Tablet (Tablet) 10.1"" FUll-HD DisplayBut First, here's why it got +3 Stars.THE GOOD: [+3 Stars]-Supports any Device running Android.-With Amazon Prime you have access to all movies associated with the Prime Account. Watched all the Season of Archer in it's HD quality.-Video Quality based on Quality of Video Standard Definition [SD], or High Definition [HD].-Worked on all 3 of my Xperia Devices Flawlessly. Video streams scaled with each devices screens with no issues.THE BAD: [-1 Star]-Initially requires Side loading of the Amazon APP via Amazon's Webpage. DO NOT SIDE LOAD the Amazon App from another website besides Amazon, due to Virus/Phishing/Malware.-After Installing Amazon's Marketplace APP, then requires installing the Amazon Prime Instant Video APP.THE UGLY: [-1 Star]-It's just an APP shortcut to Amazons Prime instant Video.For Example, if you loaded up Android Chrome or Android Firefox, and went to Amazons Homepage via the browser then navigated to Amazon Prime Video, That's exactly what it looks like.The only difference is a few buttons like ""BUY NOW"" or ""NEXT SEASON"" are bigger compared to the PC Internet Browser version.FINAL THOUGHTS:Then again, what's isn't broken shouldn't be fixed.It just felt kinda  cheap how the Amazon Copy and pasted the PC internet version of the Amazon webpage and used it as the final product as an APP. There were some noticeable differences, but not enough to make a difference.The more simple shortcut would have been to make a Android Shortcut from Amazon's Prime Instant Video Webpage and dropped the shortcut onto the home screen of the Android Device.Amazon's Fire Stick TV was waaaaaaay better than this. But the bottom line is that it works, just feels like the APP itself wasn't a necessity and I could have used Android Firefox and navigated to the Amazon Webpage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWOIKAPO21J3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N28818A#wasThisHelpful","RWOIKAPO21J3P","A2JWF9IG8PJAOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JWF9IG8PJAOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this as a Gift for a friend into Crystal collections.The black shine was really gorgeous. It is hard to see in the image but the striations and light reflections off the Obsidian glass like surface was really beautiful.Friend told me it has to be worn outside of a shirt as the rock itself isn't polished and is really abrasive to the skin.Because my friend is into Crystal collection and Jewelry making, the included Silver interlocking necklace chain was scrapped for a more personalized necklace.Also the Necklace attachment to the Black Tourmeline is really interesting, it is dipped into molten metal.Originally I thought (based on the product image) that a metal smith made a custom metal bracket and Super-glued/Epoxy it to the top of the crystal.However upon receiving the Crystal and inspecting it, it appears the the rock was DIPPED into molten metal and had the Necklace Hoop casted  into the top of the crystal for a very custom, tight, and unique fit.The only con is if the Crystal wasn't properly cleaned before the molten dipping.Otherwise the Metal casted cap might fall off, but from the looks of the finished product, it seemed to be really solid.There was no flaking of black Tourmeline on this necklace.I suppose that it was lightly tumbled/cleaned before it was made into a pendant.Due to Superior Workmanship in Metal Dipping I had to give it [+2 stars].Because this was a gift for a friend, And was very pleased [+2 Stars].Product itself was well packaged and came with a Silver interlocking necklace Chain [+1 Star]","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKXVU8AHTLZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJBYUFE#wasThisHelpful","RXKXVU8AHTLZ8","A2JWF9IG8PJAOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JWF9IG8PJAOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great book and very detailed in labeling and diagramming the internal mechanisms of a ""Typical"" Home door lock.I have a good 2 year experience at assembling locks and switching the cores for new key replacements and reshaping the metal nubs. This book was a good refresher on some techniques I missed out on.I mainly got this book to get a better understanding of how to open door locks more efficiently with power tools, and be more aware of the variety of locks available out there. Some of the locks illustrated in the book are almost 10 years old and some people say those locks are outdated. But just because a certain lock is outdated doesn't mean it's no longer in use. Some people are resistant to changing their locks, and the longer they keep their old locks means lock smiths need to have a good variety of knowledge of all the locks out there in circulation.A great book to read. Its spread out like a Physics Textbook starting off with vectors and then bringing you into the meat of the lock. No actual Physics Math required, but some knowledge on torque is a must.I have considered other books such as:>>>Practical Lock Picking, Second Edition: A Physical Penetration Tester's Training GuideHOWEVER, the reviews were very contradictory and seems to convince readers into buying ""specialty"" tools made by the author or some specific lock maker with tools up to $300.TL:DR; For Power-drilling through locks, a certain sized drill-bit is required and long enough to go ""almost"" straight through. The Idea is to destroy how it can ""ID"" a key. I won't spoil too much of the fun of breaking through locks this way, as the book explains it more thoroughly in context and technique.LOVE THIS BOOK.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8QXHDWM57IF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071448292#wasThisHelpful","R1D8QXHDWM57IF","A2JWF9IG8PJAOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JWF9IG8PJAOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Used this with:AMACO 25 -Pound Air Dry Clay, Moist, White (Water-based clay)Sargent Art Plastilina Modeling Clay, 5-Pound, Cream (Oil-based Clay)Favorite tool in the bag is the Knife Shaped one. Good for puttying and shaping features.Some of the tools look like it came right out of factory and into the packaging so there is some loose wood shavings and some parts like the ""Fork"" one has ~1mm wood splinters still between the forks.

"Non-Air Dry Polymer Clay. Each ""Slab"" is roughly 1 pound.$16.56 for this pack of 5 pounds so roughly ~$3.31 per pound.Was by far the cheapest and most Well-reviewed clay I could find on Amazon.PROS:-At roughly ~$3.12 per pound.-Easy to use right out of the plastic Bag.-Really mud rock hard when room temperature cold.-Good for imprinting without dirtying or damaging the object.-Almost similar to earthquake clay (stuff used to prevent objects from sliding during earthquakes)-Works with wood and metal tools.-Easy to sculpt with.CONS:-The longer you use it, the softer it gets. The more kneading, sweat from hands, and application of body heat causes the clay to become soft like cookie dough.-TO Quickly set the clay to ""re-harden"" so it's not cookie dough soft, it needs to be chilled (i.e. in a freezer or with Ice in a bag), or some way to let it sit in a cool place. The polymer clay won't turn to stone but will ""set"" itself to its mud rock hard touch.FINAL THOUGHTS:-A completely different clay compared to water based clays. No silicone dust flying around and no loss of clay when being worked with.-Almost like Silly putty but much denser and harder.My Actual usage was to use this stuff in Resin Casting. The polymer clay helps reduce water-damage and clean up when Rubber casting the objects with this polymer based clay. Stuff works wonderfully well. FYI, I still need to use Mold Release Spray, it is a necessity regardless of what clay I use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P1327TJ54C2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FR7TR1O#wasThisHelpful","R2P1327TJ54C2M","A2JWF9IG8PJAOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JWF9IG8PJAOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ingenious Design!This is the 1735790 Ultra Fine Tip: BLACKAll Sharpies have a cap to prevent the small felt tip from drying out. So I was puzzled about this but having a retractable tip is great as I don't have to constantly pop off the cap. The old version had such a tight cap, I had to use two hands to pop them open.There is a little circle plastic flap in the inside that seals the felt tip from exposure to the outside air.When the retractable pen tip is protracted, the mechanism causes the circle flap to retrace while protracting the felt tip.This ensures that the tip is not damaged from long term clicking or over-clicking miss-use.For $15.91 for 12 of the black Ultra fine tips, this was a moderately better deal over the newer Pen Stylos which cost almost $2 each.The old trusty standard of pop-caps go for around $7.49 for 12 making it much cheaper but the extra cost for the retractable function is worth the price.As always, Sharpies can be written on anything. I use Acetone to wash the Sharpie off of Glass or Impermeable Surfaces.There is Bleed through.Notable points of where it bleeds is the first time the tip touches the paper making a circle blot and anytime the felt tip goes through a slow drag across paper. This will be noticeable on the back side of the paper.Though this may depend on the thickness of paper and how much pressure is applied when writing.Highly suggest testing the Pen on a scrap piece of paper before using it as a main pen.I highly recommend this and will be buying more if I run out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROV6261IT7GX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017DBK0S#wasThisHelpful","ROV6261IT7GX7","A2JWF9IG8PJAOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JWF9IG8PJAOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The trio is excellent, Vicente Archer on bas and the incredible Damion Reid on drums, was recorded life in the famous Capitol studios with this usual musicians in his previous trio albums. He play songs of Radiohead, Joni Mitchell , John Legend … and his own compositions, but ant the end is the same, the sound is the Glasper sounds. He is a great piano player but for me is more important that is completely different to the rest of the piano player. A exceptional live album.

Instead if you are locking for other class of jazz forget it. The album is  a exploration of the real meaning of jazz. Fantastic. I know that you can't find good critics, but I can't understand this. For me is one of the finest jazz live albums of this year. Try to hear it and give  you opinion. Is another great jazz adventure . I love it. This is not a free jazz album, is  a incredible jazz music session.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZJAPFVTCHW2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIOZS5Q#wasThisHelpful","R2ZJAPFVTCHW2O","ALQ12GYW884EJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ12GYW884EJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since 1992 Lloyd had edited his music in ECM but this new album is from Blue Note but this no mean that his music have changed-This is a very lyrical and emotive suite that in certain way is a a total looking back to old influences, oriental  music, lyrical jazz…and many more. If you see the musicians you can understand more what I say. Joe Sanders and bass, Gerald Cleaver on drums, Gerald Clayton on piano, all of them, great jazz musicians, but also includes Sokratis Sinopulos in lyra and Miklos Lucaks on Cymbalon. Orient and occident. He is now in the top of his game, technically and sentimental. This is a live recording in Wroclaw on november 2013, the sound is very good and the production too /(Don Was). The suite have a VI movements and are really good., more of 70 minutes of pure Charles Lloyd, of all kind the Charles Lloyd of his history. Very nice to hear and very exiting. Lloyd still on great conditions, less abstract than in his ECM period but great,  in fact a masterpiece","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK9A5NCT9EH3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSGLIB8#wasThisHelpful","RK9A5NCT9EH3C","ALQ12GYW884EJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ12GYW884EJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cassandra come back to his best. In this album she re-invented some all the best material of Billie Holiday. The title of the CD is the english title of the ancient Egyptian ""Book of the Dead""and is a memorial to the deep feeling of Cassandra to the work of Billie. Is a fantastic album and the better thing, that you didn't find canonic versions, you hear the real spirit of Holliday today. Lady Day still live trough this versions. This isn't a standard version, is much more. Cassandra sing incredible and the musicians are great. Produced by Nick Launay, the eternal producer of Nick Cave with the rhythm section of Bad Seeds, T Bone Burnett and the incredible string arranged of Van DYke Parks.Is a jazz album with no exactly jazz musicians. I love the album, love the voice and the way that she spell every words of the songs. Great¡¡¡. Direct from the heart to the darknessPS.

"Here come again the incredible atmospheres of Dalvid Sylvian. This is a ""spoken word "" CD. The words came from one of my favorites american poet in this moments; Franz Wright, more exactly from ""Kinderstotenwald"" from 2011. He put also the voice. Strange beauty, something between light and dark. The sound is the elegant sound make for David Sylvian with Christian Fennesz on guitar and John Tilbury on additional piano. Is only one 63 minutes theme, but for me, fantastic. I know this is no a record for big audience, but is fascinating. It's not obscure music, is another thing.

"This box contains two albums, Torture Garden and Leng Tch'e. For me this two albums are the best from Naked City. Extremes, violence, with a incredible artwork. 20th years after are even better. Is not only music, is a life experience. The 32 minutes of Leng Tch'e are incredible, brutal, magic. Is the sound of terror. After hear this music probably you live will change forever. Never before Bill Frisell was so intensive and brutal. After this all the rash album are simple games. Torture Garden is the typical Nacked City with 42 tracks combing free jazz, bepbop, funk, rokabilly, surf, metal... a great album, this edition some extra material from another Naked City album, ""Grand Guiñol"" . This black box is necessary to understand the music today, but take care is excessive for to many people, like the art cover. If you don't have yet please buy it as soon as you can.PS.

Mike Patton, John Medesky (great), Trevor Dunn and Joey Baron. Like te others one is a mix between heavy-music and some gotic things. This one is more near to King Crimson music, but for me is too simple. The people who loves ""In sacred Blood"" will be appasionate to this one. The sound is great if you play a full volume but all the metaphisic about templar is nasty.

The musician are Bill Frisell, John Medeski, Kenny Wollesen, Carol Emanuel, Bridges Kibbet and Al Uroski. The combination of instruments is very special and the music too. Transmigration of a Magus is a memorial tribute to Lou Reed but have nothing to do with Reed music, but is ok. Fisell and Medeski are great, and compositions also.

Is the beginning of Jarret and this group, there is only  3 albums with this trio,just before his first record with his American Quartet, with Dewey Redman. Is a typical concert of this time. Jarret play piano, flute,percussion  and soprano saxophone. Paul Motian drums and percussion and Haden double bass. Is a live recording by NDR, june 1972 in Hamburg. I personally love this period, is  very open to many influences. The recording is great Except two songs, one from Margor Jarret and one for Charlie Haden, the beautiful Song for Che, the rests are composition of Jarret, there is not standards. A very good album that bring me sounds for another times. Is a pleasure for Jarret fans and also for people that did not discover yet this trio.

Like his previous album the music is pure bop or hard bop, but in a modern way. Is a combination of same standars and own material , but sound fresh and new. I think this album is great, a really pleasure to hear. Jazz on his better version. Pure and simply. In this album he introduced some electrics touch but in essential is acustic.

Is a great solo concert in a Cathedral, in live concert will be perfect, for sure, but not to hear in one recording of this, is more difficult.

Even the solo sax album from Sonny Rollins is hard to listen, this is not so hard but is boring. You can hear two o for themes but no more.

Costello have fund a great bunch of musicians, who's also compose some themes for put new music to old songs. Now is very simple to know that Dylan is a great poet, and Costello and the band are a big composers. Is great idea but risky, thanks a Allen Trousseau this mixture is possible.

Is not coincidence that this guys are interesred in the music of Jimmy Giuffre, like Dave Douglas, or Charles Mingus, like this new generation of jazz player. Each new record of Ron Miles is a gift for the audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226YKOUIAVHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOLOJRS#wasThisHelpful","R226YKOUIAVHF","ALQ12GYW884EJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALQ12GYW884EJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A boy with Down's Syndrome is found drowned.  Was it an accident?  Did one of the child's parents kill him?  Or is there some other explanation?Inspector Sejer takes hold of this one like a dog with a bone between its teeth, and holds on until what happened finally becomes clear.  This is a far less complicated procedure than in most of his cases, but ""less complicated"" doesn't mean easy.  The investigation is in large part psychological, as the Inspector peels back the personalities involved like so many onions.  The solution becomes clearer as we move on, but even so I could not put this novel down until I finished it.  As ever, Karen Fossum's writing (and its translation) is real pleasure to read: precise and convincing.

"This biography of Pope Francis explores his stunning worldwide impact, but it also a portrait ""warts and all"", making it far more interesting than a simpler story would be.  Before reading a biography (particularly a popular biography) one should ask who wrote it.  The answer here is reassuring.  The author, an internationally respected British journalist, has decades of experience covering many issues including religion.  This is is his second book on the Pope.  The first, ""Pope Francis: Untying the Knots"" came out in 2013, less than six months after the Pope's election. The first eight chapters of this book update the earlier work  (those who have read it, please take note) : the last nine chapters are new material.Vallely begins with the Argentine background of the Pope (then Jorge Bergoglio), through his entry into the Jesuit order, and then to Bergoglio's rapid rise and chequered career in the Jesuit order in Argentina.  Two major issues arise in regard to that.  First, and most widely discussed, Bergoglio was suspected of being involved in the kidnapping of two Jesuits by Argentina's dictatorial government in the 1970's.  Vallely argues convincingly that the accusation was not justified, but does suggest that Bergoglio's relationship with the dictatorship caused him great anguish.  Second, Bergoglio became a divisive figure in the Jesuit order in Argentina, because of his lack of enthusiasm for the stress on social justice that had become a central thrust of the order.  In consequence, he was removed from his office in the order, and did not return to the forefront of religious life until he became Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992. These two crises, Vallely argues, led to a period of spiritual struggle for Bergoglio, out of which he emerged a changed man.  He has always been noted for humility in external matters, but Vallely believes that he became far less authoritarian and far more socially-oriented.  Very few people really learn from their mistakes: the Pope seems to be one who has.The second part of the book looks at what Francis has accomplished -- and failed to accomplish -- since assuming the Papacy.  Here, Vallely shows that the record is mixed.  When he came to office, the Church faced two great scandals.  Francis has had great success in cleaning up the first of these --  the Vatican's finances and financial institutions, a morass that other Popes have been unable to drain.  He has accomplished much less in dealing with the issue of sexual abuse of children by priests and other religious.  That, and the Pope's less than convincing efforts to reach out to women as a group, are treated by Vallely as major failure. More broadly, Francis' clear intent is to create Church that is more open, more approachable, and more focussed on the poor than the one he inherited.  Here, it is too soon to say whether he has succeeded or failed, but the effort is inspiring.  He is trying to reform the Curia, the Vatican bureaucracy that has become a bastion of self-interest.  He is trying to reflect the fact that most Catholics are no longer European in the leadership of the Church.  He is trying to focus the Church more on mercy, outreach, and help for the poor, and less on doctrine.  This does not, as many liberals would like to think, mean that the Pope is about to change Church teachings on key social issues, but it does mean that he wants to see them approached in a different way -- as occasions of mercy, rather than condemnation.Overall, the Pope is presented as a remarkable person -- not a simple person, but one who has learned from his mistakes, and who is using his extraordinary political gifts to serve a program that is aimed at making Catholicism more embracing, more vibrant, and more focussed on making life better for the poor.  Though I am not a Catholic (I am not even religious) I found this to be an inspiring book: it made my admiration for the Pope seem much more firmly based.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N30HFVQ9UY87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZITTTZK#wasThisHelpful","R1N30HFVQ9UY87","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rate a thriller at five stars?  That's something I almost never do, but this one is different.  To begin with, it's a terrific thriller -- briskly paced, well plotted, with an unusual twist at the end.  The story, the second available in English from this Finnish author, is set in a northern Finnish city: the backdrop, in particular the influence of climate, is vividly realized.  Most of the characters are interesting and highly individualized (if not always highly likable).  The central character is both convincing and appealing.  And the writing/translation is supple and clear.But what gets it that fifth star is something that puts it beyond the usual thriller -- the central theme is right out of today's headlines, and it is treated brilliantly.  That theme is refugee immigration into Europe, and the book gives us a 360 degree view of the issue.  Our heroine is herself a refugee, though highly ""Finnicized"", her family having fled to Finland during the Balkan wars of the 1990's.  The most obvious suspect is a Pakistani in Finland illegally, while a group of suspects who emerge gradually are members of a Muslim gang.  Some of the native Finns are friendly to immigrants, while others are strongly anti-immigrant.  And neither immigrants nor anti-immigrants are treated as being entirely good or bad, entirely right or wrong, or at all homogenous.  This gave me an inside view of what large-scale Muslim immigration into Europe is like, from the point of view of the immigrants and from the point of view of the native-born.  That's a lot more complexity, and a lot more insight, than Iusually get from a thriller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OS7ZB7FQ8NVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2K5TX6#wasThisHelpful","R1OS7ZB7FQ8NVH","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This gorgeous book surveys a very specific subgenre of photography -- photographic series based on road trips through America.  It starts off with a short history of the American road, an even shorter history  than I realized.  At the start of the twentieth century, the road system had fallen into disuse (over 90% of intercity roads were unpaved) because of the dominance of trains. But as the auto came into use, the road trip came into being, and almost from the start photography was a key part of the road trip.  The pictures in the early part of the book are fascinating, as is the history of the American road, and the American road trip.The heart of the book, however, is the central section, which shows road trip photographs by 19 highly accomplished photographers.  It tells us a little about each photographer, talks about each road trip, and then shows the pictures.  Some of the photographers are giants in the field: the presentation starts with a group of photographs from Robert Frank's iconic ""The Americans"", proceeds through Lee Friedlander and Garry Winograd, and moves on to Ryan McGinley.  Some are perhaps less well known -- at least they were to this reader -- but their work is stunning.  Most of the photographers are American, but not not all of them, and a few are women.  Having seen their work in this book, there are several photographers whose work I want to investigate further, especially Alec Soth and Taiyo Onorato+Nico Krebs.And the book is definitely more than the sum of its part.  Earlier photographers have influenced later ones, but the overall determinant is the American road, that great fact and great metaphor.  Since we retired a decade ago, my husband and I have taken many road trips, all over the U.S.  I suppose that part of what we were doing was looking for America.  So are the photographers whose work is shown in this book, and their visions are unforgettable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ZYIICUFP24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597112402#wasThisHelpful","R5ZYIICUFP24","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Margo Jefferson's ""Negroland"" is a fascinating book that works on several levels -- social history, current politics, and the evolution of one  person's identity over time.  Often, two or even all three of these levels are in operation at once.  That  interplay gives the book a haunting resonance, and draws the reader in (this reader, anyway) as one would be drawn into a novel.  Moreover, I thought the book was beautifully written.  The writing is exquisitely precise at times, impressionistic and seemingly diffuse at others.  Taken as a whole, however, the book adds up  to a compelling exploration of an extraordinary woman's experience.The first thing this book does is to look at how people lived in a narrow subset of American society at a particular time: the black upper middle class in the 1950's and 1960's.  Perhaps a particular place should be added - Chicago - but what's most clearly drawn are class and race differences.  These people were top layer of an ethnic group that was at the low end of the American social scale, and held on to that positions with an extraordinary amount of discipline.  It was far more ""comfortable"" to grow up as Margo Jefferson than as most other African American children in the period, but it was not necessarily any easier.  She shows this in a multitude of ways, some very funny, some heart-breaking.The next thing that happens, of course, is that time moves on, throwing Ms. Jefferson into the racial and gender turmoil of the 1960's and 1970's.  All of a sudden, her careful, successful ""Negroland"" background was judged by many of her peers to be inauthentic, adopted, ""not black enough"".  It was difficult enough to be a young white woman in the period, when lots of things you'd be brought up to believe turned out not to be so at all.  Being a young black woman, Ms. Jefferson makes clear, was a whole lot harder.  Even feminism, which was important to her, would be  judged by others on the basis of race.And through the whole social/political progression runs the memoir of an individual.  Race is an inescapable part of that, since race necessarily affects so much that she experiences.  But race affects different people in different ways.  For example, Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ms. Jefferson both suffered from racism, but they are wildly different people, and write about race in wildly different ways.  Ms. Jefferson's book is less dramatic, and less incendiary.  For me, however, it was just as compelling an experience of seeing the world through someone else's eyes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB14V5W9YC4K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307378454#wasThisHelpful","RB14V5W9YC4K2","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a useful and interesting book, if you are looking for a survey of what recent archaeological findings tell us about the state of the Mediterranean world in the second half of the second millennium B.C.E.  As an explanation of why so many cultures fell into crisis around the same time, however, I found it less satisfactory.  Very little in history, of course, is simple, and to look for a single cause for this series of events is to oversimplify.  Several factors were involved, which the author discusses.  It seems to me, however, that he doesn't really attempt to rank order these causes, turning instead to the ""perfect storm"" metaphor.  Also, I wonder if his globalization comparison is really valid, given the small share of consumption that would have been accounted for by foreign trade in what was after all a primitive agricultural economy.  Climate change, his discussion hints, might have been at least a very major cause.  I should like to have seen that addressed in more detail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDJN5YQG3BFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691168385#wasThisHelpful","RPDJN5YQG3BFI","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was something of a disappointment to me, at least compared to several other of Ms. Armstrong's works.  Some of her books have been very important to me, offering understanding, knowledge, and even enlightenment.  This one, however, falls short of her best efforts, perhaps because it attempts so much.  The problem is not the quality of Ms. Armstrong's research or clarity.  In discussing the evolution of four major religious/philosophical traditions (the Indian, the Chinese, the Judaic, and the Greek) in the centuries around 500 BC, she imparts an enormous amount of information without overloading or confusing the reader.  Rather, it seems to me that she tries to force what she is telling us into a pre- determined conclusion; that religion in general in this period moved away from violence and towards compassion.  Certainly, this pattern did appear in the emergence of Buddhism, in some Hebrew texts, and in some strains of Chinese thought.  But other, contradictory elements were there as well, and the compassion she finds in Chinese thinking seems very different to me from the compassion of Buddhism, or from contemporary developments in Judaic thought -- let alone what was happening in Greece.  This is an interesting and instructive book, but it lacks for me the depth of some of her other works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388NU5C75U78O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385721242#wasThisHelpful","R388NU5C75U78O","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second of Gunnar Staalesen's Varg Veum novels, and dates back to 1979.  It shows its age, but it's also a fairly compelling read.  First the negative.  The writing reminds me a lot of  Raymond Chandler and other Americans of the noirish private eye school.  At times the urban gloom and the hero's downbeat cynicism reads almost like parody.  That could be a trick of translation, but it seems more like an influence not yet fully digested, and it makes 1979 feel even further back than it was.  On the positive side, however, the novel is a good read, and the story draws one in.  The further on you get, the more it emerges that things are not what they seem, and that the character who drives the plot has as many layers as an onion.

"This textbook on the history of the English language focusses more on the language than on the history.  That is, the key approach, particularly in the sections on early and middle English, is linguistic analysis that examines the way in which the language worked in various periods, not the broader historical context in which it developed.  This is a textbook, and the focus on the ""facts"" of the language may be ideal for those who want to construct a course which will shed a lot of light on linguistics in general, as well as on the development of English in particular.  For a general reader, however -- at least for this general reader -- the focus on linguistics makes the book less interesting than some other works in the field.  I found Baugh's ""A History of the English Language"" considerably more rewarding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0ZEB9BK2N2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=015507055X#wasThisHelpful","R3J0ZEB9BK2N2I","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a well-plotted, well-written, and well-translated Norwegian crime novel that kept me turning the pages, and delivered a big surprise at the end.  Staalesen wrote his first Varg Veum novel in the 1970's, and the series has been going strong since then (at least in Norwegian: at present only five of the sixteen novels in the series appear to be available in English).  This, the fourteenth entry in the series, was released in 2010.  It begins with a bang: the hero is sitting beside the hospital bed of his unconscious and gravely injured girlfriend, blaming himself for her predicament.  How did things get to this point?  That question is the engine that drives the story, and it works like a charm.  We are presented with a cast of dour Norwegian characters with lots of old history connecting them, and with a very modern dispute about a wind farm, with personal and political ramifications.  All of this unfolds in the vividly evoked landscape of western Norway, lonely and sea swept, but so interesting that I found myself checking out locations on Wikipedia.  This is the first Varg Veum novel I have read, though I have seen some of the TV movies.  It certainly won't be the last -- I just purchased ""Cold Hearts"" -- and I very much hope that more are translated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K09VF4JSOEMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2K5U2G#wasThisHelpful","R2K09VF4JSOEMT","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is part of what really is a revolutionary approach to health care as the end of life approaches -- treat the patient, not the disease.  Doctor Volandes wants patients and their doctors to think about the health care they want when an illness reaches the point where a cure is unlikely.  The way he wants patients to think about it is by learning what various alternative kinds of care entail, and by talking about what they want -- openly and honestly, with their loved ones and their doctors.  Do they want medical professionals to ""do anything""?  Do that want some support of functions that are failing, but not the most drastic?  Or do they want comfort care, in which everything possible is done to eliminate pain and discomfort, but in which drastic measures are not taken.If no decision is made, Dr. Volandes points out, the medical default is to do anything to keep the patient alive; that's what medical ethics call for unless the patient orders otherwise, and that's how the system works.  Allowing this to happen, or in fact deciding to ""do anything"" often has nothing to do with treating the illness itself, but consists of  treating the conditions that arise from it -- CPR when the heart stops, a ventilator when breathing fails, a feeding tube when the patient cannot eat.  These may prolong life, but the quality of life that results can be miserable.  For those who are already at that point, or who have loved ones at that point, these are decisions that need to be made, or the default will apply.  Some may in fact choose the ""do anything"" option: that's their choice.  But many others will choose not to accept drastic treatment, and will focus instead on care that keeps the comfortable.  These are choices that need to be considered, and communicated clearly before a crisis arises.For those of us who are not ill, but who are getting on, these are also choices that should be considered and communicated.  If nothing else, it can spare our loved ones a great deal of anguish when our time comes.  Dr. Volandes way of doing this is what he calls ""The conversation"".  He provides ways of approaching this, and he also talks about ways of communicating one's wishes once choices have been made -- living wills, health care proxies, and so on and so forth.This is a compassionate ""how to"" guide to making -- and communicating! -- choices that older people should make.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L6KV953A136Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620408546#wasThisHelpful","R3L6KV953A136Y","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is superb, both for the pictures and for the text.  The illustrations  span Hirschfeld's whole career, from the 1920's to the 2000's -- they are brilliantly chosen, and beautifully reproduced.  But the text is just as good, reflecting the author's long and close relationship with Hirschfeld, and his unparalleled access to the artist's material.  The stories behind the pictures bring the times in which they were drawn to life, and remind us that Hirschfeld was an extraordinary person as well as an extraordinary artist.  He was something of a Zelig in the New York arts scene for over 50 years -- he seems to have known everyone, and been close friends with many of them -- but unlike Zelig he recorded his impressions and indeed shaped the world he drew.  This is a wonderful way of looking at a special kind of history -- the history of the theater -- in a very special place, New York in the 20th century.  For those who are in the city, do make an effort to see the exhibit on which this book is based: it's at the New York Historical Society until October 12.

"I didn't give this book five stars because I agree entirely with Mr. Coates, nor because I understand entirely what he says,  nor because this was an ""enjoyable"" read -- I'm a 70 year old white American woman, and the odds on my smiling through this book are low.  Rather, I gave it five stars because it made me see the world, for a little while and in part, through the eyes of a black man in America today.  Whether or not I agree with everything he says isn't the point.  The point is that that's the way he sees the world, and he cites compelling external factors that  made him see it that way too.  At first it's a kind of thought experiment -- how would I feel if I had grown up subject to random violence from the authorities?  To disrespect in school?  To knowing I had to protect myself at all costs?  Then, as Mr. Coates piles on the evidence, it gets to be less of a thought experiment, and more of a statement of fact.  The book echos and amplifies the national recognition that there is something basically wrong with the way black people are treated by the justice system (and what about the educational system, the economic system, system after system?)  Mr. Coates is a powerful writer, and his book helped me to see American racism as something that remains pervasive, however many comforting stories we may tell ourselves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250ZGW6Y3LVU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEFAIRI#wasThisHelpful","R250ZGW6Y3LVU9","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a compassionate, approachable discussion of the branch of medicine focussed on treating dying patients, making them more comfortable as they near the end of life, rather than on trying to treat their illnesses in the hope of a cure.  It is written for medical professionals, but I am not a medical professional, and I found it very informative.  The first section discusses the way in which the development of modern medicine has changed the profession's approach to treating the dying: much of the change has been positive, but some of it has actually made things much harder for the dying and for those who love them.  The author then discusses the growth of the hospice movement, and the development of palliative care as a speciality within that movement.  Then, he discusses the issue of determining how long someone is likely to live, a critical issue in deciding -- and in helping them decide -- how they should be cared for.  Then he moves on to question of symptom management, stressing that what matters here is how the patient experiences the symptoms, and what that patient wants out of treatment.  The next section, on pain management, contains a lot of very specific medical information, but laypeople who are caring for dying loved ones often become (and need to become) surprisingly expert in these matters.  This section may be somewhat out of date, but it will at least suggest questions to ask.  The next section covers management of non-pain symptoms, and the balance of the book discusses broader issues involved in palliative care.Throughout the book, the focus is patients' needs. The author's approach is humane, open-minded, and oriented to effective reseults.  Dr. Hallenbeck clearly believes that listening is a key skill, and has as clearly listened carefully to his patients, and learned a great deal from them.  That orientation has a lot to do with making this book a positive one to read, as well as a source of a great deal of useful information.  From other reviews, it seems that medical professionals find it very useful.  So too did this non-professional -- so much so,  that it will affect the choices I make when I am next responsible for the care of a dear one who is dying, and when my own time comes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZAGV8BKCPKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7TCV74#wasThisHelpful","R34ZAGV8BKCPKQ","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The latest entry in the long-running Temperance Brennan series was a pleasant surprise for me.  I had been moaning and groaning about the series getting tired, but this novel has a plot that kept me turning the pages, and that's what a mystery novel is supposed to do.  The story starts out with the appearance of a ""web sleuth"" -- one of a band of internet crime aficionados, who try to solve unsolved crimes, locate missing persons, and so on and so forth.  The web sleuth wants Tempe's help in finding out what happened to a missing girl.  Tempe, of course, joins in, and the search leads to mysterious byways (physical and psychological) and of course to more murders.  And Tempe's personal life keeps on ticking through all of this: suffice it to say that Ryan is back in the picture.  After reading this I realized that the plot reached Scandinavian levels of bizarre motivation and improbable events, but what the hey, I love Scandinavian mysteries too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAP70HC6VLXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345544048#wasThisHelpful","R2QAP70HC6VLXD","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a middling Tempe Brennan novel: it's good enough to keep a committed reader of the series happy for a few hours, but not good enough to make the reader forget just how long she has been reading these novels.  Tempe's personal life is always of interest (that's certainly one thing that keeps me hooked) and remains tempest-tossed in this installment, with her daughter off to serve in Afghanistan, her ex-husband sniffing round, and her mother gravely ill.  But that doesn't keep her away from the matter at hand -- bones.  This installment sets off with two sets of bones, one belonging to an unclaimed dead girl left by the side of the road, and another to a group of (a new note, here) mummified dogs.  The plot, of course, thickens, leading Tempe into a series of parallel investigations at home, and to another investigation in -- Afghanistan.  (Yes, the Afghan interlude does feel a bit imposed).  All the loose ends come together at the end, also of course.  That's the product as expected, but the author sometimes seems to be getting a little mechanical in producing it.  The short, incomplete sentence is overused, and some of the suspense seems manufactured (will Tempe's daughter call her?).  It seems unfair to complain; the umpteen novels in this series have given me a lot of pleasure.  But the same old, same old isn't quite so satisfying the upmteenth time around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LGKYNOUO2C52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A285AE6#wasThisHelpful","R2LGKYNOUO2C52","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the seventh entry in the Detective Inspector Huss series, and is good enough to keep me on the alert for the eighth, due in English late this year.  Irene Huss is still an engaging character.  Indeed, I find more and more that her personal and family life is what keeps me reading, rather than the mystery.  This time, Irene's daughters are leaving home, her mother is failing, her husband has had to cut back his work, and her dog is not well.  She, however, continues to manage, and to remain relatively cheerful -- a bright spot in the general gloom of Swedish policiers.

"This book is an invaluable guide to deciding on how to care for we love as they approach death, and to thinking about (and planning for) our own deaths.  I first read it back in the 1980's, and found it both fascinating and frightening.  Dr. Nuland illustrated very clearly that most of us are unlikely to go gentle into that good night, and discussed very movingly how that fact conditions the choices we will have to make .  At the time, however, this did not seem terribly relevant to me -- I was, after all, just moving into middle age.  . Now, however, I am over 70, and it is an extraordinarily relevant book.  Last month, I reread it in the revised edition, as a dear friend for whom I have been responsible came to the end of her life.  I only wish that I had read it earlier in this process.  What Dr. Nuland said in the 1980's, and again in the 1990's, is still true.  All too often, the American medical system still  doesn't recognize that some illnesses cannot be cured.  A dying patient may be subjected to procedure after procedure, and treatment after treatment, in a vain effort to avoid the inevitable.  Hospice may not be called in until the very end, because the doctors and the patient and the patient's family are still focussed on treating the illness rather than the patient.  The result is pain, discomfort and disorientation that might have been avoided.  Had I realized just how entrenched this bias still is, I would have insisted that chemotherapy be cut off sooner than it was, and that my friend go on hospice sooner than she did.  For the future, this book -- and my recent experience -- convince me that if I am diagnosed with a cancer that is likely to kill me, I will enlist a palliative care doctor on my medical team from the start.  I only hope that I will find one with a fraction of Dr. Nuland's empathy and understanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJI9U863T1PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBAD1BI#wasThisHelpful","RKJI9U863T1PJ","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me this book is structured more like music than like prose -- a set of variations on the theme of time, not a novelistic examination of the topic.  Lightman's ""hero"" is the young Einstein, living in Bern in 1905, working in a patent office but spending all his energies on his theory of relativity. But it isn't Einstein's daytime life that is the subject of this book, though that is touched on in a prologue,  three interludes, and an epilogue.  Rather, what matters here are thirty chapters showing us thirty different dreams that Einstein has about time.  These explore different ways in which time might work, and the ways in which people would react under those assumptions, and they are altogether delightful.  Some read like visions, some like the premises of sci-fi stories, some like -- dreams.  The writing is beautiful, highly concrete about physical detail and more than occasionally witty, both of which help anchor these visions.  I don't have the scientific knowledge to appreciate some of what is going on -- some of the different varieties of time, I am told, reflect thinking about relativity and other great matters.  But I didn't need it to enjoy this book a great deal.  Those who love Calvino's ""Invisible Cities"" may be particularly entranced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GNA9YP04235X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JHYS4E#wasThisHelpful","R2GNA9YP04235X","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Read the title of this book carefully, because the book is just what the title says.  It is not a book about historical linguistics,  it is a book about the history of languages, placed firmly in the framework of political and social history.  The book proceeds to discussion of how language itself might have evolved, through the identification of language families, through the development of individual languages, and finally to what the future might hold.  The author is notably balanced in his approach, and modest in his claims.  Overall, the focus is on European languages and on English in particular, but there is enough discussion of other languages and language groups to make this a more general approach than one often sees.  One very strong point is the style.  It is accessible and well-written, which makes it a pleasant read for the non-student even though it is clearly a textbook.  And it avoids the ""acadamese"" that has become a curse in so much serious writing about the humanities.  I didn't enjoy this book as much as ""Empires of the Word"", which covers much of the same ground, but that may be because that was a book written for popular consumption, and this is au fond a text.

"An interesting and instructive book, but one that falls short of what I was hoping for, on two counts.  First, as noted by another reviewer, the maps are too small.  Some of that reflects the fact that I am an older person with older eyes, but even when I put on 3X glasses and used a magnifying glass there were many maps where I missed a lot of detail.  There are reasons why many atlases are oversized.  Second, also as noted by another reviewer, this is definitely the 20th century as seen from Britain.  There are some maps of areas outside the British Isles (several of which deal with former colonies) but the focus is resolutely British.

"This novel was something of a disappointment to me, but not enough of a disappointment to turn me off on the series. ""The Disappeared"" is number three in Ohlsson's Fredrika Bergman/Alex Recht series, and I was eagerly looking forward to it, having found ""Silenced"" in particular a very compelling read.  ""The Disappeared"" shares some of the positives of the earlier novels -- a high and sustained level of suspense, well rounded and (in some cases!) very likable characters, and a fluent writing style.  But the improbability that occasionally popped up in the earlier novels swings into high gear in this entry.  There are too many coincidences, too many links between the case and the investigators' private lives, and too many really bad people in really high places.  By the time it was over my interest had descended to the level of ""OK, what's she going to come up with next"".  It's not that expect Scandinavian mysteries to present a totally realistic portrait of modern day Scandinavian society: a lot of what's enjoyable in mystery fiction is having ""the evil in our midst"" identified, apprehended, and taken out of circulation.  But the suspension of the will to disbelieve, for me at least, has limits.  Now, all that said, I am still looking forward to reading the latest installment in the series, ""Hostage"".

"Settle down for a compulsive read, but be ready to ignore that ""could this really happen?"" feeling as the novel progresses.  This is the second of Kristina Ohlsson's Fredrika Bergman/Alex Recht novels, and it is a very good mystery indeed.  The plot pulled me in right from the start --  did the elderly activist really kill his wife and then himself?  What about their missing daughter, and is there any connection to a hit and run victim found with no identification?  And the plot keeps on pumping, giving us new bits of evidence that reveal an ever widening story, while the author keeps it all comprehensible, and all moving forward. That's what you want from a mystery -- a plot that keeps you reading -- but this novel has a lot more.  The police characters are fully rounded and have complicated personal lives, which affect the way they interact and create even more suspense.  The writing is sharp and accurate, without that muffled sense I sometimes get from translations in this genre.  And I at least really started to care about some of the characters, hoping things would work out for them, yet another incentive to keep on reading.So why the caveat about hard to believe? Lots of Scandinavian mystery fiction demands a major suspension of disbelief.  It resents horrific and baroque crime as something that happens all the time,  but we know that these countries are in the main law abiding (which was what made the Breivik massacres even more horrifying.  That's fine: lots of 20th century British crime fiction made the same demand -- think of the crime rate in the peaceful village of St. Mary Mead!  But Ohlsson demands a LOT of suspension, particularly towards the end of the novel.  I won't say when the ""oh, come on"" reaction began to set in, but it was certainly there.And so much for the caveat.  Hard to believe or not, I am really looking forward to reading number 3 in the series, which is already waiting on my Kindle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DBZFX4EJAPYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J2AS1C#wasThisHelpful","R1DBZFX4EJAPYO","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A few of the stories do hit the bullseye, because they are funny in an offbeat way: Classical was probably my favorite.  Mostly, however, they sort of blend into each other around a basic plot -- guy wants girl, girl rejects guy in an unexpected way.  Also, it's much more about weddings than about being married, which after you have done it for a while is way funnier than the wedding.  Would have left the book about mid-way, but it is so short I finished.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQRPOI4I9ZIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDD8WU6#wasThisHelpful","R3IQRPOI4I9ZIE","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a splendidly chosen selection of war posters, splendidly reproduced.  The first section discusses -- and vividly presents -- the war poster as propaganda, examining its roots in publicity and its use of design.  The next four sections discuss the First World War, interwar Europe, the Second World War, and finally the cold war and the post-cold war wars.  The text is interesting if not ground breaking, but the point here is the pictures.  Was the war poster the iconic art form of the 20th century?

"History depends on how you look at it, and that is something that changes over time and over place.  This book looks at how that has happened in the writing of the seminal event of the 20th Century, World War I -- the Great War.  It is a fascinating exploration for those interested in the War.  More broadly, it is an important book for those who are interested in history in general, showing vividly how much the interpretation of events can change, depending on who is doing the telling, and when the tale is told.The authors, one a Frenchman and one an American, cite the dizzying volume of historical work on the Great War, noting that over 50,000 titles are listed in a French historical library (the Economist magazine cites 25,000 books and articles: maybe that's just in English).  They review this literature longitudinally (over time), by country, and by topic.  The national differences are profound: the consensus of anglophone writers is that the war was a tragedy, but the French view is tends towards a war of national survival.  And the differences over time are profound as well.  In the 20's and 30's, the focus was on the diplomatic and military aspects of the war, with a big contribution from political leaders and generals, pointing out how right they were.  After World War Two, the historian's focus on the Great War shifted to social and economic factors, with a significant Marxist influence.  And in the last few decades, the focus has shifted to cultural and individual topics, including the way in which the  Great War is remembered.  This adds up to a highly illuminating look at how the historical idea of the Great War has evolved -- and will doubtless continue to evolve.But the importance of this book goes beyond an examination of one conflict, no matter how significant.  It is a vivid illustration of the fact that writing history is a process of combining selected pieces of evidence to tell selective stories.  Those stories depend on who is writing the history, on where they are writing it, and on when -- and why -- it is written.  It is too easy for the reader of history to forget that even the most compelling work is a partial view, and that ""what really happened"" can never really be determined.  That's not to say that everything is relative, but in history, most things are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFA4M7X4F5KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3URID0#wasThisHelpful","RTFA4M7X4F5KH","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Was World War I inevitable?  This splendid and readable book argues that it was not, focussing a series of specific policy choices made by individual national leaders in several different countries.  Taken together, these choices unleashed the maelstrom, but Clark suggests that different choices could have been made, and that a different and more peaceful outcome might have followed.This brings us up against two key themes -- or more accurately points of disagreement -- in World War 1 historiography.  First, there's what another reviewer succinctly describes as  the powder keg vs. the match.  The ""powder keg"" view argues that political and economic tensions in Europe in 1914 were so intense that war was inevitable, making the Sarajevo assassination and subsequent events nothing more than a trigger: had they not happened, something else would have done.  The ""match"" view argues that a general European war was not inevitable, which makes Sarejevo very important indeed. Clark argues that the match mattered a great deal, more by detailing what actually did happen than by presenting counter-factuals.  For me, this was a compelling approach.  His detailed presentation of the Balkan situation and of Serbian internal politics is particularly enlightening, suggesting that Austria's response was not as irrational as is often assumed.  And his  discussion of the domestic pressures working on various political leaders taught me a great deal that I did not know.  As well as specific issues  -- he argues that much of the British military establishment saw a European war as something that could stop Home Rule in Ireland  -- he discusses the cultural and even personal pressures that worked on key actors.  Overall, he describes a policy environment in which internal communications were poor and lines of command blurred -- an environment in which mistakes were all too possible.Second, there is question of national war guilt, which has been a central issue ever since the Treaty of Versailles put all of the guilt on Germany.  This was of course a major political issue in the interwar period, which tended to be pushed aside after World War II.  But Fritz Fischer reopened the argument with a bang in 1961;  in ""Germany's Aims in the First World War"", Fischer argued that Germany planned the war as a step towards European domination, making Hitler's policies a continuation rather than an aberration.  The debate that Fischer opened up is still wide open.  Some who disagree with him argue that another country (Russia, or France, or England) bore at least a large part of the responsibility, while others argue that war was triggered by a series of mistakes that left all participants (or no participants) responsible.  All involved have tended to move towards more nuanced points of view, but big differences persist.Clark's title makes it clear where he stands in this debate: ""Sleepwalkers"" argues that the war resulted from mistakes rather than intention, though several national leaders were only too ready to move towards the brink.  The institutional issues are critical here, in that leaders did not have accurate information, and did not communicate clearly, on a national as well as an international level.  Moreover, he describes a situation in which all the major players had belief systems -- different and contradictory belief systems -- which allowed them to convince themselves that highly aggressive actions were in fact defensive.Overall, this is an illuminating and very interesting book.  Any historian of course selects and arranges his evidence, and Clark does so quite brilliantly.  I am not entirely convinced that the war could in fact have been avoided.  But reading this book has certainly shown me how much individual misjudgements and random chance had to do with the war's outbreak,and how much Sarajevo really did matter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27EOIN3QVTU36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061146668#wasThisHelpful","R27EOIN3QVTU36","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This compelling history of the Ottoman Empire's involvement in World War One -- and of the peace that led to the Empire's collapse --  is important not just as history, but as a backdrop to current events.  As history, it is a major achievement, opening a perspective on the war with which I at least was almost totally unfamiliar (barring references to the Treaty of Sevres and to Lawrence of Arabia).Why has so little been written about the Ottoman involvement in World War One?  Western European and American historians have focussed  on the diplomatic lead-up to the war and on the war on the Western front, not surprisingly given the tendency to focus on one's own (or one's country's), point of view.  Beyond that, there are vast troves of material on the War in English, French, and German, and a wide audience for World War One books in countries where those languages are spoken.  Much less has been written from an Ottoman perspective.  Much of the source material is in Turkish or Arabic, not part of most Western historians' toolkits.  And  from a current-day Turkish perspective, the First World War was a prologue to Turkey's definitive war -- the War of Independence from 1919 to 1923, when Turkish forces led by Ataturk defeated the Greek, French and other forces who had invaded.  For many modern day Turks, Ottoman history is barely relevant to the new state founded by Ataturk.This lack of attention has left a significant empty space in popular writing on the First World War , a space which this book admirably fills.  It is meticulously researched, relying extensively on Turkish and Arabic sources, and on a very wide range of other sources as well.  It is admirably clear, with an organization that pulls one steadily forward, and a prose style that makes reading a pleasure.  The author evokes characters and circumstances in a compelling way, particularly given that this is in part a military history.As to conclusions, the author argues  that it wasn't the war that overthrew the Ottomans, it was the peace that followed.  The Treaty of Sevres is best known as the treaty in which the British and French carved up the Middle East; what is less widely understood is that they carved up Turkey as well.  This  finished the Ottomans, and  almost finished the Turkish state as well.  It seems questionable that the the Empire could have survived even given a less draconian treaty -- the Ottoman Empire in Europe was crumbling  before the War, and Arab rebellion became a key factor in Asia during the War -- but the author's case is well put.  Another conclusion is that the Armenian genocide was almost certainly at least in part a deliberate policy of the ""Young Turks"" Ottoman government.  The author's reliance on contemporary sources to demonstrate this is compelling.As to the relevance of this work to today's events, it is direct.  In their post-war division of the Middle East, Britain and France created states that had no relation to ethnic and religious groupings, nor to historical patterns of trade and settlement.  Instead, they suited the interests of the imperial powers.  In the 1950's and 1960's, the colonial lid was replaced by the lid of dictatorial power.  With that removed, religious and ethnic differences are boiling over, with ""states"" that do not have the power, or legitimacy, to impose order.  The past doesn't tell us what to do in future, but it does give strong hints of what not to do.  As we start to do it all over again -----","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3N2XT0AGW95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=046502307X#wasThisHelpful","R2E3N2XT0AGW95","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inspector Irene Huss is one of my favorite cops, and the series of novels about her is one of my favorite mystery series.  This entry, however, was a disappointment.  The plot is intriguing enough, if one is willing to suspend disbelief yet again on the prevalence of criminal mania in Scandinavia.  But in an incident just beyond the middle of the story, the solution to the mystery is presented to us, which takes away from the suspense of the rest of the book.  Also, as another reviewer notes, Irene seems unaccountably careless in this outing, exposing herself and her daughter to unnecessary risks.  On the plus side, Irene remains charmingly un-neurotic; no angst here, which is refreshing to a devotee of this genre.

"This is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time, even if the author's arguments don't always convince me entirely.  But he does attempt an heroic task -- explaining the broadest rhythms of human history -- and he does offer brilliant exposition.  Also, the book is a pleasure to read: Morris is an entertaining and sometimes amusing writer whose prose is refreshingly free of academese.  What's best about the book, I think, is its presentation of history outside the narrow confines in which we in the West tend to think -- ""modern"" European history, i.e. European and North American history since the Renaissance.  Morris shows that other cultures have shown parallel patterns, in the process teaching me a great deal that I did not know about ancient history apart from the Greeks and Romans, and about Chinese history.  The tool that he uses to compare different cultures is an index of social development: he recognizes that there are a whole lot of questions about this, but in general offers it as a very rough and imprecise measure: as a metaphor, I can live with it.  The final section of the book, on where we go from here, was interesting (and scary) though I found it a bit less gripping that Morris's views on where we have been.

"This is broad brush history of the most interested kind, examining how human value systems arose, and what caused them to change.  To survey so wide a scope in such a limited space (this is not a long book) of course risks over-simplification and over-schematization.  But Morris is aware of these risks, and presents a compelling argument despite them.The first part of the book presents Morris's central case: that a human value system reflect the constraints on the society that possesses that value system.  Specifically, he focusses on ""energy capture"" -- how many kilocalories a day the average person in a society can command.  Initially, when humans were hunter/gatherers, this was very low, creating small populations that needed large ranges to feed themselves.  Such cultures tend to be egalitarian and quite violent.  As people gradually domesticated plants and animals, the amount of energy that an individual could command jumped, and the evolution into agrarian societies produced a shift in values, to a more hierarchical and less violent structure.  Finally, when people gained control over fossil fuels, the amount of energy each member of society could command surged again.  The value structure changed rapidly, to a more egalitarian and even less violent model.In the second part of the book, various commentators give their opinions of Morris's arguments.  I was disappointed in this section: many of the arguments seemed to slide by Morris's own case, without much contact.  For example, one commentator proposes a ""real"" value system towards which people strive, without explicitly rejecting Morris's argument that value systems arise from economic and cultural conditions.  Things improve in the final section, in which Morris restates his case, rather more explicitly.This is an odd format, and a short book (particularly given the scope of the subject) but I found it fascinating.  On the strength of that, I am now going to read one of Morris's other books, to see if it is as good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DUX1U9O625I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q0MNEDM#wasThisHelpful","R25DUX1U9O625I","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is classic Kathy Reichs, with Tempe in top form, Ryan ambiguous, and bones accumulating like snow in Boston.  Enough other reviewers have summarized the plot, so I won't bother with that, but this struck me as a particularly good installment.  First, Tempe's constant involvement in crazed serial murder plots may require a suspension of the will to disbelieve, but the more mundane aspects of her life are brilliantly realized -- Reichs is just great at showing how real life works.  For example, Tempe barely mentions that she doesn't drink; something as dramatic as alcoholism has faded into the background.  That's what happens if you stay sober long enough.  Second, Tempe and the characters around her get more and more interesting as time goes by.  In this one, we meet her mother, in a context that touched the heart, and we re-meet her old nemesis ""Skinny"", who gets a lot more rounded.  Finally, this installment has a post-modernist touch I loved.  Tempe, we are told, watches a rerun of ""Bones"".  The character watching the character watching the character -----.

Indeed, I found it so fascinating that I ordered the book from the UK before it was available in the States.  In terms of the author's subject matter, I was not disappointed.  He does indeed examine local cultures that usually pass below the historical radar, most notably Frisia in the early middle ages, but also Flanders under the Dukes of Burgundy, and the Hansa.  And he does argue convincingly that these cultures had an impact on the modernization of European culture.  And, he does tell many interesting stories, and introduce many interesting people.Why then only four stars?  First and foremost, Pye seems to me to overstate the strength of an overriding North Sea culture, and to overstate its impact on European history.  The cultures of the Low Countries and those of Scandinavia were all trading cultures, but that doesn't make them the same thing.  Nor, for me at least, does their financial orientation explain the monetization of European culture nearly as much as Pye suggests -- what about Italian banking?  There is a great deal in this book, but not perhaps as much as the author implies.  Secondly, as another reviewer suggests, the book is repetitive.  Finally, the arguments are not always tight, and some subjects seem to be introduced simply because they are of interest, not because they have that much to do with the subject at hand.Those who are interested in emergence of European culture, particularly in its earlier phases, are likely to enjoy this book.  But be prepared to take it with a grain of salt, and be prepared to skim.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YQJB43ETA3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605986992#wasThisHelpful","R3YQJB43ETA3W","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This third volume of Rick Perlstein's history of the modern American right focusses on 1973 to 1976:  as the title says, from Nixon's downfall to Reagan's near-win at the 1976 Republican convention.  This makes it somewhat less dramatic than ""Nixonland"".  Jerry Ford was a nice guy, but way less fascinating than his precursor, and the national mood was more glum than apocalyptic.  Still, I found this book highly readable, highly evocative of an era, and thoughtful in its analysis of the progress of radical American conservatism.That's my view, but what you think of this book is likely to have a great deal to do with what you bring to it.  That's because the political history of the 1970's isn't history yet, it's still alive and well in today's political divide.  What the reader thinks of Perlstein's characterization of Reagan is likely to have more to do with what the reader thinks of Reagan (a hero of conservatism?  a capitive of the wealthy?)  than with what Perlstein has to say about him.  Perlstein never explicitly says where he's coming from, but it seemed pretty clear to me that his views are a lot closer to those of Barack Obama than to those of today's Republican party.  That said, Perlstein doesn't seem nearly as biased to me as he does to many reviewers -- he is as at least as negative about Jimmie Carter as about Reagan, and seems at time sympathetic to old-line conservatives.All in all, this is an interesting book and a good read.  It reminded me of a lot that I had forgotten (like just how bad New York was) and illuminated some things that I observe today.  ""The Invisible Bridge"" was billed as the last in a trilogy, but Perlstein is reportedly working on a fourth book.  Good!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185OJ20PS1SZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476782415#wasThisHelpful","R185OJ20PS1SZT","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is what a guidebook should be, and it has definitely added a lot to our visit to Oahu.  Unlike too many guidebooks, this one seems thoroughly researched, is helpfully organized, and is easy to use.  To go through the checklist, let's start with orientation.  The book gives a bit of history, and then explains the topography and weather patterns of Oahu, which are really important to the visitor.  Next, what to see.  The book starts with Honolulu, describing neighborhoods, beaches, and cultural/historical sites in detail.  It then goes around the island and does the same -- and all of this is illustrated by well drawn and easy to follow maps.  And ""what to see"" is often ""what to do"", especially in Hawaii.  There are separate sections on beaches, on activities, and on adventures and attractions.  You may find that something you want to do is mentioned at least twice -- once in the regional section, and again under (for example) beaches.  Sounds complex, but the organization works really well.  We didn't use the section on lodging, because we had reserved before we came to Oahu, but the section on dining was comprehensive and, we found, impressively accurate.  We are going to Kauai next week, and will certainly get the Wizard guide.

"This is the fourth in the Officer Gunnhilder series, a series that just keeps getting better.  This entry links two sets of crimes, a series of break-ins by a highly skilled and rather likeable burgler, and a murder of a distinctly unlikeable financier.  His associates -- who may be involved in the murder, or may be slated for murder themselves -- aren't very likable either, but they are interesting.  So, as ever, is Officer Gunnhilder, who continues to soldier on her professional life, while dealing with an ever more complex family situation at home.  In the background, the aftermath of the Icelandic financial crisis is all pervasive, affecting everything from living arrangements to criminal motivations.  The characters are interesting and believeable,  the plot complex but comprehensible and involving, and the Icelandic background deeply interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K7UJUS2A0XTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHK77FI#wasThisHelpful","R2K7UJUS2A0XTH","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As we began two weeks in Hawaii, I wanted to know something about the place I was visiting, and prepared to download Michener's massive opus.  My husband had read and enjoyed that, and found it helpful in understanding Hawaii's history, but I'd been putting it off because it was so big.  Then, in an ABC store in Honolulu, I found a book that looked like exactly what I needed -- and it was.  Phil Barnes short work is well organized, well informed, and (as far as I can tell) very well balanced.  It is also splendidly organized, leading one along in a story in which the U.S. does NOT play a positive role.  Indeed, I had no idea that the US takeover of Hawaii was so crass and so totally opposed to the wishes of the great majority of the population.  Moving forward, the author describes recent political history, the economy, and the emergence of pro-sovreignity sentiment.  Definitely added a dimension to my trip to Hawaii.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBEVK3RHVWBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0912180706#wasThisHelpful","RFBEVK3RHVWBV","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the fourth in an Icelandic series about lawyer Thora Gudmundsdottir, and in my view the best of the lot.  It takes place in the aftermath of Iceland's financial crisis, which affects almost everyone in the novel, including Thora and her rambunctious family.  This isn't a financial thriller, however -- Thora becomes involved in unravelling a horrific crime that took place at a home for mentally disabled people.  In so doing, she learns a lot about such people, and develops real empathy for them.  But as interesting as the background themes may be, it's the story that caught me in this one.  This is one of those mysteries you don't want to put down until you have finished it, because ""whodunnit"" is such a driving force in the story.  I was tempted to give it five stars, but stuck to my four star max for thrillers.

"This isn't an easy novel to get into, but once the story has had time to take hold it blossoms as a really gripping story, beautifully written.  The organizing principal - an astrological procession -- was a major distraction at first: I kept referring back to the list of characters to identify them by their astrological sign and relation to the planetary figures.  Once I got used to it, the astrology faded into the background, as the novel came to the fore.  It is described as a parody of a nineteenth century novel; if so it is a very gentle and admiring one.  For me, it had much of the charm of the genre, with a distinctly moral view (there are good guys and bad guys), melodramatic situations, unanswered questions, an all seeing author, and a complex structure.  I enjoyed reading it very much, but would note that I am a fan of the nineteenth century novel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EUIUDFFPNKIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316074292#wasThisHelpful","R2EUIUDFFPNKIG","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been lured back to the Alex Delaware series by ""Killer"", I moved on to ""Obsession"" and found myself sadly disappointed.  Before getting to the reason why, I should note one major positive.  Like ""Killer"" (and unlike several other fairly recent books in the series), ""Obsession"" does show Alex functioning as a believable psychologist, and it does develop a real relationship between him and his patient, even going into what he tries to do to help her.  But the story seems wrapped up in in talk: events are retailed though long discussions and conversations, characters get blurry, and at times the plot was less than clear.  Also, the violence seems almost gratuitous, and there is a simmering undertone of anger in a lot of the conversation, particularly among the cops.  I'm sure that's realistic, but it's not related to the story, and it gets wearing.  After reading ""Killer"", I was ready to jump back on the Delaware train, but this book doesn't provide much incentive to stay there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NW634I6TPHNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OVLKCM#wasThisHelpful","R3NW634I6TPHNG","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This quick tour of five Scandinavian countries, by a Brit now living in Copenhagen, is an amusing and very informative overview of the Nordics.  Booth's focus is twofold.  First, he challenges an assumption that Scandinavian society is a Nordic paradise without problems.  This seems a rather weak target, particularly here in the United States, where ""Swedish"" can used almost as contemptuously as ""French"", but if we talk just about US lefties it may be a fair target.  Second, he challenges the assumption that all of these countries are pretty much alike, inhabited by tall blonde people with tall tax rates.  Starting with Denmark, and proceeding to Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden, he discusses the characteristics that differentiate societies, and the different economic problems they face.  At the end of the tour, one concludes that even if Scandinavia isn't perfection, it has achieved some admirable social arrangements.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGT5XMILJE9ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JI09FF4#wasThisHelpful","RGT5XMILJE9ZD","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book made me think more than I wanted to, made me ask questions I didn't want to ask, and shifted my view of who we are and where we may be going - rather a lot for a single volume!  Harari's scope is not modest: as the subtitle says, he traces the history of our species from its insignificant beginnings to its current dominance of the planet.  Early on, he puts us in place as part of the animal world, an origin that still explains a great deal of our behavior.  Then, he traces the difference that emerged with the cognitive revolution, the next difference that emerged with our ability to produce food, and the accelerating pace of change ever since.  His discussion of what's normally called history -- i.e., all that stuff that has happened in the last 5,000 years -- falls into broad brush themes rather than into a chronicle of kings and peoples.  He ends with a look forward, which posits the end of Sapiens before very much longer.  Two choices here: an environmental catastrophe that extinguishes us, or a further evolution (biological? cybernetic? both?) into a post-Sapiens human being.This book is not just fascinating, it is brilliantly written, and as absorbing as a good novel.  Harari seems to delight in tweaking the usual view of the way things are, and can do this in a brief phrase, as well as in a chapter.  (The chapter on myth is really challanging for liberal humanists.) There are points with which to take issue: he presents as established fact some things that are still very uncertain in their details (the cognitive revolution, for one), and he can overgeneralize (actually, how could he not, in so concise a work?).  Still and all, this is one of the books that has really affected my view of humanity -- right up there with ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"".  For anyone interested in the human past, I can't recommend it too highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31APOYTGY91F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062316095#wasThisHelpful","R31APOYTGY91F4","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is number four in the Maria Kallio series, and is an interesting, absorbing thriller.  It also shows a continued improvement in the series -- the characters are better developed, the background is more interesting, and the plotting is growing less predictable.  Maria Kallio, for those who do not know her, is the police officer/lawyer heroine of a Finnish series, the earlier installments of which (including this one) were written back in the 1990's.  That means that there are occasional things that pop out of the narrative -- cell phones are a really big deal for these folks, not an extra appendage -- but for the most part it moves right along.  This one is centered around a group of women of very different types, and it is interesting to see how Maria reacts to this.  Her personal life also continues to develop along absorbing lines.

"For any one who is seriously interested in healthcare, it is critical reading, if sometimes heavy going reading.  Brill focusses on the history of Obamacare, and in doing so makes it clear that the root of the U.S. health care problem is political.  Healthcare now accounts for one sixth of the US economy, and that means that the money and influence t  that can be rallied against any change are formidable.  This made the enactment of Obamacare so torturous a process, and explains why the result is a U.S. system that still has profound problems.Another reviewer refers to Bismark's dictum that one should not watch either laws or sausages being made, and the first half of Brill's book demonstrates that -- exhaustively and and times exhaustingly.  He shows how it was that, even with a Democratic majority in both houses, lobbyists for special interests (the drug companies, the insurers, the hospitals, the device makers, the patient's groups, and on and on and on) were able to force those in favor of reform to water down proposals, compromise, buy off, and on and on an on.  In so doing, I learned a lot about the economics and the power structure of the U.S. health care system, but I also learned more than I probably wanted to know about a few too many individuals.  I also learned (or was confirmed in my belief) that within the Obama administration there were major divisions of opinion and major shortages of communication.The second part of the book, on what happened after the legislation was passed, was more interesting -- or perhaps more accurately less exhausting.  First, in this part,  Brill intersperses the political narrative with stories of individuals who ran into financial catastrophe through illness, and looks at what varioius institutions (mostly hospitals) did to bring these individuals close to financial ruin.  Second, his narrative of the failed launch of the Obamacare website is eyeopening -- the launch failed because the project was badly run from its inception, and that reflected bad management by the administration, all the way up to the top.  That, however, is followed by the livliest part of the book, in which a ""Geek Squad"" of mostly private sector techies saves the day.  There is a lot in this section to gratify anti-Obama types and anti-govenment types, but only if you read it in isolation from the context.  That context is one of ""non profit"" hospitals with CEO's who earn millions a year, drug companies whose devotion to research is far exceeded by their devotion to their profit margins, and an overall situation in which the consumer of healthcare comes in last.At the end of the book, Brill argues that there is no way that the U.S. healthcare system can be rebuilt from the ground up in a way that would minimize costs and maximize outcomes.  That would mean single payer, it would mean Medicare drug price negotiation if not drug price regulation, it would mean serious research on comparative outcomes and costs, and it would mean a whole lot of other violent change to one-sixth of the U.S. economy.  That sixth has a very powerful interest in resisting change, while the five-sixths of the economy that would benefit has a more diffuse interest.  Granted that, he proposes that perhaps we should consider making the institutions that directly provide more and more U.S, medical care --the hospitals -- into insurers as well as providers.  It's an interesting idea that sounds a little like handing the whole henhouse over to the fox, but it bears discussion.  As to Obamacare, Brill concludes that it was a major accomplishment, in that it brought healthcare into the reach of many more  Americans.  Still, Brill argues that it was essentially tinkering with the jalopy, not putting in a new engine.This book is the best overall summary of the U.S. healthcare situation that I have read in years, which is why five stars.  It could have been a better book, better organized and more readable.  Still, I think it is one of those books you should read even if it takes effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENB2R7GU4TXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYXY05S#wasThisHelpful","RENB2R7GU4TXM","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maria Lang, known in Sweden as ""Sweden's Agatha Christie"",  wrote dozens of mysteries from around 1950 up into the 1980's, and was widely read in her own country and in the rest of Scandinavia.  To my knowledge, only three of her books are currently available in English, and I hope that more are on the way.  This novel, written in 1960, is inevitably a period piece, and all the more charming for it.  Lang's world is similar to that of the classic English murder mystery: a small village where everyone knows everyone, a settled social order, a skilled and charming detective, and a charming and charmable young lady to give the detective an assist.  Fans of current Scandavian noir will find this remarkable restrained (not a cult murderer or a dismembered body in sight) but may well find the social setting interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGFB04H6E231/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICYHZDQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EGFB04H6E231","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a great read -- and it's must reading for anyone seriously interested in recent American history, or  in current American politics.  In this brilliantly written and brilliantly researched history of the Nixon years, Perlstein looks at how we got from Johnson's landslide in 1964 to Nixon's in 1972.  And he doesn't just look at the politics per se -- he looks at what was happening in a country that felt as if it was going crazy, piling detail on detail on detail to bring to life a society that was splintering into bits.  And this splintering society was just what Nixon needed to employ his extraordinary political talents.  Perlstein's thesis is that Nixon's own internal demons made him sensitive to the mass of Americans who felt threatened and patronized by the social changes of the era, enabling him to call into being the silent majority.  This didn't begin with Nixon.  In his book about the 1964 election,  ""Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus,"" Perlstein shows the enormous energy of those who supported Goldwater and Goldwaterism.  In this book, he shows that only Nixon in the Republican Party understood that Goldwater's defeat didn't mean the party should turn left, but that it should learn how to use the energy of the right.  Nixon was unquestionably a genius, in political terms at least, but he was also a deeply disturbed individual, whose inner drives eventually drove his politics.  Odd to think of Nixon and Johnson as tragic characters, but that's what this book suggests.But this book goes beyond history.  Perlstein believes that the divide in American society was widened by Nixon, and persists today.  I look forward to reading the final volume in the trilogy, ""The Invisible Bridge"", but I will rest up a bit first.  ""Nixonland"" is a powerful read, particularly I think for those of us who lived through it.  Like several other reviewers, I had forgotten a great deal of the craziness even though I was right in the middle of it.  It makes today's America look benign by comparison, a useful lesson indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T790X5XVL393/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MQNEMA#wasThisHelpful","R2T790X5XVL393","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extraordinarily useful guide to which muscles are engaged in which stretches.  Given the excellent drawings, it is also an excellent guide to how to do each stretch -- if you know what muscles are involved it is far easier to determine where effort should be, and where resistance should be felt.  I would like  a bit more structure and ordering -- if, for example, you are doing calf stretches, are there differences in effects?  What would a program a six leg stretches look like?  And so on and so forth.  Still, this is a very useful book, and will be a permanent part of my exercise library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2476LUNXFN9NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BABT1LM#wasThisHelpful","R2476LUNXFN9NA","A2AFIEWV1QKF8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AFIEWV1QKF8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Dragons, war, betrayal, and so much more….seriously epic tale of Ember, Dante, Garrett and Cobalt/Riley.Opening Sentence: “I stood before a silent, watchful table, six pairs of eyes on me, keen gazes ranging from suspicious to appraising as we waited for the charges to be declared.”The Review:Ember, Garrett, Dante and Cobalt/Riley are back in book 2 shortly after the epicness of book one ends. From this point forth if you haven’t read Talon please stop and go read Talon because you won’t want to be spoiled. Ember convinces Riley to go in and they save Garrett before he is executed by the order. From there the three of them plus Wes go on the run, trying to outwit both the order and Talon. Meanwhile Dante is plotting and planning to recapture Ember and kill Riley.Ember, Garrett and Riley end up in Vegas trying to find ways to stay ahead of the order, when they hear rumors of a dragon sighting. They end up trying to rescue two hatchlings, and well you have to read the book…seriously! This book is action from the beginning until the very end. It’s fast paced and flies by.Julie Kagawa picks a subject and writes it in such a way that you just fall in love. I like dragons but have not liked a ton of dragon books, especially those with shifters. However, these aren’t shifter’s per se, they have a human form that they have learned over time to in order to blend in and hide from the Order of Saint George but these are most definitely dragons. This is a complex tale that she is weaving in which you really don’t have any idea who the good guys are, the dragons (Talon) are ruthlessly in control of the dragon world, forcing hatchlings into jobs and breeding them if they fail at those jobs. They also kill those who try to leave the fold or who really fail at their jobs. The humans (Order of Saint George) are just as ruthless in their pursuit of dragons, only drawing the line at waiting to see them in their true form before killing them. Riley/Cobalt is trained Basilisk that is trying to help and hide dragons from Talon.It’s a perfect storm of complexity that draws you in and you totally root for them to kick Talon and Order butt. My only real complaint is the love triangle. I am not a fan and usually she does a touch of it, but normally it’s pretty clear who the female lead is going to choose. In this one Ember is clearly torn between Garrett and Riley. I will say that there appears to be resolution at the end of this book, but given that Soldier is the name of the next book I am sure there will not be a real answer until the conclusion of book three. I love, love all of her books and Rogue was no different for me. I think this might have been the first time I didn’t cry at the ending of her second book, because let’s face it, she loves to rip your heart and leave you with a massive cliffhanger.So if dragons are your thing go get Talon and then Rogue! If they aren’t your thing go get them anyway because Julie will totally make them your thing when she is done with you! Seriously, I have read all of her books, and she is one of my go-to authors, I haven’t read a bad book by her.Notable Scenes:“The order wouldn’t stop hunting me, especially now that I was in the company of dragons.”“A talon operative had died in this building tonight.”“And Lilith’s voice, telling me I was born to become a Viper, a killer like her.”“The boy who didn’t know I was a dragon, not yet, who saw me only for me.”“She was impulsive, reckless, infuriating…and I couldn’t imagine my life without her.”FTC Advisory: Harlequin Teen provided me with a copy of Rogue.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Gods, half gods, Ragnarok! Can Mason save the world?Opening Sentence: “This is not right…,” Mason Starling murmured softly as sank to her knees beside the crumpled form at the center of a swiftly widening circle of blood.”The Review:So please be aware that if you have not read Starling or Descendant this will contain spoilers. So please STOP now and read the first two books before reading Transcendent. Literally, Transcendent starts where Descendant ends. Mason has become a Valkyrie and Cal stabbed Fennrys, so in moments Mason is begging Rafe to save Fennrys. In doing so she has fulfilled another part of the prophecy by making Fennrys the Wolf!Fennrys finds his mother and finds out that he is Loki’s son, and he was sent away so that he wouldn’t fulfill his part in the prophecy, but considering the love between Mason and Fennrys, things are different than they should be. In the shocking conclusion of Descendant we find out Roth killed Mason while under some form of control by a god. Mason’s mother had become Hel, so she sent her back but all of this is part of what enables her to become a Valkyrie. Mason is working overtime to not start Ragnarok. I can’t say too much more along these lines because of spoilers!Transcendent is a pretty satisfying ending to the trilogy! All-in-all, these were good books. I think the romance could have been done a touch more, but I did love Mason and Fennrys. I did find it a little funny that in each book these kids are finding out they aren’t quite human. The stretching out of all the half gods unveiling was a little silly, but I will say it all made sense within the storyline. It played into a larger part of the story, which I found interesting!I want to say I loved this book and the trilogy, but I didn’t. I enjoyed them and I liked them. I just didn’t quite connect with all of the main characters.  I didn’t quite get all the additions from other pantheons of gods. For the most part this was a Norse story, but Venus and Poseidon and a whole other host of Greek gods and Egyptian gods just kept popping up. They didn’t detract from the story as a whole; I just didn’t get how they fit in other than with the main theme of keeping Ragnarok from happening.Notable Scenes:“But even still, she couldn’t stop from feeling the girl’s death in her Valkyrie’s heart.”“So she could burn down the world.”“When Mason Starling was a child, she’d died.”FTC Advisory: HarperTeen provided me with a copy of Transcendent.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: More drama, more romance and a couple that is willing to fight for each other, including declaring war on a certain prestigious family.Opening Sentence: Funny thing, coming home to a small town after six years.The Review:Calm Before the Storm is the fifth episode in the Rising Storm series. This soap opera/drama series still has me hooked on the residents of the little town of Storm. Once again this series isn’t your typical romance series. It’s more of a story of the relationships developing or being destroyed and the people who are trying to fight for those relationships.This installment mainly focuses on Marcus Alvarez who has recently returned to town after his father’s disappearance to help his mother get by with finances. He doesn’t expect to stick around long, he definitely wants to be gone if his dad shows back up in town. After Marcus meets back up with Brittany Rush and feels the attraction there, he is contemplating if he really wants to leave Storm.Calm Before the Storm really seems to focus more on the Alvarez family and all the drama that is focuses on them. Some huge secrets are revealed. Marcus is in no way like his father, the abusive bastard, but his story does relate how much a child will go to not be like their parent. Marcus ran away instead of giving in to the anger.As to the writing, I haven’t been able to tell that each installment has been written by someone else. I love how each author gets the flesh out a character or two but it is the little things that help with the rest of the characters. The only character that I still can’t stand is Dakota, I’m hoping that will change as the series goes on.Overall, I’m enjoying the series so far. I really want the development to progress a little more only because I’m nosy and want to know what is going to happen when everything explodes. I’m just worried that Brittany may end up in a similar situation like Joanna Alvarez, especially since Marcus has declared war on the Rushes. I’m going to end this review here so I can read the next installment in this series.Notable Scene:He looked away from Brit in shame. “Do you get it now?” he asked. “When I stay, I fight. Bad things happen. It’s better for everyone when I walk away.”“No,” she said softly, and he had to give her credit for screaming and running off in horror. “It’s not better for everyone. Don’t you dare walk away from me. Sometimes it’s okay to fight. Fight for me, for the possibility of us.”Jesus. Was she for real? He turned back to her, wondering if she’d heard a word he’d said. “Is that really what you want? Because your family isn’t going to let this fly without a battle, and I’ll give it to them. Once I engage, I don’t back down.”She inhaled sharply, and he damn never looked away again, afraid to see the revulsion in her expression. Instead, he saw determination. Admiration. And heat that scorched his skin.“I want that.” She poked him in the chest, emphasizing her fierce words. “I want what you’ve got to offer. Everything you’ve got to offer.”FTC Advisory: Evil Eye Concepts, Incorporated provided me with a copy of Calm Before the Storm.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: The final novel in the Sharpest Blade series was a bit of a letdown as I couldn’t get over the main characters and their dramatic love triangle.Opening Sentence: The time in the bottom right corner of my computer screen mocks me.The Review:The final book in The Sharpest Blade trilogy had me going on an emotional roller coaster. I think the only thing I didn’t do was shed a tear, although I do feel that two characters (Trev and Kyol) got the shaft and I was kind of upset about that. I read the first two books in this series, but I honestly don’t remember much and I think that played up how indifferent I was to the story. I went back and read my review for the second book and it didn’t help bring back any memories. There will obviously be spoilers for the first two books so don’t read on if you want to read this series.McKenzie just wants to live a normal human life. But that will never happen for her, not while she can see the fae and read their unique “shadows” when they shift “teleport”. It allows her to tell her allies where the enemy travels too so they can quickly chase after them. Also, McKenzie is now in a life bond with Kyol. The life bond is for life so she can never leave the fae world behind. Her life is now tied with Kyol in life and death. This bond allows each other to know exactly how the other is feeling, it even lets them know where the other is, as in physical place.The fae world is in disarray. Lena is trying to establish herself as ruler but the elders won’t instate her as queen while there is a false blood vying for the throne. A false blood who wants everyone dead, including all humans in the fae world with McKenzie at the top of his list. I’m still not entirely sure why everything falls to McKenzie to help the fae defeat the enemy. She can see through illusions but she isn’t entirely useful when most of the fae population fear her.The first half of this book was incredibly slow. I blame a lot of that on not remembering the world, who’s who and what exactly was going on. The writing wasn’t entirely great either. It felt like everything was just a list of things happening. After a while the story started picking up steam, once things started happening and I knew who the characters were, it was a much faster read. Although, I did still have a hard time remembering some of the terms and who was human or not. If I had read this book closer to the other two I don’t think I would have had such a problem with it. Overall, I still enjoyed the book more than I was frustrated with it. I still really enjoyed the world that was created between the human and the fae.There is a love triangle. This series has pretty much been a love triangle. I didn’t mind it in the first two books from what I can remember. I also rooted for Aren, but in this book. I just couldn’t stand him. I wanted him to go away. He was so wishy washy, changing his thoughts and feelings every single time he saw McKenzie. I felt so sorry for Kyol. The dude can feel everything that McKenzie feels and back and forth. Also, McKenzie was sending him some mixed signals at times. What if he had been doing some other lady? What would her thoughts have been like then? Instead I just couldn’t get over McKenzie’s treatment of Kyol. I realize she based everything on the life bond, saying it was manipulating her emotions, but she had those same emotions before the life bond so… yeah. I just got tired of the life bond being the ONLY thing she could think about or talk about.The Sharpest Blade does wrap up an ending but there was still quite a bit left open. I kind of felt unfulfilled by the ending. If there was a next book, I’m not sure I would read it. I might skim it to see what happens in her relationship with Aren and Kyol just to see if it is still just as frustrating.Notable Scene:Kyol’s expression softens. He releases his grip on his sword hilt and places his hand on my shoulder, squeezing it gently.“It’s okay, kaesha,” he says. I stiffen, expecting to feel some wave of regret for calling me kaesha, but there isn’t any. Roughly, the word translates into loved one, only, it’s so much more than that. For the last decade, it’s been Kyol’s way of telling me that he loves me. He used it rarely since we weren’t supposed to be together, but that only made it more special. It’s still special now.He senses my confusion, my unease, and drops his hand.FTC Advisory: Ace/Penguin provided me with a copy of The Sharpest Blade.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Lord of the Flies meets The Hunger Games in an extra-terrestrial experiment using human teenagers as the test subjects.Opening Sentence: There are certain things the mind cannot comprehend.The Review:There were elements to this story that reminded me first of Lord of the Flies and then The Hunger Games. LotF because that was a story of a group of children stuck on an island with no way back home. And how their separation from civilisation affects and changes them. The Hunger Games similarity was because this too was a story of alliance’s being made, children forced to make adult choices and savage-like behaviour towards the end. Plus, the entire concept of the cage and the kindred watching from outside and playing mind games by artificially altering the habitats reminded me of the dome and the gamekeepers of THG.There was one thing she had learned, living caught between human and the Kindred world. It didn’t matter what race you came from: there were good and bad among every species.There were parts of the story that I liked reading but this was mostly towards the end of the book because though it was an interesting concept, my attention started to wander towards the middle of the book. The build up to their planned escape was dragged out to the point that I thought, ‘if you’re going to die then hurry up and get on with it already!’But Lucky was wrong when he thought being here could be a fresh start. There were no fresh starts for caged birds. There was only as much freedom as their captors wished to give them.Lucky began winding me up because he was infatuated with Cora, yet he knew nothing about her, except the past that linked them both. I think his guilt created a connection that he wasn’t willing to let go of, and he could not see past it or how determined Cora was on escaping.Mali pushed back her fallen braid. “If we can escape this enclosure, I know the paths through the aggregate station. If you help me free Anya, then I will take you to the market and the Mosca. They help escaped humans sometimes. For the right price. Your hair will fetch a ship alone. Information is more expensive. A finger to know if Earth is still there. Maybe two.”She spoke so casually. Cora ran her thumb over her knuckles, feeling the hardness beneath flesh. “I’ll give them all ten fingers and ten toes, if that’s what it takes.”The last few chapters were quite entertaining, mainly because the story finally picked up speed and because of Cassian. I honestly loved his character and, no spoilers but, regardless of how the story panned out I still felt so sorry for him. The way he literally gave Cora the stars was cheesy but so sweet, especially since as an ‘alien’ he lacks the ability to feel, or so I was led to believe.Nok was the most irritating queen bee possible, and her continuous manipulation of the boys and tendency to resort to tears when things wouldn’t go her way was childish to say the least. She reminded me more of a spoiled little girl than a mature model and love really is blind if genius Rolf couldn’t see past her plans.Leon and Mali’s pairing disappointed me the most. Leon had such a strong initial reaction to Mali entering the cage, I actually felt like something big would happen, but then he sort of disappeared and that was it. I didn’t understand that and I kept waiting for him to return and for something to happen between the two seeing as he felt the bond too but it just didn’t happen.It might sound like I’m very critical of this story and I’m not overly impressed but I admit that I am intrigued. I want to know what happens in the next book because I know Cassian will have a stronger role and there will (hopefully) be some character developments but I’m not convinced if I would want to read it, given my mixed feelings for the first book in this series. We’ll just have to wait and find out.Notable Scene:“What are you waiting for?” she asked.“I am wondering if I am doing the right thing.” His voice was distant, as though he was speaking more to himself. “Perhaps I am making a mistake.”Cora stepped closer, letting the light play over her face, which she knew must look sunken and worn. “Sometimes mistakes are worth making.”The muscles in his neck constricted. His hand tightened and flexed at his side as he turned away from the light, and shadows ate at his features. “The ways in which human and Kindred think is so very different. Mistakes in our world are to be avoided at all cost, because they betray a lack of intelligence, just like lesser emotions. It is sometimes difficult to understand you when you say such things-that sometimes mistakes are worth making.”FTC Advisory: Balzer + Bray/HarperCollins provided me with a copy of The Cage.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A haunting, provocative debut that shocked me in the best ways.Opening Sentence: I have been a cottage girl for eight years now.The Review:There are two earths. They have always communicated; people talk with their alternates regularly. Until blood and smoke stain the sky. Until people start disappearing into thin air. Until the Silence begins and communications end. Only one earth is surviving while the other deprecates and dies. Lira’s world is not winning, which is why she is taken. She, along with other children that have been sold to the cause, are dropped through portals into the other world. There, they are taught the brutal reality of what it means to be a sleeper.They kill their alternates and take their places, and they wait for the war to truly begin. They hide in plain sight, doing simple tasks like helping to supply other sleepers with weapons and assistance. Lira is convinced of her inadequacy. She never can seem to see black and white, and the gray area is where she gets lost – traitorous thoughts of innocence and rebellion slip into her mind. No matter how she tries to convince herself otherwise, she’s not emotionless, and over the course of many years, her story is told.Lira was one of those characters whom is absolutely depressing to read from. She is caught up in something that has forced her out of innocence too early. She is traumatized by the things she does to survive in the harsh reality she was born into. She follows her world’s orders, to the best of her ability, but it is costing her more than she knows. And yet, she is not the perfect sleeper: she thinks of things like love and rebellion, topics that are unthinkable, topics that could get her killed by her own people. I was swept away in her emotions and caught up in the tangle of her thoughts. The writing style is beautiful, and often flows like a stream of consciousness. It was completely unique.“I have to believe that somehow, somewhere, there are worst monsters in the world than me.”The love story snuck up on the reader, but when it came, it did not eclipse Lira’s story. I liked that it played a major role without overcoming other, more important facets – the plotline, Lira’s introspection. So many themes were at play in this book and they clashed in a way that somehow turned out beautiful. I won’t lie, the science fiction aspect was brushed off of, and the world building was slippery, but that was layered over by more valuable aspects. I love how this story did not stick to a typical good vs. evil archetype: Lira is not a hero. She is, at many points, the antagonist rather than protagonist of the story. It gave such an interesting, thought provoking perspective.“In the end I don’t know which lies are worse: the lies we tell ourselves in the dark or the ones we pretend to agree to.”This book was haunting. It absolutely broke me. It’s a book that focused on such a gritty, harsh reality, and the emotions of the characters are raw. It was left open-ended, in the best way, and readers are left with only their imagination. The endings of the characters that we had invested ourselves in so much are left unsure. Somehow, that works for this book, don’t ask me how. I think that this novel is not for someone looking for a quick paced, action packed science fiction. It is more character-based, but its thought provoking quotes and gorgeous writing made it a winner to me.Notable Scene:They won’t pass the testing. It is the most excruciating examination any of us will go through, designed to weed out our mistakes and to eliminate those who are not up to par. They do not have even the slightest hope of passing it.Margot and I refocus our eyes on the books, both of us shaking our heads in disgust,  both of us silent.Love is what they have. The people of this Earth. Not us. Look how weak it has made them.FTC Advisory: Greenwillow Books/HarperTeen provided me with a copy of The Unquiet.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A one night stand, can two strangers figure out who killed Maddox before something happens to either one of them?Opening Sentence: “Gabriel Bond really wanted to murder his best friend.”The Review:Gabriel is helping put together the funeral for his best friend Maddox, who also happens to be the father of Sarah’s unborn baby (Gabriel’s sister), when he meets Eve and decides to have a one night weekend with her. Eve or Everly is the head of cyber security for Maddox’s company and pretending to be someone else for the weekend just might help her deal with her boss’s death. After the weekend ends it soon becomes clear there is so much more going on here than a weekend. Eve finds out that Gabriel is a super rich playboy, and Gabriel hears rumors of Maddox’s affair with Everly, except he hasn’t quite figured out that Eve and Everly are the same person.Before they even begin to figure out things between them Eve starts receiving texts from a mysterious informant who warns her not to get too close to Gabriel. Gabriel finds out that he is the number one suspect in Mad’s death and things just keep getting deeper and deeper. As Eve and Gabe get closer to each other, they also get in deeper trying to figure out why and who murdered Mad.This is one where it was hard not to say so much more about the book to avoid spoilers. Some of the information doesn’t seem spoilery, but it is and you have to read this book without spoilers! This book was great, I really like Eve, she was super smart and really unwilling to put up with a lot of BS. Gabe was okay, but he did improve by the end of the book. The mystery was really good, I did suspect one of the people before it was revealed but I really didn’t get the whole picture until the author laid it out. Plus, there was so much in the revelation department that you really didn’t get a good feel for the whole ending until all the pieces were laid out.Eve and Gabe are the romantic couple in this book, and they start off as strangers who fall in bed, than in love all while trying to figure out who to trust and solve Mad’s murder, with some help from the other Perfect Gentlemen. Considering this is a new series, I thought it was really bold that the authors’ killed off one of the Perfect Gentlemen in the first book. But a in some ways a smart move, because it really allows them to introduce the remaining group and get a sense of them before their books are even written.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Dark, funny, action-packed drama. Be prepared for a seriously crazy cliffhanger.Opening Sentence: The billboard at the border of Morganville hadn’t changed since Claire had first driven past it on the way into town at the tender age of sixteen.The Review:Fall of Night is the penultimate novel in the Morganville Vampire series. This is the first novel in this series that I have read but I have read Rachel Caine’s Weather Warden Series which I thoroughly enjoyed. As someone who has never read this series before I was never lost in what was happening in the story, I do wish that I had a better understanding of the overall story. One day I will go back and read the rest of this series from the beginning. The first half of the story was a little slow, setting up what Claire in doing in Boston, but when all Hell breaks loose the story is non-stop action until the ending. Fall of Night could have been a standalone story up until the crazy cliffhanger ending!This story starts with Claire leaving Morganville. She wants to get away and see if she can make it in the real world without all the vampire madness. She also wants to step away from her boyfriend Shane. She wants to know if what she feels for him is real and also to kind of torment him for some bad decisions he made which included not trusting her. Claire is going to MIT in Boston for an independent study program. She wants to use her smarts to create something good.Shane just can’t let Claire go without backup so he secretly follows her up to Boston. For someone who doesn’t want Claire to know he is there, they seem to make the same friends in the big town of Boston. As many times as he wants to jump in and let Claire know he is around, he understands that Claire wants her space, to be her own person.The reason Claire is in Boston is to perfect a machine that she has been working on. A machine that in my eyes could only be used for bad. I’m not quite sure how Claire never saw it that way. As soon as she described it, I was like “Oh great, this thing is nothing but bad.” Enter the Daylighters, an organization that wants to destroy all things vampire. You can kind of predict that everything goes downhill from here on out.Some major players and key characters added to the story are Professor Irene Anderson, Jesse and Pete. I absolutely loved Jesse. A vampire who seemed to be in control of her powers and was great in all situations. Her interaction with Myrnin was cute and entertaining. It had me laughing.I really enjoyed reading a Rachel Caine book again. I could tell it was her style as soon as I started getting into the story. I felt like I was actually in Boston with Claire and Shane. The descriptions and dialogue are engrossing. I would definitely check out the rest of this series.I will say since this is the first time I am seeing this world, I don’t know for a fact how true the characters are to themselves and how they have been since the beginning. Claire was tough where she needed to be (confronting a stalker and a nasty professor caused some really funny scenes) but I did think she was nave. She couldn’t possibly think her weapon would only be used for good. Shane was an idiot for following but thankfully she ended up needing his help or else I don’t think that would have been good for their relationship. The book did alternate between Claire and Shane’s POVs.Overall, Fall of Night is dark, funny, action-packed and filled with some serious drama. My jaw dropped during that crazy cliffhanger. So be prepared to have the last book on hand, Daylighters. I’m trying to avoid spoilers but I really want to know how this series ends but I would like to read it from the beginning first.Notable Scene:She picked up the hot pie and was walking back with it when she spotted the creepy Professor Davis sitting at an outdoor café, enjoying a coffee with a girl young enough—again—to be his daughter. She looked captivated, too. Starry-eyed and naïve, and willing to believe that Professor Davis was that missing daddy figure in her life that would solve all her problems.Claire couldn’t resist.She changed course.Dr. Davis and his new conquest were so into each other—or at least, she was breathlessly into him, and he was enjoying it — that it took at least a full minute for either of them to notice Claire when she paused at their table. Dr. Davis even pushed his coffee cup toward her, as if she were the waiter, before looking up in annoyance, then confusion, and then – gratifyingly –worry. He straightened up in his chair, and she smiled at him.What would Eve do?It was easy enough to channel her best friend’s talent for snarky destruction.“You’re not returning my calls, Patrick,” Claire said, in her best injured, pouting voice. “I thought you were going to come by to talk about our problems.”“Claire,” he said, which was an obvious and rookie mistake; it meant he knew who she was, and she saw the chagrin settle over his face as he realized it. He turned toward the girl he was with, no doubt to protest his innocence.Claire didn’t give him the chance. “I ran into your wife at the mall and she says she is not going to give you a divorce, so what am I supposed to do about the babies? Just you wait. I’m going to make sure you step up and be a good father to our twins! You promised!”She didn’t wait to see the results of the bomb she’d thrown; she just held her head high and walked on with the pizza and didn’t look back. She didn’t have to. The scrape of the girl’s wrought-iron chair legs on pavement, and Patrick’s injured, wounded protests were as good as any picture. It might not matter, and probably wouldn’t; she’d torpedoed one date, but he’d have another one tomorrow, or the next day.FTC Advisory: New American Library/Penguin provided me with a copy of Fall of Night.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: The Dead House is a terrifying and tragic take on a girl with a disturbed mind. Engrossing read that I couldn’t read fast enough but the ending did fall a little flat for me.Opening Sentence: 3 DEAD, 1 MISSING IN SCHOOL FIREThe Review:The Dead House is a book that is a little hard to describe and after finishing it, I have mixed feelings about the story that I read. The Dead House is set in the future but is primarily filled with a story that happened in the past. There are some paranormal elements to this story but the main focus is on mental illness.Carly Johnson is just your normal girl during the day. She goes to school and has friends but she does suffer from anorexia. Kaitlyn Johnson is not your normal girl. At night she takes over Carly’s body and explores the boarding school they live at. She doesn’t really have too many friends. She is mean-spirited and not very nice. She also eats when Carly does not. You see Carly and Kaitlyn share the same body but they have their own personalities, feelings and memories.Carly and Kaitlyn refer to themselves as sisters even though the share one body. They write to each other through their diaries and through post-it notes. They let each other know what they have done during the day or night. They even make requests for each other. Carly is excited to go back to school while Kaitlyn is not. When Carly and Kaitlyn are not at school they spend their time at the Claydon Mental Institute, because their parents died in a tragic accident that no one will tell them about. The doctor in charge of their care believes that Carly suffers from DID, dissociative identity disorder, or what I would say is multiple personalities. What the doctor doesn’t believe is that Carly and Kaitlyn have lived their whole lives this way, even before the accident.Strange things begin to happen to Kaitlyn. She starts seeing a strange girl. She begins to refer to her as Dee, which is what Kaitlyn refers to her diary as, so she believes she is seeing the personality of her diary and the deep, disturbed emotions that are explained within. Then one day, Kaitlyn wakes up and it is morning! Carly is gone! Kaitlyn and Carly’s friends decide they will do whatever is necessary to bring back Carly, including black magic. Kaitlyn feels that she is unworthy and that Carly is the good one, the one who should live.This story is quite strange and totally had me hooked. I loved every part of this story up until the end. I thought I had things figured out and then something else would happen and completely change where I thought the story was going. The Dead House is definitely for fans who like the ambiguous endings. I don’t. I want to know exactly what happened. There were still too many documents that weren’t unlocked at the end that I think would have explained things that happened a bit better.The Dead House is told primarily through the dairy entries, videotape footage and audio interviews. It is here that you get the since of how mentally ill Kaitlyn is. She seems like she is sane and completely normal during a few entries and then the next few just unravel and show a mind at disarray.At first I really felt sorry for Kaitlyn, there are some things that I wish I could discuss but I think they would be too spoilery for this review. I will say, that I was hoping that Kaitlyn would figure out that she was in fact the better sister… and that some of the events didn’t play out like they initially thought.Overall, The Dead House is a tragic story. Do not expect a happy ending with this one. While I was really engrossed in this story from beginning to end I did feel a bit depressed at the ending. Maybe I missed one vital clue, if so, will someone let me know? Otherwise, you are left with an ending that you can make up yourself.Notable Scene:I am afraid of the dark.No, not just tense. Not just tense at all, Dee. I am was am a child of the night—I even need it… and I am petrified of it. Some kind of joke, right? But it’s true. And more than I’m afraid of the dark, I fear the light (ha ha). I fear the sun, and I fear the exposure. So, really, I’m not fit for life. One or the other, kid. And if I face that truth for too long, Dee, it’ll break me. So I have to lie to myself to survive.But lying is a habit, and it’s addictive. You lie. It breeds. You lie again. It grows. And one day you wake up and realize that everyone around you has this weird idea about who you are, and you don’t recognize the person they’re describing. You don’t understand why they’re treating you the way they do.Or not treating you.It’s like you have a cancer.I’ve pushed everyone away. Even Carly. I live behind a veneer of Teflon that I worked hard to grow and then to maintain. I could blame it on the accident murder accident death fact that our parents left us, left me, but it would be unfair. Because the truth is… I was like this before they died. I pushed them away too, and now nothing I do will ever change that.They saw a drunk, when I was broken.They saw sarcasm, when I was sobbing.They saw me push them away, when I was screaming for their love.It’s too hard. I can’t admit to this flaw—this chink in my armor. So I walked around in that ever-night, and I felt afraid, and I climbed on the roof hoping that someday I would feel the bright moon on my skin. I still long for that, and more. Until then, Dee… I’ll be honest. I’ll be honest with you.I’m afraid. I’m so, so afraid.And I wish there were arounds around me and words in my ear, breath on my neck… telling me that everything will be okay, that someone loves me, that I’m not a mistake, not a waste, not a nothing. Telling me that, no, I’m not a child of darkness, and there is a place for me in the light.I want Carly to tell me.But if she can’t—if she can’t tell me that and still be with me, then I’ll take the dark. I’ll take the dark gladly—if only she’ll come back to me. If she’ll come back and put me in the back room and take her place in the light.I’m sorry I ever wanted it.I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m so sorry–FTC Advisory: Little, Brown Books for Young Readers provided me with a copy of The Dead House.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A coming of age story with characters who treat each other terribly, a family curse that can’t be lifted while people can’t come to terms with the terrible things that have happened to them. Slow pacing and a child narrator may turn some people away from this story.Opening Sentence: We walk on fire or air, so Daddy liked to say.The Review:The Hollow Ground is a novel that intrigued me from its synopsis, a family that has been cursed for generations, devastating coal mine fires and a girl who tries to take it upon herself to rid the family of the curse while trying to survive these unpredictable fires. The Hollow Ground while slow kept me reading only because I wanted to know the secrets of the family and how the curse would be resolved.Brigid Howley’s family has a curse over them. After a fight with a priest over coal mining, the Howley family has been cursed with tragedy and unhappiness. The Howley’s live in Centrereach a town where coal fires have pretty much run everyone out of town. The Howley’s have been living with Brigid’s Auntie. Her Auntie suffers one of the most terrifying death’s I think I have ever read about. It definitely has me looking at the ground more carefully. After Auntie’s death, the family has no choice but to move in with the father’s parents. Brigid’s mother swore she would never go back to that mean woman’s home ever again.The Howley’s are quite poor. They live with whomever can take them in. Brigid’s father, Adrian, had his arm crushed in a mining accident. He tries to work but the jobs usually don’t last long as he always does something to get fired. Brigid’s mother, Delores, supports the family with her job at the mill but it doesn’t give them enough money to get a place of their own.After Brigid discovers a dead body, the family is never the same again. Deep dark secrets start to reveal themselves one piece at a time. Delores claimed that she married into the family curse but her own past just feeds the unhappiness of the curse. The rest of the family acts strangely. Brigid slowly begins to unravel the story that she believes is happening around her. She wants to know the truth but the grown-ups just lie to her and say things that they would to little children.Brigid Howley is the eleven/twelve year old narrator of The Hollow Ground. The narrative is a bit childish reflecting the young narrator but in many ways she is more reliable and smarter than the grown-ups around her. Brigid asks all the right questions even though she might be scared to voice them at times because of the repercussions. She is also perceptive and knows how her parents act and think around her.As to the writing style in The Hollow Ground, I never once forgot that she was a child. Her speech and actions always showcased her age. The writer also showcased the regional dialect and poor standing of the characters. Brigid’s mother never finished school and you could tell by the way she talked. Brigid’s father was supposed pretty smart. He didn’t talk too much but when he did, he didn’t come off uneducated, just a bit childish himself. Brigid was the only one who could pull off this story because the other characters were just too mean, selfish or childish. Even though Brigid had her moments, she was the sane one in the family.The Hollow Ground is based off of true life events, which is why Auntie’s death terrifies me so much. The story is dark, terrible and unreliable, just like the surroundings where the family live. This isn’t a feel good story unless it makes you feel better about your own family. Brigid’s coming of age story isn’t HEA but more of a “happy enough”. If anything this story just upset me more over Brigid’s own situation and how terribly her own mother treated her. You know that saying, “What goes around comes around” definitely applied to this family. One thing that did surprise me was the paranormal aspect. I didn’t really expect that but I guess supernatural/spirituality would have to come into play when you are dealing with a curse that was started by a priest.Overall, The Hollow Ground was an alright story for me. It felt slow in places and I wasn’t quite sure where the story was going until Brigid found the dead body. I do not regret reading this story at all. I just hate when I leave a story feeling depressed about how events played out.Notable Scene:Beneath her hand the wedge moved to the letter H, then O, then W.“How?” she said. “Why do you keep saying H-O-W? How what? Spirit, what are you trying to tell me? How it happened? How you got killed?”“Maybe you shouldn’t ask it,” I said, breathing in gulps as if I desperately needed to catch my breath. As the wooden piece moved from L, then E, then Y, it felt like each letter branded a tender spot inside me and I flinched with the burn. “Don’t ask it any more,” I pleaded. “You don’t need to know.”“L-E-Y?” she said and her tongue clucked with exasperation. “What is that? Lee? Lay? Finish the word, Spirit? L-E-Y, what?”Again the wedge moved. This time it spelled: HOWLEY.I whimpered, looking helplessly from the board to the mirror above the dresser. I gripped the bedspread as if I was about to fall forward into the horrible place where we were headed.“Okay,” Marisol said, “I get How. But what is L-E-Y. Lee? Lay? Tell me.”I didn’t dare breathe, my eyes hurt like bits of salt were in them. When Marisol turned to me, all the angles of her face tensed. “How-lee?” she said. “How-lee?” But then recognition relaxed the muscles around her eyes and she stared at me with a look of amazed horror.FTC Advisory: St. Martin’s Griffin/Macmillan provided me with a copy of Hollow Ground.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Fast moving romance for the main couple, side characters want what they can’t have and a story that I am now completely invested in. Will any of these couples actually get their own HEAs? Or will it be like most soap operas with a happy for now ending before things get stirred up again?Opening Sentence: Logan Murphy paused in the doorway of Murphy’s Pub.The Review:The grass is always greener on the other side. That was all I could think about while reading the fourth installment of the Rising Storm series. Dance in the Wind was written by Jennifer Probst. I really enjoyed the writing in this installment. Surprisingly, the characters actions and feelings haven’t changed much over the course of this series, with the different authors.I don’t want to say too much about the events that happen during Dance in the Wind but this story focuses more on Ginny Moreno and Logan Murphy. Ginny is pregnant with another man’s baby but Logan doesn’t care. She is the only one in town with eyes as haunted as his. She has gone through something so terrible that only he can understand and help her with because he needs his own therapy that only Ginny can provide.The other residents of Storm, Texas stories are slowing moving along. Quite a few people show up and update where they are in their stories. (Although, it felt like all the other stories were about people who were unhappy with who they were with. They wanted someone else hence my grass is always greener statement at the beginning of this review.) Ginny and Logan’s story seemed to move quickly over time but everyone else is playing out slowly so I’m not sure if everyone is on the same timeline or not. They seem to be but I feel like some events are happening out of order.I can’t wait to see how the arrival of the town’s newest visitor plays out, especially with his family. They have been the most affected by the events of the soap opera so far.At this point, I’m in it for the long haul. I’m invested in these characters and their story. I am really intrigued to see how this series plays out, do some of these characters get an HEA or is this like a straight up soap opera, where some characters are happy for now while others are completely fine with creating conflict and making others unhappy? Ultimately, it is how these stories end will determine if I enjoyed this series or not but for now, I’m enjoying the writing and the atmosphere of this desert Texas town.Notable Scene:“What did you want to talk about?” she asked hesitantly.He took a step closer. Her gaze fell on those lush lips and she remembered the feel of them sliding over hers. Giving such sweet pleasure. Adoring her in a way that shattered her heart because she never believed she’d experience something beautiful again after losing Jacob. Oh, God, focus.“I know you’re worried about letting me be more than your friend. But I’m not going to stop, Ginny. Not until you let me put my arms around you, and kiss you, and let me take care of you. You wormed your way into my heart, and I can’t go back. So, this time, formally, I’m asking you to go out with me. In public. As more than my friend. As your boyfriend.”FTC Advisory: Evil Eye Concepts, Inc. provided me with a copy of Dance in the Wind.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A very dramatic spin on how even the most notorious thief deserves to have a happy ending.Opening Sentence: Lord Huntington made his way through the crowded ballroom with the poise and elegance of an over-fattened Christmas goose.The Review:When I read the title of this book I remembered something my English teacher quoted some time ago: ‘oh the tangled webs we weave, when first we practice to deceive.’ That fits this story perfectly. Arista has woven herself so deeply into the life of notorious, dangerous Lady A that when she finds a glimmer of hope and dreams of getting out, she can’t untangle herself.Arista was a really good base character and I genuinely felt sorry for her because of the things she had to resort to, in order to survive. However, I thought she fell in love with Grae far too quickly. She’s practically head over heels for him at first sight, which was ridiculous for someone like her. One would think that Lady A has seen a lot in life, making her a ruthless, hardened villain but she ends up being a softie. I thought that was a tad unrealistic. How can someone whose reputation as a blackmailer is so esteemed be so empathetic? Surely those emotions would have got her killed within the first few years of working for Bones?Yes, Nic helped her survive but he can’t have done all the work, can he? And if he did then he definitely got the short end of it. If Nic was the only reason Lady A survived then shouldn’t he be credited as Master N or something? Why did she get all the fame whilst Nic’s left just being the bodyguard?! I thought that was unfair.The love story was sweet, romantic and perhaps too predictable. The way Arista bumps into Grae again and again, I thought it bordered on ridiculous. I mean, out of all the houses she could have stayed in, what are the odds that Wild picked Grae’s for Arista to stay at? Again, unrealistic.“It’ll be okay, miss. I can tell already that they are good people.” Arista closed her eyes and sucked in a long breath. That was exactly what she was afraid of. Thieves, blackmailers, and whores were familiar territory. Arista knew what was expected of her, and what to expect in return. Here, she knew nothing-definitely not how to behave correctly.I liked Nic, and I had hoped that he would be the one to save Arista from their life of crime, but his ambition got in the way of that. Grae wasn’t a bad guy, but he was way too good to be true. In his looks, personality, even his career. How come he just happens to travel to the one place Arista dreams of escaping to?This wasn’t a bad read, I enjoyed spending my weekend on it. The storyline was interesting and the characters had potential but I’m afraid there was definitely a lot missing. One minute, everything is as perfect as it can be, and then the story takes a turn for the worst. I felt it was too dramatized to be believable. This isn’t a series I’m going to continue.Notable Scene:Arista took a step back and cradled her hand against her chest. Too many emotions battled inside her head. How many nights had she wished for someone to appear and give her a way out? But did she dare to trust someone like Wild! It would be like trusting the devil himself.“You of all people should know, sir, that there is no such thing as trust among thieves.”Wild laughed once more. “I like your honesty, Lady A. I dare say I like it a lot.”FTC Advisory: Disney-Hyperion provided me with a copy of Tangled Webs.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: This is a novel that, while packing a good amount of satire, still delivers a meaningful message.Opening Sentence: On the day we’re the last people to see indie kid Finn alive, we’re all sprawled together in the Field, talking about love and stomachs.The Review:It’s Mikey’s last year of high school. He can feel time running out; he wants so badly to ask out his friend Henna, but can never work up the courage, and he doesn’t want to leave his friends and his siblings. Strange things begin happening, though – glowing blue eyes, immortals, chosen ones. Here’s the thing: Mikey isn’t one of the people who is going to stop them. He’s not an indie kid, the name given to those that are the kids that have powers and fight the supernatural.So Mikey isn’t special, in a world where paranormal events are mostly background events (because, in the end, its the indie kids that take care of them). He cares about his friends, his family, and making it through the school year. As well as this, he’s struggling to fight past a disorder that is trapping him in painful “loops” that are getting bad again. But just because he’s not one of the saviors, that doesn’t mean he’s not special, does it? After all, most of us aren’t indie kids. The rest of us just live here.I got an advance copy of this at the last ALA annual in San Francisco, so I’ve had a galley for quite a while. I’ve always wanted the chance to pick it up, because it seemed like a lot of fun. When I was asked to review it, I got the perfect opportunity to fit it into my hectic schedule, so I read it. It ended up being a satire of the YA cliches we all know and love, in the best way.For example, before each chapter from Mikey’s perspective, you got a glimpse of what was going on with the indie kids. It was just a short paragraph about what they had been doing while Mikey had been narrating. The love triangles, the death, the paranormal – summarized like that, with all the typical YA aspects, it all seemed ridiculous. And the funny thing is, I definitely would have loved something like that had it been expanded.I liked this novel. It had the perfect balance of satire and meaning. I loved the message that everyone is significant to the world, and that our “normal” lives are incredible. The characters were layered and complex, and I enjoyed our very relatable protagonist Mikey. Their was a lot of diversity in this book, as well, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The writing style was simple but easy to follow. I think this is a cute story, and it seemed to live up to all of my expectations. I’ve been in bad place with books I’ve read recently – none of them are really doing it for me – so hopefully a novel like this, that was fun to read, will pull me out of it. Others will enjoy how it breaches unprecedented territory!Notable Scene:Chapter the thirteenth, in which the prince is tricked into turning Satchel and second indie kid Finn over to the Empress of the Immortals; he tries to save them, but is forced to sacrifice Finn to do so; Satchel refuses to accept this and, through only her own cunning and bravery, thwarts the empress; she saves Finn and as they flee, she steals a glimpse of the Immortal Crux, the source of the Immortals’ power, through the gateway; it is full of charms and jewels, with an empty space in exactly the shape of her amulet.FTC Advisory: Harper Teen provided me with a copy of The Rest of Us Just Live Here.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: While not much happens in terms of the overarching mystery, this is still a fun follow up to book one, full of engaging characters and a wonderful romance.Opening Sentence: I saw Sweet again today.The Review:Ever since her father left her mother, Sheridan has sworn that she will never let a man be in a position to do that to her. That means no serious relationships, and definitely no marriage. Ever since arriving at the Triple C Ranch and meeting her boss’ brother, her resolve has been faltering. James Cavanaugh is the type of man who would make any woman stop in her tracks. The fact that he seems to also be attracted to her doesn’t help matters any. Sheridan really doesn’t want to cross the line between a professional relationship and a personal one, but James is making it really hard to stay strong.James has his own reasons for not wanting a serious relationship. His sister’s murder still hangs over his head, and other events in his life have led him to believe every woman who cares for him gets hurt. So, it’s really in Sheridan’s best interest that they not become involved. James just can’t stay away from her though, and they both find themselves falling more and more under the other’s spell. Will these two people be able to put aside their pasts in order to make a future together?I was surprised with how much I enjoyed the first book in this series, so I was very much looking forward to continuing the series with this book. My expectations were met with a fast paced and sweet romance, full of great characters. I will say though that, in terms of the overarching mystery over Cass’ murder, not much happens. We get some more clues, but it doesn’t really feel like the plot moves forward much, if at all. It’s too Laura Wright’s credit that I can say this and still give the book 4 stars because she just has a way of writing that draws me in, and her characters seem very genuine.One issue I did have concerned James. It almost felt sometimes as if there were a wall between him and the reader. We find out about his baggage, but it was never given in enough detail for me to truly understand why he was so standoffish about having a serious relationship. It made it a little harder for me to connect to him, whereas I connected to Sheridan very easily.We get to see a lot of Mac (the heroine from book one), which I enjoyed. I love it when the main characters from previous books make appearances later on in a series and getting to see Mac attempting to plan a wedding was a lot of fun.All in all, while it didn’t seem like much happened, this was still a fun, fast follow up to book one. I believe fans of the first book will greatly enjoy this one as well. I’m looking forward to book three!Notable Scene:“I work for your brother.”“Right.”“And I love my job.”“Well, that’s a good thing.”She gave him a look of extreme impatience.“Come on, I know you understand what I’m saying.”“You can’t think Deacon would fire you if we…hung out together. If we were…” He paused, cleared his throat. “Friends.”“Having a hard time getting that word out?” she observed, the lightness and humor back in her gaze.“Not at all.” He dropped his chin and lifted his brows. “Friend.”Her gaze shifted to the coming sunset. “Look, I don’t believe Mr. Cavanaugh would take issue with us being friends, if that’s truly what it was. But, come on -“James didn’t let her finish. He stuck his hand out. “Then it’s settled. Friends.”She stared at his hand.“I ain’t gonna bite, Sheridan,” he said. He’d meant it as a joke, but when her eyes lifted to meet his, he saw a struggle there.“You wanna stop hanging out with me?” he asked gently.“No, but -“He shrugged. “We both know where we stand. Both know neither one of us is staying here permanent. No expectations. Just fun.”“Just fun?” she asked. “Words are easy like the wind,” she said.Heat slashed through him. Quoting Shakespeare from those lips…”What can I say, Miss O’Neil? ‘I do desire we be better strangers.'”Her eyes brightened and for a moment he though she might return his quote with another. Maybe something about rejection of the heart. But instead, she started to laugh.“All right, Mr. Cavanaugh.” She slipped her hand in his and pumped it a couple of times.“Friends it is.”FTC Advisory: Signet/Penguin provided me with a copy of Broken.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A rushed timeline makes the love story very hard to believe in this second book in the Slow Burn series.Opening Sentence: Gavin Rochester stood in the doorway of his enormous living room watching as his wife carefully examined a Christmas ornament before quietly replacing it in the box and tucking it back into the plastic basin they used to store Christmas decorations.The Review:Arial has always known she was different. From the time she was a baby, she displayed unimaginable telekinetic powers, and her parents taught her to never show them in public, afraid of the attention it would draw to her. Now, at 24, her secret is finally out. Arial is caught on video using her powers to defend herself against an attacker, and the video goes viral. Then, her parents disappear, and the men they had hired to guard Arial instead attack her. Not knowing where else to turn, Arial goes to Beau Devereaux, a man her father had said she could trust. She enlists Beau’s services to help her find her parents. Thus begins a week that will change both of their lives forever. They will have to dodge numerous attacks, all while trying to deal with the almost overwhelming attraction they have for each other. Will they be able to find Arial’s parents, or will these mysterious attackers get their hands on Arial as well?I’ve heard many good things about Maya Banks and her work, so I was looking forward to giving this book a try. Unfortunately, making my way through the book became a very arduous process, and I had an extremely hard time finishing it. What makes this even more disappointing is that the book had such a strong start. The first few chapters are from Arial’s father’s point of view, and they immediately hooked me. I began to get really excited about the book – and then it switched to Arial’s point of view and all momentum stopped. Everything started feeling very stilted, and I couldn’t get a good grasp on either Arial or Beau as characters. Dialogue felt forced and awkward. The plot just slowed to a crawl.Another big issue I had was the romance in conjunction with the timeframe of the book. The entire book takes place literally over just a few days, and here we have this couple falling in love and wanting to spend their lives together in that same amount of time. It was just incredibly hard to suspend my disbelief. All I kept thinking was “you just met this person yesterday.”Because I was having such a hard time with the book, it made me notice little details that might not otherwise have bothered me. Sentence structure was sometimes really awkward, making me have to read a sentence a couple times to grasp what was being said. If I’m loving a book, I can usually look past stuff like that, but it really stuck out to me here.All in all, this book just wasn’t for me. I didn’t like the characters, the timeframe felt really rushed, and the love story just wasn’t gripping. Needless to say, I won’t be going back to read book one in this series.Notable Scene:“Imagine my parents’ shock,” she said dryly. “They had to come to terms when I wasn’t even a year old yet that I was different, and as such, I wouldn’t be able to lead a ‘normal’ life. And it altered their lives as well. They made many sacrifices for me, adjusting their own lives to revolve around mine and my needs. I always came first with them, which is why I have to find them. I owe it to them. To myself. To do whatever is necessary, even if it means sacrificing my own life to get them back.”His expression immediately blackened, his hold on her hand nearly crushing now.“You will not die,” he said harshly, but vulnerability had flashed in his eyes before he could call it back.“I don’t want to die,” she said softly, to reassure him. “I have so much to live for. I’m only saying that if it ever came to that – and I trust you and DSS to ensure that it never comes to that – for me it is an easy choice. One I wouldn’t have to ponder, consider or have to talk myself into. They’re too important to me and I can’t imagine my world without them in it.”“You need to realize that they feel the same about you. Imagine how they’d feel, knowing that you sacrificed your life so they could live. Do you think they’d be grateful? Do you think they could possibly live with themselves? It’s not something they’d ever recover from and get over, Ari. It would devastate them.”There was a long pause, his breath coming in long bursts after his impassioned statement. Then he looked her directly in the eye.FTC Advisory: Avon/HarperCollins provided me with a copy of In His Keeping.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A whirlwind of an adventure filled with cunning characters, spectacular action, and a very well executed story that will have you instantly salivating for more.Opening Sentence: Joost had two problems: the moon and his mustache.The Review:When I was given the chance to read Leigh Bardugo’s Six of Crows early, I screamed. The gorgeous package with the coveted advanced copy arrived at my doorstep, and all I could do was scream like a crazed fangirl. Let’s be real here, for those of you who remember me, I am a fangirl – especially for Leigh Bardugo. If you haven’t known yet, Bardugo is filled with award-laden literary fantasy.Six of Crows is an epic tale of stylish imagery, some action-laden adventure. and several cunning characters. Told through a multi-point of view, a group of not-so-merry-men survive the dark alleys of Ketterdam. They seek out what other outcasts like them do best: obtain money and achieve power. But led by one man, this group of the most dangerous outcasts are faced with one impossible heist, and world destruction isn’t even the craziest thing that could happen.In Six of Crows, there is a labyrinth of a narrative that slowly reveals each character as needed. And within each plot twist and turn, Bardugo allows for the reader to make a decision about the characters. You either like them or you fear them. You see, Bardugo has outdone herself with this stunning group of characters. She has introduced some very well written people that have become real in my mind. I will only talk about two, in fear or anything spoilerish.Kaz is the mastermind, and the craziest one of them all. He is elusive and enigmatic, as if he was the descriptive picture of a dictionary page. He’s dangerous and canniving, but I can’t help but look at him as a heroic outlaw.Inej. She is amazing, and is my new favorite character. I love who she is today, yesterday, and who she will be in a few years. She is the epitome of a bad ass heroine. Stealth is her friend, but I also see it as her enemy. Her role in Six of Crows is pivotal, more so than anyone else.Ketterdam after the events that have taken place in the Shadow and Bone trilogy is something else. Bardugo did a fine job showcasing all of the highs and lows. The end of the Shadow and Bone trilogy may seem happy, but not in Ketterdam, and definitely not for Kaz and his outlaws. Money, their territories, and their reputation is what gives them power, but as you’ll see, that can be stolen with a blink of an eye.Death defying stunts, insane plans (with even more insane back-up plans), and intense page-turning scenes make Six of Crows an epic fantasy worth talk about. Bardugo definitely does not write for the faint of heart, nor for the weak-minded. She writes to gather the tears of readers, and the crushed-hopes of a resolved first book ending.Six of Crows is easily one of my favorite reads for 2015, and all-time. I highly suggest you pick it up at the end of September and devour it.Notable Scene:“It’s just a question of leverage, Nina.”“You don’t know him.”“Don’t I? He’s a person like any other, driven by greed and pride and pain. You should understand that better than anyone.”“Helvar is driven by honor and only honor. You can’t bribe or bully that.”“That may have been true once, Nina, but it’s been a very long year. Helvar is much changed.”“You’ve seen him?” Her green eyes were wide, eager. There thought Kaz, the Barrel hasn’t beaten the hope out of you yet.“I have.”Nina took a deep, shuddering breath. “He wants me dead, Kaz.”“That’s what he wants, not what he needs,” said Kaz. “Leverage is all about knowing the difference.”FTC Advisory: Macmillan provided me with a copy of Six of Crows.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Fun contemporary story that has great characters, steamy romance, and the perfect amount of drama. I was nervous to read this one because I’m not an erotic fan, but I surprisingly really enjoyed it!Opening Sentence: I mentally draw the panels of the scene before me as we follow the receptionist down the marble hallway: the woman wears six-inch black heels, her legs go on forever, her hips shift with each step.The Review:Lola and Oliver got married one drunken night in Vegas eight months ago, but they quickly got an annulment the next day. That night might not have been the start of their marriage but it was the start of an amazing friendship.Lola likes to get lost in her own world and the ones she can create. She feels safer interacting with made up characters versus interacting with real humans. Sure she has some great girl friends that have gotten her through so much, but when it comes to relationships she is an epic failure. The longest she has ever been with a guy is a few months, and all of her relationships have generally ended badly. She just doesn’t feel comfortable around other people easily until she meets Oliver. He just seems to understand her in a way that no one else can. He lets her be who she is and doesn’t judge her for it. That is one of the reasons why they have developed such an amazing friendship, but Lola has been attracted to Oliver since the first day they met. She still wants him all this time later but will being with him mess up the amazing friendship they have together?Oliver knew that first night with Lola that she wasn’t someone he could have a one night stand with. He saw something in her that made him think she could be the girl for him but he also saw how fragile she was and knew that it would take time. Oliver is fine with being patient but when things between them start to heat up he can’t help but jump all the way in. He has wanted Lola forever and now he finally has her. But soon life gets in the way and things go from great to complicated!There were things I loved about Lola and there were things that bugged me a little bit. She is an intelligent, beautiful, organized person that reminded me of myself in many ways. Her creativeness was amazing and I really liked the fact that she was an author. I am obviously a huge book geek, so I have a soft spot for authors. The one thing I struggled with was how she dealt with some of her issues. I get being stressed sucks and I also understand having insecurities, but I just thought the way she dealt with things was a little dumb. With that being said, I ended up really liking Lola and enjoyed reading her story!Oliver is one very sexy man! He is sweet, charming, smart and He is a total comic nerd, which I found very endearing! Then add in the fact that he has a hot accent and I was a total goner for him. I loved his confidence and how understanding he was of Lola’s situation. He never pushed her into something she wasn’t comfortable with, but he push her to be honest and open with him. They have a very fragile relationship but once they figure things out they really are the perfect couple. They have a very passionate connection and some extremely hot chemistry!I was in the mood for a contemporary romance and I happened to win a copy of Dark Wild Night at a Sarah J. Maas signing because Christina Hobbs was moderating the event. Erotic romance is not usually my thing, but I’ve heard really good things about the dynamic duo Christina Lauren, so I thought I would give this a try. After reading this I’m not sure I would actually categorize this as an erotic book because that aspect of the story was almost non-existent. For the most part this was just an adorable contemporary love story that I really enjoyed! It had the perfect amount of drama to keep me interested. There was some great humor that made me laugh but it also delivered a great message! The only thing I might have preferred less of was the sexy times. Don’t get me wrong, I love steamy scenes, but it just had a few more then I prefer. I did not read the previous books in this series, but I would suggest that you do before reading Dark Wild Night. This book can obviously be read as a standalone, but I felt like I was missing some of the inside jokes and extra tidbits because I didn’t know the other character stories. While the secondary characters are really minor in the story, their relationships with the main characters are very important, so I wish I had known more about them. I liked this book enough that I do want to go back and read the previous two! If you are a fan of the series or you like sexy romance books you should definitely pick this one up!!!Notable Scene:She gives me an innocent shrug. “We’re playing poker.”“I’ll clean the floor with you,” I warn, before tilting my bottle to my lips and sipping my beer again.She watches me swallow. “ You can clean the floor with all your clothes while I watch.” I raise an eyebrow at her and she adds, “We’re playing strip poker.”FTC Advisory:  I won a copy of Dark Wild Night.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A fun new adult romance that I enjoyed, but didn’t love!Opening Sentence: I’m standing on stage watching her strut in front of me with a beauty queen swagger.The Review:Devi Dalton is going to start a new life away from her dysfunctional family. She is moving to New York to live with one of her amazing friends and she is lucky enough to land a job that she absolutely loves! The only thing Devi isn’t looking for is to start a relationship with Ben Winslow, the hot guy she has been resisting for months. When they met months ago they had an instant connection, but they come from such different backgrounds that a relationship would never last. Instead of ultimately ending up broken hearted Devi decides to just ignore the attraction and just stay in the friend zone. But how long will Devi be able to deny the desire she feels for Ben?Ben has wanted Devi from the first moment he meet her and he has spent the last six months trying to convince her that they would be amazing together. Now that they are both in New York and live in the same apartment building she can’t avoid him as easily. As soon as it looks like Ben might finally get what he wants, some things from his past threaten the future he has been fighting so hard for.There were things I loved about Devi and there were things about her that grated on my nerves. Let’s start with the good stuff. She is very independent and I really respect that she has made something of herself when she comes from such a poor upraising. I loved that she makes her own dreams come true because she isn’t willing to give up easily. She also has a fun, witty personality that made her very likeable. Now for the stuff that bugged me. I hated how hot and cold she was with Ben. Technically, she doesn’t lead him on because she is pretty honest about how she feels, but her actions seem to say different things than her words, which I didn’t love. It made her come across as flimsy, which I felt wasn’t consistent with her character because in everything other aspect of her life she wasn’t that way. There were also a few times where she would make really stupid decisions and I wasn’t a fan of that. Overall, I did like her character, but I felt like I was let down because she had potential to be a character I loved.Ben is a really sweet guy that knows how to have a good time. He is smart, very good looking, and he knows how to be extremely charming. He comes from a wealthy family, but his childhood was no fairytale. His father left when he was a young boy and ever since he has had to be the man of the house for his mother and 3 younger sisters. His family has relied on him heavily for most of his life and it has been hard for him. I thought his relationship with his family was really adorable and the way he treated his sisters made me totally love him. I also have protective older brothers so his brotherly love just melted my heart. But there were a few things about Ben that I didn’t like as much. Some of the poor choices he makes in the story bothered me and ultimately they ended up making me like the overall story less.For the most part, I really enjoyed the relationship between Ben and Devi. For majority of the book things between them were very hot and cold, which created great tension, but it also got a little annoying after a while. They have hot chemistry and I felt like they were highly compatible even though they come from drastically different upbringings. Their romance was pretty steamy and overall I enjoyed reading their story.Fearless is a fun story with great humor, sexy romance, and fun characters. I really enjoyed the first book in the series and was really looking forward to this one. I thought that the romance was developed great, the pacing was perfect and I did like this book, but unfortunately I didn’t love this one as much as I wanted to. There were a couple things that bothered me but ultimately the most disappointing thing for me was how it ended. It’s not that it was a bad ending, it was more just not my type of story. But with that being said, I still thought it was an entertaining book and to be honest the stuff that bugged me probably won’t bother most people, so if you are a new adult contemporary romance fan you should definitely give it a try.Notable Scene:Ryan starts the count down. “Five. Four. Three. Two.”“What’s going on?” Jett asks.“One!” Ryan screams. We turn, $ip our guns to our shoulders and unload the Super Soakers. Two solid streams of icy water shoot through the air and pelt their chests. Ryan moves her stream up to Jett’s face, and I move mine down to Ben’s crotch. They stumble back a pace, hiss out a series of curses, and start to scramble toward us. Jett slides on the wet $oor, and Ben knocks into his back. We dive into our apartment and slam the door. My !ngers fumble to $ip the dead bolt as Ryan slides down the door laughing hysterically.“Oh, my God, I totally got Jett right in the face!” she gasps.I drop to my knees and join her trying to draw a breath between wails of laughter.“I got Ben in the crotch. It looked like he peed his pants.” Fits of laughter wash over us as we compare notes on the expressions on their faces. I retrieve a roll of paper towels, and we wind them onto our hands and crawl around to mop up the residue, still laughing. “These are awesome!” I say. “This was all we really needed. Why did we buy all that other stuff?” “All that other stuff’s for defense, when they start to retaliate,” she says.“Let the games begin,” I say, and we laugh.FTC Advisory:  Entangled provided me with a copy of Fearless.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faeries TalesQuick & Dirty: Queen of the vampires, co-ruler of hell, is the weird stuff ever going to stop happening?Opening Sentence: “You know how you see someone you love stuck with a job they don’t know how to do?”The Review:Betsy is back in Undead and Unwary! Here is my tiny disclaimer, I have not read this series at all! So I am not positive how soon after Undead and Unsure does Undead and Unwary starts. Betsy has killed Satan and is now the co-ruler of Hell with Laura. Betsy also finds out and begins looking into her father’s death, as her bestie Jessica claims to have seen him. Betsy knows her stepmother Ant is dead as she saw her as a ghost shortly after the accident. Betsy also does time-traveling chasing the twins around.Betsy and Sinclair are still going strong despite the fact that she is sure he is angling to get a piece of Hell for himself. Betsy also finds herself being out maneuvered and being manipulated into taking over all of Hell. It also brings her to the realization that she has a lot of people who care about her and are willing to help her. I am going to stop there as the rest may be spoilers, I will say she does let some people have it!This being my first book in the series, I have to say I wasn’t as confused as I thought I would be for not having read the 12 books before this one. The author also does a great job of foot-noting things so that you know which book previous things happened in. One of the major things I loved about this book was the wit, the weirdness and just the all around funny stuff Betsy says or thinks. She is a klutz and a train-wreck for bad things on bad days, but she tries and cares deeply about the people in her life.Just like in real life she finds herself being used and set-up and isn’t happy about it. The only thing that confused me was the time-traveling, it really wasn’t explained and seemed to be just thrown in. However, since I haven’t read the other books that may not be the case, it may just be something that I am not aware of jumping into this series so late. I did enjoy how the paranormal in this book is just ordinary, it’s no big thing to be a vampire or werewolf or in charge of Hell.I can’t make up my mind about the lack of action, I think most urban fantasy books I read have a ton of action in them, so I am on the fence whether the lack of action bugged me. Or if it was just a really interesting change of pace, someone using their brain to figure out things instead wielding a sword. In fact, while writing this out I have to say I enjoyed that it played a part into why I enjoyed this book, the MC was engaging, witty and totally normally abnormal. I can’t wait to start this series from the beginning so that I really can get to know all the characters and understand fully what is going on behind the scenes.Notable Scene:“The things we do in moments of weakness: recycling in a desperate attempt to save the earth, obsssively updating Amazon wish lists, agreeing to run Hell with the Anitchrist.”“I screamed and nearly fell down the stairs a second time.”“I wanted a baby of my own, and it had orphaned my brother.”“Someone had lost their damned mind and egged the Antichrist.”FTC Advisory: Berkley/Penguin provided me with a copy of Undead and Unwary.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Emotional, gorgeous new adult romance that I devoured. All romance fans need to pick this one up!Opening Sentence: I wipe my nose on the sleeve of my T-shirt, right across the pink Nike swoosh. Disgusting, but it can’t be helped.The Review:Zosia Easton’s mother died a couple of years ago and she’s never quite been the same. She hasn’t taken any risks because she felt like she’s had enough heartache in her life and she doesn’t think she would be able to deal with more. She has a best friend, a loving family, not much of a love life, but at the moment she’s content. But she knows that she is stuck in a rut and she can’t stay there forever. So when her father suggests that she spend the summer in Tokyo with him she decides it’s probably a great opportunity to start over. Then she runs into Finn O’Leary, the boy she has had a crush on ever since high school. Her summer goes from being a relaxing experience to something much more. Finn might be her new start, but she soon realizes that love is complicated and she will have to be patient if she wants their relationship to last!Finn hasn’t always made the best choices in life and he has had some pretty serious consequences because of it. But he finally has his life back on track, he is attending MIT, on the Dean’s List, and has managed to stay out trouble. But some scars run deep and no matter how much you try to cover them up they never seem to go away. Spending the summer with his mother in Tokyo seems like the perfect way to relax and have a good time. What he didn’t expect was that he would fall for a girl that he would never be good enough for!Zosia is a very easy character to like and I felt like I could relate to her. She is smart, cute, and fun, but she also has a fair amount of insecurities. She is naturally a little on the reserved side and after her mother passed away she pretty much lost all her motivation to really succeed. She didn’t start failing or getting in trouble but in areas of her life where she really excelled she just became more average. As the story progresses she slowly comes out of her shell and you finally get to see her to start living life to the fullest. I thought she was a wonderful character and I really enjoyed reading her story!Finn is one sexy guy that I complete fell head over heels for. He has to deal with a lot of inner struggles and watching him heal was inspirational. He is already a good guy, he just needs to realize that he is. With his background and genetic makeup he feels like he’s doomed to fail, but ultimately it is his choice who he becomes. I have always been a fan of hot broken guys and he definitely fits in that category.I loved the relationship between Finn and Zosia, it was insanely cute! They have seriously hot chemistry and are very compatible. I’ve always been a sucker for when a friendship becomes more, but what I love most about this relationship was we got to see their friendship develop first and then the romance come later. Their relationship is definitely not easy but it teaches you that a good thing is worth fighting for no matter how hard it gets.Swimming to Tokyo is an emotional, beautiful romance that I completely loved. The characters in the story were so engaging and I really could sympathize with their stories. There’s tons of great sexual tension that kept me intrigued and the book is extremely fast-paced, so I got through it super quick. I thought the setting was gorgeous and while I’ve never been to Tokyo this made me really want to go and see some of the historical sites there. There were definitely some funny moments that helps to lighten the mood of the story but there was also some very emotional times that really pulled at your heartstrings. Basically, from the very beginning of the story I was totally hooked and read the entire book in one sitting. I honestly can’t say enough good things about it, so if you are a new adult contemporary romance fan this needs to go on your to read list right now. You can thank me later when you enjoy it as much as I did!Notable Scene:“It’s okay, Mom. It is. I’m just freaking out a little. I’m not ready for this. I mean, it’s cool, but I just didn’t think things would change until…”“Until what?” The voice is soft and close in the dark.My eyes fly open and I lurch off the swing. A hand catches my wrist, but I yank it away as soon as I’ve got my footing. “Jesus Christ. What are you doing?”When I look up, my heart drops to my knees.Finn O’Leary, as I live and breathe. Standing a foot away from me. It’s dark, but I know it’s him by the line of his jaw, the smooth buzz of his hair. His white T-shirt glows in the moonlight, and it’s the thing I can see most clearly about him. “I…nothing. What are you doing?”“Nothing. Seriously, what are you doing here and why are you sneaking up on me?” My voice is loud and hard, and my pulse throbs in the back of my knees now.“Whoa. Hey. I’m not sneaking up on you.” He takes a step back and holds his hands up like I’m threatening him.“Really? What would you call it?” I can’t really see Finn’s expression, but in the back of my mind I wonder if I should be worried. I don’t even have my phone with me and it’s not like I know him very well. We had a bunch of random exchanges in high school, but comments on the lunch menu can hardly be called a conversation.“I just…I saw you and I came to see if you were okay. You shouldn’t be here at night by yourself.” His tone hasn’t changed; it’s still soft and even. But, wow, his voice is deep. Has it always been? I’m sure he sounded different that day I saw him in Walgreens. Didn’t he?FTC Advisory: Spencer Hill Press provided me with a copy of Swimming to Tokyo.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: With the Greymalkin sisters safely captured, you would think the Lovegrove cousins could relax a bit. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be the case in this entertaining follow-up to the first book in the series.Opening Sentence: Gretchen was on her way to the Worthing musicale when her head exploded.The Review:Ever since the Greymalkin Sisters were successfully trapped at the end of book one, the Order has been very curious as to how Emma, Penelope, and Gretchen were able to do something much more experienced witches had been unable to do. For their part, the girls are definitely not going to clue the Order into the fact that Emma is actually a Greymalkin herself, something which made their success possible. The Order has set Keepers to watch all three of them, so they can go nowhere without eyes on their every move. Gretchen – free spirit that she is – feels the most tied down by this, especially since her designated Keeper is none other than the extremely proper and tightlaced Tobias Lawless. When wards start failing all over London, however, Gretchen is going to find herself relying on her gift for hearing spells as well as Tobias’ knowledge of magic in order to help keep the city safe. For someone out there has decided to resurrect all seven Greymalkin sisters, and if they succeed, London will never be the same again.I enjoyed the first book in this series, so I was looking forward to reading this one. While I enjoyed it, it did feel as if nothing much was really happening for the first half of the book. It was still entertaining to read, as I love all three Lovegrove cousins, but the plot really wasn’t advancing. Then it seemed as if everything started happening at once, and the book really picked up speed, especially in the last 20 percent or so. It became very hard to put down.I think my biggest complaint would be that it was very obvious who some of the bad guys were early on in the book, so there really wasn’t any shock on my part when they were finally revealed. I seem to recall having the same issue with the first book. It wasn’t so bad as to wreck my enjoyment of the book, but it was occasionally frustrating that none of the characters seemed to have a clue. On the other hand, there was one big shock for me towards the end that I did not see coming at all, which was very gratifying after my previously mentioned disappointment.As I mentioned before, I love all three of the cousins, so I do like getting to see all of their points of view throughout the story. However, I will admit to wanting more of Gretchen and less of Emma, probably because Emma was the main focus of book one, so I was ready to have more of a focus on a different cousin. There’s nothing wrong with Emma’s sections, but I just loved Gretchen so much that I didn’t want to leave her.All in all, this was a very satisfying follow-up to book one. There is a major cliffhanger at the end of this one though, so readers beware! You’re definitely going to want book three on hand once you finish this book. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing what happens next!Notable Scene:“I will cast three spells, each slightly incorrect. You will act as though you have not noticed anything untoward, and then you will tell me what is wrong with each spell.”Gretchen braced herself.“Begin.”She curtsied, feeling like an idiot. Miss Hopewell used salt to create a symbol on the floor. She couldn’t tell what was off about the spell, or what it was meant to do, only that it must be something minor. The sound in her head was like waves on the shore, or bird wings, constant but not unpleasant. She strained to hear words, but there was only that murmur. She teetered slightly on her back foot and nearly lost her balance. Daphne and Clarissa exchanged haughty glances, back on the same side. Gretchen gritted her teeth.“Again,” Miss Hopewell said. “This time you will take a turn about the room.”Gretchen circled the room, casting a longing glance at the door as she passed by it.Miss Hopewell sighed. “I haven’t even begun yet, Gretchen, and that is all wrong. You are meant to glide, not march. This is not the militia.”Gretchen contemplated inventing a new spell that would turn Miss Hopewell’s hair into snakes.Instead, she walked, she glided, she positively floated. And she still felt like an idiot.An idiot with needles piercing her brain.The buzzing was sudden and painful. The waves were gone, replaced with the grinding of a blade on a whetstone, the screeching of gulls, the relentless grating of rusty  hinges. She was instantly queasy.“Keep gliding,” Miss Hopewell  ordered, but her voice was very far away. There were too many other voices all talking at once. Trying to sort through them was like trying to unravel a knotted carpet. She tried to focus on just one word, one tone, the way Mrs. Sparrow had told her to. It was like trying to hold on to water.“Unring the bell.”There. A thread. She followed it, her eyes scrunched tight. She’d stopped trying to walk. She almost had it. Pain ricocheted inside her skull. But she wouldn’t let go. Neither would they, it seemed.“We are still here.”“Stop it!” That was Penelope, trying to hold her up. “Can’t you see her ears are bleeding?”Miss Hopewell rushed forward. The other students squeaked with alarm. It was just one more layer of voices.Gretchen threw up into a potted plant.“Well, that’s not very ladylike,” Daphne remarked.FTC Advisory: Bloomsbury provided me with a copy of Whisper the Dead.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: While not connected to the overarching storyline, this book was a fast-paced, entertaining read from start to finish. I did not want to put it down!Opening Sentence: “Do you think she knows what we’re up to?” Menolly fretted.The Review:Life has never been calm for the D’Artigo sisters. After their latest experience, they’re all hoping for some downtime, but fate has other plans in mind. At the grand-reopening of the Wayfarer, their cousin shows up with a very angry Viking ghost in tow. Turns out, Daniel stole an ancient sword that houses a spirit who wants out so he can wreak havoc on the world. While the sisters try to figure out what to do, the sword is stolen again, this time by someone who wants to help the spirit get out. Now, they’re in a race against time and need to find the sword before it’s too late.I had a little trouble getting into the last book, so I was slightly hesitant about starting this one. Thankfully, my worries were unfounded, as this book starts quickly and never lets up. There always seems to be something going on, and I had a hard time putting the book down, as I constantly wanted to see what would happen next. For the most part, the action in this story takes place outside of the overarching storyline, so it could be read as a standalone if someone new to the series wanted to try it. As someone who has only read the previous two books in the series, this one was probably the most accessible for me as a new reader.I’ve now been able to read a book from each sister’s perspective, and I would have to say, I think Delilah is my favorite. She was very easy for me to connect to. There is a pretty big development in her fiance Shade’s life in this book, and Delilah’s reaction seemed very realistic, and it made it that much easier for me to connect to her as a character. I’m also very interested to see how this development affects her and Shade’s future.My one complaint would be that there seemed to be a lot of instances of repetition. For example, it’s mentioned multiple times how Delilah prefers her laptop, but always has a tablet around for convenience’s sake. Not that big of a deal, but it got extremely annoying with each subsequent repetition.All in all, I was very pleased with this installment of the Otherworld series. After reading three books in the series, it was this one that finally convinced me to go all the way back to book one and see how it all began. I think fans of the series will be pleased with this one, and I for one am very interested to see what’s going to happen next!Notable Scene:“Everybody stand back. We can never tell when I have a misfire what’s going to happen.”Everybody took a big step back, leaving her in the middle of the room, alone. Even Morio winced and edged back.With a deep breath, Camille held up one hand as she closed her eyes. The prickle of magic began to spin in the air — she was summoning the Moon Mother’s power, calling it into her. I could almost see the shimmering in the air as she let out a long breath and rolled her neck, then brought her head up. As her eyes opened, her violet irises were shimmering with flecks of silver.Creature of Fae, by name Aslo I call you,Where are you? Show me the way,Blood to flesh, an arrow points,Lady of the Moon, reveal my prey.As the last word rang out, there was a sudden crash of thunder in the room and a brilliant light flashed out, like a lightning ball, surrounding Camille and temporarily blinding me. She screamed, but in the neon blue glow of the light, I couldn’t see what was happening. The next moment, the room was plunged into darkness, and the jar from someone hitting the floor hard shook the room.FTC Advisory: Penguin/Jove provided me with a copy of Panther Prowling.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Well researched, captivating, and fascinating; an impressive sequel to an already gorgeous first book.Opening Sentence: The girl known as Gretchen Whitestone bicycled down the country lane.The Review:Gretchen and Daniel escaped from Germany, and now live a content life in England. For once, Gretchen doesn’t have to fear her brother’s dangerous moods or her mother’s biting words – most of all, Gretchen doesn’t have to fear the man who she used to call “Uncle Dolf” . . . Hitler. She was his “sunshine” for years and used to be in his inner circle, but after uncovering the plot that got her father killed and realizing the true extent of his plans for the Jews, she has escaped. The Whitestones are a loving, kind family.Then Daniel gets word about a family member dying, and he rushes back to Germany to see them. Gretchen fears for him; if he is caught than it will mean certain death after days of torture. When he doesn’t come back, she takes matters into her own hands and goes back to her homeland to find the man she loves so dearly. What she doesn’t expect is to find him with a false murder charge over his head, and to become knee deep in another scandal. They have thirteen days before the Enabling Act is passed and Hitler assumes dictatorship. Can they uncover the layers of secrets and expose him as the man he is, before he takes total control over her country?I hadn’t read the first book in a while prior to reading this, so I was a little worried about diving right back in to Gretchen and David’s story. Luckily, Blankman flawlessly delivers a recap into the first couple chapters and it came back to me. I fell into her gorgeous writing, the melodic flow of her sentences, once again. I was enchanted by the detail in both the history and the imagery, and fascinated where she would take Gretchen and David this book. I love them as a couple and was rooting for them one hundred percent, so I was devastated when their relationship got rocky, but at least it was for realistic reasons. I like how they accepted that the other person wasn’t the only thing they needed in the other’s life, but still worked to make the romance work.The secrets were even deeper in this second novel, and I was again impressed by how each clue led to another. It was a perfect blend of mystery and thriller, and the tension got thick enough to cut with a knife. New characters were introduced, each of them with complex personalities and all of them giving something new to the story. Hitler was terrifying to me, and Gretchen as well – he left an imprint on her psyche that she can’t erase. He was the most interesting character, because there were so many different layers to him, and I liked how the author explored each facet of the dangerous man.This novel was another delicious installment in the Prisoner of Night and Fog series, and I enjoyed it immensely. I’m not a huge historical fiction reader, but I was still swallowed into this novel, and I loved that I now feel very informed about that period in history. Blankman truly covered all her bases. If you enjoyed the first, I promise that the second gets even darker, more dangerous, and more high-stakes than before!Notable Scene:When she’d first moved to England, sometimes she missed her old hate. Back when she’d been Uncle Dolf’s darling, she’d wrapped herself in it like a coat, and felt warm and protected. Safe. Without it, she’d been stripped bare. Vulnerable and aching in the cold.Hate had made her life easy. Hitler had taught her so carefully. Any of the wrongs done to her could be traced back to Jewish or Communist hands. A poor exam mark meant her teacher didn’t approve of her political beliefs; a slight from friends on the playground meant the Jewish students had turned their classmates against her. Nothing was her fault.Love was so much harder, messy and complicated and confusing.FTC Advisory: Balzar+Bray/HarperTeen provided me with a copy of Conspiracy of Blood and Smoke.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: This densely packed book didn’t give me the suspense nor tension that I expected; nevertheless, the writing was pretty and the characters complex.Opening Sentence: The last of her seven falcons balanced on her wrist, Nova Chastain walked back out onto the balcony once more.The Review:Archenfield’s leader has just been assassinated, plunging the kingdom into chaos. Suddenly, his Edling Jared is pushed into the spotlight, forced into a crown he’s not sure he’s ready for. Everyone expects something from him, and he doesn’t think he can satisfy everyone. Not only this, but they still must find his brother’s killer – the blood price must be paid. Asta Peck, the physician’s apprentice, is bright and curious, the perfect ally for Jared – or maybe more than an ally. As more and more people fall victim to murders, secret romances are revealed and new clues come to light, but will it be enough to bring the killer to justice once and for all? And even if they can, will Jared ever become the ruler his brother was and lead a whole kingdom to prosperity?I read this in pieces. This book was five hundred pages. Given, I’ve read much bigger books, but this one had such thick description that it was incredibly dense. Reading one page felt like reading three, so it got hard to read this novel. First I got about halfway through, and then I couldn’t take it, and stopped for a few months. Then I read the rest later on in a few days. The problem wasn’t the length, it was really the lack of action and the absence of good tension that made it feel so dull. Luckily, this book did have something good going for it. The writing was beautiful, and enjoyable in its melodic flow; it was perfect for the high fantasy genre it was placed in.The characters were also good in this novel as well. There is a lot of them, so you have to reference the little chart at the beginning quite a bit until you can get the hang of them all. One thing that Somper did that was cool to me was feature many different side character’s points of view. He probably gave around ten different characters their own chapters. You got to see a small but incredibly revealing glimpse into their thoughts, emotions, and turmoil in just a couple pages, and it definitely helped to understand the world and created empathy in readers.Jared and Asta were a team in this novel. They worked together and Jared at some points thought that Asta was the only one he could trust. She was curious and thirsted for truth, and although Jared tried to keep her safely on the sidelines, eventually she was too immersed in the mystery to back out. There was this whole thing with “he’s a king, he can’t be a real friend” going on, but Jared didn’t give that an ounce of credit. Something super funny is that despite the obvious chemistry between the two, in five hundred pages they didn’t kiss once. Okay, I lied – but a peck on the cheek hardly counts as a kiss. I’m assuming something will happen in the next book. It must.Altogether, I thought this book achieved certain facets such as the characters, writing style, and rich imagery. Other aspects, not so much. It failed in tension and suspense. I have heard, actually, that other people thought it had rich tension, but I couldn’t see it at all. It made the book feel incredibly long, longer than it needed to be. Nevertheless, I feel that certain people will enjoy the lush medieval setting and intrigue of the murder mystery, so go ahead and give it a try – but maybe pick it up from the library first, instead of buying it?Notable Scene:“What’s that you say, child?” Elin inquired of her.Silva’s eyes had a new determination about them. “Anders lives on in me.”“What exactly do you mean?”Silva smiled sweetly but she did not answer with words. Instead, she simply raised a delicate hand and placed it apon her belly.FTC Advisory: Little, Brown Books for Young Readers/Hachette Book Group provided me with a copy of Allies and Assassins.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A thrilling follow up to The Jewel, with even more twists and turns.Opening Sentence: The arcana is silent.The Review:Multitude of spoilers for first book. Read at own risk! In the first book, Violet was purchased by the Duchess of the Lake to have her baby, because of a genetic malfunction that doesn’t allow the upper class to have their own children. Violet was forced to learn the painful Auguries, magic that comes at a vicious price, and was told to be proud of her stance as a surrogate.But when she learned the truth about the pregnancies – that none of the surrogates survived – she was even more swept up in the rebellion that is brewing against the Jewel and its rich, selfish occupants. Now Violet is on the run with her love interest Ash. They are trying to escape the Jewel and get to a safe place, but no matter where they hide, will it be good enough? Because the Walled City has secrets of its own, and they are about to be revealed.I really enjoyed the first book of this series, so when I picked up the second at ALA this summer (which, by the way, I totally recommend – I went to SDCC as well and I think ALA topped it), I was super excited. I had a few ideas for where I thought this series was going, besides gorgeous pictures of dresses as covers. And let me tell you, this series went in a completely different way then I expected, and I loved it. Violet has grown as a character in many ways, although she still has a bit to go, and I loved watching her evolve as the novel went on.The aspect of the book that I disliked in the last novel was Ash. He had a sad background, I’ll give him that, but I was annoyed by how fast their relationship flew right off the ground, despite the forbidden nature of the romance. It only took a couple intimate moments for them to be confessing their never-ending love. This novel, he did grow on me, though I was still far from convinced. It was still too insta-love in the first book, but watching different facets of his characters and seeing his flaws made their relationship seem a little more real to me.Altogether, I was very impressed with the second book of this series. It was thrilling, exciting, and I really enjoyed where the author took it. The novel was left open ended (just like the last) and there is lots of potential for more surprises in the third novel, which I await anxiously! Seriously, though . . . what does Amy Ewing have with cliffhangers?! They’re just cruel! If you liked the The Jewel, I can guarantee you will enjoy the second just as thoroughly, maybe more – I certainly did!Notable Scene:“I’ll be back tonight,” she says. Then she closes the hatch before I have the chance to thank her, or ask any questions, or wonder if there might be something to eat up here.I am sealed off, in an attic, in a strange house, on the Bank.I am utterly on my own.FTC Advisory: HarperTeen provided me with a copy of The White Rose.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: One young woman, two hot men… A forbidden love and everything torn apart.Opening Sentence: “The Collier’s Winter Ball was considered one of the most exciting events of the winter season.”The Review:Hangs my head shamefully. I haven’t read yet another series, however, let me just say this, if the rest are as hot as this book well, *fans self* consider me a lover of this series and I am adding the first book and going back and reading them all. Alyssa is a Senator’s daughter and she meets Shane and Sebastian at the Winter Ball. From the moment they met, the three of them are attracted to each other. Alyssa isn’t that shocked when she finds them with a woman pressed between them. And yes, this is the moment that you know this book is going to include a not so normal relationship and that you are totally okay with that because it’s smoking hot!Shane and Sebastian don’t press Alyssa when they first meet her, instead they wait for several months until she is in Spain and then begin wooing her.  The courtship and the relationship make you want to take a cold shower while reading this. I am not going to say what tears them apart at this point because I think that gives too much away that you will want to read for yourself. Needless to say there is a deeper mystery that is very much central to the story.Several spoilerly things happen and our main characters are suffering very much when finally they are back together to work out everything! Let’s just say blackmail, murder, attempted murder and well hot steamy erotic sex are all happening in this book!When I saw Alyssa’s age in the book I thought maybe she was a bit too young (she starts off 18 in the beginning), but I really have to say that I loved the author taking a shy virgin and having her totally okay with getting her freak on! I also loved that Alyssa, Shane and Sebastian had zero issues with their relationship being what it was. There was no jealousy even in the one on one encounters, and the guys loved each in the familial way as they were cousins, but they were also used to sharing women sexually. Lora Leigh takes a forbidden type romance and serves it up in such a way that when your done reading it you are totally okay with it and totally loving the three of them together.I really can’t say anything bad about this book, I totally loved it. And I say that with three people as a couple isn’t usually my thing, not that I see relationships as just one way, but because often they are kind of portrayed unrealistically or can be done as just a sex book with no plot. Which none of these things are done in this book, the mystery keeps you on the edge, the sex is just enough to be super hot and the romance is just great! So if you are new to the series or been reading it all along, then keep reading because Secret Pleasure is so worth your time.Notable Scenes:“The hidden, the mysterious, the rumors and scandalous whispers of some of the more erotic artwork pulled Alyssa into the darker areas.”“It was damned freaky how much her entire body seemed to like their voices.”“They offered the forbidden and made her feel alive.”“It was stealing their souls and they had no way of fighting it.”“As long as she had them.”FTC Advisory: St. Martin’s Griffin/Macmillan provided me with a copy of Secret Pleasure.

Beth Bloom is about Eva, a young girl determined to write a modern classic. A classic to appeal to peers in her own generation. But Eva quickly realizes that in order to write a modern classic, it would probably be best to have gone through a few experiences. And in hopes to experience life, she gets a job as a summer camp counselor, she reevaluates her current friendships, and she builds new ones with people that surprise her.Eva’s life transitions from high school to college, where she decides to become a Writing, Literature & Publishing major. But her lack of adventures leads her towards a summer day camp for girls and Foster, who also works at the camp. To further step out of the box, she attends a graduation party, which leads her to Elliot. Elliot has a lot of swoony band moments that solidifies the budding friendship.It was a little difficult for me to connect to Bloom’s Eva. To be fair, I’m in a different place now than where Eva is. Eva is young and filled with bright, vivid dreams. She speaks to the reader in an honest and poignant way. She shares her hopes, dreams, and ambitions. But along the way, there is a moment that she begins to grow. I feel that it’s difficult for any woman in her shoes, in the in-between, and more so when there is so much added self-pressure.Bloom’s voice for Eva and the other characters were straightforward, and Eva can come out to sound pretentious. It felt that at times I didn’t appreciate everything she had to say, let alone her actions. I felt disconnected from her and couldn’t understand her actions for certain things. There was a turning point, where Eva decides to change her ways.Don’t Ever Change is a good book. It had many different plot points and turning points for a coming-of-age young adult novel. But my personal preferences just didn’t get me to completely connect to the story.Notable Scene:“You bought me a soda?” I say.“I know the bartender,” Elliot says. “It was free.”“I only want it if it you bought it,” I joke. “If it took some effort.”“Well, I tried pretty hard not to spill,” he says, and sticks out his tongue playfully. The cold of the ice has turned his tongue hot pink.“Do you want to go and actually watch the band?” I say. “You know, see the music play?”“You can’t see music,” Elliot says, like it’s his deep personal philosophy.“What was the better one then?” I ask. “You were saying you had a better one. . . .”“Oh yeah. It’s by A. A. Milne—know him?”“The guy who wrote Pooh,” I say.“C’mon, it wasn’t that bad,” Elliot says.“Okay, what’s the quote?”“So Christopher Robin asks what day it is and Piglet says, ‘It’s today,’ and then Pooh says”—here Elliot leans down, his face close to mine—“Pooh says, ‘Today. My favorite day.’”“Is this a real date?” I ask, my eyes right beneath his, my nose just below his nose.“It’s a little date,” he says. He chomps on another cube of ice. “A half date.”“Still half to ask me,” I say, pretty pleased I left my bedroom for once in my whole life.FTC Advisory: HarperTeen provided me with a copy of Don’t Ever Change.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: He is trying to find a new path in life, and she is hiding an amazing talent. Together they are going to make things happen or drive each other nuts!Opening Sentence: “Garrett’s head pounded, and not from the hangover that would greet him with the sunrise, but from being slammed against the wall.”The Review:So, this is the third book, but for those of you who haven’t read this series no worries, no spoilers from me as this is first one I have read! Under the Spotlight is the story of Garrett Jamieson, the oldest brother in a trio group the Jamieson’s. Okay this may be spoilerly so don’t look, the group has broken up and Garrett is adrift searching for something else to do with his life. He knows he wasn’t the most talented member of the group so going solo isn’t for him. His dad suggests producing and calls in some favors for Garrett and off to Chicago he goes.Riley is starting her first full-time job, a favor that was called in from a friend she met while on a reality show for singers. But only Barry, the owner of the studio, knows she was on that show! Until Garrett finds the YouTube videos from that timeframe. When one of Riley’s favorite bands shows up to do some recording and Garrett blows her cover she agrees to sing with Steven and blows everyone away. Especially when they realize she hasn’t sung in over five years.Riley’s mom causes all kinds of drama and lands Riley in a financial mess and Garrett’s solution is for Riley to record a record. Along the way they discover that they have feelings for each other, but tragedy strikes and all is left hanging in the balance. I know I am horrible, but I want you to read it and not tell you everything!I loved this book, it was great! Drew me right in and even though I haven’t read the other two books it’s clear that each book focuses on a brother, so I wasn’t missing out on much by not reading the first two! However, I plan on reading the first two as soon as I can. I love good romances and this is a good romance. Riley and Garrett of course start off on the wrong foot but they really take the time to know each other and interact with each other before they even begin kissing!Riley is fiery and completely unafraid to put superstar Garrett in his place. They really balance each other out and it makes the book great! Bonus if you love music this is the book for you! I really actually wanted to hear the singing! So if you haven’t read any of these books, what are you waiting for…go forth and get them!Notable Scenes:“The chick with red hair and cute little diamond nose had been drilling lasers at his back the whole time.”“Gee, maybe stealing her chance to be assistant engineer the other day, or his big announcement that he planned to produce her records.”“No way was this little flit of a girl going to best him.”“Everyone she worked with seemed to fall in love with her.”“And without thinking, he leaned forward and kissed her.”“He captured her mouth and rewarded her with long, lingering kisses.”FTC Advisory: HarperTeen provided me with a copy of Under the Spotlight.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: For the diehard fantasy fan, this novel has a richly detailed world and complex characters.Opening Sentence: Even as a grown woman of fifteen, Alfgyfa never stopped thinking about the wolves she had encountered as a child.The Review:An Apprentice to Elves is the third novel in The Iskryne series by Elizabeth Bear and Sarah Monette. This is definitely a series/novel for the die-hard fantasy novel fan. An Apprentice to Elves can be read as a standalone novel. I didn’t read the first two novels but the last one mainly focuses on the main characters’ daughter, Alfgyfa and her journey as she is torn between two worlds, those of regular humans and the svartalfar (elves).Alfgyfa is human but she isn’t quite just a regular plain human, she can communicate with wolves just like her father. As a child she was sent to live with the svartalfar to apprentice as a blacksmith. It was done as a political move by her father because he knew that the elves needed to see a human grow up and hopefully the elves may offer to help to the Northmen (Alfgyfa’s fellow countrymen) when they go to war with the Rheans (southern invaders).An Apprentice to Elves does not just focus on Alfgyfa. The novel also follows several other characters, Otter, Tin and Fargrimr and how the impending war effects each of their lives. Otter was once a Rhean slave. She knows their tactics and tries to help the Northmen with what is coming. Otter has made a better life for herself since she was rescued and hopes that she will never return to Rhean control ever again. Tin is the elf master blacksmith that is training Alfgyfa. She knows what it means to have a human in her home and hopes that the other elves will understand why an alliance can help them all. Fargrimr is a plain ‘ol human in charge of a settlement. His brother can speak to wolves. It is Fargrimr who mainly has to deal with the Rheans.I absolutely loved the fantasy world that was set up in An Apprentice to Elves. I enjoyed the complexity between the humans who could communicate with wolves and those who couldn’t. Also, for the elves, the svartalfar whom are metal working elves to the excommunicated aettrynalfar elves whom could shape stone. I really liked the in depth detail about the everyday lives of all and how they each have adapted to the cold environment that they live. The Northmen are very similar to the Vikings.I didn’t read the first two novels in this series so I did struggle with the terms at first. I didn’t quite understand the differences between wolfcarls, wolfheofodmenn, heal, konungur, trellwolves, wolfsprechend, karl, jarl and so forth. Most of these terms were not explained so I was left trying to figure out what they meant. By the end of the novel I did have a good idea of what everything meant. I didn’t get a chance to read the beginning of the novel again but I think I would be able to understand what was happening knowing now what I didn’t know then. This was a very slow read for me because of all the strange words.There is a feminine message to An Apprentice to Elves. Alfgyfa often thinks about how different it is to be female as a human as opposed to being a female elf. Human females are often just for childbearing and housework while female elves are revered and in charge. They even get to do what they want like blacksmithing. A human female blacksmith would just be looked upon in disgust like the female elf is respected. There is also a deeper story with Fargrimr, which I’m sure is explained in one of the previous novels, but for this one, I was left in the dark so Fargrimr was very complex and left me wanting to know exactly what is up with “his” story.If this novel is the final one in the trilogy, it does have an ending. I just felt it wrapped it up quickly. I like to have a little more closure in the final book.Overall, An Apprentice to Elves is a well-rounded fantasy novel. The characters were quite complex and interesting. I really wanted to know their stories. An Apprentice to Elves is definitely a novel for those who really love fantasy novels because of the language (including the way characters talk and the titles) and the third person alternating views.Notable Scene:“Take Alfgyfa back to the Iskryne with you when you go.”Tin looked at him crookedly. She hadn’t mentioned Alfgyfa’s apprentice difficulties to him. She wondered if Alfgyfa had. “She’s not happy there.”“She’s not happy here, either. “ Isolfr said bleakly. “And she’s safer with you.”“About that, I assure you, she does not care.”He grinned, obviously proud. Humans were all mad. “She was always a wild creature. But if she stays here, the best she can hope for . . . the best she can hope for is to stay at the heal and take Thorlot’s place, but it’s far more likely she’ll get in trouble with with one of the tithe-boys the way her mother got in trouble with me. And then, it’s not that the heal wouldn’t support her and her child, but I fear . . .” He held his clenched fist out in front of him, then opened it, as if throwing all Alfgyfa’s potential to the wind.“She loves the smithing,” Tin said, reaching up to pat him on the shoulder. “If you had meant to choose for her, you chose well.”FTC Advisory: Tor/Macmillan provided me with a copy of An Apprentice to Elves.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Despite the slow start, this ended up being a very entertaining story filled with engaging characters, sweet romance, and a beautiful setting! I would highly recommend this to all young adult fantasy fans!Opening Sentence: Take the key from your grandmother’s portrait.The Review:Nicolette was the daughter of a very wealthy merchant. Their fortune came from her father selling her mother’s amazing inventions. Nick loved all of her mother’s inventions and at a very young age she started to learn the trade, but unfortunately her training stopped when her mother died unexpectedly. Her father soon remarried a wealthy woman that had two daughters. Nick thought that she would get a new family, but instead her father passed away and she was turned into a servant in her own house.But when she turned sixteen she receives a mysterious letter at her bedroom door that leads her to her mother’s secret workshop. Soon Nick starts to train again by reading all of her mother’s old journals and notes. She quickly realizes that she is talented and for the first time in years she has hope that she can change her future. There is a technological exposition being held in just a few short months and if Nick can get someone to fund some of her inventions she can support herself and finally live the life she wants.  On her journey she meets new friends and a prince that captures her attention, but does she really want to live the happily ever after everyone thinks she should or does she want to live her own kind of happily ever after?Nicolette is an interesting protagonist that I found to be very likeable. For the last 10 years of her life she has just been going through the motions and not really living. After the death of her mother she was devastated and her entire life was turned upside down. She had an ok relationship with her father but it wasn’t anything like the closeness she felt to her mother. At a very young age her mother started training her how to create inventions and Nick fell in love with all aspects of mechanics. As she grew up this love only grew and she was always trying to find ways to use her very limited skills. When she finds her mother’s workshop she is able to really perfect and develop her talents.I loved watching Nick grow throughout the story. She is obviously very intelligent, but she is a little on the awkward side when it comes to interacting with others. She starts out as this shy girl with very little confidence, but as you read the story she slowly gains more and more confidence. She goes from someone that just does what she is told to a girl that takes charge of her own destiny and makes her own dreams come true. She does have some flaws as well, but nothing that bugged me or annoyed me in any way.  Overall, I thought she was a very inspirational character and I really enjoyed reading her story.For the most part this story was just about Nicolette and the very few people she interacts with. There is a fairly large cast of secondary characters and I really enjoyed getting to know all of them, but to not spoil anything I am just going to leave them out of this review!Mechanica is an adorable story that I loved, but it was a rough start for me. I started reading this and I actually put it down after about 30 or pages because it just wasn’t keeping my interest. I’m not sure if it was just the mood I was in or if it was the story itself, but I seriously considered not finishing it. Then I was talking to a few of my great bookish friends and they told me how much they loved it so I decided to give it another try and I am so glad I did. I did have to push through the first 75 pages or so, but after that I was totally hooked. The steampunk world was captivating and I loved how it was lightly based on the fairy tale Cinderella. The characters were engaging and very easy to connect with. There is very little romance in the story, but the little there was written really well. It was a pretty quick read for me, which normally I feel like fantasies seem to take me a while to get through because there is so much to process when you are being introduced to a new world. But with Mechanica that’s not the case and I found it quite refreshing. The ending was not what I was expecting, but it really worked with the story. I believe this was written as a standalone, but things were left pretty open so Cornwell could easily write a sequel and I hope she does. While I did have a hard time with the book at first, I would still highly recommend it to any young adult fantasy fans!Notable Scene:I dug through the desk drawers, selecting a few matched pairs of gears. I held them against my instep, estimating the fit as best I could—I didn’t have time to work out full measurements and diagrams. When I was satisfied with my choices, I turned toward the furnace. I had no dyes left, but I thought that perhaps clear glass would be best, after all. Then people could see the gears working, could see each of my steps. The shoes could be the final component of my display. Even if they didn’t turn out to be comfortable, they’d certainly be unique.FTC Advisory: Clarion Books/HMH Publishing provided me with a copy of Mechanica.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Epic high fantasy that will leave you breathless and dying for the next book. Brimming with magic, romance, and adventure, this is sure to be a hit with all YA fantasy fans!Opening Sentence: “Let them in.”The Review:It is Cyrene Strohm’s seventeenth birthday, which means it is also her Presenting day. The day she will be assigned into a class and given a position that she will have for the rest of her life. There are 3 classes and the Third Class is a mix of craftsmen, merchants, and farmers. The Second Class consists of mostly the guard service and all those that help with creating military weapons. The First Class are made up of the Affiliates and the High Lords that help to run the country. It has always been Cyrene’s dream to become an Affiliate to the Queen and her dream is about to come true. Cyrene grew up in a very prestigious family and she has always had high expectations of her future. What she didn’t expect was court life to be so dangerous and difficult to navigate.On her Presenting day Cyrene received a letter full of riddles and as a birthday gift her sister gave her a book that is blank to everyone but Cyrene. She starts to hear voices inside her head, and it seems like she is being constantly watched. To top things off there are dark brutal murders happening at the palace.Cyrene was bred to be the perfect Affiliate, but she soon finds herself caught between the man she can’t fall for and the queen she is suppose to serve.  Will she choose loyalty or love? Or is there another path she is supposed to take all together? Find out in this sweeping high fantasy that you won’t want to put down!Cyrene is a very bold character. She is witty, flirtatious, and intelligent. She was really fun to get to know and I felt an instant connection with her. On top of all of her endearing qualities she also has some major flaws which made her a more realistic character. She tends to make rash decisions at times, and she is a little overconfident at times, but she is also a sweet, loving, loyal person. I felt like she grew tremendously as a character throughout the story, and by the end she had really come into her own. She still has a long journey ahead of her and I am really excited to see where her story goes in the next book.Edric is a very charming, swoon worthy, hot king that you can’t help but find intriguing. His relationship with Cyrene is very cute. They have an instant connection, an amazing chemistry, but things do develop a little too quickly for my liking. I think they could become an epic couple, but they still have a long way to go. To be perfectly honest, I felt like you didn’t get to know Edric as well as I would have liked, and I am hoping in the future books we get to explore his personality a little bit more. What I do you know of him I really like so far, but I can’t say whether or not I would pick him for Cyrene.Kael is a mysterious character that I really can’t quite figure out. One moment he seems like he could be a villain and then the next moment he turns into the charming prince you want to fall for. To be perfectly honest his relationship with Cyrene is rocky from the start. They seem to have a connection as well, but at this point I can’t really tell if it’s romantic or not. Kael really intrigues me as a character and I’m very interested to see how he develops in the future books.The Affiliate is an action-packed, romantic, adventurous book that I couldn’t put down. From the first moment I picked it up I was instantly hooked and finished the entire book in one sitting. I really enjoyed the entire cast of characters including all of the secondary characters they were all so well written and very engaging. The book is definitely full of lots of drama, political intrigue, and romance. I thought that the romance develops a little quickly, but I still really enjoyed it. I do want to mention that I know it looks like there is a love triangle because I talked about two boys earlier my review, but honestly I don’t think it was really much of a love triangle. It’s pretty obvious who Cyrene is going to end up with. So if you are not a fan of love triangles, I think that you would be fine reading the story. The book was definitely not perfect, but I cannot deny that it was very entertaining. The book was very fast-paced but there were a few times it felt a little choppy and not as smooth as I would’ve liked it to be. There were also moments where I got a little confused about what was happening and I feel that there were a lot of unanswered questions that I still have. But this is only the first book, so I’m sure that many of those unanswered questions will be answered in future books. I am really looking forward to the next book in the series. This is my first book by Linde and I found her writing to be very captivating, and addictive. She really knows how to weave a wonderful story and I look forward to reading other books by her. Overall, this was an extremely enjoyable story and I would highly recommend it to any young adult fantasy fans.Notable Scene:Her lips quirked up into a haughty smirk. “Yes, My King.”King Edric paused, eyeing her mouth. “Do you always wear that smirk?”She tried to tramp down the expression on her face, but she didn’t seem to be able to. “Yes, My King.” His blue-grey eyes narrowed, and her heart thumped. Why can’t I keep a lid on my attitude today of all days?FTC Advisory: K.A, Linde/InkslingerPR provided me with a copy of The Affiliate.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Tempest Rising is the opening salvo in a soap opera war with plenty of drama, intrigue and deceptions. This first installment didn’t have much in the way of romance but it did have some passionate scenes.Opening Sentence: Pounding rain battered the roof of Ginny Moreno’s twenty-year-old Toyota Camry, and she tightened her grip on the steering wheel even as she leaned forward, as if that would somehow help her see through the impenetrable sheets of rain.The Review:If you are a huge fan of soap operas, than you must check out the Rising Storm series. This soap opera event in print from was spearheaded by Julie Kenner and Dee Davis. A total of eight authors (including Lexi Blake, Elisabeth Naughton, Jennifer Probst, Larissa Ione, Rebecca Zanetti and Lisa Mondello) have come together to each write an episode set in Storm, Texas to tell the trials and tribulations of the residents.Tempest Rising is the set up novel laying out the cast of characters and the drama in this little town in Texas. Unfortunately, this review is going to be pretty short because I can’t say too much without giving a lot away. I will highlight the character of Ginny Moreno because it is upon her return to Storm that the secrets and lies come to light. Soap opera staples that you will read are a tragic accident, a surprise pregnancy, a game of “Who’s the Daddy?” plus much more.As with all soap operas there are many characters and many stories to tell so there are many POV’s. If you don’t like multiple views then you will not like this, but it is a soap opera and you can’t tell it without having all the different views, insights and secrets. I was a little surprised by the actual lack of romance (and considering the only hook up is a cheating couple, I’m kind of glad I didn’t have to read that). There is lots of passion and emotions are flowing after the death of the young man in town.I kind of wished that there had been a list of the characters and how they are related to the other characters in the novel because I did find I was forgetting who was who as the stories were laid out. Other than that, I really enjoyed the Sherriff’s story. I can’t wait to find out the fallout of what he did.Tempest Rising is everything you love and hate about soap operas. I really enjoyed Chapter One in the opening saga of Storm, Texas. I’m already hooked on the drama and I can’t wait to see how some of these stories play out.Notable Scene:Ginny glanced between the two of them, and as she did, she saw Luis and Jeffry standing outside the glass—and Sebastian Rush was standing there with them.Senator Sebastian Rush.The senator she’d slept with.The senator whose baby she was probably carrying.Was he there now to see her? To tell her how worried he’d been? To squeeze her hand in a silent, secret moment of compassion?“For Jacob’s best friend?” Celeste was saying. “For Ginny? Of course we’ll do whatever we can.”Ginny barely heard the woman. Instead, she was focused beyond the glass, on where Senator Rush pressed his hand on Luis’s shoulder. Ginny’s breath hitched and she stiffened, preparing for the moment he walked through her door.But he didn’t.He just took one more quick glance at her through the glass, then turned away and disappeared down the hall, not even bothering to ask if he could come in and say hello.FTC Advisory: Evil Eye Concepts, Inc/Inkslinger PR provided me with a copy of Tempest Rising.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Three heirs, one dead, one attacked and stripped of all her magic, the last one is fine….Opening Sentence: “I paced the floor of my room, tired and on edge, playing the memory of my mutilation over and over again in my head.”The Review:Picking up shortly after The Queen Choice’s ends, Anya is stuck in the human realm since she her wings were cut off taking all of her magic. Zabriel is executed for his crimes supposedly committed here in the human realm. Illumina has returned to the Faerie realm in order to let the Queen know what has happened to everyone. Although not long after she leaves Anya begins to suspect that Illumina is the reason she lost her wings.Anya comes close to getting back the Anlace, however that necklace continues to elude her, but she does find out that Luka has Zabriel and aren’t dead. Zabriel and Anya figure out that the faeries are losing their wings because someone is attempting to cross the Bloody Road. In fact, they are preparing for a war against Faerie itself.The Queen arrives in the human realm, and Anya and Zabriel update her on everything. Anya informs them that cutting of her wings has effectively made her human. Anya’s love triangle involving Tom and Davic comes to end, probably the shortest and most ineffective love triangle ever.So the book itself is solidly good, I didn’t love it, it wasn’t quite bad, I just didn’t connect with it. My only real issue is the whole wing thing; I can’t wrap my head around how cutting off wings makes them less Fae. I mean it’s different and that’s cool, but I don’t understand it at all. I know it’s a fantasy book but some things are still supposed to make sense and I don’t see how wings being cut off makes a person less of the race they were born or how it causes them to lose their magic.That’s probably my biggest major issue with the world building, the book is good, the world building is good, and the writing is good. My only other problem is the love triangle that really isn’t so much a love triangle, but in the first book and most of this book Anya is betrothed to Davic, and in most of the first book she seriously loves him or so we are supposed to think that. Until she meets Tom and then it’s like Davic who? However, I think what the author was going for more than a triangle. For instance, Davic is fae Anya’s love and Tom is the more human Anya’s love.So to sum it all up this book is good, it’s got some romance, break-ups, death, resurrection, murder, addiction and then some. It’s a book you are either going to love or hate or just possibly be right down the middle like I am.Notable Scene:“The Bloody Road was the barrier that kept me from reaching home.”“So I wouldn’t know what my partner took with him when he left me to die.”“The Prince is alive.”“She was there at the bloody road on the night my wings were taken.”FTC Advisory: Harlequin Teen provided me with a copy of The Empty Throne.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Hybrid-Dragons, hot sexy men with wings, and a woman who always gets her way!Opening Sentence: “Yeah.”The Review:Windburn picks up some time after Soulfire ends, and I will say this: you won’t miss anything if you haven’t read Soulfire other than some background information. These books are part of a series and while you know characters from the previous book you don’t actually miss anything by not having read it. Sorcha starts off this book in someone else’s bed, and ends a little late to a company meeting where she finally meets Lorian Nightwing! Morgon’s are dragon-hybrids, meaning they don’t shape shift but literally have wings on their backs. The color of those wings also tells you what clan they belong too.Sorcha flirts with Lorian and at first it seems like he might just be able to resist her, but it soon becomes clear that it is futile. They are working together to build the first human-morgon club and continue building harmony in the races, when Sorcha starts receiving mysterious gifts with a logo from a crazed dragon cult on it. Lorian and Sorcha are just getting everything really started when she is kidnapped…and well you just have to read the book.I really enjoyed these books, they are quick easy reads. A little bit of paranormal and just a bit different since there aren’t too many dragon type books out there, but this is a first where they don’t shift at all. I will say that I wish it was just a tad bit longer, and that’s not to say it was rushed, just that it was too short. I would have loved to read some more sexy times, or Sorcha flirty snarky remarks.Notable Scenes:“Flirting with danger was my favorite pastime.”“He was the kind of man who enjoyed the hunt.”“Saying I was like some cat in heat, twitching my tail.”“An act I had once thought would only ever satisfy my body, had finally come to satisfy my soul.”FTC Advisory: Lyrical Press/Kensington provided me with a copy of Windburn.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A girl and something? A love square and a cult!Opening Sentence: “Before.”The Review:The Crimson Gate picks up right after The Violet Hour ends, so on that note I would suggest you pick up the first book before reading The Crimson Gate. Otherwise, you will have no clue what is going on. Harlow was just a girl who heard voices, it turns out that voice was Isiris who is like a goddess, maybe, still unsure, but she is also a dead ringer for Harlow. So Isiris leaves Harlow trapped in the temple and takes Harlow’s place.Isiris then plans to destroy the world and kill everyone and it is up to Harlow to stop her. Harlow begins to work with Hayes and the Resistance to beat Isiris. Harlow shared a kiss with Hayes in book despite her love for Adam, hence why I said love square because in the Crimson Gate, Adam is with Isiris and Harlow is sort of with Hayes. It’s all a little confusing.I wanted to really like this book, but I found the first book confusing. This one wasn’t much better. A lot of interesting elements but no real clarity on what is going on, for example is Isiris a goddess or does she just have some kind of magic? Harlow gets a taste of this power in the book but why does she have Isiris’ power? Just more questions raised than are ever answered. Plus, the love square, although I did like Hayes quite a bit more than Adam, and by the end of this book I firmly wasn’t in the Adam camp.I am not sure why Isiris and Harlow looked so much alike either, Harlow referred to her as her doppelganger and the synopsis refers to them as twins, but that is never really explained. I think I would have enjoyed these books if everything was a lot clearer. If the world building was better and I could understand what was going on.Notable Scenes:“In my gut I knew it was something terrible and I was going to have no choice but to face it.”“I tried to imagine a way this could all play out to a happy ending.”“And after that I was going to get the hell out of here and go kick some doppelganging ass.”FTC Advisory: Flux Publishing provided me with a copy of The Crimson Gate.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A shocking death, a casino in turmoil, can two old flames find their way back to each other?Opening Sentence: “I inhaled a shaky breath as his coffin lowered into the solid ground.”The Review:Dakota is reeling from her father’s murder when she sees Shane at the funeral. She instantly remembers all of her feelings for him and tries to remain aloof. Two of Hearts is a romance but also a mystery. The mystery is Linden’s death and the turmoil that seems to spring up right away in the casino.  Linden left the casino to his white wife Johanna and named his daughter Dakota as the operations manager. Shane and Dakota had a relationship five years in the past when they were in college, when faced with future choices Dakota choose to take a break and Shane just went along with it.Johanna and Dakota are under pressure from the Casino Association to sell their casino, and Johanna’s motives come under fire because of rumors. Meanwhile, Shane and his team are investigating what is going with the casino and who is behind Linden’s death. After several attempts to avoid him, Dakota begins to fall back into a relationship with Shane. As Dakota continues to fight for the casino and what her father wanted, Shane and Dakota fall deeper and deeper into something!That’s all I can say about what happens in the book without going into spoilers! This was a good book, I had a couple issues which I will go over, but I don’t want to focus on them too much because I really did enjoy Two of Hearts. In fact, I will get down to it right away, first I didn’t always like the interactions with Shane and Dakota, I kind of felt like everything was falling on her too much, she wanted the break, etc, etc, it didn’t last which is why I am not going to keep complaining about it. But my only real thought (which the author did address) was if he loved her so much why didn’t he open his mouth and say something when she wanted to take a break. Lastly, this was really more of a romance than mystery novel, which is fine, the author herself states this a romance, so it almost felt like the mystery was thrown in and watered down. By that I mean, the romance was really the central part and the mystery was often in the background or kind of glossed over.Those were my only bones to pick, if I say more than I just seem a little nit picky. Besides, I did love Shane’s and Dakota’s interactions once they got passed figuring who to blame for the break-up. He was a good guy who supported, and wanted to be an important part of her life. Dakota was a kick ass and take names kind of girl and together they were smoking hot! I loved loved loved the Native American aspects of the novel, from the viewpoints on the casinos and the realistic conflict over a white owner on reservation land. Kudos to Christina Lee for her research and really attempting to convey such a rich culture in a wonderful light. I was a little shocked but not completely surprised by who was behind the turmoil and the murder of her father, so if you really like thrillers and mysteries you might find this one falls short in that aspect! For the romance genre it definitely hits home!Notable Scene:“In the sound of the wind, the melody of the crickets, and the brilliance of the sunset.”“In the past five years I had placed my feelings for him in a nice little box and thrown them overboard into the vast darkness of my heart.”“The same pride that would continue eating me alive, leave me bereft and alone.”FTC Advisory: Signet/Penguin provided me with a copy of Two of Hearts.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Beauty and the Beast all wrapped up as one character that was just too mean to care about. This one just wasn’t for me.Opening Sentence: For the first time in her life, Brye Morgeaux was no longer the prettiest sister.The Review:His Wicked Desire is a paranormal romance set in New Orleans. It is the second novel in the Vieux Carré Witch Sister series. This was kind of a beauty and the beast tale except for beauty and the beast were the same person. I never read the first book in this series so I can only assume that the events that caused Brye’s condition happened in Bewitching the Enemy.Brye has been a recluse for the past month while she has been healing and dealing with the fact that she no longer has her good looks. Half of her face was burned with acid by an evil warlock. Brye learns just how mean people can be when she doesn’t have her looks getting her what she wants anymore. As a half witch, half warlock, Brye is an abomination among her kind. Warlocks are evil and kill witches for their power in order to prolong their own lives. They certainly don’t have children with witches. The warlock who ruined her face needs something from Brye. The warlock keeps showing up at inopportune times threatening to kill Brye and her family.Josh has been in love with Brye for a long time. They have been best friends since they were young. After an encounter that left them both thinking the other wasn’t interested in a relationship. Josh has tried to move on but when he sees Brye’s disheartening encounter at the mall he knows he needs to comfort his friend. Brye keeps brushing him off but he can tell something is up. A mysterious man shows up and he can tell she is in trouble.I had a really hard time liking Brye. She is quite rude and mean especially to the man she supposedly loves. When she finds out she has the power of persuasion, it doesn’t stop her from getting what she wants and it certainly doesn’t stop her from manipulating Josh. She uses her scarred up face as an excuse for everything, for avoiding her family, for avoiding Josh, for downright just being mean to everyone around her. I will say she learns a lesson in beauty, ugliness and persuasion but I’m not sure she learned it soon enough for me to really care.Josh is a human in a witch/warlock world. There are the Paladins who protect witches but Josh isn’t one. He wants to protect Brye but he can’t because he isn’t powerful enough. I was really hoping something great would happen with him but it never happens. He just ends up kind of being Brye’s conscience. I wanted to like him since I really couldn’t like Brye but for the most part I was just kind of meh towards him.The writing is good, the story is dark but not incredibly dark. I just didn’t like the characters in this one. It may help reading the first story in this series but I didn’t so some of the backstory was confusing jumping into this one. I did like how this story different with the witches, warlocks and paladins. I just wish I could have seen more of it. Some of the backstory left me in the dark so I felt I was still needing a little bit more when the story was over with. The romance wasn’t very romantic or hot knowing that she was manipulating him.Overall, His Wicked Desire just wasn’t for me. I didn’t like the characters and had a hard time really getting into this one.Notable Scene:She took a deep breath. Open up and let him in. “When I was lost—you were there. When I needed a best friend—you were there. When I lost my confidence and thought I had nothing left to give—you made me feel pretty. When I needed to wallow in self-hatred, self-doubt, pity—you didn’t drag me out of it too quickly. You let me fight my own way back, and it made me stronger, but you were always there. You were like a night-light, guiding me back home. I’ve changed because of you. My looks aren’t everything, as I once believed them to be. You. You are my everything. You even calmed the beast inside me.”“What are you saying, Beast? I mean, Brye.” He chuckled, then sat up.She slapped his bicep, then wiped her eyes before any tears escaped. “I’m saying that I’m afraid I’ll lose you forever this time.”FTC Advisory: Entangled: Covet provided me with a copy of His Wicked Desire.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: White Lightning delves even more into the dramatic and complicated lives of the people of Storm, Texas. This installment focuses on the ever widening chasm of relationships and affairs.Opening Sentence: Senator Sebastian Rush sighed as he shrugged out of his Charvet dress shirt and hung it neatly on the valet rack where Carmen, the very efficient maid, would pick it up and ready it for cleaning.The Review:The soap opera drama continues with White Lightning. It is the second novel in the ongoing soap opera series of Rising Storm. I would recommend that you read Tempest Rising first before getting into this one. I will say I wasn’t as overwhelmed with the characters like I was in the first installment. I am not a huge fan of cheating and cheaters ever but I know that is a huge plot point in soap operas because of the drama and it was a huge point in White Lightning.Dakota Alvarez’s head is spinning. She is still reeling about the death of Jacob Salt. The love that was going to get her out of the godforsaken town of Storm. Then with the disappearance of her father, she just goes to self-destructive tendencies, one of which includes the sex-crazed Senator.I didn’t like Dakota in this version. She’s completely stupid and buying into what Sebastian tells her. She also denies, denies, denies how terrible her father is. I’m sure she had to be hard to write for the author, for any author. I couldn’t believe the comments she was making about her mother.The rest of the story moved along for the rest of the residents of Storm. They are trying to get over the loss of Jacob and move on with a festival. A festival that is supposed to help with the great Senator’s re-election campaign. Although, I will say I’m really looking forward to when Joanne gets over her husband’s disappearance and falls for Dillion.The writing in White Lightning was excellent. This episode went really fast.  I really love the tie in with the name of this episode.Overall, I say if you like soap operas and the drama they entail then definitely give this series a try. I’m really looking forward to when the real romance hits the page. I am wondering if there will be any real HEA’s in this series.Notable Scene:He immediately pulled away. “Sorry. You’re so sexy I’m afraid my hand had a mind of its own. I’ll get that food.”She reached down and grabbed his hand, bringing it back to her chest. She didn’t want to let go of how he made her feel. It was there in the back of her head that this was wrong, but she didn’t care. She just wanted another couple of moments where she felt good about herself.He was smiling as his lips descended on hers again and he took her mouth. His hand moved over her, her nipples sparking to life under the material of her blouse. His tongue traced the edge of her lips and when she opened for him, he delved inside. She gave over to him, tasting the liquor on his tongue. That liquor and this man had washed away some of the humiliation of the day.After a long moment, he lifted his head and stared down at her. “We could have fun this summer, you and I.”FTC Advisory: Evil Eye Concepts, Incorporated provided me with a copy of White Lightning.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Wonderfully written story that explores how badly secrets can destroy until the power of forgiveness heals all.Opening Sentence: Jose observed his aunt Dona Antonia, an aging aristocrat who’d taken him in as her own.The Review:The Debt of Tamar is quite a bit different than what I thought it was. I was expecting a love story with a history lesson, what I got was a history lesson in Judaism, tragedy and loss with a bit of a love story thrown in. It also heavily revolves around fate and destiny and how badly secrets can destroy or enlighten. The synopsis confused me after I started reading, I had to double check that I was reading the book it said it was about because we don’t even glimpse Selim until well over 100 pages in. With that being said, I did enjoy this novel wholeheartedly. Expect for some heartache, tragedy and tears. This novel does make you explore the unfairness of life and how badly people are judged by their religion.This novel starts off in the mid-1500’s with the persecution and killing of millions of Jews in Europe. Dona Antonia Mendez has kept a huge secret from her daughter and nephew. She has been raising them as Catholic but secretly their family is Jewish. After, Jose’s (Dona’s nephew) parents were killed in the Inquisition, she hasn’t told them about their heritage. She was waiting for them both to grow up before telling them they were in fact Jewish. Dona has also been secretly helping Jewish people get out of Europe with the use of her massive funds. One day the queen of Portugal come to Dona with a proposition she cannot turn down. Dona’s daughter Reyna will marry the Prince. Portugal is having money problems and needs Dona’s money. Dona lets out the secret of their family to Jose and Reyna. Dona cannot let Reyna marry the Catholic prince, so she is now running away from Portugal with her daughter and nephew to Turkey. A bit of a love story plays out with Jose and Reyna but it isn’t without its tragedy.In Turkey, Jose and Reyna find a bit of happiness and stability. Jose learns a lot more about his religion.  When Jose and Reyna are put almost in the same precarious situation that they were in when they left Portugal. Jose concocts a plan that could only work in a plague ridden world. He cannot let his daughter marry a Muslim Sultan. A Sultan that lives out the rest of his days heartbroken and sullen.The Sultan family now has a curse that will follow them until a green eyed beauty can redeem them from the curse that has forced the family to wait for love and enlightenment. Selim is empty inside. He’s just counting his days until he dies. After his tragic past he hopes it is sooner than later. Selim meets Ayda. He wants to love her but he just can’t. He tries to push her away but Ayda fights for what she wants and will not let him go so easy. Selim skips out on Ayda for New York City. While there he meets the green eyed Hannah, where history has come full circle. It is up to Hannah to release Selim’s family curse.It wasn’t until Selim’s story that I kept tearing up. I am tearing up just writing this review. Life is just so unfair and sad. The full circle of the story is supposed to be uplifting. It is supposed to show how someone’s actions in the past can weigh heavily on future events. How the power of forgiveness and help heal wounds inside and out. The story was all these things but I still feel a bit melancholy about how the events in this story play out. Because not only is Selim’s curse lifted but so is Hannah’s.Overall, I learned quite a bit about the Jewish faith. The story itself is pure fiction but based on some real life characters. I love learning about history and the story that was written was stuff I have not really ever read about so I’m glad that I made this journey. If you love history and want something a bit different. I recommend giving this one a try.Notable Scene:“This Is not the dream of a fool, Murad. It is a window into the future.”“Tell me what it means. Tell me now and tell me quickly.”“A tree such as that can mean only one thing.”“Please go on, good sheikh!”“A tree such as yours can only mean life.”“Murad looked on, bewildered. “Life?”“Yes, dear boy. The girl lives on.”“But the girl in my dream, she is dead.”“Murad,” Sheikh Suca continued, “the girl is certainly not dead. The debt of her household follows her to a faraway land.”“Debt?” Murad’s voice was faint.Holding his beads in his lap, the sheikh pressed his lids down tightly, accessing a world of secrets and spirits beyond. “Your forefathers rescued her household and all its descendants, those living and those yet to be born,” he said with his eyes still sealed. “For this, a debt lingers in the heavens. A time will come when she returns to see it paid.”FTC Advisory: Thomas Dunne/St. Martin’s Press/Macmillan provided me with a copy of The Debt of Tamar.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: An international pop star aka “Justin Bieber” finds love in this fast paced, steamy romance.Opening Sentence: Wasn’t regret a bitch?The Review:Pure Wicked is the story of a “Justin Bieber”-esque pop star who finds love during a terrible moment in his life and career. This story is a novella off of the Wicked Lovers series and also a part of the 1001 Dark Nights. I will say that the romantic scenes are quite steamy but there aren’t really any BDSM elements to this story, for which the Wicked Lovers series seems to be known for. Also, the couple falls for each other hard and fast which means there is kind of a crazy ending.Jesse McCall has had a terrible and tragic night. He decides he needs to hide away from the spotlight for a while because of the seriousness of the situation. He even goes so far as to change his appearance so that no one will recognize him. Jesse stops for dinner in a small Texas town and sees the saddest, most beautiful woman he has ever seen.Bristol Reece has some family issues and welcomes Jamie. *cough* I mean Jesse’s help to get her mind off of the unsettling family event. She has also decided that she is done with relationships. She wants some fun and decides a one night stand is something she needs.Pure Wicked is a one night stand that begins in lies and through passion and intimacy becomes something much, much more. This novel is a heavy dose of Insta-love, so if you don’t like that then you won’t like this read. The events take place in less than a week’s time, the couple actually only spend a weekend together so hence the very fast relationship.Jesse is not really in a good place when the novella begins but he is determined to turn his life drastically around. He sees that he can do that with Bristol. Jesse isn’t exactly good with relationships so the fact that he dives into this relationship with Bristol so fast is sexy but a bit off putting. I just can’t expect a guy like that to change everything about himself even though I really want to believe. Also, in the beginning when he is compared to the Biebs I just couldn’t think of him as sexy for the first half of the story. (Other readers may not have that problem.)Bristol owns a bakery/restaurant in her little hometown where reputation is everything. She can’t be known as a whore or no one will eat there. Old Maid isn’t much better either but she would rather that than anything. And just as she says she is done with relationships she jumps head first into one. Overall, I did like Bristol and how she reacted to Jesse initially lying to her, but her really quick use of the “L” word may turn some readers away.Overall, Pure Wicked is one of those dreamy, quick HEA love stories. As a whole, I really did like how the story came together. The writing was excellent. I have not read any other books in this series but I would like to go back and check out this steamy series.Notable Scene:He glanced around, then cocked his head in thought. “It’s you.”She smiled and shut the door behind them, flipping on the overhead lights. “Yeah?”“Comfortable, happy, unvarnished. I like it.”“Thanks.” He seemed to get her, and that did Bristol’s heart a world of good. Hayden had hated this place. He liked things grander and more formal, not an eclectic grouping of her favorite things. He called antiques “recycled junk.” “But you didn’t come all the way to Lewisville to comment on my décor, right?”“No.” He turned to her, his hands suddenly engulfing her hips, his stare drilling down into her eyes. “I did not.”“So what did you come to do?” she challenged.He gave her a panty-melting grin as he pulled her closer, fitting her flush against his body where she could feel every inch of him. “Make you glad you let me follow you home.”Bristol swallowed and lifted her face to him. “Are you finally going to kiss me?”“Eager?”She gave him a coy shrug. “A little.”“Let’s see if we can make that a lot.” He took her face in his hands.FTC Advisory: Evil Eye Concepts, Inc/InkSlinger PR provided me with a copy of Pure Wicked.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A dark paranormal “Romeo & Juliet” type romance with action, intrigue and even a murder mystery. There were things that I liked and didn’t like about it but overall it was a good read.Opening Sentence: It was half a degree past freezing as Jillian stumbled across the snow-covered pavement.The Review:Dance with the Devil is the first novel in the Soul’s Harbor Pride series. This paranormal romance series has an intriguing twist on paranormal creatures that I really want to see more of in future books. This book has a dark back story, a sexy romance and action.Dance with the Devil begins with Jillian feeling the supernatural tug that is forcing her to go back home, but before she can do that she must clean up some loose threads. Jillian wants to cover up that fact that she has spent the last couple years working at a bar before she leaves. Her boss, Carrick, won’t let her leave so easily, especially after her big secret is revealed. She’s a lion shapeshifter! Then another bombshell! So is he.Jillian’s father has killed Carrick’s father so the two packs that share Soul’s Harbor Island are in a tizzy. One pack is only accepts pureblood shapeshifters while the other accepts all but is very violent towards its members so it isn’t a very healthy pack. The packs must decide on a new leader and they must go through a mating ritual to do so. But not just the potential leaders have to go through with the ritual, all pack members have to take part in the hope that the two packs will combine into one.My only real complaint about the novel is that I didn’t really care for the whole mating thing being forced on the entire pack. Because to me it seemed like whoever you had sex with during the mating ritual would be your mate whether you liked them or not. Or you’re just forced to have sex with as many people as possible until matching tattoos showed up on you and your mate. Yes, matching tattoos is how you know you are compatible.This novel was quite action packed and then an added murder/mystery is in store while the packs are trying to determine their mates and the future of the packs.Jillian starts off the novel knowing exactly what she wants but when her plans change she has no idea what she wants to do and she has a hard time making decisions. She is willing to forgo her own happiness. For the most part, I did like Jillian I just wish she would have stood up for her feelings a little bit sooner. Jillian was quite badass when it came down to it.Carrick was quite the hottie that knew what he wanted and he definitely wasn’t going to let Jillian forget about him. He was persistent and passionate.I really enjoyed the side characters in this novel. Jillian’s two best friends are hilarious and fun, even in their tension filled moments. I can’t wait to find out what more is in store for them.The one thing I would really like to see more in this series is in the power of the mixed supernatural species. I felt like we didn’t get to see much of the magic side of Jillian after the beginning of the novel. I don’t think we ever got to see it in Carrick. They mention they are stronger than purebloods because of the mixing of species. I especially want to see the cross of lion and vampire.Overall, Dance with the Devil is a decent start to a paranormal romance series. The ending was quite abrupt but I really do want to see what is next for this pack.Notable Scene:Carrick rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling. “What we have comes once in a lifetime. Why not give it a chance?”She blew out a hard breath. He still didn’t get it. “Maybe I will. I have to weigh the pros and cons.” She held out her hands like the halves of a scale. “My happiness versus the lives of my Pride.”He sat up with a shake of his head. “You’re thinking about it wrong. You need to balance our shot of surviving the Conclave, combined with our happiness, against maintaining the farce that will be the Pride if you choose Lucas.”Her frustration quickly turning to anger, she stared at him. “What are you getting at?”“You choose Lucas and you’re not just turning your back on me, you’re turning your back on our laws. You and Lucas will have to lie to maintain your positions. If the Pride finds out, pure-blood or half-blood, they’ll rebel against you.”FTC Advisory: Samhain Publishing provided me with a copy of Dance with the Devil.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Steamy and sexy novella about two characters who have an “experienced” past and find something in each other that they just can’t live without.Opening Sentence: “Weddings make me horny.”The Review:Stripped Down by Lorelei James is a steamy, sexy novella for fans of cowboys, rodeos, ranching and country music! But most of all for fans of passionate characters and hot and crazy, inventive sex. This is a novella that is a part of the Wicked Cowboy series and the 1001 Dark Nights compilation.Stripped Down starts off quite naughty and it doesn’t let up. Wynton and Melissa meet up at a wedding. They immediately are attracted to one another and start up a flirty and naughty conversation. They each think this is going to be a one night only hookup so they are flirting hardcore with each other. Wyn and Melissa have both been sexually dry for a few months and are ready to scratch that inch so much so that it turns into a one-upmanship over who has had the more adventurous and crazy sex life.After a family crisis, Wyn needs help on the ranch. He’s already down one brother on honeymoon. Melissa is volunteered into helping because of her rodeo experience. They both weren’t expecting to have this extra time together but they both knew there was something with the intensity they shared.  Wyn is going to make sure Melissa’s time at the ranch is something they never want to stop even after the work is done.Melissa has a secret she is trying to hide. A secret that she hides in the room she is staying in at Wyn’s house. A secret that she hides by not sleeping in Wyn’s room, no matter the connection that they feel towards each other. Ultimately, it is Melissa’s secret that can determine their relationship.Wyn and Melissa are very similar in character. They both the same past sexual experiences which they bond over. They both have a bit of background in rodeo, farming and horses. Although, their pasts are vastly different. Wyn is completely comfortable in who he is. He doesn’t make excuses for his past. He is hot, passionate and intense in his deep feelings towards Melissa.Melissa is fun, spunky and spontaneous at the beginning of the novella. She turns a little more secretive and quiet towards the middle only because she doesn’t want her secret unveiled.As a couple, Wyn and Melissa are very sexual and their banter is funny at times and sometimes uncomfortable. I wasn’t quite sure that I would like them at first but in the end I grew to love how unabashed and free they were in their love lives.Overall, Strapped Down reminds you about how fragile human life can be and the hope of making the best of everything while you can.Notable Scene:Everyone started talking and Wyn leaned down to speak to Melissa privately. “You really okay with this?”“I was thinking to myself earlier that I wished you and I had more time together, and now I’ve got my wish.” She smirked.“What?”“This wasn’t as altruistic of London as you might believe.”He chuckled. “Yes, it is fortunate that they won’t have to miss more than a day or two of their honeymoon, isn’t it? Becausee the ranch matters are handled.”“That and you know she’s been trying to fix us up since she and Sutton got engaged.”That took Wyn by surprise. “Then why is their wedding the first time I met you?”Melissa looked away. “I have no idea.”FTC Advisory: Evil Eye Concepts/Inkslinger PR provided me with a copy of Stripped Down.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A sun-soaked summer novel chalk-full of fun, heartbreak, friendships, and bitter secrets.Opening Sentence: Just do it.The Review:Years ago, Tali, Luce, Joy, and Zoe were the best of friends at the summer camp Okahatchee. Though the camp ended, the four swore that they wouldn’t fall out of touch. Years later, the bond no longer exists and the memories are bittersweet in the back of their mind. What changed? What made their friendship fall apart? When they all come back to the camp Okahatchee reunion, some for reasons different than others, something strange happens. They’re transported back in time via a magic photo booth, to the summer where it all changed. Is this a chance to do everything over again, and reconcile their friendship? Or will they be trapped in the past forever?If you are looking for a summer book, you found it. It has the same light, fun qualities of kisses and sun-soaked water fights, with a unique element that is entirely its own. It brings in an incredible amount of surprises and secrets are being revealed every other page. Romances weave through a rebuilding friendship, and each girl is forced to admit things about themselves that they’ve avoided. The writing is rich, vivid, and detailed, with each scene in perfect clarity. She juggles four different points of views, and while I was confused at some points of who I was reading from (my fault: should have read the chapter headings more carefully), she does so almost seamlessly.Each character was so different, which is what made their friendship so interesting. Zoe is a tomboy, while Tali is self-conscious and popular. Joy is light and follows her name, but she hides a dark secret that is weighing her down. Finally we have Luce, the responsible one who never steps a toe out of line, or so they think. The complexity of each individual adds so many layers to an already strong storyline. They are realistic and relatable, and all of them finding themselves in the strangest of ways, after being transported back in time via a photo booth. There is snark in this book that made me smile and four different romances that were in sharp contrast.The storyline is sometimes hard to follow, because of the whole jumping into the past thing. For example, Luce’s romance with Andrew has progressed so much in the future, and I was so confused when he started treating her like he didn’t know her. Then I realized that they were back in the time that their romance was just blossoming. Seeing things happen again gives Luce doubts. Is their relationship too safe, too boring? Is her love for him strong enough to withstand more time or will it crumble when she does this all over again? Tali’s romance was hilarious. She kept finding “tow boy”, a hot worker for the camp, in the weirdest ways on her quest to seduce Blake. First he sees her where she’s waiting for Blake in lingerie, then he rescues her from freezing lake water when she falls in kissing Blake.. Their conversations were funny to read. Their “hatred” morphed very very quickly into pure attraction when they both revealed their feelings. Those were my favorite two romances, but I also really enjoyed the diversity of one of the girl’s relationship.Altogether, I enjoyed this book. I first read 40% of it at, get this, a summer camp at UCLA. When I went back home I got distracted and forgot about it, but I returned a couple months later to finish. It’s a decent sized book and the fact that it’s so packed with details made it seem longer, so at times I got slightly bored, but for the most part I found it enjoyable. The writing had a slight lyrical quality to it, and there were plenty of twists and turns that kept me guessing about the inevitable end. When it did come, it was bittersweet, and though I did see part of it coming, it took it a little further and surprised me. For a debut novel with this complexity and this many points of view, I’m very impressed!Notable Scene:“Does it ever make you, well, mad?” Joy asks quietly. “I mean, how unfair it is.”“Hell yeah. It makes me mad all the time. That’s the whole thing about life, though, right?“What is?”“It’s unfair. That you just have to accept things, take whatever you’re dealt and work with what you got. (…) But you get to a point where at least you’re happy for the time you did have.”FTC Advisory: HarperTeen provided me with a copy of Proof of Forever.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Enhanced soldiers, deadly women, and some little vipers!Opening Sentence: Wyatt Fontenot tied up his airboat, but stood in it in the dark, listening to the familiar sounds of the bayou.The Review:I have read like the first five books, but must have hit a not reading much period in my life because I haven’t read book 6 -10. However, the one thing I liked about this series is while you are missing some information by not reading all them, they are books that can be read out of order or missing some and you don’t feel lost reading them. So no clue if Viper Game picks up after Samurai Game or not but Viper Game does hit the ground running. Wyatt has returned home to his beloved bayou after some trying missions and being wounded. He has also returned with two of his fellow ghostwalkers.But something is up in the bayou, food and clothes are being stolen from locked houses with no signs of break-ins! While trying to figure out of all of this, Wyatt finally stumbles across the woman and child that are hiding in the bayou. Pepper and Ginger are also enhanced but considered very dangerous and were to be exterminated by the Company. This is where it got a little unfamiliar for me, in the first couple of books they finally take down Whitney and it seems like the enhancements and experiments are over.Clearly this is not the case! Wyatt finds out Pepper tried to escape with three girls, but the other two toddlers were caught while they were escaping. The little girls are vipers; their bites are venomous and dangerous. Wyatt and Pepper fall in love while plotting the rescue of the two other girls, which they find out are their biological children.It was easy to see why I initially had liked this series so much when it first came out, not sure why it fell off my radar, most likely I wasn’t paying attention to when the new ones came out and then so much time had passed I just forgot. I am seriously inspired to go back and read them all. This is a solid series with great characters. Plus, the author has really built up the world and background and it just works!Notable Scenes:“A shiver of awareness went through him.”“He knows we know just about everythin’ happenin in the bayou.”“He brought you here, created a reason for escape and a reason for me to come home.”It had taken three little vipers in jeopardy to open his eyes.”FTC Advisory: Jove/Penguin provided me with a copy of Viper Game.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Hot paranormal read with engaging characters, steamy romance, and action packed adventure! I really enjoyed this and would highly recommend it to all paranormal fans!Opening Sentence: I was never one to be accused of being patient.The Review:Genesis has spent her whole life preparing for her number to be called.  She actually never thought it would be called, but she wanted to be ready if it did.  She was taught over and over again how humans mean nothing to the immortals and the only reason they coexist is because the immortals would die without humans.  Imagine her surprise and fear when she receives her call and realizes that for the rest of her life she will be a slave to the immortals.  Odds are she won’t live all that long because all immortals are monsters right?What she didn’t expect was how very wrong she was about the immortals and how important she is to their survival. She didn’t think she would ever become friends with any of her masters and she was definitely not prepared for Ethan. The hot vampire that makes her feel things she never thought possible. Then there is Cassius the king of the immortals who has marked her as his own and will do anything to make her his.  Which one will she choose and is she truly the one chance for balance to be restored between humans and immortals!Genesis is a strong woman that has terrible self confidence.  Her entire life she has been told how insignificant and ugly she is.  But despite her horrible upbringing she is still a strong amazing person that has a heart of gold.  She is such a sweet person, but she also has a temper. She doesn’t let others push her around and even though she is timid she knows how to hold her own even against a group of immortals.  She grows immensely throughout the story and she was very easy to connect with. I thought that Genesis was an amazing heroine and I really enjoyed reading her story.Ethan was a very intriguing and mysterious man that instantly draws you in.  Of course he is drop dead gorgeous and who doesn’t love a hot vampire! At first he comes across as very cold and unfeeling, but as his story is revealed you can’t help but sympathize with him.  He has been through a lot and has had to deal with much loss and heartache.  His relationship with Genesis is really sweet and sexy.  They have amazing chemistry and an instant connection.  I do wish that their romance had been developed a little bit better, but overall I loved them together.  Ethan is defiantly a swoon worthy man and I enjoyed his character.The Dark Ones is an action-packed, steamy paranormal story! I don’t personally read very many adult books so this was a nice change of pace from my normal reads. From the very first page you are drawn into the dark world that Dyken created and it easily kept me intrigued the entire time.  The pacing was spot on and the plot was interesting.  The characters were engaging and easy to connect with. There is one thing that I can’t quite make up my mind about and that was the romance. It developed very quickly and defiantly had an instalove feel to it. But at the same time it worked with the story line and I don’t think that a more drawn out romance would have.  So I wouldn’t say I loved the romance, but I understood why it was written the way it was. Overall I thought this was a very entertaining read and I am really looking forward to the next book in the series.  I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of adult paranormal stories!Notable Scene:“You really are a pretty one, aren’t you?” another voice chimed in, this one deep, smooth, soothing… like a stream where the water trickled over the rocks.He was gorgeous.Light green eyes glowed in my direction, beamed and twinkled with each blink, almost like I was staring at stars. His skin was smooth and light, dark brown hair was pulled back into a low ponytail, and he had a leather bomber jacket on.He was the epitome of every girl’s fantasy come to life.FTC Advisory: Rachel Van Dyken/Inkslinger PR provided me with a copy of The Dark Ones.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: An ex-archaelogy student on the run from vampires accepts a job from a dragon in exchange for her safety. The dragon didn’t say anything about keeping her safe from anything else though…Opening Sentence: I hate potholes.The Review:Ever since being unjustly blacklisted by the archaelogy world, Owl has taken to stealing antiquities for those who will pay for them. After a couple of bad experiences, Owl has sworn off doing any supernatural jobs. That is, until she’s brought to see Mr. Kurosawa, a dragon who is determined that Owl help him locate and translate an ancient scroll. In return, he swears to get the vampires chasing her off her tail for good. Owl accepts and thus begins what will become the most harrowing experience of her life. You see, Owl’s not the only one after the scroll, and the vampire after it will stop at nothing to get it. Will Owl and her friends be able to find it first? Or will Owl be forced to tell a dragon not used to hearing the word “No” that she failed to find his treasure?This is yet another difficult book for me to rate. At times, it moves very quickly and is hard to put down, but then at other times, there are lulls that seem to last forever. It also often feels like we come into the story partway through. Not much detail is given regarding Owl’s previous supernatural encounters, and yet they shape so much of how she responds to her current situation that it often left me feeling a little lost.Another problem comes with the character of Owl herself. Her voice is very uneven, which makes it hard to really get a lock on who she is as a character. Despite the first person narration, I still am having trouble coming up with words to describe her. She is at times very kickass, and those scenes are such fun to read. It’s not consistent though, which is frustrating. She also has a tendency to just run into danger despite warnings from friends, and this just gets her into more trouble. It gets a little old after a while.The romance also falls a little flat. Rynn and Owl already have a history with each other when the book starts, although it hasn’t progressed into anything more than friendship yet. There’s really no romantic tension though, and with the romance scenes fading to black before getting to the action, it’s hard for any chemistry to form between the two. I just didn’t feel invested in their relationship.On the positive side, I think my favorite part of the book involved Owl’s cat, Captain. The idea of there being a breed of cat that was developed specifically to hunt and poison vampires is very unique. I pretty much loved all the scenes in which Captain appeared. I am a cat person though, so that may have had something to do with it.I know most of this review sounds negative, but I swear I did enjoy myself most of the time. It just always felt like something was missing, so I couldn’t completely lose myself in the events of the book. A lot of these issues could come down to it being a first in a series. I liked the book well enough that I will check out book two when it comes out. I’m hoping that the hints of a good book/series that I saw here will flourish in future installments.Notable Scene:Three long seconds passed, during which I held my breath.“Lady Siyu,” Mr. Kurosawa said. The Kabuki girl produced a red lacquer pen with a very sharp tip.Oh hell no.I went to shove my hand into my pocket, but she was too fast; a blur of red-tipped fingernails snatched my wrist. I yelped as she pricked me with a needle and held my finger until a drop of blood fell on the page. She was strong for such a small woman. Lady Siyu said something in Japanese, and my conditions appeared on the bottom page. Just like that. Then she flipped the pen over and handed it to me. I kept her and Mr. Kurosawa in my sights as I signed. I thought I caught a glimpse of a slit eye as I passed the signed contract back to Lady Siyu. If she was human, I was a dancing unicorn.“How does a dragon get vampires to back off dinner anyways?” I said.Mr. Kurosawa frowned, as if my question was in line with what he’d expect from a four-year-old.I held up my hands. “Just curious. They were pretty pissed off the last time we spoke in Egypt.” Thinking about  my Egyptian run-in with the Paris boys was enough to give me nightmares for a week.“There are courtesies and etiquettes to follow,” Mr. Kurosawa said. “If not, I’ve been known to eat the occasional vampire.”I believed it. Dragons trump vampires in the supernatural food chain. Which only strengthened my conviction that I was completely and utterly out of my mind for even contemplating this job.“So, just so we’re clear, tomorrow I can use my Visa and no one will jump out of an alley and try to kill me?” Oh yeah, vampires were loving the digital era.“I suggest you set yourself up in Vegas to start, but yes. I’ve taken the liberty of having Lady Siyu check you into one of our suites. Your van was retrieved and is in the parkade.”Lady Siyu passed me a receipt for my Winnebago, along with the red dossier. She turned on her spiked heels and motioned for me to follow.Mr. Kurosawa regarded me. Even halfway to a dragon he still looked every inch the rich businessman. “Words of caution, Owl: do not let yourself lose track of Lady Siyu in my private casino. People have a way of getting…lost.”I scrambled; I was not about to get lost in a dragon’s lair-den-whatever you call it. But my business side took over.I glanced back over my shoulder at Mr. Kurosawa before Lady Siyu entered the maze. “How do I contact you?”“It’s all in the dossier.” He got up to leave and had almost disappeared amongst the slot machines, but I couldn’t help myself.“What would have happened if I’d said no?”He flashed his vicious, razor-sharp smile once more. “Those Paris vampires offered an awfully large reward for you. And I eat thieves.”FTC Advisory: Simon & Schuster provided me with a copy of Owl and the Japanese Circus.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Dragon King has it all from a steamy romance, wonderful writing, action scenes to an amazing cast of characters.Opening Sentence: Grace was screwed.The Review:Dragon King is an absolutely sexy read. The characters are entertaining and the writing sucked me in to the story. I really felt like I was in the highlands of Scotland sitting on the side of the mountain with Grace. I really liked this setting and the dragon’s story. I just want to stop everything and read the rest of this series. I thought this novella was that good. I have never read anything in this series yet but I will. I think this could be read as a standalone because the world is set up and explained in such a way that I didn’t feel like was missing out on anything.Grace is desperate to finish her novel. She has been fighting terrible writer’s block. She does the last thing she can think of and that is to travel to Scotland, the place where her book takes place. She is hoping the atmosphere will help her write. She drives to a location that she thinks is perfect for writing and write she does. It was the perfect option for her troubles.Grace suffers from a weird phobia. She is scared of storms. She is a little worried when she sets out because of the rain but she faces her fear because writing is the number one thing she needs to focus on. As the rain picks up she seeks refuge in a cave as she continuously writes.Arian has just woken up from his dragon sleep. He can sense that his cave has been invaded. He is intrigued by the woman who is sitting at the entrance to his cave. She shouldn’t have been able to see it but he is enraptured by what she is doing. He thinks she is a wonderful storyteller but he needs to find out how she got to his cave. Arian’s cave comes under attack by Dark Fae and he must decide whether Grace knows anything about it.As a novella, the sparks fly pretty fast between Grace and Arian. Once she is aware of Arian she isn’t scared of him. I do think she is a little insane because he is naked when they first meet and she doesn’t really think anything too crazy (at least she doesn’t dwell on it).Arian is a dragon who can magically transform into a human shape. He is drool worthy. Arian follows his intuition when it comes to Grace. He is a little selfish and doesn’t want Grace to leave him so he uses his power to control weather to keep her in his cave. For the most part, Grace is levelheaded. She isn’t freaking out too much about the things she is finding out about Arian and the world that he is from.Dragon King has it all from a steamy romance, wonderful writing, action scenes to an amazing cast of characters. I really enjoyed this novella and I’m already hooked onto the character of Constantine. I really want to know what is going on with the leader of the Dragon Kings. If you like dragons and want to read a series that is well written. I would check out this novella and see if it hooks you like it did me.Notable Scene:“You’re quiet,” Grace said.Arian found himself smiling. He noticed that he had been lightly rubbing her back the entire time. “So are you, lass.”“I’m thinking.”“About?” he urged.She snuggled closer to him. “Don’t laugh.”“I would never,” he responded solemnly because he had a feeling whatever she was about to say was about them.Grace flattened her palm on his chest. “I’ve not been writing it correctly.”“Writing what, exactly?”“Passion. I forgot what it was,” she whispered. “I went off what I saw in movies or read, but I haven’t…experience…it in many years.”He didn’t like thinking about other men being with her, but they were in the past. Where they would remain. “Were they no’ good lovers?”“They were all right, but without passion, it all feels…empty.”FTC Advisory: Evil Eye Concepts, Inc/InkslingerPR provided me with a copy of The Dragon King.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Erotic novel featuring all kinds of sexual situations, not for the faint of heart.Opening Sentence: His mouth pressed against mine, his tongue squeezing between my lips.The Review:Victoria is 16 year girl caught with the stable boy in Regency era England. Her father decides to send her to a finishing school in Vienna. I am not sure if he meant to send her to that school, but she ends up in Venus finishing school for girls. Almost immediately it becomes clear what they are learning at this school.Victoria is taught the art of pleasing herself, performing fellatio, and basically almost every act of sex you can think of. She takes to these lessons eagerly. Often using her newfound knowledge on the other girls attending the school, and sometimes on the young men kept on hand. After a year or so passes she returns home one summer to find that her father is in dire straits and ultimately kills himself and she tries desperately to save what she can of the estate.Let me start off with the good, if you like erotic sex books than this book is for you. It has something literally for everyone, lesbian, gay, straight, and bi. I mean that seriously. The writing is excellent and the book is vivid. For this being the first erotic novel by the author I felt she did a pretty great job.However, I had some issues; this book isn’t particularly for the faint of heart. The first thing that bothered me was Victoria’s age, of course taking the timeframe into consideration, I know that I am looking at that with a modern eye. She and other teenagers are in graphic sexual situations the entire book. There are depictions of incest, rape and numerous other disturbing incidents within the book. I know I said it was a good book, and it is a good erotic novel, given the context of the book my feelings are probably just my feelings. I was conflicted about the book, on one hand I enjoyed it, and on the other hand those incidents and her age disturbed me quite a bit.You may feel that I didn’t properly address the story except there really isn’t much of a story. It is very much an erotic novel. The plot really is about a young girl’s sexual awakening and her path to running her own establishment.Notable Scenes:“So I remained inside the stuffy house with no one to converse with or entertain me.”“Most evenings we entertained one or another of Bea’s patrons and their friends or guests.”“Natalie waved from the doorway as I began my journey to Vienna and a new life.”FTC Advisory: Sourcebooks/Xcite provided me with a copy of The Education of Victoria.

"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A marine turned Crow, and Viking Raven and darkness that is coming to devour them all.Opening Sentence: She didn’t know what woke her up.The Review:Kera is a former Marine who is killed and offered a second chance at life. She is then dropped into a house with new sisters, which are a Viking clan called Crows. For the most part they are the complete opposite of Kera and at least one spectacular fight breaks out from Kera’s organizational skills. There are multiple clans serving all of the different Norse gods. The only thing any of the Crows have in common is that they are known for their rage, their hatred and their loyalty to each other.Kera finds out Vig is a Raven, another Viking Clan that serves Odin. Vig was a repeat customer at the coffee shop Kera worked at before her life so drastically changed. Kera also makes the Skuld bring her dog with her, although at the time she doesn’t realize that Brodie has to die too. Brodie quickly becomes the new mascot at the sorority type house Kera finds herself living in, in her new life.There are several POV’s in this book including Chloe and Erin (who is Kera’s new mentor and the Crow she gets into an epic fist fight with.) Chloe is the leader of this particular chapter, apparently there are many all over the world. The first half of the book is really getting to sort of know Kera and her new sisters and her developing relationship with Vig (the blacksmith for the Ravens or weapons master). The second half brings to light that something dark and dangerous is attacking the clans and that one clan alone probably won’t make it against this darkness.I enjoyed the book, although it did drag a little in the beginning. Sometimes it was a little confusing whose point of view it was at the time, but for the most part the author was on it. I feel like I have read a lot of books lately with gods, or Norse gods in them. This one didn’t have them active as of yet but definitely their presence was felt. I did really like the fact that Kera was a former Marine and that she ends up deciding to run a non-profit for rescue dogs that pairs them with veterans.As a former Marine myself there were several parts of the book that made me laugh out loud and I appreciated the author really portraying her in such a positive manner. Overall, I liked it, didn’t quite love or really like it but I enjoyed it and thought it had a lot of interesting concepts and characters. My only issue is that it could be confusing and some of the world building really needed to be fleshed out.Notable Scenes:“He was just an introvert with an aversion to shaving.”“A whistle caught their attention and the Silent looked up… to see the trees filled with Chloe’s sister-Crows.”“They stood straight and ready for battle.”FTC Advisory: Kensington provided me with a copy of The Unleashing.

"I bought this makeup case from Sephora. It was where I first saw it, and the price was $59-$60. I picked this versus a small version of a TARTE eye shadow set is because of its value. I get so much more... so many different shades of eye shadow and blush. It even came with an eye shadow brush and a mascara. As one of the reviewers commented, the eye shadow color is very similar, but they are not identical. I notice a slight different when applied to my eyes, but I also know which color I am applying. Overall, they do look very similar. I am okay with that, because I don't want drastic, flashy, bright, etc... color. I prefer something earth tone, somewhat natural. If you are someone who wants something simple, this is the set for you. If you like a larger variety of color and shades, then this is probably not for you. This eye shadow set is going to last me a long time. I am using a couple rows at a time, so that I don't dirty them all up.As for the quality of TARTE cosmetic, the eye shadow, blush, and mascara are all very easy to apply. It stays on nicely, and stay looking fresh throughout the day. I also love that TARTE is cruelty free, Leaping Bunny certified.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15RFIFPNVSLAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015W6XYUO#wasThisHelpful","R15RFIFPNVSLAF","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Can't believe how inexpensive these flats are. They are so comfortable, too. They are even more comfortable than my $100+ Cole Haan flats. I have slightly wider feet, and they don't look wide when they are in these flats. It also covers my toes very well, no toe cleavage. The little rhinestone looking stones in the front can come off easily. One of the stones came off when I got the shoes. I just put the stone back in place and bend the prongs back to tighten the stone in its place. When I look at the stones close up, they look kind of cheap, but in a distance, they don't look too bad. These flats are also light weight. There is little to no arch support. On most flats, the sole/heel part is not that nice. I prefer shoes with heels, like the ones on these flats, of varies height. I am really happy with this pair of flats. I will likely to buy something similar by AK again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHY52PBZAQRQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQAYGJ8#wasThisHelpful","RHY52PBZAQRQA","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this at Best Buy, and have it installed by their Geek Squad. The installation doesn't look as simple as taking it out of the box and mount it on the wall. It required putting the pieces together and lining the parts up to go with the TV. As I sat there and watch the Geek Squad installs the mount, I am really glad that I didn't try to do it myself or get one of my guy friends to do it for me. It took quite a bit of time to get everything just right, to include mounting it on the right spot on the wall.After the entire set up was done, I am really happy that I got the full motion mount. I have a 45"" TV downstairs with a regular wall mount. I could only tilt down a little bit before the lower edge of the TV hits the wall. for this TV, I went with the full motion, just in case I need to do some serious tilting. Depending on the size of the TV, the degree it can tilt will vary. The arm allows me to pull the TV out, turn the TV to face the left, right, or center, and tilt the TV up and down.The thing that I am not crazy about is that the cables hang right below the TV. When I pull the TV out, the cables come out with the TV. I didn't have the cables fished behind the wall. Because of it, I have cables hanging from the TV to the cable box and to the floor. With the right TV stand, much of it will be hidden.Overall, I really like this mount. I can pull the TV out or push it closer to the wall easily. The tension is good and the TV doesn't need to be leveled again and again every time I move it around. I got a mini-leveler, and I believe it came with the mount and not the TV. It helps check and level the TV, if needed.So far, I am very happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSBZ3FLGWCSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1TOOTE#wasThisHelpful","R3MSBZ3FLGWCSI","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I learned about how disgusting rawhide is, and it is real bad for dogs. My little Rat Terrier mix is too finicky. I just saw these at the local specialty pet store, and was excited to see that this treat has no-hide, humanely raised chicken, and made in the USA. It is healthy for the dogs! It is pricey, and I definitely got what I paid for. My little one loved it. If she likes it, 99% of the dogs out there will LOVE it, because my little one only eats about 5 different types of treats (e.g. Grandma Lucy's Just Liver, Barkworthies Pork Pizzles, Aunt Jeni's Chicken Jerky, Stella and Chewy Freeze-Dried Dinner Patties, and now, this), and won't eat the rest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQT7GGUQEJS7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01576VM58#wasThisHelpful","RQT7GGUQEJS7U","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent product for the price. I have read many reviews and done so much research, and I picked this bench because I want to put a supersized litterbox in it. It fits the ""Petmate Giant Litter Pan"" BUT, the litter box covers 1/2 the cat entrance on the side. So, I went with the ""Whisker City High-Back Open Cat Pan Item: 36-5216338"" that I got at Petsmart. I couldn't find it on Amazon. It's a perfect size! For those with cats that like to pee up high, I recommend this Whisker City litterbox because of its high back.Many of the reviewers expected high quality and perfect product for a $200 piece of furniture. I feel that if you are more realistic and consider the quality of the furniture you'll get for less than $200, this product will most likely meet your expectation. You're not going to get Ethan Allen quality furniture for $200.I am very pleased with this product. I found 1 damage and 1 imperfection in the wood, but I am okay accepting it. Mainly because the damage is in the insider corner of the door near the hinge, and I don't really see it every time I open the door. The imperfection is in the edge if the top of the bench. Even if I were to exchange this bench for another one because of the damage and imperfection, there is a chance that I could get another bench with more issues. For the hassle of returning because it's such a heavy bench and the risk of getting something worst, I'll stick with what I got, and I am happy with it anyway. (see pictures)I wanted a piece that I can assemble, mainly because, I can carry it up 2 flights of stairs 1 or 2 pieces at a time, since I am not strong enough to pick up the box. This furniture has a nice weight, and even on the box, there is a sticker recommending 2 people carrying it. I didn't have any issues assembling it by myself. The only little complication I ran into is when I was screwing the right door onto the bench.I'm right handed, and it is difficult to hold the door up and screw the little tiny screw into the bench. The screw is very tiny, and if you have big hands, see if you can get someone with smaller hands to at least get the screw into the wood so that it will stay in the wood. Trying to screw the screw all the way into the wood was a challenge for me since the wood on the side of the bench moves a little so I have to pull the wood toward me as I screw the screw in, and I have to push real hard with the screwdriver into the screw and pray that I won't strip the screw. To accomplish that, I used the top of my feet to balance and hold the door up, while I used my right hand to hold the wood that the screw is going into from underneath or above the door being balanced on the top of my feet, and used my left hand to push the screw into the wood with the screwdriver as I turn it. It takes some coordination, and fortunately, I am pretty coordinated :-).I followed the instructions, and the instructions are excellent.Some reviews complained about cat urine ruining the wood... ummm... cat urine can ruin A LOT of things. Don't blame the product for it! If your cat likes to pee HIGH up... get a tall or hooded litter box. I don't recommend a hooded litter box, mainly because you'll need to take the whole box out to clean because the hood will need to be removed. I like the Whisker City litter box because it has its 10"" high back, and unless you have a supersize cat with long legs, and likely the cat won't even fit into the entrance/exit hole anyway, it should work. I guess your cat could pee on the side of the litter box which is lower. To prevent that, this is what I did, not that my cats does it, but just in case.... I used the 3M Command Hooks and small bidder clips to clip the puppy training pads up. To catch any drip, put another piece of training pad to catch the drip. The one hanging on the interior wall will need to sit over the pad on the base. (see pictures) Hope this helps.I just ordered the ""PetFusion SmartGrip Cat Litter Mat. Large"" on Amazon. It's 35"" by 25"". The interior base of the bench is 35"" by 19"". I'll have an excess 5"". I plan on adding more 3M Commander clip to clip the excess up along the interior back wall. The reviews said that it's flexible so that can be easily implemented as I plan. This mat should protect the interior base of the bench.How big is your cat? You might want to consider that before getting this bench. The opening is 7"" across and 8"" the highest part. I have a 12 lb big boned Himalayan (Himalayans are usually 6-7 lbs), and she made it in fine. Of course, my 2 (2 and 3) month kittens can climb in and out without any issues. From the floor to the bottom of the opening is about 7.5"". For real small kittens, you might want to put a block inside and outside the opening to serve as steps for the little one.Even though the doors have holes for light to enter, the interior is still very dark. I am not sure how well cats can see in the door. I also ordered the ""Motion Sensing LED, Kuled LED Sensor light"". Based on the reviews of many battery operated lights, I feel this one should work best. Main because the interior cabinet is not that bright, and I wouldn't want to blind my cats when they go in. This one sounded it provides just enough lights. It also has motion sensor, and I plan on mounting it inside and above the entrance. I'll update this review when I get it and install it tomorrow.For the divider that comes with the bench. I chose not to use it because it will take up too much space plus I want to use the litter box that I got. To store the divider, I put it under the litterbox and training pads. With all that, i still have plenty of room to clean the litter box while it sits inside the bench.Oh, one more thing, I used binder clip to clip a sheet of the training pads in the front of the litterbox to catch any litter stuck in the little paws as they come out of the box. (see pictures)Please see my pictures to give you an idea. I uploaded the pictures in the order as I discussed above.HIGHLY Recommended!! If I need another one, i would definitely buy it again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZRH1KTHCOZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJ7JE6Y#wasThisHelpful","R1BZRH1KTHCOZ6","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

To accomplish that, I used the top of my feet to balance and hold the door up, while I used my right hand to hold the wood that the screw is going into from underneath or above the door being balanced on the top of my feet, and used my left hand to push the screw into the wood with the screwdriver as I turn it. It takes some coordination, and fortunately, I am pretty coordinated :-).I followed the instructions, and the instructions are excellent.Some reviews complained about cat urine ruining the wood... ummm... cat urine can ruin A LOT of things. Don't blame the product for it! If your cat likes to pee HIGH up... get a tall or hooded litter box. I don't recommend a hooded litter box, mainly because you'll need to take the whole box out to clean because the hood will need to be removed. I like the Whisker City litter box because it has its 10"" high back, and unless you have a supersize cat with long legs, and likely the cat won't even fit into the entrance/exit hole anyway, it should work. I guess your cat could pee on the side of the litter box which is lower. To prevent that, this is what I did, not that my cats does it, but just in case.... I used the 3M Command Hooks and small bidder clips to clip the puppy training pads up. To catch any drip, put another piece of training pad to catch the drip. The one hanging on the interior wall will need to sit over the pad on the base. (see pictures) Hope this helps.I just ordered the ""PetFusion SmartGrip Cat Litter Mat. Large"" on Amazon. It's 35"" by 25"". The interior base of the bench is 35"" by 19"". I'll have an excess 5"". I plan on adding more 3M Commander clip to clip the excess up along the interior back wall. The reviews said that it's flexible so that can be easily implemented as I plan. This mat should protect the interior base of the bench.How big is your cat? You might want to consider that before getting this bench. The opening is 7"" across and 8"" the highest part. I have a 12 lb big boned Himalayan (Himalayans are usually 6-7 lbs), and she made it in fine. Of course, my 2 (2 and 3) month kittens can climb in and out without any issues. From the floor to the bottom of the opening is about 7.5"". For real small kittens, you might want to put a block inside and outside the opening to serve as steps for the little one.Even though the doors have holes for light to enter, the interior is still very dark. I am not sure how well cats can see in the door. I also ordered the ""Motion Sensing LED, Kuled® LED Sensor light"". Based on the reviews of many battery operated lights, I feel this one should work best. Main because the interior cabinet is not that bright, and I wouldn't want to blind my cats when they go in.

I chose not to use it because it will take up too much space plus I want to use the litter box that I got. To store the divider, I put it under the litterbox and training pads.

"Excellent product for the price. I have read many reviews and done so much research, and I picked this bench because I want to put a supersized litterbox in it. It fits the ""Petmate Giant Litter Pan"" BUT, the litter box covers 1/2 the cat entrance on the side. So, I went with the ""Whisker City High-Back Open Cat Pan Item: 36-5216338"" that I got at Petsmart. I couldn't find it on Amazon. It's a perfect size! For those with cats that like to pee up high, I recommend this Whisker City litterbox because of its high back.Many of the reviewers expected high quality and perfect product for a $200 piece of furniture. I feel that if you are more realistic and consider the quality of the furniture you'll get for less than $200, this product will most likely meet your expectation. You're not going to get Ethan Allen quality furniture for $200.I am very pleased with this product. I found 1 damage and 1 imperfection in the wood, but I am okay accepting it. Mainly because the damage is in the insider corner of the door near the hinge, and I don't really see it every time I open the door. The imperfection is in the edge if the top of the bench. Even if I were to exchange this bench for another one because of the damage and imperfection, there is a chance that I could get another bench with more issues. For the hassle of returning because it's such a heavy bench and the risk of getting something worst, I'll stick with what I got, and I am happy with it anyway. (see pictures)I wanted a piece that I can assemble, mainly because, I can carry it up 2 flights of stairs 1 or 2 pieces at a time, since I am not strong enough to pick up the box. This furniture has a nice weight, and even on the box, there is a sticker recommending 2 people carrying it. I didn't have any issues assembling it by myself. The only little complication I ran into is when I was screwing the right door onto the bench.I'm right handed, and it is difficult to hold the door up and screw the little tiny screw into the bench.

"After doing a lot of research, I decided to stay with the Trixie product line because of quality and style. I don't want just any cat tree. I have purchased a $300+ carpeted solid wood cat tree that came assembled, but I couldn't move it upstairs because it was too heavy! I ended up giving it away.I wanted one that I need to assemble so that I can transport a couple of pieces at a time to the room where I want the cat tree. I wanted something that will look nice, and is sturdy. I also wanted one that is big enough to fit my 12 lb Himalayan and my 2 kittens' full grown size.I bought the Trixie Filippo and loved it. It is great for kittens and adult cats with claws. See my review on that tree on Amazon.I wanted 1 in my bedroom for my old lady Himalayan to be able to sleep close to my bed while being away from the kittens since the kittens seem to love her fluffy tail. After more research, I bought this Trixie Emil cat tree because it will fit my 12 lb Himilayan.The Emil comes with little steps for the cat to climb up onto the middle platform and to the bed at the top. The 2 taller steps wiggle a little, and I tightened the screws very tight. I think if the screws were longer, they might be more stable. The 2 short steps are more stable. The rest of the tree is solid. The bed is pretty roomy for my 12 lb Himalayan, and as I am writing this review, my 2 month old kitten is in the bed with my Himalayan :-). The bed will probably just fit up to an 18 lb cat.Here are some assembly issues that I ran into...1- this one is resulted from me not reading the instructions. There are 2 thread rods. One is longer than the other. The shorter of the 2 used to connect the top platform for the bed to the top scratching post, and the longer one is used to connect the bottom of the top scratching post, thread through the middle platform and into the top of the bottom scratching post.2- this one was not my fault. The middle platform has 4 holes: 2 for the steps, 1 for the cylinder tunnel bed, and 1 for the scratching post. I only found 3 holes. I ran through the surface of the platform with my fingers looking for the missing hole, and eventually I felt the missing hole in the wood for the scratching post. The hole wasn't punctured through the material. I used a pair of slender scissors to poke a hole through to the other side, and that corrected the problem.When assembling the tree, the instructions doesn't really tell you the order of the parts to put together asides from recommending that you assemble the tree top down. This is what I recommend.1. Be sure to assemble this tree on a protected surface. Hardwood is not what I would consider protective. The one of thread rods scratched my floor when I was screwing the post onto the platform, and the rod was a tap too long and left a circular indent into the wood.2. There are 2 thread rods that come with the tree, and one is longer than the other. Find the longer of the 2 thread rods and screw the short end into the scratching post3. Thread the rod already screwed into the post through the middle platform starting from the side that doesn't have the ball attached to the other. The hole is located away from the group of 3 holes.4. Screw the other scratching post into the other end of the thread rod.5. Now, lay out all the screws and group them by length. Refer to the diagram on which screw to use.6. Examine the middle platform. You'll note that one side has 3 visible holes and the other with the ball has 4. This is by design. if you are missing a hole with only 2 holes on top and 3 holes on the bottom, then you might have the same issue as I did (see my note #2 above under issues).7. If I remember correctly, use 2 of the medium length screws and screw the posts for the steps into the middle platform into the 2 holes located along the edge of the platform. Note that on the top side of the platform, the hole for the cylinder is not punctured through the material; it is covered underneath. It is only punctured through on the bottom side of the platform. It is the design. The posts should be sitting on the side of the middle platform that doesn't have a ball attached. The longer post goes into the hole closest to the scratching post, and the shorter post goes into the hole next to it. The screws go through from the bottom side of the platform with the ball.8. The remaining hole left near the 2 steps and away from the edge is for the cylinder tunnel bed. Find the shortest screw, thread it through the unfinished exterior end of the cylinder from the inside, and screw it into the middle platform. Not that the cylinder will cover the screw of the longer post. Be sure to tighten the longer post as much as possible before attaching the cylinder to the middle platform. Be sure to turn the opening on the back of the cylinder close to the scratching post so the the front will directly face the front of the tree as much as possibly.To adjust the cylinder after finished installing, it is very easy, so don't worry if the cylinder opening is not facing in the direction you want. To adjust later, you just need to loosing up the screws at the top and bottom of the cylinder. and the cylinder into the position you want.9. Take the base and with the finished side on the partially assembly part of the tree, line the holes for the cylinder and the scratching post, and screw the base into the cylinder and bottom scratching post using the 2 longest screws (check the instructions to make sure I am referencing the right size screws since I am writing this based on memory).10. Then screw in the long and short posts into the holes along the edge of the post. The longer post will be located closest to the scratching post and furthest away from the cylinder. The other hole is for the shorter post.11. Flip the tree around and screw in the tops for the 4 steps.12. screw platform for the bed onto the top of the top scratching post.13. Put the bed and the bed cushion on the bed platform, and put the little round cushion into the bottom of the cylinder tunnel. And you're done! Not so bed.Friendly reminder.... Please check the diagram to verify which screw to used. If you need to adjust the cylinder, you just need to unscrew the 2 screws attaching the cylinder, and make the adjustment.I hope this helps. I got my at bed bath and beyond. With their store coupon 20% for about $120, I got this tree for a lot less than in Amazon. For heavy products, I prefer shopping local, just in case I have an issue and have to exchange a part by ordering a new one and do a switch instead of lugging the whole tree back to the store or shipping it back. If Amazon has a much lower price, I would have taken my chance and go Amazon. I'm addicted to Amazon Prime! :-).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R200B1VI7HB5BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2J0954#wasThisHelpful","R200B1VI7HB5BZ","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, I was amazed by how stable this cat tree is. The cat tree came with the tools needed to put it together but there is no instructions.From my experience, here are the instructions:1. Screw one of the posts into the Hammock - Look for the end of the post that has a screw attached, and this is the screw that you'll be screwing into the hammock. As for the hammock, look for the side that has the holes. Align the hole in the material with the hole underneath the material in the hammock, and thread the screw in the post into the material and into the hole in the hammock, and turn clockwise to tighten the post into the hammock. Note that eventually, the material on the hammock will turn with the post. Keep turning the post until it is tight.2. Repeat Step 1 with the other post.3. Place the hammock facing down on the floor with the post facing up.4. On the base of the cat tree, the side that is fully covered with material has 2 holes, and this is side the posts will be screwed into. The tree comes with a small bag that contains 2 screws and a square looking ranch (not sure what you call it). These screws are for securing the base to the posts.5. Align the holes in the base with the posts. Place your fingers (2nd and middle finger) between one of the posts and the base with the hole located between your 2 fingers. This will help the screw align into the hole nicely. Thread one of the screws into the hole in the base and into the hole at the bottom of the post. Make sure the screw is lined up in the holes and between your 2 fingers. Slowly turn the screw into the post, and when the post and base starting to squeeze your fingers, stop turning the screw and remove your fingers.6. Repeat Step 5.7. Tighten both screws, one at a time. This will secure the base into the post.When done, the parts in the tree should be secured well that no part should wiggle or turn.My 12 lb Himalayan kind of ""just fit"". The way the hammock is designed, it will allow larger cats to ""spill over"" and still be able to sit in it comfortably.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKFT4N5QLUB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027IVL6K#wasThisHelpful","ROKFT4N5QLUB9","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this saucer for my Roborovski hamsters. It is so cute to see them run on it, and when the hamster stops running on it, the saucer will continue to spin until it eventually slows down to a complete stop. The reason why I am giving it a 4 star is because between the time the hamster stops running and the saucer comes to a complete stop, one of 2 things can happen:1- the hamster would spin in circles on the saucer until the saucer stops, and it is very entertaining to watch.2- or the hamster would fly off the saucer before the saucer stops spinning. This concerns me, because the hamster could hit something before landing and/or land hard on the floor of the cage.

"There is a warning on the label indicating that this gate is for PETS, NOT CHILDREN.Also, when the gate first come out of the package, it appears to be lopsided, and that there is a huge gap that prevents the gate from locking to the frame. This is by design. There is a tag hanging on the gate door informing you of that. Once the gate is tightened and secured between the wall, the gap will close and that the gate will be able to lock.Now that I got those 2 important information out of the way...This gate is so easy to install. I installed it on the staircase, and needed the extra extension panel that it comes with the gate. This gate is all metal except for the piece of wood located on the gate.Many reviewers complained about the plastic piece on the gate broke during shipping. Fortunately for me, that didn't happen.This gate also has a cat door built in, which is nice if you want to keep the dog out and let the cat in/out of the room.The gate also auto-close/auto-lock. Which means, when you release the gate, it will swing back into a close position. It does that sometimes, depending on the force. If I let go of the gate and let it swing back gently, the gate will close, but not always locked. If i were to add a little force when swing the gate back, it could swing back into a lock position. This is the only gate I came across that has this auto-lock feature. It can be nice if you want the gate to close on its own... or irritating, if you want the gate to stay open. I often like to keep the gate open, so I use a bungee cord to keep the gate open. It can easily be done by hooking one end of the bungee cord to the frame of the gate (same side where the swinging part of the gate is attached to the frame), threading the bungee cord through the swinging part of the gate that is attached to the frame, and connecting both ends of the bungee cord together or hooking onto the same area of the frame. Hope this makes sense. :-)If you have a baseboard on the wall where you are installing this gate, you can adjust the bottom to be more narrow than the top, as long as the bottom knobs align on the baseboard perfectly.Overall, I highly recommend this gate. Shop around for a lower price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NVI7AAC7OBJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKJ5RU2#wasThisHelpful","R2NVI7AAC7OBJ8","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful bedding for a great price. This bedding set comes with the bedskirt, comforter, 3 decorative pillows and 2 shams. I was looking for a comforter with a bedshirt, and didn't expect to end up with a purple color and more (decorative pillows and shams) for this low price.For the price, I didn't expect it to be this nice. The top of the comforter isn't smooth and soft because of the design stitched throughout the comforter. The bottom of the comforter has no design, and the material is so smooth and soft. The weight of the comforter is reasonable, not paper light, closer to a medium weight.I ordered a queen size, and the comforter hangs over the mattress just meeting the top of the bedshirt covering up the flat sheet on the mattress. I have to tug the flat sheet in so that it is not hanging beyond the comforter. The length is of any Queen comforter I own. With the top edge lining the top edge of the mattress, the end drapes over the end of the mattress falling about 1 or so inches short of meeting the top edge of the bedshirt.I don't have extra pillows to fill the shams with, so I took the 2 pillows and stuffed them in the shams. So now, I have 2 shams and 3 decorative pillows, instead of 2 pillows, 2 shams and 3 decorative pillows. It works great since I am not really the pillow person. Since I got it for the guest bedroom that is rarely, almost never used, it looks pretty with all the pillows on the bed.If you are looking for something inexpensive (around $100) and if this is the color and style you are going for, this is the one to get. I do not recommend machine washing it because of the stitching throughout the comforter. I believe the washing instruction is ""Dry clean only"".The set that I received has a small brown stain on the white fabric of the bedskirt. Since it is tugged between the mattress, I was okay with it. One of the decorative pillow has a dark stain. It looked as though it is wet. I am too lazy to return and reorder, plus I was already setting the bed anyway. I recommend if you are more particular, I recommend inspecting the product thoroughly in case there are flaws.I didn't order this on Amazon, even though it's a great price. I got it from Bed Bath and Beyond online and used a 20% online coupon. I ended up getting it for $100, saving about $10 then if I were to order it on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTOX270HKT6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXT5YU4#wasThisHelpful","R1FTOX270HKT6Q","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was on vacation last week and ran out of body lotion. I ran to Marshalls to find a bottle of animal-friendly (i.e. not tested on animals) lotion. I came across this bottle, and because I love the smell of lavender, I decided to give it a try. The next morning, after my shower, I applied it on my body. I am surprised by how well this lotion works. It is not watery/runny nor is it thick. It is just the right thickness, not too light and not too heavy. It is a lotion that I can use all year round. It has a real nice smooth feel to it. The fragrance is light, and after applying on my body, I don't smell it anymore. The lavender scent is similar to lavender, but it does not smell like the lavender essential oil (pure lavender oil). I love it so much that I went back to Marshalls today near my house to see if they have another bottle. I found a bottle of Organic Argan Oil, and it has a very light scent. I tried it out, and the consistency is the same as the Lavender one. I am going to stick to using this lotion for a long time. No more searching for the perfect lotion.

"This pencil case is very small, you can probably fit 4-5 No2 pencil comfortably, and it is also very soft and flimsy. If you are looking for something more stuff, like canvas, this is not the case for you. The design on the material is very cute, and it is compact/flat, which makes it very easily to slip into any bag without bulkiness. The only thing I don't care for is the interior. I was hoping for a vinyl like interior, but it's not. It has a white, thick, mesh like material. It's not my favorite material, and it made me dislike the case. I'm picky, but I am not going to give it a bad review because of my personal preference. I bought this pencil case on eBay for less than $3.95.

Since I am not looking for something with great sound, I got these with very low expectations.First I am very surprised with the design. it is very compact and stylish. It can be compressed for storage, and the sound quality changes when it is expended versus compressed. The speaker works both ways. It like the sound better when it is expanded.Note: I am not a sound expert - As for the sound, I am WOW! It sounds very nice. I don't play it very loud since it is only 2-3 feet in front of me on my desk. I am really surprised by the sound quality - especially for the price and the size. It comes with a 3 year warranty.

"I love this litterbox. It is the largest I can find. The local pet stores generally sell this around $25. I can't believe how inexpensive it is on Amazon $17 with Amazon Prime free shipping. The dimension of the area that holds the litter is about 27 x 17. For the 2 little pocket for storage, people often wonder what they are for... the litter scoop! It might also fit a box of litter fresher powder and might fit a small can of Lysol. I use it for the scoop and the other pocket for the bag that I put the dirty litter in while scooping.Unfortunately, this box doesn't come in different color, only the color as pictured. This box fits perfectly in the standard bathtub.Highly recommend it if you have just 1 or multiple cat or a very chubby cat. Very roomy. The quality is great. It is made out of thick hard plastic. It's not flimsy like some of the litter boxes I've seen at the store. It is very well made. This box is big, so please check the measurement and make sure you are okay with its size and have room for it. I would have liked it, instead of the 2 storage areas one the side, make the entire thing for litter, but since I have it in the tub, I like that I can just leave the dirty scoop in there and don't have to find a place for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K57V0DBEDCPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HHLVA4#wasThisHelpful","R1K57V0DBEDCPJ","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use litter box and training pads for my cat, and I like the fact that this litter is flushable. I started flushing it at first, and realize it can leave the toilet a little dirty and it is a waste of water. So I started putting it in a bag for disposal. At first, when I first poured the brand new litter in the box, I notice little dust. Then over time, as I scoop the dirty litter out, the litter can crumble over time. Depending on how you scoop it.

"My best friend and her family got me this as a surprise Easter gift. I LOVE IT. It's a little bigger than I had expected, but it is perfect in size. The height of the lotus pendant is 1/2"" and the width is 3/4"". With the bail, the pendant is 3/4"" in height. It is also pretty thick, and has a decent weight. The back is smooth and in the center, there is a stamp. I didn't try very hard to read it, and I assume it's ""925"". The chain that comes with the pendant is very thin. It can be a good thing, because when worn, the lotus will stand out and the chain is not noticeable. Because it is so thin and appears to be delicate, if you are wearing it often, I recommend switching the chain out for something a little thicker.Overall, I highly recommend it.

"My little Rat Terrier mix is extremely finicky. She turns down chicken, filet mignon, lamb chops, etc... all human food. She will only eat mini-cucumbers, and prefers the Persian cucumbers. This is one of the 2 treats that she'll eat consistently, every day. The other one is Grandma Lucy's Liver. Not just any brand of liver regardless of price, must be Grandma Lucy's.Let's just say that I am very excited to find this 2nd treat that my little dog will eat. I don't know if you have ever seen this treat in the box? I get this treat from a local specialty pet store, and I have seen dead and live bugs crawling around these treats. What the pet store owner told me is, they always put the box in the freezer for 24 hours before taking them out for sale. Even then, I have taken treats home with bugs still crawling. Pretty gross, but what I can do, when my little one loves this treat....So, what I do is, I take the bag home, then put it in the freezer for 24 or so hours. Then I rinse it under warm water to wash off as much as anything that I can and cannot see. I then unbraided it, and rinse it under warm water again. I then let it air dry on my kitchen counter. Then I put the unbraided treats in a Ziploc bag and stick it in the fridge. When it is ready to serve or before I put it in the fridge, I would take 2 unbraided pieces and cut them in half. It's because my dog is little, and if I don't cut it in 1/2, it would be difficult for her to hold it and eat, because it's too long.I pray that Barkworthie will never stop making these Pork Pizzles.

"You get what you paid for... please lower your expectations and you will be happier with this product. :-)Since this bookcase requires assembly, with the price being the first clue, this is the second clue that this bookcase is not high quality.The first one I ordered, I received this product in 3 days purchased with Amazon Prime. It arrived a day late but I am OK with that. I like this bookcase so much that I ordered a 2nd one.The first box arrived with a hole on one side but it didn't damaged the product. There are some imperfects (scratches, chipped paint on the edge of the boards) in the wood but they are not obvious. I also turned the wood around during installation so that the perfections are on one side, and I have that side of the bookcase against the wall. During assembly, one of the holes for the screw is a little off, and I managed to hand screw it far enough into the hole so that the screw doesn't stick out. I recommend using a power screwdriver to speed up the assembly. Little round black stickers are provided to cover the holes for the screws. Overall, it is very easy to assemble. Note: you will have to clean the wood with furniture polish before assembly, because the styafoam pieces makes the wood dusty. The wood is solid and the bookcase is very sturdy.One thing that I recommend is check the little round white plastic thingee that they put in the foot of the bookcase. One of them scratched my hardwood floor twice when I was shifting the bookcase around - during installation and when positioning it against the wall. If you have hardwood floor, it's a good idea to buy some felt sticky thing to put underneath each leg to prevent the legs from scratching up your hardwood floor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PGHI7HDENX32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009APXZOY#wasThisHelpful","R1PGHI7HDENX32","AJRLDYWMEA9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRLDYWMEA9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a sample package of this from a local specialty pet store. My little Rat Terrier mix is very finicky. I've tried so many mid to high quality pet food, and she will munch on Royal Canine, but she will eat this, Epigen 90. Royal Canine (2.5 star rating) does not have as good as a rating as Epigen 90 (5 star rating) on dogfoodadvisor. I like that this Epigen 90 is for both Canine and Feline since I have a Himalayan, too.After reading the reviews on this product on Amazon, and contacted Wysong to find out if the sample bag I got is the old formula or the new formula. Their customer service has great response time (within 24 hours) and are very helpful. This bag is the NEW formula just as the sample bag that I got.I ordered it on Amazon because of fast 2-day PRIME shipping. The bag arrived in great condition, and the expiration date is April 2016. Fresh product.After pouring a bowl of this food, both my dog and 1 of my cats started munching on it. A day later... my dog has slightly softer poop, but not runny. Solid, just softer. My cat... well, she didn't do too well. Major diarrhea. Hummm... not good, but then, I expect a run from both pets considering this is new food that I am introducing. I am going to wait a couple more days to see how my cat does.Updated on 5/30/2015:------------------------------------My cat started having solid poop about a week after being on Epigen 90.

"The first four stories are written about four brothers who find their wife during the time of beginnings for our country. The next three stories are written about the Quaker people and their quest for peace during a time of war. The last two stories are not connected, except for the theme of romance during our country's early history. Each story has romance, faith, and drama. Some of the stories have already been printed before, but the collection was nicely put together.I think my favorite stories were the ones about the brothers. The authors, while different, wrote the stories so seamlessly. They fit well together. I also really enjoyed the last story. It was about romance later in life. This was a huge book to work through, so it took me some time to read it.

"Four regency Christmas stories tell romantic stories of what happens under the mistletoe. Four couples find love during the Christmas holidays. The stories are tied together by their theme and genre, but can be read alone. Each gives a sense of the author's writing style, while wrapping up the plot in a short novella.I love Christmas, romance, and regency. So I'm sure you can imagine how much I enjoyed these stories. Since I enjoy regency romance so much I've read books by several of these authors, so I knew I would enjoy the stories. A couple of them felt a tad rushed, but it is a novella. Also for those who prefer a ""clean"" story, you might want to steer clear. The authors added some spice and bedroom scenes to these. Most of them were tasteful, but a couple were a bit much. Overall, I enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend it if you enjoy regency romance.I received this book free of charge from NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RO8PDSYRNW59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI7KK#wasThisHelpful","R3RO8PDSYRNW59","A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've reviewed quite a few adult coloring books, but none of them compare to the artwork drawn by Wendy Piersall. Her attention to detail and gorgeous designs are truly a work of art.I use these to focus my mind when I'm listening to a lecture or have to wait for an appointment.

"Lucy works for an interior designer, Sid, who specializes in purchasing rare or antique items for his buyers. Lucy helps run the shop and focuses on rare books. She's in love with James and feels that her life is going well. The one little blip is the absence of her father. He sends her a book every year on her birthday, but there is never a note. His stories started her on the path towards loving literature. But he spent time in prison as a con man and Lucy wonders how her past could affect her future. When one of her mistakes is reveled she loses her boyfriend and damages her relationship with Sid. When she is suddenly asked to go on a buying trip to England with a client she goes to find answers to her past, present, and future.Part love story, part history lesson, and part reflective are the ways I'd describe this story. The plot, nor really the characters drive the story. It seems to be more about coming to grips with yourself and your life choices, about how your choices don't have to define you, and about how change can come with life lessons. The story wasn't overly romantic or faith based, although it was implied that the main characters were Christian. I enjoyed the story and the aspects of the classics. There were times that the line of thinking was foreign to me and the introspective style was a bit much. But overall, while this wasn't my favorite of her books, I did enjoy it and will very likely read it again.I received this book free of charge from NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQG7RBNJWMAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPV60IW#wasThisHelpful","R1UQG7RBNJWMAF","A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Six authors take on the Lone Star state with historical romance stories that each show challenges and triumphs in love and faith. Each story gives the reader a taste of the writer's style and a sweet Christmas story about love. The stories are connected solely by their location, theme, and time of year. So each story can be read independently.I enjoyed these stories. Each one brought a different flavor to the book. The authors were able to get their message of faith and love across in the short novella style. While the book was long due to have six novellas in it, I was able to read each story without loosing the plot since they weren't really connected. This makes the book great for short waits at appointments or when you just have a short time to read.

"Katie and Brady might be opposites, but opposites attract. At least that's what Katie keeps telling herself. Everyone around her is getting proposed to or married. Which isn't that unusual in the wedding business, but when it comes closer to home Katie begins to get confused about her relationship. Some good advice and a little soul searching will show her the direction to take in this season of her life.The story begins with the same characters from book 1 and tells the story where the first book left off. So while reading book 1 will definitely help you get the back story and a better feel for the characters, it isn't necessary since the book could work as a stand-alone. The author does a great jbo of pulling the reader into the story and creating a light-hearted and fun experience. While the story was what I would call fun, it also had some deeper elements that were intended to cause the reader to think. This added dimension was a plus in my book. I loved the characters, the humor infused, and the faith theme that was woven into the plot. I'm looking forward to reading the third book about Katie and Brady.I received this book free of charge from Revell Reads in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KLOVI4ZBEFWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800724003#wasThisHelpful","R3KLOVI4ZBEFWU","A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book began when a question was asked of the author that she didn't have a short answer to. She was asked how she'd kept her marriage intact after 30+ years even with a separation in the mix. The author complied her thoughts and experiences into logical, practical advice that every wife can use and presented it in this book. Her hope was to prove that marriages can last and be wonderful and amazing. Using stories, illustrations, and experiences, she shows how each wife can build up her marriage and succeed where others fail.I enjoyed reading the book. A lot was things I already know and practice, but it was presented in a refreshing and inspiring way. This book would be a good read for any wife. Because it touches on so many aspects, everyone can gleam something from its pages.

"Brock is greatly disturbed by a dream that he keeps having of his late father. When he mentions this to his friend, his friend loans him a book on lucid dreaming. Brock finds that lucid dreaming can take him back to the past where the decisions he makes change the outcome of his future. Since he is having some difficulties in his marriage and business, he sets about to change the future by influencing his younger self. But it doesn't go as planned. He continues to meet with himself until he learns some valuable life lessons about the choices we make and how they effect the ones around us.This book was a different take on time travel then what I've read in the past. It was an unusual set up for a thought provoking book. I enjoyed the style of writing and the visuals the author created. I didn't really connect with or care about the characters, but the plot was very intriguing. I finished the book and couldn't stop thinking about the life lessons the author brought out. The book has appeal and I would recommend it for the Christian element alone. For the casual reader who isn't into life lessons or Christian insight, the book might be a bit much.

"James Bond is a character that is universally known. He first came to the world's attention as a character in a book. Then later he presented in the movies. Played by several different actors who each brought their own flair to his character, he still is an iconic figure who loves women, martinis, guns, and catching the evil villains. The author begins the book by taking a small peak into the life of the man who brought this iconic figure to life - Ian Fleming. He then mentions other writers who wrote about 007 and then delves into the movies and characters that made him a household name.A large heavy coffee table book that is sure to delight everyone who picks it up, this book is filled with pictures, inside glimpses of the movie sets, and behind the scenes information about the people who helped create the character.

But when she learns they can't afford to come home for Christmas either, she sinks into a depression.

As a person who suffers from depression, I didn't feel like that aspect of the story was portrayed correctly. I really liked Stan, the husband.

All three women have to overcome a current or past difficulty before they can find the love of their life. Sometimes the past can get in the way of the future.

"The author and his wife realized that their spending was causing a disconnect with their friends and family. Their children were expecting to receive something and the gifts they were giving people weren't creating experiences. So in an effort to recognize their blessings and connect again, they made a vow to go without spending for one entire year. There were some clauses, but for the most part, they wouldn't spend money. What resulted was more than they had imagined.The concept is great, but the author really makes this book. His sense of humor and entertaining way of looking at subjects draws the reader in. It's rare to find a non-fiction book that I just can't put down, but this was one of them. It wasn't just entertaining though. I learned a lot and was inspired to find ways to connect without spending money. Written from a Christian perspective, the author gives the reader subtle mentions of faith and Biblical inspiration.

"Jeb was a soldier for hire. But he's ready to retire. He returns to his apartment to relax and plan his next move. But when one last job offer comes through he finds himself forced to take it. He must rescue a spoiled rich girl and her friend, a reporter. Her father will stop at nothing to get her back. But nothing is like what he's been told and now he's just hoping to make it out alive.This was a good suspense novel with plenty of action. There was a touch of romance, but it wasn't over the top or mushy. The author used one of the secondary characters to bring in an element of faith that while at times subtle, got the message of salvation across very well. The two main characters were well written and their characteristics fit well with the plot. I also enjoyed quite a few of the secondary characters.

"Marriage is difficult. Just look at the divorce statistics if you have any doubt. But what about the people who are on the other side of those statistics? What is their secret to staying married for so long? The author shares his secrets, mistakes, and triumphs with the reader as he share the four secrets that he's found to keeping that important relationship alive.The author wove his personal story into the book while including lots of scripture.

"Kara, who passed away earlier this year from cancer, wrote a book with her friend Jill about what it means to show up and be there for a friend who is suffering. The women take turns telling their story from their own perspective. The style of writing is simple, and feels like a conversation with two friends. Each perspective gives practical and faith filled advice to those who want to help their friends and just don't know how.The writing was real, raw, emotional, and profound. It's been a long time since I've read a book that spoke to me so well. It showcases what true friendship, community, and love should be about.

"The book's bendable cover and gorgeous photography will appeal to the visual senses. But once the book is open, everyone will love the simplistic approach that the author took to explaining each braid and the easy-to-understand steps for each style. The book begins with several pages that talk about the different products, brushes, accessories, and hair styles that you will need to craft these braids. Each style begins with a full page photograph of the completed braid with the name. There is a brief description and then step-by-step photographs and descriptions tell the reader exactly how to get the desired affect.My daughter and I loved this book.

While the two stories definitely go together, they can also be read as a stand-alone. There were two almost separate parts to the story. They were both enjoyable for me, but my mind had a slight problem transitioning between them. Otherwise the story was smooth and flowed well.

"Paul is really nervous. Today is the first day of preschool and he isn't sure he wants to go. He tries to convince his mom to let him stay home, but she insists he try. The story is of Paul's morning as he gets ready to go to school and what his reactions are once he arrives. It deals with the anxiety a child might have when facing a new situation.The story would be a great book to read to a child who is getting ready to go to school for the first time or getting ready to do anything that might be intimidating for the first time. The vocabulary fits the intended age. Children will enjoy the story and will be able to relate to the little boy. My daughter enjoyed the story, but didn't care for the illustrations.

"England has just declared war with Germany. A luxurious airliner nicknamed the Clipper is preparing for take-off. They will be flying across the Atlantic to land in the United States. On board are a surprising mix of characters. Each of them has paid a high price for a seat on the plane. Each of them is escaping Europe for some reason. All of them will become intimately acquainted before the 30 hour trip is over. Some will lose their lives, some will find a completely different life than the one they intended, none of them expect the violence or turbulence that will be waiting.The story started out with separate story lines as the author brought each character to the day when they boarded the plane. There were plot twists, drama, and intrigue. The story covered a very small time period, but filled over 500 pages with grip your seat suspense and drama. If descriptive sex makes you uncomfortable, there will be a few paragraphs that you will want to skip. While I felt it unnecessary to the plot, it didn't really detract from the story for me.

"As women we are always chasing the to-do list. And at the end of the day some of us still feel overwhelmed and a tad guilty because everything hasn't been accomplished. The author has taken these struggles, that are personal to her as well, and written a Biblical and factual approach to getting to the root of the problem. Once the procrastinator can get behind the reasoning for their procrastination they can tame the to-do list and the things that they accomplish will be done well. At the end of each chapter is a small exercise that pertains to the topic.I picked this book up because the write-up described me. And for the first three chapters I felt like I'd picked up a book written specifically for me. Then it began to get tedious and I really had to force myself to finish. It felt ironic to be reading a book on how to prioritize my life and leave the things that didn't matter behind and to be spending time reading a book that didn't feel like it was really addressing my problem. While the content was good and I appreciated the spiritual aspect, the delivery was a bit dry for me. I would have liked a more light touch to the writing and more practical tips and suggestions that I could have put into practice.

"Kyle, a Christian recording artist, and Kelsey, a Christian actress and the daughter of a well know author began preparing for their future spouse when they were thirteen. The book begins and ends with their love story. But in between the story is a beautiful outline on how to start trusting in God to help you find the one you are meant to be with. The authors use personal illustrations and stories about friends to illustrate their points. Scripture and well thought out advice give the reader a clear path to follow.I've been married for 19 years. So technically this book doesn't apply to me. But I was still able to glean some useful information from it and I enjoyed reading the book. And I can honestly say, that while this couple has not been married long, they have a wonderful and correct concept of the process to finding the person that God wants you to have and preparing for a marriage that blesses Him. I would recommend this book to anyone who is still looking for that special someone and will be keeping it for my children to read when they get older.

"There are so many mixed messages about our bodies going around in the world today. So the authors have delivered an excellent, faith based book for young children that will explain God's idea for about the body he made for them.

Children will learn that God made them special, what is appropriate and inappropriate touch, the differences between secrets and surprises, and so much more.

"One of the greatest things that we as parents can pass on to our children is our spiritual legacy. It is the only thing of importance that we will leave behind and the only thing that will benefit them in the long term. The authors have joined together to and written a book using the concept of rites of passage that the Hebrews used with their children. The traditions and ceremonies were specifically designed to bring to remembrance God and what he meant to them. These rites of passage that are outlined in this book are to help the parents make faith real and lasting into the next generation. They are broken up by grades and each chapter is a separate grade beginning with Kindergarten and ending with twelfth grade.I was really impressed with this book. The layout is user friendly. The writing is simple in the approach, but the concepts have depth. Lots of Bible verses are used to back up the ideas and thoughts. Each chapter describes what a child of that age period will be experiencing, discussion questions, suggestions for instilling faith based rituals, prayers, etc. Each chapter a wealth of information, but doesn't come across as overwhelming.

"There isn't a whole lot written about the queen of Sheba. We know that she was wise, but sought out Solomon because of his reports of wisdom. The author has taken these few scriptures and other verses throughout the Bible to pull together a women's Bible study on how to be a woman of wisdom like the queen of Sheba. The author takes a personal approach and adds her story telling talents to make those few verses about the queen come alive. The book ends with study guides for each chapter so the book can be used in a small group setting or for personal study.The writing style lent a more fictional feel to the book, while capturing the reader's attention. I liked her frequent use of scripture and enjoyed the thoughts she brought out about the strengths of the queen. The study guide in the back was a plus that makes it helpful for further reflection. This isn't a typical topic for a women's study and I think readers will appreciate that.I received this book free of charge from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUP50W057LWJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400070031#wasThisHelpful","RUP50W057LWJY","A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to see change in the world, you must begin at home with your own family. Only by changing the family can the world be changed. The authors have a lot of experience in the ministry, but also in their family. They have a healthy marriage and five children, so drew from their personal experiences to write a book about reviving the heart at home. They touch on quite a few aspects of the home life - such as parenting, marriage, dating, and the different aspects of the mother and father.The writing is simplistic in style, without flowery words or verbose chapters. The authors use practical, useful illustrations and ideas to bring across their message. It's a refreshing and on-point look at how we can make a difference for God in our own home. I enjoyed the more personal approach and the suggestions were helpful. I appreciated the frequent use of scripture to back up their points.

So I was delighted with a chance to read the newest addition with the extras that were added to it. It's still a captivating story that inspires and convicts the reader.

"Stickers, coloring, and princesses are all things that most little girls enjoy. Combine the three and you have a colorful and fun activity book that will delight young girls for hours. The book starts out like a story and each activity is centered around one of the princesses, Charity, who lives in a castle. The activities are geared for ages 4-8.The book would be a great compliment to a church bag to keep girls entertained during the sermon. I have some positives and negatives. The positives - It's bright and colorful, the are plenty of stickers, the activities are age appropriate. The negatives - There isn't much to the book (although the suggested price does reflect this), there isn't a story line, the book doesn't describe the positive attributes of the name to the young reader.

"Abby was inspired by Maggie's column where she talked about Wishing Springs. Maggie had given her great advice and Abby was in desperate need of a change in her life. So she picks up stakes and moves to Wishing Springs. But from the very beginning things do not go as planned. Abby meets Bo and despite her desire to keep her distance she keeps meeting him to help. She hopes to keep her heart intact and her secrets safe. But sometimes God has other plans.This book was the second in the series, but could definitely work as a stand-alone. I enjoyed this book and it was fun to reconnect with the characters from the first book. It's part romance and part small-town novel. The story was a little on the heavy side as far as emotions and some of the deep topics brought up. But the author kept the romance front and center and lightened up the heavy topics with the zaniness of the towns characters. My only complaint was that it didn't really feel like a Christian book. There wasn't a lot of talk about faith or any of the aspects of it.

"MacKenzie grew up in the small town of Red Leaf, but was eager to leave. She was pursing her career in journalism when her father suffered a mild heart attach. Mac returns home to help out her father, but plans to return to the city when he is better. In the mean time, she's suffering at the local paper writing stories about garden clubs and town meetings.

She has a refreshing, sweet way of writing that draws the reader in and puts them into the story. The scenery was beautiful and the secondary characters helped make the story entertaining. I'd read another novella with some of these characters and so it was a nice surprise to meet them again. The romance was clean and focused on the importance of family.

"Mittie is in love with two things - horses and flying. But flying is her passion. She's currently helping her father at the farm while he recovers from some health problems. But what she's really like to do is buy her own airplane and fly. So when two men enter her life that have a love of flying, Mittie is in heaven. But she must trust her faith and her instincts to make the right decision when it comes to choosing the man who will have her heart.The story is rich with the history of flying and brings the era to life. Since the main character lives on a horse farm there is also parts about horse races and the life style that includes. The author did a great job of creating the main character and having her be likable and relatable. Since my husband is a pilot, I enjoyed reading more about flying in its infancy. The story is more about the main character and her path into flying than romance. But she does have two love interests and the romance is woven into the plot. Her romantic story was a little bit confusing for me. I was unable to feel the connection she had with either man and couldn't see how she chose the one for her so quickly in the end.

Her only possible witness is a private investigator named Luke. Abby isn't fond of Luke and his showboat antics, but she needs his help with the serial killer. Imagine their surprise when they both realize they are also working the same cold case. Luke's uncle was killed in the same fire that was set to kill Abby's parents.I really enjoyed this story. The characters were flawed, but likable. The plot flowed well and kept me interested the entire time. The plot revolves around the main character and her emotions and thoughts as she deals with finding who killed her parents. The book ends with some ends not completely tied up. So I was very glad to see that there is another book coming out soon. Not only did this book keep me engrossed the entire time, but it also really had me thinking long after I finished.

"Julitte lives with her adopted family in the small village of Briecourt. Long before France went to war with the Germans, the town has been at war. Two families have been feuding since before any of them can remember. So when the Germans invade their town, the Toussaints and the de Colvilles must decide whether to unite against them or stay in their feud.The book began by telling the story from two different view points; one of a Belgium man and the other from Julitte. It began slow and didn't pick up for me until about two thirds of the way through the book. But once it picked up I enjoyed the interaction between the villagers, the faith message, and a couple of the secondary characters. Most of the characters never really stood out to me, it was definitely more plot driven then character driven. This is a dark time in history and the author was able to convey the seriousness and hardships the villagers endured. There was a strong message of faith woven throughout the book, especially with the two main characters. Overall impression - In looking back after I finished the book, I can say that I liked it. But since it took so long to pick up for me, I can see others quitting before they get that far. There were some questions for me that weren't filled in after finishing the story, holes in the plot.

Join these autumn brides as they walk down the aisle with their best friend.This was one of the best collection of novellas that I've read. Each story was sweet, romantic, and had elements of faith woven into the story. The authors wrote about the bonds of family, even those that aren't blood related. The stories were short and simple, but the characters had depth and were relatable. The heroes were the stuff of romantic dreams - flawed, but completely in love with their girl.

"Maggie loves photography. Her entire life is wrapped up in her wedding photography business that she started with an ex-fiance years ago. When an old college rival starts a competing business down the street, Maggie is afraid of losing everything. If she can get over past hurts, she must might find the love of her life.The story begins when the two main characters are in college. The main portion of the story reads like part YA novel and part chick lit with lots of girl talk among Maggie's friends and angsty feelings for her rival. I enjoyed the photography theme since it's a hobby of mine. There was a few things with the secondary characters that felt left open, perhaps from a previous book or for an opening in another book. The relationships were realistic and fit with the plot lines.  The story has a faith element that is woven into the story, but doesn't come across as preachy. The story was wrapped up at the end with a romantic ending that will appeal to romance readers, especially those who enjoy Christian romance.I received this book free of charge in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HDSA7MEXDAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UR69PI0#wasThisHelpful","R25HDSA7MEXDAS","A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brianna and Colleen are two sisters who don't get along. They, along with their family, live on a horse farm. Their father has aspirations for them marrying well. But both girls have different ideas for their future than their father. As each girl grows up and matures, she realizes what is important and what is worth fighting for.The book reads like a family saga. The writing flows well and kept me moving through the story. The characters were more numerous than a typical historical romance. The book is laid out so that the main story lines are completed at the end of the book, but characters are set up for the next book in the series. The message of forgiveness and faith was woven throughout the story without it being preachy. I enjoyed the story, but the characters didn't grab me. I didn't fall in love.

But this book is now my favorite of hers. The characters were authentic and had depth. The plot of the story came alive with her descriptions, but I never felt bogged down in the details. The mystery and suspense fit well with the romance of the story and the time period. I felt like I was reliving a part of history as well as enjoying a great story.

"God loves His children very much and longs to bless them. When we realize what blessings truly are and the depth of love that our heavenly Father has for us, we will begin to see blessings all around us. The author has taken scripture and stories about blessings and woven them together in a compact book to show the reader how much God wants to bless us. Part I tells the reader about the power of blessings, Part II goes over the different parts, or decrees, of blessings.The cover is beautiful and the subject was appealing. The book is informative and could be used for additional study on blessings. However, it was a bit dry for just sitting down to read. I appreciated the points that were brought out, but the layout didn't flow smoothly for me and I found myself struggling to read portions. It will be a blessing to those who read it, but it wouldn't be considered light reading nor would work for a Bible study (on its own) like I'd hoped.I received this book free of charge from Chosen in exchange for my honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ZFD9OEVITDZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMSCN54#wasThisHelpful","R10ZFD9OEVITDZ","A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1N5JDPMOD8K3Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each of the four stories are connected by their location and time period. Each one is set in the south during or close to the Civil War. The women in each story must overcome obstacles to have the men they love. Each author captured the essence of the time period.I enjoyed each of these stories and found some new authors to check out. The one author I was familiar with took a secondary character from one of her previous books and wrote a love story for her. It was really fun to go back and visit them again.

"Britain is in the midst of WWI. Grace has a brother who has joined the fight and she wants him to come home. She naively thinks that if more men will join the war will be quickly over. So she crashes a party one night and hands out the white feathers to men she thinks are cowards. One man in particular is her focus. Her actions land her in trouble with her father and soon she finds herself working in the country helping with war efforts. What she finds there will change her life and that of her entire family.I've been wanting to read this book since I first heard of it. Thankfully it more than lived up to the hype. The book captured my attention from the very first chapter. The characters were complex and well defined. The descriptions were vivid and allowed me to ""see"" the story. The author was able to take a story during a dark period in history and add some beautiful elements to it. The plot was both complicated and yet easy to follow. I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense and twists the author used to guide the plot. I enjoyed the friendships and the elements of faith that the author wove into the story.

"The author changed her family's diet and wrote this book to show the reader the simple steps to implementing a healthy in their lives. She begins by talking about how to take it one step at a time and what to start with first. She then builds on each chapter with additional information.This book is intended for the beginner in healthy cooking. The steps are simple and follow what the author learned in her food journey. The book has a memoir feel. There are a few black and white pictures and six recipes included in one of the chapters. With the exception of the soda pop recipe, all of the recipes are simple and easy to make. This book would be okay for someone who is completely lost when it comes to implementing a healthy diet and needs a starting point and some general ideas. I was not able to glean any new information from the book, even though I am technically a rookie when it comes to healthy eating. I was very disappointed in the amount of recipes and helpful information. I had hoped for more. The book is full of grammatical and printing errors and the pictures were so grainy that I didn't find them helpful.

Heather and Ben must heal their broken hearts and decide if they have room to let another person in again. The story also catches the reader up on the happenings of the small community that was introduced in book one.This is a book that is rich in details and has a large cast of characters.

I was immediately bogged down in the details. The romance was weak and didn't grab me. There were so many characters that I had a hard time remembering who was who, despite the fact that I'd read the 1st book.

A bucket list to find out what you want to be when you grow up, given by a wise elderly lady. Perfect, right?! But the dialogue was so awkward and stiff. So much of the story was so implausible that it felt wrong. The story was sweet and a tad cheesy. The romance, while very rushed, was nice.

Her boss recommends a vacation and Livy heads to Logan Point. But once there she runs into Private Investigator Alex Jennings who is investigating the disappearance of a young girl. The clues all look just like the ones that were there two years ago when Livy's cousin disappeared. Can the two be linked? Livy agrees to help Alex in hopes of finding her cousin.Even though this is the 3rd in the series it can be read as a stand-alone. But based on the writing I would highly recommend reading the first two books. Ms. Bradley is not an author you want to miss. The suspense is well laid out and fits with the plot. The characters are likable or the kind you love to hate. I enjoyed the interaction between the family members and felt the scene was well set for the story.

But when things got out of hand and Kylie is suspended she's forced to retake social studies, spend time with a counselor, and do some community service. She's determined to fake everything so she can get back into cheer leading.I was a little skeptical of how the story would play out. It's the story from the bully's point of view. But the author handled the issues really well. The story brought out reasons, but not excuses, for why a bully might act the way they do. Solutions using the Bible were taught to Kylie in a non-preaching manner that will really help girls in similar situations. The steps to getting rid of bullying can be used on both sides of the issue to bring a resolution.

"I love the Mitchell series.  I love reading about their kids.  I have to be honest and say that Cassie hasn't been my favorite Mitchell kid.  However, that being said, I can understand her problems.  She is not going to listen to her parents about anything.  Kids do that.  They pushed and she pushed harder.  Cassie gets herself into some trouble and doesn't feel as if she can go home again.  Most of the book is about Cassie running off, getting into trouble, and finding her way on the right path.  This is not a sweet storyline.  She gets into some deep stuff.  She finally meets someone who can help her become who she really wants to be.  It just takes a while. I would have loved to have more interaction with the entire Mitchell family, but this book takes place outside of their home states.  Dual point of view.  No cliffhanger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRBW6BDL9BTE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016RIRI8K#wasThisHelpful","RRBW6BDL9BTE3","A1T5CK8KC56JZ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T5CK8KC56JZ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to double the five star rating!!! I am left a blubbering mess after knowing that I have finished a journey with a remarkable family.  I started with book one, and five books later I am still in love with this family.  Will finally gets his turn.  Will has always been the sweet one of the bunch, but man who knew what an alpha he would turn out to be with Carmen.  I loved that Lacey included a refresher course on Will's siblings and how they each found love.  Sometimes after having months between books we tend to forget storylines.  This refresher made it easier to connect the dots.  Will and Carmen are about to embark on a no no romance.  Carmen is Will's boss.  Oops!! I felt everything as I read this book.  I felt as if I were inside the room where Will and Carmen were.  Let me tell you, sweet Will is sex on a stick.  He is the total package, who would do anything for his woman.  Even if that anything is losing his job.  I love how he takes control of the situation.  I am a huge Will fan, but he made me swoon with his and Zach's shopping trip.  The angst is low key.  The family atmosphere is off the charts. The ending was breathtaking as we get a short story from Elizabeth's (Mom's) point of view.  I cried happy tears throughout the entire short story.  I can't believe the journey is over with this family.  This is a series that I will keep on my Kindle so that I can reread it anytime I choose.  This book has dual point of view.  No cliffhanger, but you are left with a longing of wanting more from this family.  This book is a part of a series.  Yes, you could read it without having read the others, but I'm going to suggest if you want to really get to know Will that you read the other books first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DA9VE73I0RVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BS3LWE#wasThisHelpful","R1DA9VE73I0RVM","A1T5CK8KC56JZ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T5CK8KC56JZ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this book is part of a series, I feel that you can read it as a stand alone.  Parts of the book take place while the other books are going on as well.  We met Derek and Carly in the other books.  They are instantly attracted to each other, but it takes a while to get their motors going.  There are a few ah ha moments in this book that answer some questions that I may have had during the other book.  It's for sure that Carly and Derek have angst, but they also set the sheets on fire.  As this book's setting is Australia, and I am American, I had a hard time with some of the language and expressions, but that didn't take away from the book.  I loved it.  No cliffhanger.  The story is mostly from Carly's point of view, but Derek's point of view sneaks in a few times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZUDJGF1LRQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEG25KU#wasThisHelpful","R2MZUDJGF1LRQQ","A1T5CK8KC56JZ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T5CK8KC56JZ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always good to go back to Summer Lake to visit with some great characters. This is a series, but each book can easily be read as a stand alone. This story is about Renee and Gabe. Renee is a down on her luck woman who has a positive attitude. Gabe has it all but is not really happy with how his life is going. They knew each other when they were growing up, but went on to have different paths. I have to say that I liked Gabe much more than I did Renee. She is so stubborn. I just wanted to shake her. I know there will be more books, but I am bothered by what is going on with Pete and Holly. Hopefully, I will get my answers soon. Dual point of view.

"I got this book as a free book choice.  I had never heard of it.  I had never heard of the author.  But, I really enjoyed myself.  I began to read thinking okay why is this book free?  Will it be one that I have to make myself read?  The answers are simple.  I didn't have to make myself read the book because I just couldn't put it down.  Allison has taken on the roll of ""mother"" to her dad and two younger sister.  She has put her life on hold in order to be there for them.  Her mother died from cancer just six months ago, and her dad has been in a downward spiral ever since.  It seems that he has lost his business and their home to someone named Trevor.  Trevor is a British billionaire who has no sympathy for people.  Somehow Allison agrees to become his mistress to pay off her father's debts so they can keep their home.  I have to say that Trevor is a pompous jerk most of the book.  You know that he really loves Allison, but man does he do some stupid things to keep her from knowing it.  I felt every emotion that Allison did.  I just fell in love with her character.  She was trying to do it all, but she sacrificed herself in order to get it done.  I loved the quirky cast of characters that were introduced in this story.  Dual point of view.  No cliffhanger, but we know that Allison's sister is going to have a book about her.

"This series is about a group of friends.  While in each book we get caught up with old couples, you can still read it as a stand alone.  This is the story of Justin and Tessa.  Justin is a psychology professor who is a bit awkward with the ladies.  Tessa is a receptionist who has had a tough life raising her younger brother.  In the other books you know there are sparks flying between the two of them, but nothing comes of it.  Poor Justin is clueless as to how to snag Tessa.  Tessa is doing all she can to get Justin to want to snag her.  This is a fun story that includes love and friendship.  Dual point of view.

"This is the second book of a series.  While, I think you would be okay without reading the first one, I would encourage you to read book one in order to get a better feel of the Malloy brothers.  I will warn you that this is not a cute story that have you smiling the entire way through.  It isn't an easy story to read.  Rev, the president of a MC club, has left his brother's wedding to save a fellow member's child.  He finds Annabel in a horrible situation.  He rescues her, and the story begins.  They both share a traumatic past, however, Annabel's tragedy is much more recent than Rev's.  They are both broken.  They need each other to heal.  I cheered for them the entire book.  I felt every emotion that Annabel felt.  You will be kept on the edge of your seat as you know that there will be repercussions of Rev's rescuing of Annabel.  I felt many emotions as I read.  I felt sadness, hopefulness, happiness, fear, anger, etc.  I loved the carnival scene as well as the fawn scene.  It honestly felt as if I were in an action movie.  Dual point of view.

"Because I have read the two previous books, I know how the story turns out.  I really think (in my opinion) that you should read the other books first.

"In reading the acknowledgements, I found that Danny's Main was never supposed to have been written. I sure am glad that it was. Danny and Julie are the backbone that makes this series. Without their guidance, their ""kids"" would have never made it. Their ""kids"" have stories of their own. There are 3 books before this one that are about their ""kids"". This book takes us back to the past to see how Danny and Julie became a couple. These two sweet people suffered blow after blow after blow. They did not have an easy life, but the one thing that they did have was love. Their love was so strong. Where many couples would have given up hope, Danny and Julie grew from these blows. I totally admire this couple. Throughout the book you will see the theme played out by using this quote, ""A family didn't have to come with blood, it only had to come with love."" This book is about family that doesn't have the perfect life, but love will win out every time. The book ends in the present, and it kind of made me wonder what is next for this group.

"Wow! Wow! Wow!  This is the third book in a series, but I do think you could read it without having read the others.  That being said, I will say DON’T read it without reading the others because you will be doing yourself a disservice.  The first two books in the series are about Blake and Liane.  This one is about their son, Carter.  L. L. Collins has this knack of pulling readers in with realistic characters and situations.  These are real people with real problems.  They are human and make mistakes.  But, they love with all they have.  While I read on of her books I feel every thought and every emotion through actions and words.  You will be blessed with reading this book.  The prologue explains Carter’s past.  If you read the other Twisted books then you will know what poor Carter has gone through.  His past has shaped him.  Let me rephrase that, what his “dad” did in his past shaped him.  And, I’m not talking about Blake.  That would be the evil Ronan from the first two books.  Carter is a character who changes throughout the book.  His parents, Julia, and even Julia’s family changes who Carter thinks he is.  Carter has just graduated and covets an internship in Denver.  The first day there he meets the boss’ daughter, Julia.  Whoo!! Hoo!! But, being who he is he fights every emotion.  I. Like. Julia.  She is blunt with Carter making her exactly what he needs.  I’m not sure which Carter I like the best.  Jealous Carter? Sexy Carter? Loving Carter? Mad Carter? Scared Carter?  He has so many facets.  I loved the games that these two played while getting to know each other.  One of my favorite scenes was when Carter was chatting with a little boy named Garrett.  That was precious.  I love the way that L. L. Collins incorporates music within her books.  There is always a playlist at the end to go along with the book.  My favorite quote from the book would be: “Because love not only shows up, it stands up.  This is me, standing up for you.”  I am honored to have read such a great story.  I love Carter, Julia, and Carter’s family.  And, I must say that L. L. Collins made me even begin to like Julia’s family at the end.  I can’t say enough about this book.  I promise that you will enjoy every second.  If you have never read anything by this author before, then you have found a new favorite.  Dual point of view.

"This is an amazing book.  We first met Anna and Logan in the Men of Honor series.  Anna experienced a happening that no one should experience.  Logan was there for her.  He loved her.  Then, one awful night changed their lives.  For four years Logan and Anna were apart.  He let her go because he though she'd be better off without him.  He loved her the entire four years they were apart as she loved him too.  What I found interesting is that once they became reunited we find out that neither of them were with anyone else for that four years.  That's how much they loved each other.

Jasper is ""hired"" by Muse to help her find her father.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this book.  There is drama, angst, love, hot sex, sadness, and mystery in this book.

"I feel like that I have run a marathon.  This book will keep you on your toes.  It will pick you up like a spinning tornado.  I felt love, sadness, happiness, madness, etc.  This is a stand alone book, but you will visit with characters from book 5 in Bayou Stix series.  This book will remind you of the haves and the have nots.  Ty is a blue collar paramedic.  Annabeth is from a family is from old politics.  Her dad is a senator.  She is torn between what she wants to do and what she thinks she should do.  Ty and Annabeth have a secret relationship because she doesn't want the knowledge of said relationship to get out.

"OH MY HOLY HOTNESS!!!!! Items you will need before reading: fan, water, husband/boyfriend/lover nearby, all day!!!! This is a wicked way to start a series.  I have been grabbed and pulled in.  Woolf and Callie share a past where their parents were friends.  Actually, he and her brother were best friends.  He fought his attraction to Callie because of his friendship.  He thinks she needs to find a nice ""vanilla"" man.  You see, Woolf is part owner in a sex fantasy club.  His lifestyle is so different than Callie's.  Hang on a minute, Callie has something to say about that.  She is tired of being the old Callie.  She is back in town after a break up.  WHEW!!! Hot does not even give justice to this book.

"Welcome back to Hope Falls.  I hope that you have read the other books in this series, but if you haven’t you can still read this one without being lost.  Melanie Shawn does a great job of recounting past couples’ experiences within each of this books.  I think you will fall in love with this quaint town nestled around the Sierra Nevadas.  This book is centered around Adam and Jane.  Adam is a 34 year old hot, genius who is very cynical about relationships.  You will find out why he is cynical later in the book.  Jane is a 30 year old awkward, quiet woman.  She is a very smart herself, and she is looking for that relationship that makes her feel that “zip, zap, zing”.  Adam doesn’t want a relationship, but he can’t get Jane off of his mind.  She seems to be everywhere he is.  It must be fate.  I had to giggle at some of their first interactions.  It was as if something from a comedy was unfolding in front of my eyes.  Poor Jane was left embarrassed at almost every meeting that she and Adam had.  I liked that added humor in the book.  Melanie Shawn has an ability to keep their readers engaged in the story.  They make you want to live with these people and be friends with them.

"I got this as a freebie off Amazon.  While reading the reviews I had my doubts that I would give this a five star rating.  I thought that at best it would be a four star book for me.  I am happy to admit that I was wrong.  This is a book about second chances.  It is a very clean read, and I would recommend this to a teenage girl to read.  Asher and Grace went to high school together.  She is two years younger than him.  They never developed that girlfriend/boyfriend relationship, but you could tell that it was what both wanted.  However, Asher leaves for college promising not to forget Grace.  To me this is so typical of young love.  Of course, they lose touch. and Grace ends up dating Asher's brother.  Two years later Asher returns and the sparks begin to fly again.  There is a lot of unresolved feelings that we go through with these two young people.  Keep in mind that during most of the book they are 18 and 20.  Kids that age are supposed to be reckless and not serious, but these two have a ton of maturity.  There will be a lot of turmoil these two have to go through to find their happily ever after.  Dual point of view.

"Beautiful. Compelling. Emotional.  Loving.  There are more adjectives that I'm sure give a better and more fitting description, but I just loved this book.  The Southerlands are a family that I have enjoyed reading about.  I will tell you up front that you can probably read the book as a stand alone, but I don't think that you will get the same feeling if you haven't read the other books.  Blake Southerland has been in England building his fortune.  He has an assistant, Samantha, whom he is finding a bit attractive.  She feels the same way.  A family emergency sends Blake back to Virginia.  Needing to finish some business, Samantha travels with Blake.  Blake is from a big, boisterous family.  Samantha is an only child.  She comes off a bit cold, but it is not her intention to be that way.  I can only imagine how intimidated Samantha must have felt meeting Blake's huge family.  I loved the way that Blake defended Samantha when his brother, Adam acted like an @$$ to her.  This was a simple love story without exes and outside influences causing grief or heartache to their relationship.  I love that we as readers just get to watch their story fall into place.  There is a dual point of view.  There is one chapter in which we get John, Blake's dad's point of view.  That just made me happy cry.  Then as I kept reading that happy cry turned into an ugly cry.  I don't want to ruin the story so I will stop there.  No cliffhanger, but we know that Taylor's, Blake's sister, story is next.

Erin is an ER doctor facing the challenges that ER doctors face while dealing with an ex, whom is also a doctor, dealing with a past she wants to keep hidden, and dealing with a tragedy that left her family heartbroken.  Their lives connect one night and both of them will never be the same.  Within the first few pages I was captivated.  I kept reading to find out answers.  Erin does A LOT of running, so she got on my nerves often.  Dual point of view with suspense, action, drama, sex, and love.  No cliffhanger, but there is another Trent boy book coming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21IMZ5X4HRI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPMO82I#wasThisHelpful","R21IMZ5X4HRI0","A1T5CK8KC56JZ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T5CK8KC56JZ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the final book about Ayden and Lyric (there are 4).  I felt as if this book was a bit short.  Their story did get a conclusion. All of the questions that were swirling around in the previous books are answered.  I just didn't like this series as well as I did the one about their parents.  There is a bit of a dark aurora around the book.  If you like happy contemporary stories then this book and series probably isn't for you. I still love Lyric's happy go lucky attitude.  She doesn't let stuff keep her down.  Ayden finally has come out of his fears.  Dual point of view.

What I didn't care for was the dating of two guys.  I just like my romance books about one girl and one guy.  Other people will like that aspect.  I just didn't.  It all works out in the end with Juliette choosing the best guy for her.  Also, there are a lot of characters.

"Sexy, bad @$$ racer, Leandro has hit rock bottom.  His near life ending wreck has left him afraid to get into a car.  He is on the edge.  He is about to lose his career.  He goes to see a therapist, India.  They are VERY attracted to each other.  India fights the attraction all the way because it's a no no to be involved with a patient.  After a bit of persistence on the part of Leandro India gives in.  There are lots of hurdles that this couple must overcome.  I think what I liked the most about the book is that once they became a couple, they didn't run from each other when problems arose.  They talked about everything.

"his is a second book in a series.  I do think that you should read book one before this, but if you didn't then you will be okay.  We met Jade and Aidan in book one.  Jade is a dancer who has come to be with her two best friends and teach at a dance studio.  She and Aidan met a year ago and have been close friends since.  Aidan wants more.  He really loves Jade, but he can sense that she is scared of something.  That something comes to light in this book and causes Jade to run.  Aidan follows.  The running lands Jade a job as a guest judge on a dance show.  The dance show felt like So You Think You Can Dance.  Matter of fact the characters' names reflect that show. You will fall in love with Aidan as he is so sweet but manly at the same time.  Dual point of view.

She moves back home to start a dance studio with her two best friends.  Jaxson is a widowed father.  His little girl signs up for Mia's classes and the story goes from there.

I love the Green Mountain series so I loved this part.  The wedding helped complete Cam and Will's story.  I loved how Marie used Fred in the wedding as well.

"Easy Charm is easy and charming to read.  I am enjoying the Boudreaux family.  Kristen Proby has a way of luring you into this fantastic family world.  She makes you fall in love with the characters and feel as if you are a part of their family.  This book is about Gabby, the youngest Boudreaux, and Rhys, a professional baseball player.  We met both characters in the first book.  You don't have to read the first book in order to understand this one, but I encourage it.  Gabby is the baby of the family raising a son by herself.  Rhys is an injured baseball player needing time to mend from surgery.  They have an instant connection.  This is a sweet story of them learning to love each other.  There are a few spots of misunderstanding along the way, but nothing to make this what I would call angsty.  Had life not interrupted me I could have read this in one sitting.  I can't wait for more of this family.  Dual point of view.

"There is nothing to hate about this new series.  I am hooked.  Katie Ashley hooked me with the prologue.  I was grabbed and pulled into a world of motorcycle men who aren't exactly on the right side of the law.  Willow will steal your heart in the first few pages.  Deacon is a member of a MC.  He likes women and he lives a life where he is responsible for the MC he is a part of but nothing else.  Enter Willow.  Willow is Deacon's child.  He has no idea what to do with a child.  Alexandra is Willow's kindergarten teacher.  She is worried about Willow, but she doesn't know what she is in for when she goes to visit Willow's home.  Alexandra is nothing like the women that Deacon likes.  She is ""white bread"".  When they finally give in to the attraction, it's lights out.  There were scenes in the book that made me want to cover my eyes.  Katie Ashley vividly described some of the going's on of the inner workings of a MC. There is a lot of action in this book.  I fell in love with the characters despite their way of life.  Dual point of view.  No cliffhanger for this story, but we are set up for Rev's story coming soon.  This is a series that will capture you, make you want to do nothing but read, and then leave you breathless when you finish.

Taylor and Falyn are the main characters in the story.  She has no interest in him, but then she finds out where he is from and uses him to get there. They have a relationship that is based on bantering back and forth.  I like Taylor for most of the book, but then I wanted to slap him.  I'm not a big Falyn fan.  I really didn't care for her throughout most of the book.  There were MAJOR bumps in the road in their relationship.  I wanted to throw my Kindle at the way the story unfolded. Just when you thought the story was going the way you wanted, BAM it turned a different way.  Of course, I kept reading because I wanted to know how this was going to play out.

"This is a bit of a different type of book that I have been reading.  Yes, it's romance, but it's so much more.  Renie has lost her grandmother and her mother in a short time span.  She is losing control of her emotions when the rock that she needs walks through the door.  Mitchell is who Renie needs.  They were married and divorced.  They had that young love, but then life got in their way.  She was a bit immature for the relationship and the time that it takes to build a lasting one.  This is a book about their second chance, but it is also about Renie growing as a person.  She has to come to some realizations about herself.  The book takes you back in the past at times.  We see how the love of Renie and Mitchell came to be, and we watch as it blooms again.The author did a great job of character development.  Dual point of view at times.

I think what I had trouble with is that in order for these characters to grow and learn they had to be apart.  I love Houston and Rory together.  I don't like who Rory was apart from Houston.  I felt that even though she loved Houston she had a hard way of showing it by running off with Liam.  Of course, her running off is the result of miscommunication and some dumb choices by Houston.

They are attracted to each other but Tabitha's best friend Madison (from book 1) used to date Barrett.  Tabitha doesn't feel as if they should  continue seeing each other.  Tabitha has used sex in the past to fill in for something she is missing.  She never sleeps with the same man twice.  Barrett is going to change that.

All you want to do is keep reading until you are finished.  Then, you sigh and think to yourself why didn’t I slow down because now what do I read to top that.  Melanie Shawn pulls you into the story.  You feel as if you are a part of the story.  The editing is awesome.  There are no miscues to make you stop and have to read again.  The storyline will keep you interested from start to stop.  Levi owns the local bar in town.  He and Shelby had an encounter at a wedding over a year ago.  He has never forgotten that encounter even though she left without a goodbye.  Shelby comes back to Hope Falls to try to get her life back together.  There are sparks flying everywhere, but both of them are too stubborn to do anything about this lust.  Each have their own reasons, but you just want to shake them and yell, “Get on with it!”.  Even though this book is a part of a series, you could read it as a stand alone.  Other characters reappear, but you can follow the story without knowing their backgrounds.  Dual point of view.

"I am in love with this series.  I think that the books just keep getting better and better.  I laughed, I cried, I got mad, and I felt the loved.  I honestly think I laughed harder in this one that i have in the others.  There were so many scenes that cause me to giggle so much my husband looked over at me.  I loved the scenes where Bella, Allie's best friend, made such a fool out of herself in front of Wren.  Once you read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about.  We have known Wren throughout the entire series.  We met Allie in the last book.  Allie and Wren had a hook up seven years ago that produced a child.  Wren was so drunk that he doesn't remember the deed.  He also gave Allie a fake name.  She finally found him, and she is now demanding answers.  I can't say that I blame her for making Wren grovel a bit.  Their chemistry is off the charts.  I love the relationships that surround Wren and his family.  These dudes are hot, rich, loving, alpha, caring, etc.  They are the total package.  Even though this is part of a series, I feel that you can read this as a stand alone.  However, I don't suggest that you do that.  Each book is worth the read.  You too will be hooked if you give this author a try.  I can't wait until the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVZEQ0SB4HYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMKOH2W#wasThisHelpful","RFVZEQ0SB4HYJ","A1T5CK8KC56JZ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T5CK8KC56JZ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ella Fox got my attention once again with this second book of The Catch series.  This book is about Trace and Darby.  The book takes us back to when Darby was 4 and Trace was 5.  We were shown how awful Trace's grandmother treated he and Tristan.  We also saw how Darby wanted to take away his hurt from the moment they met.  We follow their friendship as the years go.  We know that Darby is totally in love with Trace, but we also see that Trace in his own way loves Darby just as much.  While I know that Trace had a horrible beginning, his using sex to cope just ticked me off.  I felt so sorry for Darby as Trace strings her along.  Yes, I know he deeply loves her, but that is not how to show someone you love them.  Darby is a trooper.  She is strong.  She has to be because a weaker woman would have been broken by Trace's constant yo yo treatment with her heart.  I loved the epilogue.  Dual point of view.  No cliffhanger.  I might suggest to reread Catch My Fall before reading this one.  I read it so long ago that I forgot what happened in that one.

River is an escort who has been hired by Meadow to make her boss, and man she thinks she's in love with, jealous.  Her boss is a total loser.

I was invested in the story from beginning to end.  Yes, there may have been a few (and I mean very few) errors, but those errors didn't deter my reading as they did the books 2 and 3.  The storyline was different for this one as well.  I didn't feel as if I were rereading books 1-3.  Jett is posing as one half of a gay couple.  The problem is that once he gets a look at his client's sister, Ophelia, he falls head over heels.  Now, he has to settle for being her friend.  I love how their friendship grows and flourishes.  There were some humorous parts in here as well.  I love the way that Jett gets the best of Ophelia's boyfriend.  He deserved everything that Jett does to him. Dual point of view.  No cliffhanger.

He is really mean to her at first.  They fall for each other, but she must overcome some things in her past to help her to fall in love again.  There are some spelling, editing, and word usage problems within the book.  Sometimes those errors make for hard reading.  They weren't as bad as in book two, but I still noticed them.

"This is the second book of a series.  This book can be read as a stand alone.  Even though the same characters are in each book you won't miss anything by not reading the others.  While I really enjoyed book one, this one seemed to lag a bit for me.  I had a harder time getting in tune with the characters.  There were some typos and even some misused words such as than and then.  I didn't notice that in the first book.  Troy is a professional escort.  He only escorts dates.  He doesn't kiss them or anything else.  Harper and Troy met in book one.  They become friends.  She has him to pretend to be her boyfriend in order to get her parents to leave her alone.  I did like how Harper was honest with Troy about having a hard time accepting his job.  What girlfriend wouldn't be jealous of her man spending time with other women?  I felt as if the relationship that Harper had with her parents was left hanging.  Even though that was a major focal point in the story, we didn't get closure with them.

"I enjoyed this book.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I read the blurb about the male lead being an escort, but it turned out wonderful.  Rhett has been hired by Aspen to be her date.  She is wanting to stick it to her ex and his new love.  The relationship builds slowly for Rhett and Aspen as they can only be friends.  They share so much of each other, but both are afraid to take it to the next level.  I love Aspen's strength.  I love Rhett's loving side.  I admire Aspen for not being upset at Rhett's job.  I'm not sure I could be so understanding.  The book has a nice even flow to it.  There is minimal angst.  You will fall in love with Rhett and Aspen.  Dual point of view.

"If you are looking for a romance book where boy meets girl, boy and girl have problems, boy and girl make up, then this book isn't for you.  This is a book about a couple who are married and have been married for years.  Their sex life has become a bit boring.  This book discusses how they rekindle their sex life.  I found myself being able to relate to Frank and Wendy.  Most people's sex life gets pushed to the rear while raising a family and going about daily life with that family.  One day Frank finds and reads (after he figures out the password) Wendy's Kindle.  He realizes that their sex life has gone cold and he wants to recreate the spark they used to have by using the knowledge he found by reading some of the books on her Kindle.  I loved how Frank loved his wife but lost touch with what they needed as a couple.  This happens in real life.  I think I'll leave this book open on my Kindle and maybe my husband will read it.  The book unfolds over a few days time, but it is well worth the read especially for that person looking to revamp their sex life.  No cliffhanger.

"While I totally loved the other books in this series and gave them 5 stars, this one just didn't shout a five star rating to me.  There were parts of the book that I loved and there were parts of the book that to be honest sort of bored me.  Kellie is the only female in this McCallan clan.  She was a bit of a mystery to me.  There were times that I rooted for her and there were times that I wanted to smack her.  She and Tate had an instant chemistry although neither acted upon it.  Tate won my heart with his interactions with his Gram.  I felt there was too much Kellie and her family and not enough Kellie and Tate.  I understand that this is a series about the McCallans, but I wanted more of Kellie and Tate.  There wasn't unnecessary angst between the couple, but the family dynamics will keep your head spinning.  Max, the McCallan who I didn't like in the other books, begins to turn me around with how I see him.

"I enjoyed Caroline and Reed's story.  I will admit to not liking Caroline early on in the story as she was judging every guy by his bank account.  I realized how she was brought up and how she wanted to be different than she was in her youth, but shaking off guys who didn't have a solid bank account is just bitchy in my opinion.  Once I got to know Caroline I did enjoy her character better.  Reed and Caroline butt heads, but their chemistry is off the charts.  They keep secrets from the other therefore their relationship is rocky.  This is book two of a series, but you can read it as a stand alone.

"What a disappointment! First, the stated dimensions are totally wrong. The website, and even the carton this is shipped in, says it is 27.5 inches wide. But in fact it is 42 inches, which means I ended up having to repack it and send back since it was too wide for the alcove I intended it for.Second, this does not in any way look like leather. It doesn't even look like imitation leather. It is a two-tone mottled plastic material with 2 shades of brown that look like large, blurry polka dots. Really ugly. Fortunately Amazon is wonderful about returns that do not match the web descriptions and this certainly does not.

"I am an artist and have painted a number of murals on various walls of our homes over the years. Recently, we moved into a new apartment and I just didn't have the energy to paint 2 sliding door panels myself so took a chance on this mural. It's beautiful!  First, although very reasonably priced, it is a high quality product, made of a heavy paper stock with a glue sizing on the back. You simply dip a panel in water (I did it in the bathtub) and take it, dripping wet, to the wall (or door) and simply press it on, wiping across it with a lint free towel or soft sponge to remove any air bubbles.As opposed to plastic film, air bubbles are easy to press out with this product. And best of all, there is so much sizing on the back that it is very easy to slide the panel around to straighten it or align it. Consequently, you don't have to do what the directions say which is to draw a plumb line before you begin to make sure you put it up perfectly straight. I just put it up, used a carpenter's level to make sure it was level, sliding it a bit here and there till it was. Super easy. And you don't have to worry about wrinkles. The paper is heavy and forgiving. Wrinkles seem to disappear.Now for the quality of the graphics and the color: it is exactly as shown in the photo. I am using it in a small room, and the soft colors are not intrusive. I actually cut it to mount on 2 sliding closet doors, and that was easy to do. The finish is a very nice matte. I really am extremely impressed with the company and the product, which is designed and manufactured in Canada. It shipped in a heavy tube and arrived in perfect condition. The only thing I question is why the price went from $22 when I bought it a few days ago to $38 today. Is it worth $38? Yes, it really is, but perhaps you should check to see if you can find it cheaper with a different vendor, or even here on Amazon, which often has varying prices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IOCIWO7OLJUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WZCHPQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IOCIWO7OLJUW","A18CQ3TU9MISJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18CQ3TU9MISJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The advertising is a little misleading. The memory foam layer is only about 1/4 inch thick so is virtually ineffective. The rest of the foam is fairly firm, but since I've just started using it I can't report on how quickly it breaks down or whether it retains its firmness. But I wouldn't buy it again because of the almost non-existent memory foam, and also because the cover is fabric on all sides, which makes it less practical as a cushion that ""travels"" (such as the ones with one vinyl side) and which can be washed/wiped down easily. Because of the name of the company it might be that this is primarily for a wheelchair seat, in which case the fabric on all sides would be softer than vinyl, but the memory foam should be thicker.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VZUYYMYTWEOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M9GGEG#wasThisHelpful","R3VZUYYMYTWEOF","A18CQ3TU9MISJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18CQ3TU9MISJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been taking biotin for years. First, my hairdresser recommended it and then my dermatologist concurred. Initially, I started with 500 mcg, increasing it up to 2,500mcg on my dermatologist's recommendation. I actually found my hair and nails growing much faster on just the 500mcg, but increased it to see if there would be further improvement. The improvement to my nails was amazing. They have always been thin and unattractive. The higher dose of biotin made them grow in thicker, stronger, and unbelievably (at least to me) the nailbed actually lengthened, making my nails far more attractive than they'd ever been in all my 70+ years. Wish I could say it did away with the ridges, but that's not changed. The only effect I've seen on my hair is that it grows much more quickly when I take biotin, and the dosage hasn't seemed as critical as with the nails. But here's the kicker: After taking 2,500 mcg for about 8 months, I started using this Twinlab 600mcg. and have been able to maintain the improvement on that small amount. It's a very small capsule, is made in the US, comes in a glass jar, and is free of corn, sugar, coloring etc. It's a quality product that I really trust and recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRJOUZPNO87V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011FPIXM#wasThisHelpful","RMRJOUZPNO87V","A18CQ3TU9MISJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18CQ3TU9MISJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this lamp a lot. The light is gentle and it's well made. The main reason I don't give it 5 stars is that there is no timer, which is important when you are resetting your circadian rhythm and want to use it a specific amount of time every morning or evening. Even the little portable LED one at $69 has a timer, so it is possible and should be added to the design. Moreover, the Verilux bulb gives off some heat, which isn't a problem for me but it could be for someone prone to hot flashes or living in a warm clime without A/C. And even though this is not large, it's not an item you can travel with. So bottom line, I've bought both lamps.

"Whoever invented this toilet scrubber system was brilliant. These pads are a very firm nylon material with disinfecting soap embedded in them. They fit (easily) onto a plastic wand, which sells as part of an introductory package. The wand is very well designed and the pads are easily popped off the wand with a flick of a lever. Your hands stay clean throughout the entire process.These pads clean far better than any brush can for they fit under the rim of the bowl, into the hollowed out area that often gets mildewy and that brushes never seem to get really clean. Yes, it's a bit more costly than a reusable brush, but it cleans better and you don't have to have an ugly toilet brush hanging around the corner of your bathroom.

"This is absolutely the best dark chocolate confection ever! I am a chocoholic, specializing in dark chocolate for 70+ years, consuming them in every country imaginable. This small tin contains 2 layers of rich dark chocolate wedges, each of which contains just a dollop of soft caramel. The result is heavenly perfection - not too sweet, lovely contrasting textures of the firm chocolate and melting caramel, and is totally satisfying. And that is what perhaps sets this chocolate aside from all others - eating just one small wedge is totally satisfying. There is no craving to continue on. OK, maybe if you want to indulge, a second one might be in order, but you won't binge on this chocolate - you'll savor.The only caveat is the price. In a Trader Joe's store, the price is about $4 per tin.  Over $8 seems obscene.

"Arrowroot is a wonderful product for anyone on a gluten free diet. But it is also a good friend to all cooks who like silky sauces without the heaviness of flour, especially since it mixes easily into either hot or cold liquids. It also is a great friend to people with sensitive skin. I use it as a bath powder, for it is 100% pure, with no preservatives, botanicals, or chemicals, and it is silky smooth.

"This little guy will never replace a larger, better roller for calves or thighs, but it's handy to throw in a suitcase. Wish it were more ergonomically designed. The handle is awkward and it takes 2 hands to keep the roller moving along the trajectory you want. The roller part is very hard plastic, not rubbery as it seems to appear in the photo. It's usable, it's OK, but if this is going to be your primary roller, expect to pay at least $15-$25 for a good wooden one or a better, more flexible and ergonomic plastic one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V489YDYOW13G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR8PX6I#wasThisHelpful","R1V489YDYOW13G","A18CQ3TU9MISJY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18CQ3TU9MISJY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jackets and shirts are somewhat hit or miss with me when it comes to sizes. I have a medium torse, but am tall and have long arms. So while a medium will fit me in the mid section, the sleeves are usually short. And a large will fit me sleeve wise, but im usually swimming in the torso area.I ordered both a medium and large to see which one fit best and luckily enough, they made the medium with longer arms. So the medium was a perfect fit. Large was way huge.Now....I love buffalo jeans. They are the only jeans I buy. I own some of their shirts too, but I mostly just love their jeans. I expected great quality with this jacket, which I will say, it is pretty sharp. The biggest problem I can get past with this jacket is the noise it makes. It sounds similar to people that cover their couches in plastic protectors. Its absolutely horrible. I even had a friend, for kicks, walk into the other room down the hallway with it and move their arms around and it was sooooo loud I could hear it from down the hall. Too funny.They should have put a decibel reading on the tag.Ive tried many other faux leather jackets and they are 100% quiet. But they were very loose material. This one is very stiff.I really wanted to love the jacket.

"These racks are pretty decent, but not without issues.These are not attached, which was what I wanted. But there are issues with not having them attached. One is stability. You have to have these aligned pretty well to get the bar on properly. you dont want to lift heavy with having an awkward starting position. And also ,lifting super heavy will be questionable when reracking the weight. you want to be careful as to not alter the position of the racks, but lets face it, after doing a set of squats to exhaustion, you sometimes dont have the energy or stability to be careful enough to not push these racks out of place. Luckily, I mostly only use these for light in house workouts. I save the heavier lifting for the gym.Another reason I bought these is because I wanted to use the stoppers as a dip station. Although it works fine, the paterial they have on it hurts your hands. So I recommend cutting a PVC pipe to place around it to make it more comfortable.The biggest issue I have with these racks is the method they have for changing the height. The pin that goes in does not stay in too well because it is too short. It kept sliding out of the one side when I was in mid workouts. I ended up having to get a wire tie to strap it in place. Also, the stoppers are not a through and through pin. Its a screw. And you cant adjust the top height of the racks without unscrewing the stoppers, taking out the pin to adjust the height, replacing the pin and then replacing the stoppers with their screws. This is VERY annoying and takes a lot of time to do. I woudlnt recommend having a workout placing with switching back and forth between rack height if using the stoppers.Another notable mentions...if using a lighter bar be cautious. The distributed weight could be an issue. I had the bar go flipping across the room because I had a 25lb plate on the each side and took the one off. Unlike heavier / thicker bars, Ive never had this happen, but also a big deciding factor is how far apart the rack is spaced. Since these are free standing, this could be an issue. So Just keep this in mind.Also, the one stand I received was bent out of whack and I couldnt get the top bar in. I didnt feel like sending it back and waiting for another, so I just got a hammer and pounded it back into shape myself. Not really something Id expect to do considering the price, but whatever. It worked.I cant say that these are the best, but for the space I have and the ability to more easier move these from room too room, they will do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ6JBFWGSQN12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5QE3L0#wasThisHelpful","RJ6JBFWGSQN12","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I went through a couple dish racks before I arrived at this one. I actually wasn’t expecting to like it at all, but it’s perfectly what I wanted. Not something big and clunky taking up too much counter space, and also wasn’t an eye sore to leave out when not being used. This fits both criteria.It’s also low profile too which is nice. And whereas other standard dish racks might be bigger overall, this one is slightly longer than standard, so it still holds just as much.The only grips I have which aren’t deal breakers are:Odd enough, there are no rubberized feet under the water tray, but there are rubberized feet under the frame. Why they did this is strange because the steel frame fits perfectly in the water tray and there isn’t any room for it to move around anyway. Possibly just to keep the frame from sitting in water I guess. Anyway, this makes the whole rack slide all over the counter. I had to buy some stick on rubberize feet to stick on the bottom of the water tray. Now it stays put.The utensil tray is not attached to the base. This makes it topple over easy when too much is in there. I used small clear wire ties from Walmart to grip it to the frame. Now this also stays put.The water tray needs to be emptied. But I already knew this before I bought. Still would have been nice if it had some sort of self-emptying, as I am always spilling the water all over the place when trying to empty. Doh!Overall, still a great dish rack for a single dude that’s too lazy to fix his broken dish washer. Maybe for 2.

"Im using this with my Husky Silent Flow air compressor.I like how the nozzle attached to my tire. It doesn't have to be forcefully pushed on and pulled off like some other compressors Ive owned. The one even ripped the pin right out of my tire and I was stranded. This one is easy. Push the handle down, push the nozzle on the tire and then release the nozzle. Just make sure you push firmly on the tire until you dont hear any air coming out. Otherwise it isnt sealed properly.The only complaint I have is the gauge is not accurate. I have a Slime digital tire gauge reader which is much more accurate. I used it in conjunction with this inflator. Its ok to use the gauge on this inflator to get a general idea where you are at, but get a digital reader if you want to fill more accurately.Also, incase anyone was wondering, I had my compressor set to roughly around 60-70psi when I was filling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MW7EOKCKH5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007ZJ1IK#wasThisHelpful","R11MW7EOKCKH5T","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is pretty cool. I redid my kitchen and initially was going to do a white paper bag type flooring, but white is not a great color to try and do a paper flooring with because you cant see any variations as you do with a colored paper, and because the white paper becomes see through once the water and glue is added which makes seeing whatever is underneath (including the other pieces of white paper overlapping which looks like complete poo).That being said, I decided to paint the entire floor white. But that just looked to plain and blah. So I then added faux grout lines using paint pens to simulate a white tile look. But it wasn't even the slightest convincing of being real tile because of the lighting and shading you would see on real tile wasn't there.That being said, I decided to give this thing a try. I repaint over some of the fake tile lines to make them into bigger slats / planks, and then used a variation of a lighter grey paint (very close to off white) with random streaks of a slightly darker grey (to give diversity across the faux planks) and I got to say...it turned out pretty amazing. I was actually surprised.A few things to mention:Since I was painting and graining in planks (one to 2 at a time) I decided not to even use a glaze. I hate mixing glaze and I found it to be very messy and increased the ultimate drying time (not just the 'working' time) substantially when I last used it on my walls. It wasn't necessary since I was painting and rolling in a short amount of time. Saved money and mess by not using it.The rolling action on these isnt the best. I feel like the roller itself is too stiff. I think it would have been easier and more effective if the lines were much more plyable and rubbery tectured. I found myself pulling too much paint off a lot of times and having to repaint and re-roll. My technique developed and it happened less as I went, but it was still happening because it was stiff. Not a huge problem, but made the project take slightly longer.I didnt use the triangle piece at all. I used a straw broom instead. Seemed less manufactured than the tool they provided.The small roller was nice, however, if I started from the one end it would just completely scrap all of the paint off. So I only used it starting at the other end (the rounded parts being at the top). Hard to describe, but you will see what I mean if you get it and try.The handle and roller and be flipped so you can start at different ends. I don't think this was described on the instructions. I just figured it out on my own by mistake, but I didn't flip it back and forth even once I did figure it out. Prob would have made even more variation if I did, but I didn't feel I needed too.A lot of people practice before they start. I don't have patience and just jumped right in. Took me a plank or 2 to get into the groove and I only had to go back and fix the first plank slightly since then. So it wasn't the end of the world to get used too for me. So I wouldn't get overwhelmed about having to practice first, but it would definitely help if you happen to have patience.and lastly, I did this on a vinyl flooring with texture and grooves in it. So it made it very difficult to even get a good action with the roller. This thing is definitely gonna give great results using it on a smoother surface. But it still turned out great in spite of this issue. Wood grain in reality is very diverse. So even messing uo (which I did often) still seems to look natural. What I noticed more than anything is that its more about the combination of paints / colors and layers which can make or break it. I first went too dark of a grey over the white and it looked very fake. starting over with a very light grey with only darker random streaks of grey made it look more realistic.In the end, I think it looks unbelievably like realistic, faux wood panels. And I have to be honest, I really wasnt trying hard as I have tried so many different things already to make the floor look decent and I was at the point I just wanted it done and over with. I know if i really took my time and put a little more effort into painting the wood grain on I could have made it look 10x better. That being said, I wouldn't confuse my floor with real wood. But those fake laminate wood grain panels...sure.I seen a video with a guy using a full on round roller with his hands. I think that would have worked much better then this quarter round grain on a stick method and I would have preferred the one he was using. But like I said, it still turned out great.I will post some before and after pictures when I get a chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA30GZEV1ECW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BKPRNQ#wasThisHelpful","RA30GZEV1ECW1","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The case I received wasnt exactly as pictures, but it was close enough. It didnt have the brand name on the back and was slightly different colored, but it still looked good.Definitely wasnt otter box quality, but what do you expect at this price?The rubberized sides kept pulling out of place a little and the overlapping touch screen was annoying so II ended up sending it back.Also, I had a tempered glass screen protector on my phone and it still fit and didnt cause any issues.TouchID seemed to  work ok as well, but not as good as without a case covering it.Visibility is not as great with the extra screen protection on.Unless you expect to get it splashed or wet, Id prob get a separate screen protector on the phone and then cut theirs off.The ports were to small for a charger such as an Amazon lightning cable (which I own).Adds a decent amount of bulk to the overall phone, but im sure your phone will be very protected in this if you decide to go with this case.hope this helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12NH80QT5TFBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHQVD1A#wasThisHelpful","R12NH80QT5TFBM","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted some cheapie clocks to add in my kitchen as some sort of 'world clocks' set up. So i needed a few and didnt want to spend too much on doing it.

In the end, I couldnt deal with the second hand sound of 3 clocks ticking all at different times, so I just opened the lid and pulled the red second hand off.

It actually made the sound quality awful when compared to not using it. I'm assuming this is because you throwing an analog connection into the mix instead of pure digital to digital connection. Also the fact that technology is much better and crisp with bluetooth 4.0 nowadays and software enhancements.Also, the wire is very flimsy. I do have any issues with it at the moment, but Id assume it would rip off very easily. And why they decided to go with a non standard USB charging cable is beyond annoying.I cannot recommend this adapter for apt-x / sound improvement purposes. But one thing it is good at is turning an non bluetooth device into a bluetooth device. But definitely not worth paying $50 to do as there are other non apt-x solutions that are much cheaper.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QPN9C33MCQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PU9U0E#wasThisHelpful","R1QPN9C33MCQ1","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oddly enough I primarily bought this for a reason you probably wont see listed in any other review. I use it when I am mowing the lawn because I am allergic to grass and no matter how much I try and cover my face with a face mask or my shirt, I feel like I want to die by the time Im through.So I figured I would give this a try, wetting it and wrapping it around my face, hoping that it would also keep me cooled when cutting my lawn in the summer heat. Although it did filter out the shredded grass and pollen from entering my nose and mouth, I cant claim that it stayed cool for very long. At least it didnt feel like it did. I also used it biking and walking out in the sun. It seems to stay cool for a while but not as long as they make it sound.For the grass, it works ok (its hard to keep it wrapped around my face). But primarily for staying cool, I dont know how effective I can consider it to be. Lets just say if I was heading out to the beach, and I forgot this in the house, I dont expect I would be running back inside to grab it.Also, you will probably want to wet and activate the towel outside as it gets messy when you have to violently trash this thing around to get it cooled. Definitely not made to be done indoors.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SSI1DYNZ3SV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGHAHTU#wasThisHelpful","R3SSI1DYNZ3SV0","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this light on sale. Ive been searching for a while for a light to hang up under my sink because it is dark.This light seems to light up pretty well, but I ended up using electrical powered lights under my sink, so I decided to use this in my mudroom instead, so I didnt have to always turn the light on for a quick late night snack (where my refrigerator is).3 problems...I wish they didnt make the edges rounded. It really serves no purpose. Why is this a problem....well, I could have just had it sit on top of my fridge on its side. But it wont stay up because the edges are rounded. This causes it to fall right over.which brings me to issue 2...I tried just placing it on a flat surface aiming up. While it does light up the room decently, the light itself is very blinding if you happen to look at it, which made it unavoidable being placed on a table aiming up.Final solution (or so I though) was to give in and use the provided mounting velcro against the wall above my door. Shoot...I figure if this was meant to be hung under a cabinet it should hold better than against a wall....WRONG! The provided velcro and mounting bracket are not strong enough to hold this light. And the bracket itself shouldnt even be called a bracket. It barely grips the light. The groves are not deep enough and it does not snap securely into place. That being said, the brack and velcro both came off within seconds, the unit fell to the ground and the very cheaply made battery door broke. And since they decided to place the battery connector directly on the battery door, this unit no longer works. It will work if you hold the battery door against the batteries, but the door wont stay on itself any longer.The light seems to work pretty well for wat it is. But the bad and cheap design choices they made ruin the light.I like the idea of having a light in my mudroom now, so I will get another one.....but not this brand.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17EG8TU3Y18NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DY7KP2E#wasThisHelpful","R17EG8TU3Y18NX","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I cant really give a full on review of this thing because...well....my power hardly ever goes out. In the 9 years I’ve lived in my house it only went out a handful of times but usually never more than a few minutes (except for hurricane Sandy which lasted 2 days).That being said, today my power went out. My iMac was on running parallels (windows 7) and it was in the middle of doing a Windows update (during the shutdown procedure). The power was out and the APC was still keeping my system running. Then a few minutes later, the power came back one, and for some reason, the APC cycled its power causing it to cut the power supply to my iMac…in the middle of the update!Also, for some reason (not sure if this was directly related to the APC), but when it was feeding power to my iMac, nothing was working (my peripherals…aka keyboard and mouse). It was almost as if it locked up my system. So I couldn’t even force the iMac to end the update and shut down which I was trying to do right before the power came back on.I am very disappointed with this. I might as well not even own the damn thing if this is the way it is going to operate. I bought it specifically to avoid this situation, because the last time this happened (my power went out which I was running windows in parallels) and it completely corrupted my Fusion Drive (fusion drives do not play well with partitions. Keep this in mind if you own a mac and are utilizing boot camp…especially through parallels). I had to completely wipe my drive and reinstall MAC OS and Windows from scratch because the newer iMacs only have USB 3 and Windows 7 doesn’t recognize USB devices during boot. Which means you have absolutely no way to restore windows from the boot menu via a USB flash drive or USB DVD drive (because they are connected to USB 3.Anyway…I was leaving for work when this happened, so I did not have time to restart it and check that it didn’t corrupt my drive again. I really hope it did not because that took me over a month to research how to fix it with the help of Apple.Also, something I did not know until I bought it, but you have to change the battery every 5 years which cost about $50 for a replacement. Plus disposal of your current one.You also have to connect the battery yourself inside the unit as it is shipped with it disconnected. Wasn't hard to do, but its not something that's advertised. It is also very heavy. I owned a smaller one in the past so I was not expected this as well.Other than that, the thing integrates awesome with Mac. No software to install. Just plug it in and it automatically shows up in the settings.But what’s the point if it doesn’t work as expected.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RACSUE6U2ZOSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DN2PJAI#wasThisHelpful","RACSUE6U2ZOSE","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I owned another brand of a similar type product that only came with 3. I loved it, however, the remote was cheaply made and I had to constantly bang it to get it to work.So I was overdue to get a new one and I didn’t want to get the same brand in fear the same issue would happen again.So I decided to go with this one when it was on sale for $20 (It goes on sale pretty often).I really love the fact that they have separate on and off buttons. My other one did not which mean you had to be in the same room to ensure it was actually turning on or off (especially considering the buttons on the remote did not work properly).The only flaws I can mention is:They are not numbered. I had to go through one at a time to figure out which button number went to which outlet, and then number it with a marker. I wish they had them pre numbered, or even better yet, color coded.andThe battery. This is the same type of battery my other unit used as well. Not sure why they don’t just opt for the more standard AAA batteries. I prefer using rechargeable instead of disposable. Plus I will never have these weird batteries just laying around.Other than that, 5 outlets and 2 remotes for 20 bucks! That’s a great deal for this product.Also, the range is pretty decent.I recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZRRHN3RICNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQELHBS#wasThisHelpful","R1GZRRHN3RICNU","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The fit is very form fitting and fits nicely out of the package (medium size shirt, and I am 6’1” athletic build).I have yet to actually wear it out so I have not washed it yet.

"I was initially going to order the smaller brother (the UCO Clarus) until i seem this one which lasts more than 2 times the amount the smaller one does. But seeing the Clarus first, I assumed the power button was also on the bottom for this light. That is not the case, and I gotta say, where they decided to place the button is annoying.Most of the time when I use this light, I want to use it in flashlight mode. But either way, I have to extend the top part in order to get to the power button. This was a very annoying design choice and my biggest gripe with this light.Also, the light seems to be very focused and overpowering. Yes…it lights the room up well, but I have to put it in a spot where it is not remotely anywhere in my line of vision or else it is overpowering and painful. Even in flashlight mode I get this effect. I was checking a pipe down my basement to see if it was trickle leaking, but the light is so bright that it makes it very hard to see what you’re aiming it on. Think of a picture that is over exposed and that’s the effect you get with this light.It does have a dimmer feature which is nice. But even that I am disappointed in. I sometimes prefer a light for late night bathroom trips instead of turning the bright home overhead lights on. It would have been nice if they included the feature that it ‘resumes’ to the last brightness you had the light set too. The power button automatically brings it back up to 100% no matter what you had it set to when you turned it off. This means for late night bathroom trips, you are going to be blinded before you hold the button down to dim the light.Overall, I would say this is a great emergency light if your power happens to go out considering it has very long battery life and it does lite up an entire room pretty decently. For normal flashlight and everyday use…you might want to look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R169OA71EM209R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WG9688#wasThisHelpful","R169OA71EM209R","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this Airfloss after first checking out the other electronic flossing devices (water based ones), and decided this one seemed to fit my needs best considering there isnt much involved to get this thing going (no connecting to water lines or filling tanks with water).I also bought this because regular flossing can be a pain sometimes, and even more so because someone mentioned that they felt like 'they just walked out the dentist office after a cleaning' after using this.That being said, I can tell you this thing definitely does not feel as refreshing as when I walk out of my dentist office. Maybe my dentist office is just THAT good. Honestly, my teeth feel more refreshed after using regular floss to be honest.Still, this thing does seem to work and it blasts some mouth wash between your teeth, so that is nice.Overall, I expected more. But I only paid 30 (made an offer on ebay and had some ebay bucks) and it is much faster than regular flossing so I wont complain too much.Things to mention are:This thing can get pretty messy. It blasts a good bit of mouthwash or water into your mouth. I had to keep spitting it out. There is a mode that you can hold the button down and it will spray every second so that you can keep going and do your entire mouth in one shot. I dont think that would be possible unless your swallowing the mouth wash. ha.Upon initial set up, I 'thought I had the attachment fully on. But it wasnt and when I pressed the air shot button it flung it across the room. Made sure you press down hard and hear it snap before using.Also, be careful. There are 3 modes when you turn this thing on. It will either shoot 1 air shot, 2 or 3 depending what you set it too. My first time using it, it 'hiccuped' and shot one, paused, then shot the other 2, and then when i pulled it away from my mouth it shot the 3rd shot.....almost into my eyes. (thank you big nose for the save)You have to take the head off after each use and flush it with water. It doesnt say you have to let it dry out before putting it back on, but I would think it best to do so so no water is left lingering in there building up some fungal funk. That being said, I wish the base had something you could place the attachment on while it dries out.And last but not least, I wish they used some sort of rubber for the part you place against your gum. The plastic is very flimsy and is already misshapped and cracking after 2 uses. Overall, the shap of this part I am referring to is not shaped very well for being meant to be positioned between your teeth on your gumline. And if you dont press it against this area the air will not floss properly.Overall, I still like it and recommend it. But in the end, I still think regular flossing is better and will be needed for some inbetween cleaning session in conjunction with this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJFO6OYJAAXRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUG270S#wasThisHelpful","RJFO6OYJAAXRK","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So...I bought this bag a while back, and I'll admit I was one of those dumb people that didn't read 'everything you are getting and not getting' before buying (damn you lightning deals). That being said, I assumed the sand was already in these bags as they would be for most other weighted things you would buy like leg weights, arm weights, etc. Sadly, it is not. So now after months of not using this the weather is finally breaking and its starting to finally get nice out. Nice enough for a day trip to the beach for some free sand MWWAAHAHAHAHAH!!! (sorry, evil scheme is finished).Besides, who's to say when I am exactly filling these bags with 10lbs of sand? Do I need to bring a scale with me to the beach. (I can hear all the chicks running away from it and screaming now).But I figured, let me just check online and see what peoples thought were on filling this with sand on their own, because it looks like it could get messy (sand stuck in the velcro messy). So on Amazon reviews I went and YUP. Tons of people complaining about the sand coming out of the bags. But I knew Amazon reviews wouldn't let me down. Let's keep looking and see what other creative people tried putting in their bags. And dont you know it....there were some pretty great suggestions. Here were a few I found...1) Aquarium sand - It is thicker and wont leak out of the bags! Eureka! Problem....darn its expensive. $10+ for a 5lb bag. That ideas out.2) Landscaping gravel / rocks - Better priced, but the idea of putting something this solid in a bag I will be swinging around with the possibility of dropping on my foot....meh. Might also damage the bag quicker. But still a pretty decent option as you dont have to worry about leaking.3) Rice - This seemingly was the most awesome option I came across. If theres ever an apocalypse, not only can I use the bag to work out. I can eat the bag when Im done! Plus you can buy them in 10lb bags and slide the bag right into the SKLZ bag, leaving it intact ready to consume later. Still though....your talking about $10 per bag bringing the price you paid for this workout bag much higher (but like I said, at least you can consume this at some point. You're not going to consume aquarium sand....unless you're into that kinda thing).When all was said and done....my option in the end was......drum roll please....rat tat tat tat tatttttt....NONE OF THE ABOVE! (You thought it was the rice, dont lie)Just so happens, I have a TKO 20lb weight vest, and 2 10lb leg weights all filled with sand fillers. I rarely use them and they have just been sitting on my in house gym floor like an dust attracting eye sore. They fit perfectly into the bag, no crazy stuffing like other people mention with their 10lb SKLZ bags are filled. And best of all....no more eye sore!Lets face it. You're either going with the free messy option of sand, or going to spend some more on products you cant use in the future to fill the bags with (unless its rice. Emmm), or you can spend about the same (or slightly more...or less depending on what your thinking of filling the bags with) on some other weights you can use for various exercises. Just think of the SKLZ bag as a storage bag for those items.You could get 2 5lb leg weights, 2 5lb arm weights, and a 20lb vest. Or just get a 40lb vest and call it a day.This bag is pretty awesome and I plan to use it a lot now that its finally filled.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EH0JUS230OYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053C3RO6#wasThisHelpful","R3EH0JUS230OYW","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own this bulb and the E27 10W LED RGB Magic Lamp Light Bulb Color Changing Spotlight + Remote Control. I actually prefer the E27 10W LED RGB Magic Lamp Light Bulb Color Changing Spotlight + Remote Control because its SMOOTH mode is much more smooth (slower).This one is too fast for my liking.The remotes work for both bulbs which is nice. But this bulb is not as responsive as the other one I own.Still, this is an awesome bulb that I am using in an accent light in my living room.The only thing I wish is they both dimmed more than their lowest setting. Dim to the lowest setting is still too bright in my opinion.I might try and add a Lutron LED dimmer to the mix to tam these bad boys down.I posted a picture of the lights so you can see how bright they are.The setting was set to SMOOTH, which means, they are at full brightness in the pictures (because you can not DIM the lights when you set it to a color changing mode. You can only DIM when it is set to a constant color.)Also, be aware....if you own any other LED lights like I do (strip lights behind my TV), the remote might alter any other type of LED lights as well. But not in a desirable way. If I press DIM on the remote for this bulb it will change my TV lights to FLASH MODE. Or FADE will change my TV lights to Blue. Its really annoying. Best bet is to set the light to the color or mode you want whilst the other LED lights you might have are turned off. Then turn them on after you change the settings.Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q78H8OU95W6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R683SN0#wasThisHelpful","R2Q78H8OU95W6Y","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with the other reviews. This is a very nice, stylish wallet. I always seem to wind up loving Fossil wallets. Ive owned many other name brand wallets, and the Fossil one always seem to last the longest, and are equally stylish and practical.The only complain (if I strained hard to point one out) would be that the ID window frame could have been larger to show the entire ID. The framing of it covers some of the edges of the ID. Its also very tight and not as smooth to remove and replace the ID in this window if needed. But not a deal breaker.This wallet was sold out everywhere a few days ago when I was looking. The only one I seen was on Ebay for $50 and I almost bought it....almost. But I couldn't justify spending $50 on a wallet. Luckily Amazon somehow got another one in stock for $25. So I snatched it up.I highly recommend this wallet, or any Fossil wallet for that matter.****UPDATED 2 months later:I still like this wallet, however, the ID window I mentioned earlier being small / tight...well, after owning this wallet for 2 months and not taking my ID out excessively (only when someone needs to see it like at an airport, etc) has caused the seems on the top of this compartment to rip. This being said, it wasnt stitched very well on top part of the ID window. I expect now that it has separated it will only get worse. And they didnt overlap the material on this part either which is why I am assuming it came apart so easily and will also make it difficult to fix.I am still going to use it, but I am a little disappointed. Every wallet I've owned (most of them Fossil) I've owned for years before they started coming apart if at all. This one I only owned for a short time and barely use the ID compartment and it ripped.Im definitely glad I did not pay $50 for this wallet. And if I knew this was a possibility I would have went with a different wallet.I removed one star for this updated review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLT80A0FFS09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUQKH10#wasThisHelpful","R1CLT80A0FFS09","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mixed bag of reviews here. Gotta say...some look fake (the good ones. lol)While I seen all the bad reviews about it breaking and being cheap, I decided to give it a try since it was only 2 bucks.I can attest that this bracelet is cheap and I do not expect it to last. That being said, I think I will use a little pre-emptive super glue to keep it from breaking where others have mentioned.The tightening design is annoying and also not portrayed in the picture. Its 2 thin strings with a knot, and you pull to loosen / tighten. Unless you have wrist the size of your biceps, you will have to pull the strings close together, meaning these 2 strings used to tighten the bracelet will be flapping all around. I just twist them up in the mess of other strings so I dont have these 2 long strings hanging down. A clasp of some sort would have been better. Who knows...I might even go to Michaels and get some to install on here.Not the best bracelet choice. I dont expect it to last.

"Its a lot deeper, darker than the picture shows. Also feels pretty cheap. like it should be worth $5 cheap.I cant say it was really worth the $11, but I bought it as a joke for a friend and got a pretty good laugh about it. So in that respect it was worth it. (inside, had to be there kinda joke)But for $11, if I was seriously buying, I would at least expect a nice box for it to come in. Not a cheap ziplock.The pin itself was a pain to use as well.

"Im weird when it comes to cologne. I like how a lot of them smell, but I dont like them when they are sprayed on me. So its rare I find one I can tolerate on me. This is definitely one of them.It smells great! The only problem is as others have mentioned. By far, this colonge wears off FAST! The fastest colonge I ever encountered. It almost seems like its gone after an hour or 2.Im guessing thats why the price is fairly low on this. Because you have to keep spraying it on all day.I wish they made a stronger version and charged more (aka, parfume).

"I was really taking a chance on this light, as I have an accent light with a large shade around it that lights up via a regular bulb (which shines light through every part of the bulb). This bulb, however, seems to only shine light through the top, which I thought might leave the bottom half of the shade unlit, ruining the style of this floor lamp I own. This is not the case though. Even though there is only light being emitted from the top of the bulb, it seems to have a pretty wide spread. Enough that it is even lighting the bottom of the shade. Not as great as a regular bulb, but worlds better than I expected, and good enough to look freaking amazing! The IR also seems to be very strong, as another thing I was worried about was being able to work the remote even though this bulb was deep in the light behind the shades. But the IR was still being transmitted from across the room, through the shades!!! This made this light a 5 star product for me.I originally had a Lutron lamp dimmer on this light because I had no way to dim it. I never disconnected it when I first tried this bulb and it made a weird buzzing sound when I had it set to the white color. Removing the Lutron dimmer removed the buzz noise. But its not needed anyway because I can not dim the light from the remote.This light is great! I think it is very bright. The colors are very vibrant. The white is pretty bright as well. I think I might order more for around the house since they are better on energy, have a remote, and look amazing. Not to mention LED has longer bulb life than regular bulbs.The only thing I am kicking myself about is not order another one when they had one offered through prime. After I got this and was certain it worked for my needs all the Prime ones were gone, and the only ones left are from China or Hong Kong. Major bummer, as I hate ordering items from there. They take way too long, and I’ve had instances where I haven’t gotten my items at all.I need 2 because my lamp requires 2. One to shine up and one to shine down. But I didnt want to order 2 incase it didnt light up the bottom half of the shade like I described earlier. That being said, I ordered a very similar looking light, but a different brand. I am hoping the same remote will work for both. I dont want to have to use 2 remotes to turn the lamp on. I will report back when I get the second if it works with one remote and list the brand, because they had more of those bulbs shipped from Amazon.***UPDATED 04/03/15As promised, I am updating my review with the use of the secondary bulb I bought (different brand).Although the remotes for both of the different brand bulbs do work for both, they do differ in their modes and response, this one being better in my opinion. The Smooth Fade option on this bulb is much slower and pleasing.Not a total offset. Its just that the other bulb (Elover E27 10W Colorful Remote Control Adjustable RGB LED Light Bulb Lamp) fades faster than this one. And considering the accent light I put these in require 2 bulbs, the colors are constantly on different colors when fading because of the timing difference. Still looks cool though. But Id sometimes prefer them to be fading on the same color at the same time.ALSO...another annoyance for anyone that owns any other types of LED lights (like the strip lights), the remote might do whacky things with those. For me, I have strip lights behind my TV and the remote commands from this remote alter the strip lights. But they are erratic. For instance, if I was to press the DIM button, it will make my TV lights go to FLASH mode. Or if I press FADE on the remote it will make my strip lights turn to BLUE. This is very annoying. If you have any other LED lights in the room, it might be best to set them both to the mode or color you want them on before turning the other set on and vice versa. If they are both on and you start trying to change settings and colors it will get annoying.I posted some pictures of the lights to better show what I have described.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NVBFCL079329/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K18PWXG#wasThisHelpful","R2NVBFCL079329","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description on this set is lacking. But I still took a chance because it looks like it would match my current duvet. Although, it does match it nicely, there are a lot of things I did not expect when looking of the misleading picture and description.For one, it doesnt list the thread count. I still dont know what it is as the packaging didnt even list that it was a Queen size set (which I ordered). The description on the packaging itself is lacking. But I can tell you that it doesnt feel like a high thread count. The sheets are just 'ok' when it comes to comfort.2nd thing to keep in mind, is the picture they have shown for this SHEET SET, is not what you are getting. The picture they have posted is for the DUVET SET, which they also sell, but you have to find the correct listing for it.Subtract the duvet, the white style pillow cases and the larger pillows/cases in the back and you are left with a fitted sheet, regular sheet and 2 blue styled queen sized pillow cases (with large buttons on them to hold the pillow in. Some will not like this). I really wanted white styled pillow cases since I already have blue ones that came with my other Duvet set I am using. So this was a bummer.Also, if you notice the fitted sheet on the bed in the picture, you will see that the lines are running vertical. This is not the case. The regular sheet and fitted sheet have horizontal running lines, with the regular sheet have blue themes vertical lines at the top (as shown in the picture).This all being said, it did look nice, didnt cost too much, and I didnt feel like sending them back and ordering something else that I could possibly wind up having the same or different issues with. So I just kept them.I hope this review better describes what you are getting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M7F4RPKISJQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IELREQ#wasThisHelpful","R2M7F4RPKISJQ2","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the look of this wallet when I first seen it online. Although it does look as is displayed in the picture, the quality wasnt as I expected.Most wallets (when new) are very tight. Even to the point of not being to fit your cards in sometimes. This one feels the opposite. It feels like a wallet you owned for years already. Its very loose in all of the pockets. Most notably, the cash area. Something you cant really tell from the pictures is it is only stitched on 2 ends. The other 2 ends are open. So it sort of opens like a folder slot. I am not a big fan of these types of wallets. They just dont seem secure too me when it comes to storing cash. Especially with this one because it is very loose.Also, it is slightly bigger width wise than Id prefer (aka, wider than a credit card).The only selling point for this would be the RFID feature. But I cannot comment on if that works or not. Im more going towards carrying less cards these days anyway with Apple Pay being accepted more places I go to now.That being said, this wallet just wasnt for me, so I sent it back.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8YRKIEQ2I960/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KE5YF8#wasThisHelpful","R8YRKIEQ2I960","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These magnets are awesome. I have several purposes I am using them for. They are very powerful and get the job done. And unlike the thinner 1/16"" magnets I ordered and snapped into pieces because they are so thin / fragile, these ones are just the right size for this to not happen.Word of advice though. They ship magnetized together. They are hard to get apart. Best option is to slide them apart. Dont try and pull them apart. You will lose.***UPDATED!Well...I was wrong. These magnets are definitely stronger, however, they also are susceptable to breaking as are every other magnet I have tried so far (- 1 star). The trick is to making sure you dont allow the magnets to be in close range enough to SLAM into each other. Otherwise, they will snap into a tonf of pieces pretty easily. And you though just getting 2 magnets apart is hard...try getting a magnet with a ton of tiny little sharp shattered pieces apart.

"This chain looks awesome. However, I cannot say it is true to the color shown in the description picture. Hence why I added my own picture so you can see the true colors.I have a very black and silver themed area in my office I thought this would go perfect in. However, the coloring of the chain is more a dull grey and completely covered in a dirt, rust color (the part that is displayed more as black in the photo). Also, this rust or dirt or whatever it is supposed to represent covers more surface area than what is shown. Hardly any grey area shows through on the one I received.If I had to guess, it almost seems like they changed the photo to a greyscale image before posting it. All the deep color parts are very brown.I was a little disappointed because the coloring didnt exactly go with the theme, but they are pretty darn awesome looking in general, so I will just deal with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39G2TIGK0U8Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBPLQME#wasThisHelpful","R39G2TIGK0U8Q9","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ill admit, this thing is pretty cool. But I bought this with intentions of lighting up a red themed area in my office. I thought this would be perfect, but I was wrong. The light is barely visible. Especially if it is not shined on anything white. And even still, the red color specifically is very dark in nature. Any ambient light present within a room and you will not see this light, no matter what color it is set too. Its just not that powerful.However, place it in a dark room aimed one a white ceiling and your set.The water effect is gif animation like in natural. There is no variety to the water effects. It could have probably been achieved, but they decided to go with a set motion. So although it does have a water like appearance, the realism is lost with the repeat 2 second motion.Still....this is pretty neat for the cost.But some things I do not like are that you have to cycle through to power off. And I find myself having to look down where the buttons are to find which one to press repeatedly, causing me to be blinded by the LEDs. A remote, or colored buttons instead of white would have made this easier. Or better yet....a dedicated off switch.I do not like that it has a permanent 1 hour shut off feature. If I want to leave on indefinitely for a party or something, I will have to keep turning back on every hour. Annoying.The instructions are lacking. The descriptions on the box are more warnings about batteries themselves. Which it doesn’t even include. And they aren’t written in plain English. You can tell its foreign attempt at English. Still...entertaining to read.And the sound / speaker is just ok. Its a little louder than my iPhone itself, but the problem is, you cannot set the volume to max because it starts affecting the light. You will see it flickering depending on how loud the volume is and what you are playing. You have to lower it to a volume that matches that of the iPhone itself. So its kind of pointless. Especially if you are on battery power.All in all, if you want some cool ceiling effects to fall asleep to, then you might really like this.

"I would only recommend these magnets for very specific needs. And even still, I wouldnt trust them much as they are very fragile and break very easily.I had 2 sitting not far from each other.

"THESE MAGNETS ARE HELLA STRONG! I can barely get them apart when they snap together.I already owned many different sizes and shapes of these rare earth magnets. These are the largest I’ve owned so far and are definitely harder to get apart because they are super strong. This is why they use the plastic separators.I honestly like the circular magnets better. They seem easier to work with and are easier for me to get apart. The box shaped ones always magnetize together too easily.Anyway, for my purposes, these are a little too strong. I will still use them, but my needs require using 2 magnets in close proximity to each other and because these are so strong they keep clasping together. I have this happen with smaller ones as well, but not nearly as bad and they are easier to get apart.But anything too much smaller and you run the risk of them being fragile. I previously bought the thinner and smaller ones. Those break very easily. These however, are pretty solid. I’m not saying they won’t break as well (depending on the force), but you would have a much harder time of having this happen.Id say these are some really awesome magnets, and I highly recommend if you dont plan on using more than one that are in close proximity to each other.***UPDATED!Well...I was wrong.

"Anywhere you see these pants online, they have amazing reviews (Dicks & Nike). I believe they are truly great compression pants that are ruined by a major flaw that I am surprised everyone is failing to mention.I am 6'1"", 185lbs, athletic build. I ordered the Medium after reading someone else's review of the same body type and the pants themselves fit perfect. The compression feels proportionate throughout the pant.The main problem with these pants that I can understand why Nike did this is the head, ankle part. The opening for the heel is SO SMALL. And there is a very tight fitted seem around the opening which causes the pants to DIG into your Achilles tendon. Its actually beyond uncomfortable to the point of being painful. As the pants are, you really need to pull them up to get the compression distributed properly to the correct parts of your legs, but doing so makes this seem dig even deeper into your tendon.I have gone all night wearing them (the best time to wear them, when you are sleeping and you body is healing) but its so uncomfortable that it wakes me up. And thats saying a lot because I dont wake up for nothin! Did you ever see Donnie Darko? Even THAT wouldn't wake me up!I can make it about 10 minutes before it becomes unbearable. They should try and make compression pants as comfortable as possible. Not the opposite.  Because lets face it....compression pants in general are already uncomfortable to begin with. When I wake up after aa night of wearing these I have a huge indentation around my entire ankle and its sore for hours.I understand they added this to try and keep the pants situated without riding up your leg. But they could have made the opening bigger. It wouldn't have hurt anyone in this situation. And Im sure there are people out there that have heel that fit like their heel was perfectly made for it, but Im guessing the majority do not. They could have even went with something that was more adjustable..?? I would have even preferred the foot anchor being removed completely, the bottom being super tight, and the addition of a zipper to close after the pants are on (kinda like a scuba suit) than what they decided to go with.These pants are pretty pricey. I would say definitely go to a brick and mortar store and give them a test drive (with underwear on people. dont be funky), and trust me, you will know pretty quickly if the heel will bother you or not. If so you can just return them easily.One thing I did like is that they came in this very nice hard case. I use it to store the pants and some compression sleeves at the moment. But I may wind up using the case to store some of my electronic equipment. Funny enough, I like the case more than the pants.The only reason I didn't return them and go get a pair of compression pants without the foot hook is because I accidentally ordered from somewhere overseas. I didn't realize it because their site automatically came up in US dollars which is rare. So I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back. Otherwise, I would have.Who knows...I might even cut a slit in them around the tendon area. But for $150, I dont feel I should have too.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFS0BEK3ZUW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGQFUP2#wasThisHelpful","RXFS0BEK3ZUW3","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This glue is the worst. I dont know how it has such great reviews. I tried it on magnets, fabric, plastic, rubber...it never held anything. And yes, I let it dry with compression for long periods of time to no avail.The only good thing I can say is its one of the only 'super' glues that didnt dry up after opening the bottle once. But its probably because it has no sticking ability.I have 3 tubes of it. Maybe all three were a bad batch because everyone else seems to love it...Krazy glue all the way for me.

"I gotta say, if I bought this to hold my guitar, Id be more inclined to give it a 3 star rating. When a guitar is hanging, all that you are left with is fingers showing.

This hand looks awesome and the detail is pretty sick. but it all just gets lost when it is 'doing its job'....holding your guitar.When your guitar is not being held, this thing looks killer. Especially if you have some lighting nearby or above it (fortunately I do).The construction is amazing (although the first one I ordered the index finger was snapped at the base of the finger, only being held together by the inner cushion material). I was also missing the bolt from the package. Possibly a used / returned product..?? I almost didn’t notice the snap, until I was hanging it and touched the finger and it moved. I couldn’t even notice the seam where it was split , so make sure you check yours if you order.Speaking of the inner cushion material, it does look a little weird having this weird shaped black spot on the hand. It's really not that bad on the tree model because its already dark, but I have a red hand as well and its mega noticable. I guess they assumed it would be covered by the guitar, so it didn’t matter. It doesn’t really bother me overall, but would have been nice if they incorporated the cushion better. Possibly better shaped it, or colored to match.That all being said, I ordered 2 (one left and one right hand) and funny enough, I decided to use them to display my Sais/weapons. Hence why I gave it 4 stars. When holding the very slim sais as opposed to my guitar, none of the detail is lost. I can clearly see it is a hand, I can see the detail that it is if wood / tree origin, and the sais aren’t blocking the detail of the inner part of the hand which helps you too see that its.....a hand. I cannot see the amazing detail on the back of the hand because its facing the wall, but it’s better than nothing.Another thing I wish is that they had a Philips head on the inside end of the bolt where the hand screws on. This way it could be installed in the wall easier with a screw gun driving the bolt in first, then twisting the hand on as opposed to having to drill, then put the bolt on the hand first and then twist the hand into the wall. Who knows…maybe this is how the finger got snapped on the first on I received..?? Someone was trying to twist it into the wall with the hand and broke it. Would explain why there was no bolt. They probably just left it in the wall.If I really was going to use it for my guitar, I probably would have returned considering the price. I wouldn’t want to pay $50 for something I can barely tell what it is. This is all the same for all the hands (even the red one I own).

"I went with these anglers because it was priced the same as some others on Amazon that only came with one. This comes with 2, and it’s great if you own a laptop that has USB ports on each side.The only things to mention and why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is that its slightly chunky. So, if you have parallel USB ports positioned closely together (like I do on my 2 port USB power block), this will the other ports next to it. Or if you own a slim laptop like a MacBook Pro Retina, then these will be thicker than the laptop itself cause it to be raised. No Bueno for these situations.Overall, its great quality, and works for what I am using it for (attached to a gooseneck LED USB powered light coming out of my rack mount equipment). If you are using something slim and don’t want to block ports, you might need to try an angler that is on a flat 90 degree angle, instead of this one which is L 7 shaped adapters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NW6OC3YGM7AL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JM458FM#wasThisHelpful","R3NW6OC3YGM7AL","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to go with this portable LED USB powered light because it had the ability to dim, and it had an on and off button.While, it does work well, it would have been nice if it returned to the brightness you set it at after turning off and on again. You have to set the level each time you turn it on, as it resets to 100%.Also, I’m not too happy with the gooseneck part of it. While it is easily adjustable, it doesn’t seem to allow the light tube portion to easily be 'twisted' as to angle it better where you want it. If you want to accomplish this, you have to try and twist and maneuver the gooseneck part instead, which is not easy. It would have been better if they allowed the tube itself to be slightly twistable as to get the right angle.I assume some people will not have this issue depending on the angle of your USB port and where it is placed, but I am using this in conjunction with a USB 3.0 Vertical Male to Female Adapter Right Angle Adapter because I have this coming out of my rack mount equipment, and this places it on its side at the USB part of it. But its better than it coming straight out of my rack mount and trying to adjust it to an even more awkward angle.Another minor annoyance is where they decided to place the button. As mentioned, the gooseneck is 'easily' adjustable. A little too easy in fact. A slight touch to any part of the light, and you just moved the light out of the position you just spent all that time trying to get in the perfect angle / spot. That being said, even the slight touch you have to do to turn the light on moves the entire light / gooseneck. And pressing it to dim makes it even worse. I wish they used a more stiff type of gooseneck. Id rather initially fight to bend a rough gooseneck into position, than have something that moves so freely you barely want to breath near it.Again, this may not bother you depending what and where you are planning to use it. But my light and purposes require it be in an exact position at an exact angle. Otherwise its either in the way of my other rack equipment and buttons, or its not shining where I need it (aka….directly blazing into my eye balls….ouch)The light is decent for its price and what it does. It's VERY bright. I like that I can take it with me if I have too and it is definitely worlds cheaper in price and way brighter than the standard BNC gooseneck lamps made for rack equipment. Not to mention, where else are you going to use those? Not with your laptop that’s for sure.If you have an portable USB battery pack, like an Anker, you can also use this as a portable flash light or as a reading light.I cant say for sure if other lights out there are better. But this seems to be the one of few that has an on and off button which I also needed. If you don’t need one, then I would say try and find one that has a stronger gooseneck, and is more adjustable at the lamp for angle.The light itself is very bright and lights up my work area great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19IT5V1HIPZYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIQUJQ4#wasThisHelpful","R19IT5V1HIPZYS","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can’t say that I love these flowers, but I like them. I bought them to accent some wild set up I have at my desk. Pretty much everything I’ve added to the mix lights up in some way. What can I say….I am obsessed with things that light up. So I thought these would fit in perfect. And although they fit in very nicely, they do not fit in nicely for the reason I expected / wanted.As others have mentioned, the lights are yellow. When I heard this I preferred it because I needed something that was both purple and yellow in the area I was planning to place these in. The problem is, that the yellow is a very dull yellow. Not the normal incandescent / regular non LED Christmas lights yellow I was thinking. More like a brownish yellow. And when lit, it completely drowns out the purple and white colors of the flowers in a dark setting. They are not bright, as others have also mentioned. Its more of just an atmospheric thing. But in all honestly, I prefer the flowers with the lights off. I was completely shocking to me because I LOVE things that light up. But these look so much better without them on, and the residual lighting from the surrounding lights almost glow off of them when the flower lights are not on.I can’t say I recommend these if you are dead set on the fact that they light up. But if this makes you feel more comfortable, they are great looking fake flowers in general, and set at a pretty decent price when you consider that to buy an arrangement that looks as full as this set at Michaels (without coupons) you are going to spend a lot more than you would on these.Other things to note are:There are 3 main stems total in the package.The stems are somewhat posable. I wouldn’t expect to twist them into circles, but they are very movable.Some pedals fell off when I took them out of the package.One Pedal was completely missing from the arrangement.The flower stems are very long. I wouldn’t expect to put these in a small/standard vase without them looking odd.The flowers are permanently connected together via the wires. They do leave some spacing between them, but don’t expect separate all 3 stems in different locations (unless you are going to sacrifice the lighting feature and cut the cords)The power block is detachable from the wire. I am guessing this is incase you want to route the wire much easier through the bottom of a vase or through any open holes, since the power block is a bit more chunky.All in all, these are decent flowers and I will keep them because they look good, Not because of the lighting aspect. Regular or LED Christmas type lights would have looked better, but oh well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K0OJGMBTR6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006SQ44U2#wasThisHelpful","R39K0OJGMBTR6C","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally bought the SUPERNIGHT Infrared Music Controller 20 keys IR Remote Controller Sound Sensor Controller For 5050 3528 5630 RGB LED Strip light Flexible because it was cheaper, and it was just that. Cheap. The response to music and beats was erratic at best. It was very inaccurate.I decided to give this one a try and I can tell you it is MUCH better at sound recognition.There are a few things I did not like about the controller:There aren’t many light modes to choose from. There are only 2 music modes. A flash and strobe (which seems to be a slow fade).The remote range is not that great. I have to get pretty close for it to work.Black wires on the connectors would have been better than white considering the controller itself is black.I wish they had an option for the PULSE music setting to change color. It only seems to pulse 1 selected color of your choice. I would have the option to choose 1 color pulse and a setting to pulse rotate colors.I had my eye set on the much larger white model MUSIC IR controller from another company, but this one comes with the wires you will need, so this one is better. No need to buy, cut, solder anything. Worked fine with my existing 12V adapter that came with my SUPERNIGHT lights. I will say though, it comes pre-wired, and i think they wired it incorrectly because the colors on the remote are not working correctly when selecting a color (press PURPLE, get YELLOW). I will have to rewire it which isn’t a big dealThis is a great quality (metal construction) controller. The sensitivity knob seems a bit weird as it doesn’t seem to change in a way you would expect. It’s hard to explain, but when I was lowering the sensitivity it worked well, but raising it higher made it more erratic, then accurate, then erratic, then accurate....it was kind of random. I find it best to leave it lower, but it responds to music very well no matter what the volume is set to. The other controller I previously had was too picky with volume and placement. If it was up too high it wouldn’t work at all. I even tried muffling the microphone with tape and foam to no avail.Although, the light modes are a bit lacking, I highly recommend spending the extra cash on this MUSIC IR over the other cheaper models because it is more accurate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S6P4W1WBRQQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RGRJ36#wasThisHelpful","R3S6P4W1WBRQQV","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is mostly for the RED model. I ordered it based off the pictures. However, I wouldn’t say this is a clear representation of the coloring considering all the pictures are taken in bright atmospheres. But let’s be real....it’s a lantern. I don’t know many people that use a lantern with a candle in the day time. It’s meant to be used in dark areas or at night.That being said, the color of the red is very deep red. Almost like a cranberry juice color.I bought it to use in my office since I have many red themed things in there, but the entire lantern looks black considering how dark the red is. Also, I used a tea candle (what is listed as being recommended in the description) in hopes the red would be more apparent, but it didn’t help much. It only emits a small area at the bottom of the lantern. Also, the pictures mostly show the lantern from the back, but it doesn’t show a picture of the lantern from the front with the door closed. The bottom of the front of the lantern is exposed (not red glass). So I could see right through to the inside and see the candle which looked lame. If you plan to buy and hang any of the colored ones, made sure you have the rear facing you or else it looks lame. They should have made the door opening stretch the full length of the lantern.Overall, the lantern seems like good quality, but I might recommend going for the clear model and utilizing some par can light gels to color as desired, lighting with a bright white LED candle.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CGUIL6GPODNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3L056E#wasThisHelpful","R1CGUIL6GPODNS","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this in hopes to dim a Brightech LED posable floor lamp, but unfortunately, it did not work (because the light itself is not dimmable).Instead, I decided to use on some VERY bright DODO 10M 100 LED String Christmas Lights after reading a ton of reviews that claim they work well with christmas lights. Although it does work, it does not work well. Possible because the lights themselve have a controller and I have it set to slow fade. It acts sort of erractically when using with the modes. It causes the lights to flicker instead of having a smooth slow fade that is produced without the Lutron connected. Also, if dimmed to much via the Lutron controller, it will eventually just shut off. I then have to raise the Lutron to MAX to get the lights to come on again, and then slowly lower to fade the lights.I find it does not shut off if I do not set the Lutron too low, but it still acts erractically with the flickering. But i honestly like the effect it produces. Not more than the smooth fade produced without the lutron, but I still like it.I also own the NON - LED Lutron dimmer (Credenza model) and it produces the same results with the same lights. So I cant say I recommend this one more over the other for this reason. But they are the same price and this seems to be interchangable between more types of lights so for that reason, I would recommend this one. But I wouldnt expect it to work well on all christmas lights, Especially if the lights have FX modes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369T37LIQOP0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DZONXI#wasThisHelpful","R369T37LIQOP0L","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the MUSIC IR controller. I hate when companies combine products on the same page just to confuse the buyer with the star ratings. Most of the 5 star reviews are for the regular controller. My fault for assuming they were for the MUSIC IR controller. Anyway....onto the review...I have been an audio engineer / DJ for many years and have worked with tons of lighting systems that were controlled by sound in a similar fashion. Some of the lights Ive worked with were connected to relay devices that had an internal mic and would control the lights connected to it automatically based on the sound it was hearing...and to be honest, these systems worked well.This, however, does not seem to work the same way, nor does it work well. It is over-sensitive to volume, regardless of the sensitivity you have set the controller on by pressing the + / - buttons once in a audio setting.Some mention it works best when placed next to a speaker. Im assuming they might be using smaller computer speakers. I am using this controller in my recording studio with my JBL LSR305's and placing the controller next to these kick ass speakers is no bueno. I have moved the controller as far away as I possibly can (the lights were already wired in place before I decided to buy this, so placement was limited), I placed several pieces of electrical tape on the microphone on the controller, and positioned it so that it was somewhat under my desk and behind the speakers, AND STILL, the only way the controller responds accurately is if I have the volume of the music I am playing, under 50%....much lower than I typically listen to music. Even a slight increase over that sweet spot threshold and the lights start going crazy. And anything above 85% volume, and they dont respond at all, just staying idle on one color because its not detecting the music.Shut the music off, and clap my hands....it responds uber accurately, changing instantaneous to each hand clap.This all being said, I could possible rewire my whole lighting setup which would be a nightmare to move this thing far enough away that it will respond accurately to a volume I am more comfortable listening too, but then, I'm pretty much locked in for these lights only responding to that set volume. If I am just doing light listening and want to listen to something lower for background noise with the sound activated on the lights, its not going to work.In comparison to other lighting systems Ive worked with, they were not as sensitive to volume. If anything, it was the opposite. The louder the music was set, the more accurate they would be and the lower it was, the harder it would struggle to change.  I guess what I am trying to say, is that the volume seems to determine the sensitivity level of these lights. Its very strange, and not very pleasing.Overall, the price is nice and I am thankful that they still work with other settings such as fade which I tend to normally leave the lights on in general. But I gotta say, Id rather pay more for something that works more accurately with music. Not something that just changes with music, but not accurately. Maybe its because I used to be a DJ and beats and rhythm are very important to me. If I hear a beat and the light isn't changing until even just .305809358 seconds after that beat I just heard, its throws me off. x that by every beat in the song and its maddening.My  best recommendation is, since this still is a decent product, your best bet is to get some LED light and the MUSIC IR at the same time, before you install the lights and become content with where you already placed the lights. This way you can position the controller, the lights, and the speakers in ideal locations to compensate for the inaccuracies of the sensitivity of the microphone / programming in this controller. If you do that then the controller might be worth it.If you are like me and just ADDING this to a preexisting set up,...use caution and dont have too high hopes....or just try and find a product that is more accurate and has better sound sensitivity adjustments (some have a sensitivity knob on the device itself. this was the same with the DJ lighting I mentioned earlier).OR, if you just want to see lights changing somewhat with the music and dont care too much about how loud or low your music is, as long as its playing, then this would be perfect for you.Btw, I just connected the lights to the existing 12V, 5A power adapter that came with my SUPERNIGHT LED 5050 strip lights and it works fine.Hope all this helps.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPUPTWE9JZV50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQ4O94Y#wasThisHelpful","RPUPTWE9JZV50","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Up until now, I have been using the Griffin Technology BlueTrip, and it got the job done well enough for playing audio. The problem is that I own a Mazda 3, and the AUX port is located in my center console right next to the lighter jack, which is super conveniently placed, however, this means the microphone on the BlueTrip is also located inside there as well. Whenever I answered calls it defaulted to the BlueTrip microphone and no one could hear me. So I would have to pick up my phone and change it to the iPhone speakerphone. I could not using the BlueTrip for calls at all, nor anything Siri related.Queue...the SoundBotFinally, I can now have the microphone routed outside of the center console. Now people can hear me, Siri can hear me....it’s a much more pleasant world. Don't know how I went so long without it. I also love the transport buttons on the SoundBot. No more reaching for the phone.That being said, it’s not perfect. You can’t actually activate Siri from it at all. The only operation it can do that is call related is dial the last person called by pressing and holding the NEXT button. And the delay for the call is pretty lengthy, and the button press to hang up when you realize the last person you called was you mother in law and need to press that END button takes even longer :oNot sure why they didn’t incorporate Siri functionality in their product. It claims this is the 2015 LATEST MODEL and Siri has been around for years now. This would have essentially made their product a DO ALL product considering you can tell you phone everything you want it to do. They dropped the ball on that. My work around is to have Hey Siri enabled and plug the power cord in.The multi-function button works nice when music was the last thing you were playing, and you want to press it to start up some music when you first get in your car. If it was YouTube for instance, then the multi button won’t do anything when you press it. You’ll have to use the phone to open the music app / iTunes and press play from there. After that the multi-function will resume functioning as a PLAY / PAUSE button again. Annoying...but more so a iOS flaw I’m assuming.Now for some weird /  major problems with the SoundBot. The sound is terrible when directly wired to my AUX. This was the same with the BlueTrip, except the SoundBot was 10x worse. You can hear the power hum coming through excessively. Could be more of a wiring / Mazda issue, but at the same time, there is nothing built in to the SoundBot to reduce this. I had to buy a Kensington Noise Reducing Car Audio AUX Cable, and now the SoundBot is virtually silent. Not a peep coming through as far as power hum is concerned.Another thing to mention is the audio from my phone still seems to play a few seconds after my car is turned off. Possibly there is a battery in the SoundBot ? Capacitor that shuts off after a few seconds..?? Once the connection is lost between the SoundBot and my phone, the music stops playing on my phone, and the volume annoying jumps down. Not sure what that is about, but this never happened with my BlueTrip. Did they design it to do this in the SoundBot? Why? Annoying.And…the weirdest of all that I cant seem to replicate….sometimes when I get out of the car after it is turned off while music was playing (say to run in a store real fast), Ill come back out and turn the car on and BAM. The music automatically starts playing again. Then sometimes, it will not do this and no music will play when the car is turned back on, even if I reenact the same motions. There no rhyme or reason to it. I actually would prefer it to NOT automatically play. But wouldn’t be the end of the world if it did. Just so long as it consistently does one or the other.I was about to send this back and go with the HimBox because of the Siri integration, but I read to many mixed reviews with the Siri and the HimBox. So I decided to just use the Hey Siri instead.Besides, I got this on sale for 15 bucks and it is worlds better than the BlueTrip for my situation. And it also comes with a very nice 2 port USB charger which I needed as well.I recommend this for its price and if you don’t care too much about Caller functions. If you do, just enable Hey Siri for you iPhone users.Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3COE80L8R5859/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RH29CJO#wasThisHelpful","R3COE80L8R5859","A21INUA35HX4XQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21INUA35HX4XQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The quality is great. Probably the best boxer briefs Ive tried. However, they only had small left. And while I normally wear mediums, boxer briefs are sometimes forgiving with size. Not these. Small was way too small. These are very true to size. I did wind up getting mediums and they fit perfect.They dont stay tight to your legs as others claimed after a full day of wearing, but they stay form fitted better than other brands.I like that they come down the leg further than others as well. The short boxer briefs that are seemingly more popular are annoying because they ride up. This does not happen with these.I highly recommend Tommy Hilfiger when it comes to boxer briefs.

"The NutriNinja is a compact, relatively inexpensive all-in-one kitchen appliance that could replace a separate juicer, blender, and food processor.

The NutriNinja only has 2 pieces and takes less than a minute to clean.-The NutriNinja requires a higher level of prep of the ingredients than the juicer. Crispier fruits and veggies have to be chopped into small pieces and the stems have to be removed from kale & other greens. The juicer is much less picky and the added prep time of the ingredients for the NutriNinja negates a lot of the time savings of the easier cleanup.-The NutriNinja leaves the pulp with all the fiber in the resulting smoothie rather than separating it out like the juicer does. From a nutritional standpoint, this is obviously much better. But from a purely taste standpoint, some of the smoothies coming from the NutriNinja were on the chunky side and my kids complained.-The NutriNinja has smaller capacity so I wind up having to make multiple batches instead of just 1 for the juicer. Most of the time I'm juicing for my whole family and with the NutriNinja I have to listen to complaints about who gets his/her smoothie first.-The NutriNinja requires water or another liquid to be added to the smoothie, whereas the juicer will just extract the juice from dry produce. Several times I had to stop the NutriNinja to add more liquid.Bottom line: both machines have pros & cons and I don't think there is a clear winner if price is not an issue. I foresee myself using the NutriNinja more often because of the ease in cleanup, and saving the juicer for when I want to incorporate stringier/tougher produce that the NutriNinja doesn't handle as well.NutriNinja vs. Breville BFP800 XL Food Processor-If you do a lot of food processing, you probably want to stick with a heavy-duty machine like the Breville. The NutriNinja doesn't have the selection of blades and plates that a traditional food processor does. It also is harder to ""pulse"" the NutriNinja.Bottom line: if you don't have the budget or need for a traditional food processor, the NutriNinja can do perform some of the same tasks, but not as well. It isn't a real replacement for a traditional food processor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU7DA9L3DQSMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGV40HO#wasThisHelpful","RU7DA9L3DQSMS","A1UV5NB0DXTSWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UV5NB0DXTSWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A Thousand Pieces of You"" is an intelligent, suspenseful, and romantic sci-fi thriller. It is the planned first book in a trilogy but unlike many YA trilogy openers, the novel stands on its own reasonably well. Yes, I want to see what happens next to Marguerite, Paul, Theo, and Marguerite's parents Sophia and Henry. But I felt like the ending gave the appropriate amount of resolution rather than ending abruptly like so many first books these days do.Parents should be aware that ""A Thousand Pieces of You"" contains a non-graphic sex scene as well as references to adultery, drug use, drinking alcohol, and smoking cigarettes. I would say that it's best for older teens and up as a result.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQQB11Z201QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062278967#wasThisHelpful","R3AQQB11Z201QK","A1UV5NB0DXTSWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UV5NB0DXTSWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love dystopian YA novels and also Homer's Odyssey, so when I heard the premise of ""Love in a Time of Global Warming"", I was excited to read it. Thank goodness it was short because I didn't like it at all. I did read to the end because I wanted to see how the author handled Pen's homecoming. The ending was a disappointment just like the entire book was a disappointment. I didn't like any of the characters and felt that the whole pro-homosexuality message was totally inappropriate for a book aimed at a YA audience.

Instead of finishing the race she went back to carry her injured opponent across the finish line costing herself the trophy.

"Definitely good for the back seat of a car.  Sometimes the fast moving scenery is too much stimulation for a baby and either gets them motion sick or agitated.

"This steamer does seemingly everything, and it does these tasks well. As a steam mop, I like its simplicity. All it requires is filling the tank and pressing the ""On"" button. I was surprised at how quickly it reached temperature and started releasing steam. It was well under a minute.At its default mid-setting, it produces a good amount of steam that is sufficient for cleaning both wood and tile floors. After testing the unit, I left it for the cleaning people thinking I would show them how to use it. I was pleasantly surprised that they figured out how to use it and went ahead and cleaned the floors with it. I did not have a chance to talk to them but I would imagine they preferred it to the regular mop and water.I decided to try cleaning out our grill. It was just as easy to configure it and very effective. I was able to steam clean the grill in less than ten minutes. And part of that was playing around with the steam settings and blasting an annoying fly. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised at how fast and effective this tool is. The one part that was a little inconvenient is the long power cord. I looped the cord multiple times and carried the cord with one hand and the steam cleaner with the other hand. The long cord is useful when mopping a large area but can get in the way when doing local steam cleaning. I would be especially interested in a cordless version of this steam cleaner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24WFPDAMMKZ68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106ANJAG#wasThisHelpful","R24WFPDAMMKZ68","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an animal repellent, this seemed to discourage some visits by stray cats. At least it initially seemed to repel some cats that have been visiting out back yard. After a few weeks, however, we observed these same cats, so it does not appear to last more than 2-3 weeks for us. We also have rat visitors but this is not effective for mice or rats. For birds, it seems that there are fewer after spraying. Overall, I would guess some animals are less affected than others are.As far as a fertilizer, we have recently converted to artificial grass in the front (and curiously received a gift deposit from a canine visitor which prompted me to spray the ""lawn""), so that is not relevant.

It doesn’t require you to handle any sharp objects to cut shapes into the crayon and the result is nice.

"For a Kamado type cooker, this works reasonably well. It holds the grate and allows removal and replacement as long as it is used near the center of the grate. I would prefer if it had some bends lengthwise instead of across the tip. This would make it more robust. It seems to be sturdy enough to lift medium or large steel grates but extra large or heavy iron grates may require assistance. I have not seen any rust develop so it is decently plated at least.When tried with other grill grates, it did not work as well. It did not work at all with a Weber propane grill (specifically Genesis Gold C). These grates are wider than most and have tighter spacing. This gripper also did not do as well with a Traeger grate.

Powers are divided into 5 Fs: Flickers—who can turn themselves and other things and people invisible, Flares—who can control heat/fire, Fuzzies—who can do general animal magic, Flyers—who can fly and hover, and Fluxers—who can change into animal forms.Nory is a Fluxer, but her magic sometimes gets out of control and changes her into two animals at once. So when she applies to Sage Academy, a magic school, she fails and is sent to a special class for kids who have strange magic like her. By the end of the story, Nory realizes that it's not so bad to be different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHSNPJR0DWWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545800455#wasThisHelpful","RDHSNPJR0DWWJ","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A couple of years ago, I bought a pair of Oral-B electric toothbrushes for my children. I had been using the same set for over ten years and have been pleased with the results. Unfortunately, they did not take to using the Oral-B toothbrushes and have mostly been manually brushing their teeth.I was offered this Sonicare electric toothbrush and decided to let my younger daughter use it. She has crazy teeth (even worse than her sister who is now wearing braces) but many are still primary so the orthodontist is waiting for more permanent teeth to come in.The standard size fits her mouth OK although we may try the compact size in the future. The Sonicare brush head design is superior to the Oral-B for keeping the brush clean. Both children have had some build-up around the brush area. I am in the habit of removing the brush head and rinsing it thoroughly, but they cannot remove the Oral-B brush too easily. The Oral-B brushes are less expensive.My old set started having charging issues (understandable after 15 years) so I bought a new unit with Bluetooth capability. I tried the BT app a couple of times but did not really see the benefit and just use the toothbrush one a day, alternating with a regular toothbrush.We have not tried the iOS app yet, but I do not really see the need. She knows how long to brush and since she is messy, it is better to avoid taking other electronics into the bathroom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC4F49M86LHOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7ZL6#wasThisHelpful","RC4F49M86LHOF","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK, I admit it. I selected this watch for my 8-year-old daughter. I asked both my wife and my 11-year-old daughter if they were interested in it, and both declined. However, my younger daughter saw it and really wanted it. I figured, why not?It actually looks more impressive in real life than in the pictures. Both my wife and older daughter thought it looked good. Even I was surprised and I have over twenty watches.The band is a nice mix of three colors, and the main face shows minutes clearly. The three subdials are a little busy but functional and readable. I thought the 24 hour subdial could be used for a second time zone but can not set it separately than the hour hand. The instructions are generic and do not really explain this particular watch. It is a larger watch but can be sized for smaller wrists. It weighs more than plastic watches and leather strap watches, but it should be manageable for most females. I do have some monster Invicta watches so my perspective may be skewed.Since this watch was for my younger daughter, I sized it for her and she happily wore it to school as well as to a music performance. To her, it is like jewelry that tells time. I hope I don't regret this later.

Her school had a flyer about a poetry competition with the book as a prize, so she was pleased to have already read the book.Younger daughter's review: The book is actually very funny, but it's also disgusting. It's disgusting because there's a page with a poem about booger or burps and farts but I still like it. I like burps, farts, and boogers the best.

"This tea has a nice light jasmine scent. I normally drink tea at work. Mostly I drink green tea although sometimes I will have oolong or jasmine (from black) tea. For convenience, I mostly use tea bags. At home, my wife and I will occasionally brew higher quality loose leaf teas. For reference, some of the jasmine (green) teas have been $30-40 per 1/4 pound, which is approximately upper middle grade.This tea is quite good. It is not comparable to the $150/lb loose leaf teas, but does compare well with many bagged teas. I do admit to preferring Mighty Leaf Tea, Organic Spring Jasmine. Tea bags allow variable steeping time and temperature which can bring out additional flavors so that is better. It is also much less expensive. The downsides are it is not as convenient or fast as K-cups.I tend to brew teas twice per K-cup. The second brewed cup for this flavor is noticeably weaker than the first cup.

"My wife and I met after she had already finished her residency program, so I, thankfully, did not experience the duress of intern/residency life.

Judging by what he has written, it was mostly trials. If his is a typical intern year, it is amazing so many doctors survive this period.He focuses on a few key people and events and appears to keep other influences (his personal relationships and clinical practice areas) relegated to secondary importance. Maybe they were not as influential, but he did marry his girlfriend and eventually chose infectious medicine as his specialty.It turns out my wife started one residency and then switched to another after a year.

"Last year, I bought an air compressor combo kit that included brad and finish nailers. Of course, I had to get a pneumatic staple gun, too. Thus began my journey to find an assortment of staples.While searching, I discovered several finish/plating options: no (non), galvanized, stainless, and Monel. I searched for galvanized and stainless steel assortments but could not find any and eventually settled for Stanley TRA700BN Heavy-Duty Staple & Brad Assortment, 2500-Pack.This assortment contains only staples and is galvanized finished. I tried them with several staplers. The first is my old standby POP Brand 3000 stapler. I loaded several sizes and had no problems driving them into some wood boards. I also tried the Tacwise Z3-140. Loading was even easier, but the staples did not always fully embed. Sometimes they ended up a millimeter or two off the wood. This stapler has a ""linear power curve"" so it may be a matter of getting used to its operation.The final staple gun I tried these staples with is the Surebonder 9600A. This kit is a perfect match with the Surebonder. I fired off too many staples in several sizes and pockmarked the poor board with no misfires and excellent penetration.

"Many people may not pay attention to water quality, but it is vital to vitality. I first heard about oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) while maintaining marine aquaria and koi ponds. I know it is a good measure of overall water quality and went so far as to buy a Hanna HI 98121 meter, but did not actively start using the meter until more recently.We have a whole house water conditioner as well as a reverse osmosis filter in the kitchen for drinking and cooking. The water conditioner supplies conditioned water for the lawn and outside plants and I have been using RO water for our Aerogarden, as recommended.I was curious about this product and decided to test it with the 98121 as well as a TDS meter. I can reasonably state that this water conditioner does what CleanGrow claims. For our tap water, I measured 330PPM (TDS), 273 mV (ORP), and 7.72 pH.

They also thought it was too hard and did not want to catch it. I dug out an old flying disc that was softer and lighter and they enjoyed playing with that disc more. The bases, poles, and bottles are solidly built and appear as if they will last.This game could also be used to improve throwing accuracy: maybe set the poles several feet apart and throw between the poles. If the disc knocks the bottle off, you lose a point. Or maybe set the poles so you get one point for knocking one bottle off and five points for knocking both off with one throw. I think this set could also be useful for practicing Frisbee golf with different disc weights.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G76DFR9M8OUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6GOYMM#wasThisHelpful","R2G76DFR9M8OUD","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a large bath towel, similar in size to some beach towels we have acquired over the years. While it does dry well, I did not find it to be particularly plush. We have some other towels that feel thicker, softer, and more absorbent, so this did not seem like a luxury product. I do like the color and the weight but this is a personal preference.On the sample I received, there was a hanging thread pair. I was not sure if I should risk cutting it and the end unravel or leaving it. I left it alone. More disappointingly, a loop caught on a hook and pulled a section tight. This also left me questioning whether to leave or cut the loop. I tried stretching the section to reabsorb the loop but it did not work. I left it alone and put the bath sheet to be washed. After washing it appears the loop was reabsorbed but one end of the hanging thread broke free. Overall, it seems like a decent product but priced a little too high for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S808QDJTXZ6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXUIB4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2S808QDJTXZ6F","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pure Fix Oscar. Several years ago, I received a copy of Fixed: Global Fixed-Gear Bike Culture and drooled over fixed gear bikes. A co-worker sometimes commuted on a fixie and I started leaving my bike in a single gear all the way home at times, thinking about converting to fixed gear. I never took the plunge.In recent times, I have biked or Trikked to the gym whenever possible. It is straight and flat. I seldom shift on my bike and can't shift on the Trikke. When the LBS declared my beater bike kaput, I thought about converting it to fixed gear. But after looking at conversion kits, I decided it would be cheaper and easier to just buy a new bike. I happened into a Pure Fix Oscar.This solid bike looks as good as some of the bikes in the book. The frame is heavier than my old aluminum bike, but it is well built and rides well. It reminds me of my first commuter bike, a converted mountain bike that I had for decades and put thousands of miles on.One of the tubes on the PF had or developed a pinhole out of the box and I had to replace it. Unfortunately, the replacement tube was also defective and burst while I was adjusting the kickstand. The third tube has held up OK, so I am glad it is not a wheel defect causing the leaks.The components are of surprisingly good quality. I thought I would replace more parts but have ended up keeping a lot. I did put on a trekking bar, kickstand, rear rack, and my old saddle. This bike is made to be customized. It is not a beater bike, but more like a bling bike that can take some beating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BB9R8H0NL16A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006U8D53U#wasThisHelpful","R1BB9R8H0NL16A","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Years (uff, decades?) ago X-10 offered an interface that allowed interested parties to directly read and control their devices through the AC power line. My brother was heavily into home automation and asked me if I could read and control this interface. I programmed a microcontroller and was able to read and display information from the interface on some 7 segment LEDs. After that exercise, life got busy and we did not develop further. It seems the home automation industry also tapered off a bit.More recently, I acquired a WeMo switch. It, along with the app for Apple, Android, and Windows Phone, has very conveniently controlled our hot water pump and has been saving water and electricity over the past year. Then I discovered the WeMo Maker. I have the Popular Science issue where it is listed as one of the Top 100 Innovations of the Year and that started churning the gears.A real application for this device would be a battery powered standalone project. Any line connected device could just as easily be controlled with one of the WeMo switches. What would be a good battery powered project? I might need to sleep on that. Wait! How about a motor control to automatically swing my hammock?!?The first thing to test is whether this bad boy can be powered by a battery. Sure enough, I hooked it up to an external power bank and even programmed it all without using AC power. Using the same network as the WeMo switch causes both devices to appear in the app.The hammock motor took a little more effort. I bought a cheap baby swing (Craigslist, $5) and ripped it apart, removed the motor, and mounted it on a wood base. A hook screwed into the end of the oscillating part attaches to a cord hooked up to the hammock. I tapped the USB line for 5V power to the motor. It works. I just need to tweak the speed and boost the torque to handle my size. I could also hook up the lights and soothing music, but that's probably going too far.The world is once again my oyster and I will get to it after a quick nap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKKZ0SZUFBN7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N32H7U8#wasThisHelpful","RKKZ0SZUFBN7S","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before marriage, I had a set of nice Wusthof Grand Prix knives. I kept them honed and sharpened and took excellent care of them. After getting married, my wife and I still used them but she did not take care of them and I thought about getting a cheap knife set. Eventually, we bought a cheap Wolfgang Puck set that she and the nanny regularly abuse.Lest you think I am joking, my wife broke the tip of the paring knife. Evidently, jabbing a knife tip into a frozen chunk of meat and then flexing the blade side-to-side is an acceptable way to divide a large piece of meat. And one or the other seems to have used the chef's knife as a mallet or something. The handle has a small crack, which I just noticed. These people cannot be trusted with fine quality cutlery.Honestly, I have never heard of Mercer Culinary before this. I thought it is a new consumer grade products company. It turns out they have been supplying cutlery to culinary schools and working chefs for decades. The local restaurant supply store sells them. They are truly professional quality.The knives are individually packed and have their own slot in the block. My block is well constructed and everything is properly finished. I would prefer additional spaces for a steel and knives but can accept that it would detract from the simple visual appeal.The blade steel is excellent quality and the knives are quite sharp straight from the box. Mine could probably use some honing to align the edges. I do not know how long they hold their edge but suspect they should perform similarly to the Wusthof. Regardless of brand, I highly recommend watching Craftsy's free Knife Skills class taught by Brendan McDermott.This is my dilemma: do I let known abusers use this knife set or keep this for my own use? Students and professionals are the most demanding users, and if Mercer Culinary can supply those audiences, they should be able to withstand a couple of home (ab)users. I'll keep the Wusthof knives tucked away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KPQFXT0XBDJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRU46DS#wasThisHelpful","R1KPQFXT0XBDJY","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many reviewers rave about how this product restored their old cars to like new appearance. I say, ""Pfft! Amateurs! Let me try this stuff on my three month old Cadillac SRX."" It still has wisps of new car smell. This, people, is a real reviewer.As far as this product goes, it applies easily using a microfiber cloth. I wasn't sure how much to apply since it is thick like hair conditioner, so I started with a small amount and increased it proportionally as my comfort level increased. Then I got lazy and glopped it on. I will say that it led to some noticeably uneven areas, so I recommend taking your time and doing it right.As far as smell, it does not have a strong scent but I did detect a faint ammonia or some other chemical smell. My family has not said anything about it, so it is not a strong smell. And since my children do not like the ""new car smell,"" it might even be considered more neutral than not.

"My wife had a small George Foreman grill before we met. She appreciated its quick and simple operation and ease of cleaning, so we requested a large version on our wedding registry. This larger version has performed well over the years and it has been a reliable appliance.We first tried this out with waffles. The waffle plates were a little misaligned and it took some effort to get them installed. I do like the convertible feature of this grill, but this could also be a weakness if the plate handles are banged around. I think careful storage and attachment/detachment will be important to protecting the plates. The company should make a storage rack or cover available.Anyways, the first waffles had an unpleasant odor, as expected, so I discarded them. The next waffles turned out OK. They were evenly cooked but did not have a nice crunchy shell that we get from our waffle maker. I wonder if searing the waffles the last minute might help. As a waffle maker, this is better than a previous one we had but worse than our current one. I think we will keep using our other waffle maker. This one does make larger sized waffles.Later for lunch, we tried it with veggie burgers. Here is where the grill shines. I like the new ceramic surface, and the temperature adjustment is very handy. This is a great improvement and allows all types of cooking. After grilling the burgers, I popped a cheese sandwich in there for my other daughter. Using smoked Monterey jack cheese with a little ranch, she said it was the best grilled cheese sandwich she ever had and ate it all including the crust.The adjustable slope is also useful and better than our old one's fixed angle. It is necessary to keep waffles even while allowing other foods to drain liquids. The plate size is a little smaller than our old George Foreman but still quite large and capable of cooking a family sized meal.Overall, I would say it is an excellent update to our old indoor grill. If only the waffle plates worked a little better, it could replace our waffle maker. As it is, we may buy some other plates and reduce some of our appliances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BXL7SISEFK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYJWE8#wasThisHelpful","R4BXL7SISEFK6","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using VideoStudio for many years, I started looking for another video editing program that is faster and could output 3D Blu-ray. Several months ago, I bought and used PowerDirector 12 and was impressed by how fast it authored and burned 3D Blu-rays.This version is even faster. I have burned several 3D discs and am amazed at its speed. A short compilation video of a trio of scenes took less than three minutes. A six-minute puppet show took less than eight minutes. I am used to starting the process and then coming back hours later, hoping that everything worked. With this software, I can try multiple options and not be as concerned with time. I generally use BD-RE discs so wasting discs (""creating coasters"") is not an issue.Editing video is similar to other programs but there is still a slight learning curve. As I learn more about this program (and I had only used PD12 for a few months so not a lot of experience overall), it appears that it will expand to meet my needs. I have downloaded some menus and templates from the Cyberlink website and appreciate the other users' contributions. I tried the EZ video option where the program will attempt to analyze the input files and select the project options. It took quite a while to process the video and the result was similar to what I would choose. Maybe I did not enable some feature but overall I did not find it worthwhile.For 3D video, I am using a JVC Everio GS-TD1 and it works quite well. I have also tried a Fujifilm W-3 but have not been able to find the proper combination to output a usable disc. It records in 24FPS and there might be some setting I am not choosing correctly. The JVC works pretty much with defaults. 2D video is completely straightforward and I have used multiple sources successfully. All that is required is to choose the proper output path.As far as resources, I am running this on an i7 PC under 64-bit Windows 7. I did get the BSOD once while editing video with Adobe Lightroom and Internet Explorer running in the background. Reducing resource load while editing is definitely recommended. I have burned usable discs while surfing the net multiple times so that should be OK.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKGPS273WRAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OLGP2#wasThisHelpful","R1YKGPS273WRAI","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I first became aware of Grohe on our honeymoon cruise. The cabin had Grohe fixtures and we were well impressed with the quality and durability. We figured if a fixture could take daily cleanings and abuse by different sea-faring passengers every week, it must be well above your standard home improvement store selection. When we remodeled our home, we selected Grohe fixtures. We were not disappointed. Our master bath had thermostatically controlled body sprays and a nice showerhead. With softened water, we frequently looked forward to returning home even while on vacations.We bought a new house and moved several years back, and the plumbing supply recommended another brand (Danze) as comparable quality at a lower price. Sad to say it has not performed nearly as well. We miss our Grohe fixtures and may move back to our old house when the kids have grown.When this appeared, it took me all of a few seconds to choose it. Even then it was just trying to decide where to install it. I decided to try installing this myself in our guest bathroom. It is a little more involved than expected and took me about two hours, but I am not a plumber and made a few mistakes. At this price point, most people will probably have it professionally installed.First off, this requires a ½"" nipple and Teflon tape and/or pipe thread sealant. Tools required are 2.5mm hex wrench for set screws, a T10 Torx screwdriver for the upper anchors, a #2 Phillips screwdriver for the lower anchors, a set of wrenches or an adjustable wrench, and a 5/16"" masonry drill bit (Bosch multi-construction). Drilling the holes for the anchors requires precise measurement. I thought rough measurements would be sufficient, but it is critical if everything is to fit correctly. In addition, I used a power driver to drive the screws into the anchors. That is not a good idea as I stripped some of the Torx heads. I did measure the height several times and was relieved the connectors lined up correctly. Again, careful measurement is critical.With that bit of work completed, the assembly went together quickly and it was time to test it. I did not remove the flow restrictors and there is sufficient pressure to run both heads. I really like the selection system where one to four patterns can be selected. After one use, my favorite is the Bokoma Spray mixed with Rain. The Bokoma Spray is an interesting in-out center pulsing. The hand shower has the same selections and running both simultaneously is a truly luxurious experience. I did not want to get out of the shower.I will say that the main system is well constructed with a solid feel like I remember. The showerhead and hand shower, however, are not as solid. They appear to be plastic, which is good and bad. Good because they are lighter weight (compared to a Hansgrohe Axor Terrano showerhead and Danze hand shower we have in the master bath) but bad because they are not as durable. The pattern selection uses a light touch to select multiple patterns or a strong touch to select a single pattern. The plastic just does not feel as good as brass. But the system has a lifetime warranty so it might not matter in the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R196JKKOEJ5HSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7RS0K8#wasThisHelpful","R196JKKOEJ5HSB","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is possible to stuff an X-large shirt in there. It won't win visual display awards, but it won't incite fermented fruit flinging.It took me a few tries. The key for me was to stretch the shirt taut while paying close attention to the armpit areas.

"Once you get used to controlling this contraption, it is a load of fun. The app does take some getting used to since the controls are not strictly conventional. But then, this is not my father's Oldsmobile.I wish it charged faster. More than once, I have had to stop the merriment while it sat and recharged. It seems the run time to charge time is about 1:3 or 1:4, which is somewhat disappointing.

"This was selected as a replacement for my daughter's Samsung Focus i917 Windows 7.1 phone. We were originally going to hold off getting her a phone but decided to let her have one when she started middle school.Just unboxing and setting it up, I could tell the BLU is a significantly better phone than the i917. For one, it comes with a cover and screen protector. While in and of itself not a big deal, this shows that BLU pays attention to the details. The dual Sim slots are another nice feature although we have not used it. I did install a microSD card and appreciate the expanded storage.Finding and loading Windows phone apps has not been as difficult as some have made it out to be. For one, we do not want her to load it up with games, so the main titles that are available have been more than sufficient. Hard core phone gamers will want to consider whether the titles they are interested in are represented. Xbox owners will be better suited for this environment than other game system owners.We also bought her a new laptop running Windows 8. It has very good integration with the BLU phone. As she gets more familiar with the phone and computer, I can see her entering quick notes or thoughts into the phone and transferring the data to her computer. One point about Windows Phone Cortana, it does not allow access to anyone under 13 years old, so she still has a few years to go.As far as the hardware, the phone feels nice and solid but not too heavy. We like the large display and the buttons are responsive. Sometimes, however, the touchscreen seems to require a few attempts before responding. It's difficult to determine if it is the hardware or software. The sound is good, although my daughter says it is almost too loud and there is not enough resolution at the lower range. Calls are clear and we have not had any reception issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCO68FM39X9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQGFQ7C#wasThisHelpful","RNCO68FM39X9A","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Mean Girl Makeover series. My daughter read and liked the first book, So Not Okay, so I selected this title to continue the series. The following is her review.This book is a continuation of the previous story from a different point of view. Now it is from the victim rather than a witness. This book does a great job of describing cyberbullying. I am sure that the victims of cyberbullying or even regular bullying will find this book to be a great help.

"Our LG front loading washer is about six years old and still working well. We have gotten into the habit of leaving the door open after washing and it has been relatively odor free.This product has a pleasant smell and is easy to apply. About once a week for the past few weeks, I have sprayed it inside the washer and left it there overnight. Although we have not had a large problem with odor, it has improved somewhat. As far as cleaning, I thought it would also help remove discolorations on the gasket but several applications have not seemed to noticeably reduce them.Regular maintenance is essential and this product should help to extend the time between cleanings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UVJV4OYEIBG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM5MHK8#wasThisHelpful","R1UVJV4OYEIBG7","A1HYH206E18XVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HYH206E18XVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had one of these for about a year, and liked it so much that I bought another to use at a different location. It works perfectly every time and I've had zero problems. I like the fact that it can run on either a 9 volt battery or the AC adapter. Both are included. I usually just keep it plugged in.One thing to pay attention to is the mode when you first turn it on. When you first turn on the scale, the default mode is Kg, not Lb, so if you want Lbs you need to hit the mode button to get a proper Lbs reading.I've weighed packages from as little as 6oz up to 70lbs, and it is very accurate. I've even compared it with another scale I have and it is right on.The thing I like most about this scale is that the reading screen can be moved out of the way so you can weigh large boxes and still be able to see the screen.

"In the spirit of nonconformity, I thought I'd write an honest review, contrary to the 160+ lemmings and friends of the author that wrote glowing 5 star reviews.I decided to stop reading this book at page 92 because my eyeballs were getting tired from rolling up into my head every few pages. The self-help advice, while not bad, is very generic and unoriginal. For example, the author suggests that you should write down a list of your goals for your life; really? Ya think so? Gee wiz, I never would have thought of that.The tone of the book also comes off as condescending to anyone who doesn't CONFORM to the ""nonconformist"" lifestyle that he presents. Can't get much more hypocritical than that. I also couldn't believe it when I read the part about how the author's big personal goal was to travel to every country in the world. That's nice and all, but it totally sounds like something a 7th grader might say if you asked what they want to do with their life. To each his own, I guess.I read books for 2 primary reasons:1. To learn something interesting or valuable, or2. To be entertainedAt 92 pages in, this book was not doing either of those two things for me, so I put it down.

"I wanted a basic compass that was small and light to use for hiking on cloudy days when the sun can't be used as reference. These fit the bill perfectly. They are about the size of a quarter, and are designed to clip onto your watch band, but since I don't wear a watch I'm going to just toss one of these in my pocket, and a backup in my backpack.Getting 12 for such a low price seemed too good to be true, and I figured at least some of them wouldn't work, but surprisingly all 12 work perfectly. There are no air bubbles, and they all point North. On the ones I received, the NSEW letters are a bright green, with the rest of the markings being white, instead of all white like in the product image. The bezel does turn too, it's just a little stiff at first but after you move it a few times it works good.I did buy mine from the seller ""Micro-Tools"", so if you want exactly what I'm describing here you should buy from them.Also, the way the clip on the back is designed, there is a hole that you could thread some cord through and wear this compass as a lanyard if that's your preference. The product image doesn't show the back so I thought I should mention that.It's great to have a dozen of these. Great to put one in each vehicle emergency bag, and the kids can all carry their own compass when we're hiking.

"I am a lifelong Iowa resident, and an avid hiker within the state and elsewhere. Unfortunately, this book is primarily just a partial listing of state parks and preserves, with very brief descriptions, crude maps, and black & white photos.The introduction states that this book was written by a college student who spent a summer hiking in Iowa, and the book does in fact read much like a college research paper. Rather than first hand information about hiking the area, most of the information for each hiking spot is about the geologic history of the region, statistical weather data, and historical names and dates of the area. While that information may be mildly interesting, that does not constitute a hiking guide in my humble opinion. There is nothing in this book that can not be easily found for free with 5 minutes of Google searching. There are no ""hidden gems"" or anything like that in this book.If you're interested in hiking in Iowa, save your money and get on the Iowa DNR website, or Google the county conservation board websites for the county you're interested in exploring. The information on the web is much better and the maps are MUCH more detailed and useful.

"I liked this book. It is an absolutely terrifying survival story centered around one of the last survivors of a flu epidemic that wiped out most of life on earth. The few that remain, live in a constant state of fear, fighting off looters and murders who travel the countryside spreading terror as they please. But, this is not a typical post-apocalyptic story. The typical reader of zombie apocalypse novels would probably not like this.The writing style was very unique, in that much of the book reads as if it were almost poetry, instead of a novel. But yet, some portions of the book read like classic storytelling. My interpretation of this is that the writer was trying to express the state of mind that the main character was in by changing up the writing style depending on what was happening in the story. When Hig was feeling sad, lonely, or troubled, the writing was very fragmented and poetic. Almost like you had a direct line into Hig's head and were reading exactly what thoughts and emotions were bouncing around in there. At other times in the story, like when there was a struggle or an emergency, the writing style went back to storytelling, like the thoughts in Hig's head paused for the moment and he was acting on pure reflex or adrenaline. Then, near the end of the book when Hig finally started to get his emotions straightened out a bit, the poetic writing style stopped appearing altogether. I'm not sure if this interpretation is what the author intended, but that is what I got from it regardless.This is a diverse book that has suspense, emotion, action, fear, and joy, all in one pretty fascinating story. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTX9J4703YUEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307950476#wasThisHelpful","RTX9J4703YUEK","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title was misleading. It should be called, ""Complaining About the Woods""I got this book thinking it was about a hiking adventure. What it turned out to be is a seething rant about how the author hates nature and it is all he can stand to simply walk through the woods. I really doubt that much of this book is even true, at least the hiking parts anyway. Clearly the author's knowledge about nature and hiking comes primarily from only reading about it, as his obvious paranoid fear of anything that is outside of city limits shines through in this book. I don't think he could tolerate even an afternoon on the AT, let alone what he claims to have done in this book.This book just reads with a very smug tone, and I really didn't like how he completely insulted and picked apart practically everyone he encountered in the book (not to their face, of course). He also does a lot of stereotyping of Southerners, hikers, small town people, and again, pretty much everyone he encounters. The guy is just a jerk at heart.I just noticed too, that the bear on the cover is a brown bear, which doesn't even live in the area he supposedly hiked. Just another layer to this completely foul smelling rotten onion of a book.

"I've been reading a lot of books in this genre lately, and I found this one to be quite special compared to other books I've read on this topic. Instead of the people struggling to survive the aftermath of a cataclysmic event, as in most post-apocalyptic books I've read, these people are observing the extinction of humans on earth from afar, knowing with absolute certainty that the same fate is in store for them. There are no preparations that can be made to prevent it. The only thing they can do is bide their time for the last few months that they have left.This is a very interesting look at how people can behave and treat each other, and the emotional struggles that they go through while awaiting certain death. That being said, it is obvious how the story ends, but it is the details that happen between when the story starts and when the story ends that make for a very interesting read.This book was written in 1957, and I think this book really gave me an insight in to what the general world view was at that time regarding nuclear holocaust. Even with impending extinction, somehow the society held together, not completely, but for the most part people continued to be decent people all the way to the end. It makes me wonder how the people in today's times would react to such a situation. This was a very thought-provoking book, and I will likely read it again some day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24IKB7WI1QVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307473996#wasThisHelpful","R24IKB7WI1QVV","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is some great advice on managing people, and he even goes into details about what types of employee benefits work and what what ones don't.He covers it all from hiring and firing, to taxes and accountants, to managing inventory, to buying a building. Dave gives loads of practical tips and advice from all the mistakes made and lessons learned over his business career. And of course, you do it all debt free.

"I first heard about the author when I heard an interview he did on an entrepreneurship podcast. He sounded like an interesting fellow with an interesting concept, so I bought the book to learn more about the ""entrepreneur mindset"" that he was talking about in the interview. Unfortunately, this book was many things and interesting was not one of them.First of all, contrary to what some of the other ""reviewers"" have stated, this is definitely NOT a book about entrepreneurship. There are no business strategies, marketing advice, or anything like that. It is about creating the proper mindset to prepare yourself to succeed in the entrepreneurial world, or any world for that matter. It really is more of a psychology/sociology/philosophy book than anything else.The thing is, while I do agree with many of the viewpoints expressed by the author, the way they are explained is very jumbled, and really has no cohesiveness to it. I have read quite a few books on the topics of philosophy, psychology, ego suppression, etc., and I think that someone who has no prior reading on these topics would find this book very confusing and frustrating to read. For instance, in the chapter about emotions, the book suggests turning off the emotions and focus on the facts before reacting. While I agree that's a good idea, the book provides no suggestions on how to do that, or what steps to take in your daily life to train yourself to do this. These are HEAVY topics here that many people spend their entire lives working on, and glazing over these topics in just a few pages just doesn't cut it. On the topic of philosophy and emotional well being, I would recommend reading something by Krishnmaurti or Tolle instead. These two explain those concepts much more clearly and more in depth.This book also seemed to read like an autobiography, except instead of being written in first person past tense, it was written in third person present tense. This book is obviously his story and observations from his life, but every instance that ""I"" would normally be used in an autobiography, it was replaced with ""You"", so it sounds as if he's telling you how things happen for you. It is just bizarre, and it annoyed me through the entire book. Honestly, I think this book would have been much more readable and more interesting if it was actually written as an autobiography where readers could learn from the author's experiences. Instead, this book lays out a constant stream of ""You feel like this...."", and ""You consider this or that..."" or, ""Other people think this of you..."" which just doesn't jive with me.I am a self-made entrepreneur, and neither my path in personal life or my path in business fit within this cookie cutter life path that is laid out in this book. I really don't like writing low rating reviews, and I'm pretty choosy about the books I read so I rarely have to. But, in the spirit of helping people as this book suggests, I've got to put these things out there so buyers can make an educated decision on whether or not they want to bother with this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SSZ2QZPTANWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985601337#wasThisHelpful","R3SSZ2QZPTANWL","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little bow and arrow set cost less than $4. Knowing that, I think the quality of the toy is right in line with the price paid. Yes, the toy is extremely low quality. The arrows don't even have notches in the ends, so I cut little notches in them so my 4 year old could shoot them. It works fine that way. The bow is very flimsy, and there is no way the thing can shoot the arrows with enough speed to actually stick the suction cup arrows onto anything. But, it has been 3 days now since we got the thing, and it actually hasn't broken yet, which is surprising. With all these negatives about the toy, I can't stress enough that this toy was ONLY $4, so adjust your expectations accordingly.

They are pretty durable too, as my boy has been playing with these frequently since then, and that was over 6 months ago.The belt, badge, and holsters are just OK. They are made of thin plastic and the belt is a little difficult for my boy to put on. The guns are great though, and I know nearly $20 for a couple of plastic guns is a little spendy, but the quality of these toys is MUCH better than other cheaper toys that break after a week.

"This third volume in the Holding Their Own saga really stepped it up. Some new characters are introduced to the story, and some old characters make a comeback. I really liked how the author switched viewpoints every so often. It was kind of a ""take a walk in their shoes"" type of story, where you got to see the situation from different people's viewpoints.As in the previous books, Bishop and the other characters in the story are constantly coming up with clever solutions to the problems they face, which I really like. Also, as in the first two books, there is very little political bias in this story. I won't divulge too much of the story, but there are some really heavy political issues with the government in the story, but the author manages to tell the story without joining one side or the other. The book really promotes the ""We're all Americans"" idea, and I think it is more focused on the philosophy of unifying people rather than dividing them.I was somewhat critical in my review of the second book, but this third book is a significant improvement and I really enjoyed the story. The editing has gotten better too.

"I liked the first book quite a bit. Yes, the font is weird and there are too many typos to list, but this review is about the story and characters.The first book seemed pretty realistic. The main character was a pretty regular guy who had some military experience, and his reactions to the chaos that was happening around him were what I would consider to be pretty reasonable and smart. He was a regular guy, making some smart and tough choices so he and his wife could survive.In this second book, the main character somehow transformed into an unrealistic super hero. Probably the part that was most ridiculous was when he managed to cling to the underside of a moving truck, wearing a heavy pack, for around an HOUR, and after that he managed to take out an entire heavily armed drug gang single handed, while at the same time rescuing a little girl. There are more amazing feats like this one in the book, but this is the one that struck me the most peculiar.I gave the first book 4 stars, but unfortunately this one only gets 3. I'm starting to notice with these apocalyptic genre books that the quality of the story slips pretty quickly when you start getting into the sequels. I'm going to give book three a read. I've got a feeling a 2 star review is in my future.

"This stock fit perfectly on my Saiga .223 rifle. I was a bit concerned about how sturdy this stock would be because of how light it was, but after installing it and putting it through some of my own personal ""tests"", it appears to be pretty darn solid. I'm very happy with it in that regard.Installation is a snap, and it took me about 10 minutes to do. You simply fit the stock into the receiver, drill three little pilot holes with the supplied drill bit, and then install the retainer screws. Don't worry, you are drilling into the new stock, not the gun's receiver. If you ever decide to put the original stock back on, it will be exactly as it was when it came out of the factory. The pistol grip is even easier to install, requiring the insertion of just 1 heavy screw inserted through the bottom of the grip.The bottom of the pistol grip has a little spring loaded trap door, and with the space inside being hollow is it feasible that you could use that little space for storage if you wanted to. While the grip does have ridges milled into it to help make it ""grippy"", it is still made of hard polymer, which is not really very ""grippy"" to hold on to. I put on a cheap Hogue Handall slip on rubber grip that I had laying around. Much better.Overall, this is a great addition to an already great rifle and I'm very happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O5EZAEW0K282/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q8GJXM#wasThisHelpful","R1O5EZAEW0K282","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this book does contain a lot of useful information on preparedness topics, the way it is written is very hard to read. The writer skips around from topic to topic, without any real recognizable organizational plan. He will be talking about food storage in one paragraph, and then on the next page medical supplies, and then the next page ammunition.The book seems very disorganized in this way, and while reading this I couldn't help but imagine if the writer's home and survival supplies are ""organized"" in this same fashion. It is very ironic that a book about being prepared and organized has very little organization itself. This book is definitely not geared for people who are new to this subject matter. It uses a lot of terms that will likely be unknown to a person who is new to the subject.Most of the information presented revolves around the premise that you already own a farm or secluded location where you can have animals and agriculture and basically set up your own self sufficient little world. While this is good information to know, if you don't already have a ""bug out location"" in the boonies, much of the info in this book is not applicable to you. Most of the information in the book assumes a total collapse of society, and there is very little information about dealing with smaller, shorter-term disasters/situations.Much of the book also seems to assume that you have an unlimited budget for these things. If you did even half of the suggestions in this book you would have millions invested in this. In this regard, I do find many of the suggestions in this book pretty unrealistic and unattainable for the average person.Over all, this is a decent book. As the title of my review says, it's just OK.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMI8F5WGJKOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452295831#wasThisHelpful","RTMI8F5WGJKOF","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am amazed at how the price of desktop computers has dropped over the last several years. I bought this one to replace my 5 year old Dell Inspiron. My old PC has 2GB RAM, and only 60GB hard drive and I paid over $800 for it then. Now, I got this new Dell with 4GB RAM and 1TB hard drive for almost half the price. More computer for less money. Amazing how things change so quickly in the PC world. When I bought this, the price was $348, but it looks like they've raised the price since then. As of this writing the price is $419.This PC works great. Start up is very fast, probably under a minute. It runs very quiet, which I like very much. It does have a vertical style disc drive, which I'm not big fan of, however I rarely use CDs in my computer so it's not a big deal for me. Based on reading other reviews, it seems like that is a deal breaker for some people, so make your decision accordingly. This PC is very compact, standing at just under 11 inches high, 4 inches wide, and 15 inches long. It's really not much bigger than an X box.I read one other reviewer complain about the lack of a DVI port, and this is true. The picture that shows the back of the PC shows a DVI port, and it does not exist on the PC. The description does not say that it has DVI port, but for some reason one of the pictures is incorrect. Just something to be aware of. Personally, I don't care about DVI, as most monitors now days will take DVI, HDMI, and VGA inputs so they will work with any PC. I think most people fall into that category regarding DVI. DVI is going the way of the floppy disk drive.I've also noticed that this PC runs very cool. The outside of the box is not even warm at all. On the back of the PC there are two slots where you can install additional ports if you would like. I have an older Canon camcorder that I like which needs a firewire connection, so I will probably install a firewire card in one of those slots.Windows 8 is something that will take a little getting used to. When I say ""a little"", I really do mean it. Yes, it's different, but it's still windows, its not like we're learning a new language here. I know lots of people freak out when they encounter change, but to freak out over this little operating system is kinda silly. After about an hour of poking around in Windows 8 I started feeling pretty comfortable with it. I don't like the new start page, but this can be easily bypassed by simply clicking on ""Desktop"", which takes you into a much more familiar (and logical) way to access your files and programs. In ""desktop mode"", the interface looks very similar to previous versions of Windows.Overall, this has been a great computer so far. I use it mostly for basic tasks like internet and email, Microsoft office tasks, a little bit of image and video editing, and music. For these purposes this PC works fantastic. I've always had good luck with Dells. In my opinion this PC is an excellent piece of equipment for the money and I would buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZB501G2FHDSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RE86ZQ#wasThisHelpful","RZB501G2FHDSE","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's face it, if you've used Microsoft Office in the past then you know pretty much what you're getting with this software. There is nothing revolutionary or life changing about the 2013 version of this software. There are minor tweaks here and there, but nothing to get excited about. It works as it should.But, the biggest difference that I noticed was that this new version is non-transferable between computers, and you can only install it on 1 PC. In past versions, you were able to make one software purchase and outfit your whole household (up to 3 PCs) with Microsoft Office. No more.This 2013 version clearly states that it is only for 1 user, and 1 PC. So, if you have more than one PC in your home, you will need to make multiple purchases of this software. Also, if your computer dies or you decide to replace it with a new one, guess what? Yep, you guessed it, you'll spend another $140 to re-install Office2013 on your new computer.I am a fan of Microsoft Office programs, and I've used them for many years, but this new ""non-transferable"" policy is an important thing to know when making a buying decision. I hope this review has been helpful.UPDATE 3-19-2013:Microsoft has recently changed its user agreement allowing you to transfer the software to a different computer. If your PC dies or you get a new one, you can transfer the software license to the new computer. While this is a step in the right direction, unfortunately this is just a half-measure. The policy still only allows installation on just 1 PC, contrary to previous versions which allowed installation on up to 3 PCs. Those who have more than one PC will still have to make multiple purchases.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUNIU94B5A6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1TGUMG#wasThisHelpful","R2KUNIU94B5A6N","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's not too much to say about this part. The retainer nut broke on our Kenmore dishwasher, and this one replaced the broken one with no problems. Just make sure you don't tighten too hard when you put the new one in or you'll be buying another one!Tip: If you've broken the nut off by over tightening, the plastic threads from the nut will likely be stuck inside the hub. To remove that broken piece, take a pair of needle nose pliers, put the tips inside the lumen of the broken piece and open the pliers to exert force outward on the threads. While holding the pliers open, begin to turn the pliers counter clockwise. Keep twisting and the threads should screw right out, making room for your new retainer nut.

"I wasn't impressed with this helicopter. I got it for my 3 year old son. I expected it to make a lot of annoying sound effects, but what I didn't expect was it's almost complete lack of functionality. The rotors fold up for storage, but when you open them up you can't even spin them. There is so much resistance that you have to manually move the blades, you can't give them a push and watch them spin. My son was very disappointed by this.

The rope has two little velcro tabs attached to the rope that are used to make the lasso loop.

"There are a few problems with this RC truck, which warrant this low rating. First, the range of the remote control is terrible. If the truck gets any more than 10 feet, yes, only 10 feet, it will be out of range and stop working. Secondly, the levers on the controller are tiny. They only stand about a centimeter tall, which makes them impossible  to actually grab with a thumb and forefinger. You can only use your thumbs, and since the tops of the buttons are slippery plastic, it is difficult to drive the truck without your thumbs constantly slipping off of the buttons. Third, the turn radius of this thing is pathetic. We have a pretty large living room, and there is not enough space for this truck to do a complete circle. This thing looks like it would need at least a 15 foot circle to be able to turn around. For the price paid ($35) you would expect a higher quality RC truck.

"I got this case for my Saiga AK rifle chambered in .223. In regard to length, the 38 inch version fits my Saiga perfectly with about a half an inch of length to spare. I like a nice snug fit like that so the rifle isn't sliding around inside the case. In regard to height, I do have a scope mounted on my rifle and this case gives plenty of clearance.The padding is actually quite a bit thicker than I expected, which was a nice surprise. The zippers are heavy duty and I expect them to last. The pockets on the side accommodate a 30 round magazine perfectly, and I was pleasantly surprised at how strong the velcro is on the closure flaps. They will definitely stay closed, and I won't have to worry at all about a magazine falling out on its own.The outside shell looks pretty durable, and similar to luggage tags, there is a little clear plastic sleeve where you can insert a tag with your name or logo if you choose to. I probably won't use that feature, but I thought it is worth mentioning. The carry straps look to be good quality and the stitching is reinforce pretty well. One thing I really like is that this case has a shoulder strap.

"I can't stand clipping a light on the book, so I was looking for a light that would attach to the headboard. I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet. Battery life appears pretty good. Overall, this is THE BEST reading light I've found and if this one ever wears out I will be buying another just like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13S3JQZFECPRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933622709#wasThisHelpful","R13S3JQZFECPRE","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this Kodak M580 for a couple of years now. I wanted something that took quality pictures, had a good amount of optical zoom, and had a decent amount of features, but not some $500+ camera with a bunch of features that I would never use. This camera fits the bill perfectly.The 8X zoom Schneider lens is really great. It lets you get in nice and close and the auto focus does a really good job when zooming in. You can also change the setting to macro, which will let you take close up pictures of really small things like flowers or other small objects and still pick up the fine details. The LCD screen is big enough to see well, and give a nice clear image when viewing the photos you've taken.I also use this camera to take product photos for my business. The macro feature combined with the the adjustable exposure compensation makes it really easy to take nice and bright, vibrant, close up photos of our products. I barely have to edit the images at all before uploading them to the web. If you sell products on ebay or your own website, this camera works perfect for taking excellent product photos.I didn't bother with the Kodak software that came with it, I just plug it in to my PC and retrieve the pictures just like I would off of a flash drive. I would definitely buy this camera again if the one I have ever lets me down, but so far I've had zero problems and only good things to say. This was a good buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWNNHSH3FKBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031RGGC0#wasThisHelpful","R2MWNNHSH3FKBY","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pretty apprehensive about this movie before I watched it, mainly because it was on subject of dragons. I'm not big on stories about make believe creatures, or wizards, or magic, or any of that Harry Potter type stuff. Surprisingly though, this movie was not like that at all.It takes place in a post-apocalyptic earth, where the human race is dwindling on extinction and the remaining survivors are struggling to endure. The characters played by Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey are both pretty intriguing, and much of the plot involves the ego battle that goes on between the two.The special effects are done well, and by that I mean that the creators of this movie did not go overboard with special effects. They used CGI with discretion, and the scenes that actually had dragons in them were done pretty tastefully.Ultimately, this is a story about human survival and overcoming the odds in a very troubled world. I liked it, and I will likely be watching this one again in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LNSTYIEJWO6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LGE2LC#wasThisHelpful","R2LNSTYIEJWO6M","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We use quite a bit of packaging tape and have tried several different brands. Generally, I've found that the really cheap stuff has a lot of memory to it and tends to curl on you while you are trying to stick it where you want it. This Scotch tape comes off the roll with practically zero memory, which makes it very easy to handle. I used to buy this 6 pack at Sam's Club but now the price here on Amazon is actually less than Sam's, and with Amazon Prime I get it delivered for free, which is awesome.Regarding stickiness, I've never experienced anything like that video reviewer with the Kleenex box in their review. They must have gotten a bad batch, or maybe that particular Amazon seller stored their inventory somewhere that wasn't climate controlled and the tape just degraded. This tape is as sticky as can be, and I've never had issues with it not being sticky enough. In fact, if I accidentally stick it somewhere on a box and try to remove the piece of tape, it takes part of the box off with it.This tape gets the job done consistently, which is why I continue to buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335ZSZT255Y77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000087KUA#wasThisHelpful","R335ZSZT255Y77","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this WRT54G router back in 2005. I've had three different desktop computers come and go during that time, and this router has always been a snap to set up each time I got a new computer. I've never really had any problems with it at all, and it works just like it should very consistently.I've done the firmware upgrade through the control panel a few times just to keep the firmware current, although I have not noticed any difference in performance (either good or bad) from any of the upgrades. This thing just works like it is supposed to. We have another desktop PC that uses a linksys wireless adapter to get signal from this router. Since they are both linksys products, linking them together was pretty simple too. We also have two laptops, and iPod touch, and my phone, which can all connect flawlessly.Setting up the wifi security features is pretty straight forward, and since this is a pretty popular model there is a lot of help available online if you're not too computer savvy. I've considered buying a newer wireless router, but I just can't justify spending money on a new router when this 7 year old WRT54G is still going strong and giving me zero problems.Quick Tip: If you want to ""boost"" your wireless signal, do a google search for ""windsurfer antenna"". It is a neat (and free) little way to increase the effectiveness of your wifi signal by making little signal deflectors out of paper and aluminum foil. It helps when you have your router on one side of the house and get a weak signal on the other side of the house. It doesn't actually boost your signal, but it just allows you to get the most out of the signal. I did notice a difference when I utilized this tip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWN5LNDACX44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007KDVI#wasThisHelpful","RAWN5LNDACX44","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This weather radio is very basic. It is nice that it has the SAME feature which allows you to only receive alerts for your immediate local area, but this weather radio is lacking one very important feature. This weather radio does not have the ability to select which types of alerts you want to be notified of.For example, I live on top of a hill so I definitely do not want to be awakened in the middle of the night for a flash flood alert. I bought this mainly to be alerted of tornado related weather, but this thing goes off for EVERY SINGLE alert that goes out. Moments before I started writing this review, the weather radio went off for a thunderstorm watch, not a warning, a watch.This weather radio works just as it is supposed to, and the alert sounds that come out of this thing will definitely wake up the heaviest of sleepers. But, the inability to change which alerts you want and which alerts you don't want make this weather radio very annoying. I am going to buy the Midland WR300, which has this very important feature.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T79E88LYG6DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001OHH0Q#wasThisHelpful","R1T79E88LYG6DQ","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this charger regularly. The best part is that you can charge a battery without having to have the battery in the phone. I have extra batteries, and when my phone battery starts getting low I just take the fresh one off of the charger and put the dead one from the phone back on the charger.The ""cradle"" part of the charger is ok. Getting the phone to plug into it correctly is kind of a pain sometimes. I think that is mainly due to the design of the charging port on the phone, not the cradle's fault. The charging port on the phone has this little rubber tab that covers it when not in use, and that rubber tab gets in the way when trying to plug the phone into the cradle. Other than that, it works just fine. I have Activesync on my computer, and I just plug my phone into the cradle and my files are automatically synced to my PC.I think the only downside is that this device requires two usb ports. One to provide power to the battery charger on the back, and one to allow data transfer between the phone and the computer. Most computers have lots of usb ports though, so that's not really a big deal but I thought it was worth mentioning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25VTVYOX3KLPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BDD5GQ#wasThisHelpful","R25VTVYOX3KLPH","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Samsung i760 for a few years now. It is a pocket PC, so it uses a lot more juice than a normal phone. I leave the wifi turned on all day long while I'm working so I can get emails as they arrive. If I were to try this with the standard battery the phone came with, the battery would only last half the day. This extended battery literally does last twice as long as the standard battery.Unless I do an unusual amount of web surfing on my phone, this extended battery will last the entire day and into the evening. Usually around bed time it will notify me that the battery is getting low, but by then I'm ready to plug it in for the night anyway. I have three of these extended batteries. I always have one in the phone, a fresh one in my bag, and the other one on the charger at home.The standard battery works ok if you're only using this device as a phone, but if you're going to be checking email or surfing the web you'll definitely need at least one of these extended batteries. It is about twice as thick as the standard battery and adds a little bit of bulk to the device, but that is to be expected. I highly recommend getting the charging cradle that has a spot on the back where you can charge an extra battery. This way you can charge an extra battery without having the battery installed on the phone. When your phone battery gets low you can just grab the fresh one off of the charger and put the dead one on the charger.One thing to note is that since the extended battery is thicker than the standard, most protective cases for the i760 will not fit anymore because they are designed to fit the phone with the standard battery. There are cases that allow for the extended battery, but just be sure to pay attention to that detail when shopping for a protective case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HYORIUQ2OFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EXPU7A#wasThisHelpful","R36HYORIUQ2OFJ","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked The Grapes of Wrath, so I decided to give this Steinbeck novel a whirl. While the book did delve deep into the characters and their personalities, the characters are completely boring and the book was a snooze fest. In fact, several times I found myself reaching for this book when I was having trouble getting to sleep some nights. Worked like a charm.The subject matter is drab, and the characters are less than enchanting. You can tell from near the beginning of the book that this ""moral man"" (Ethan) is eventually going to decide that succeeding in the world is more important to him than his ethics. Surprise, surprise, another fool sells his soul in the pursuit of wealth.Steinbeck is known for being a master of the English language, and I won't argue with that. The use of words and phrases in this book are obviously brilliant, however, that is ALL this book has going for it. I agree with how one other reviewer described this book as ""a silly, tiresome book that is micro-smart, and macro-dumb, dumb, dumb"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16X9RZN5566LV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143039482#wasThisHelpful","R16X9RZN5566LV","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the title says, this is the BEST gel pen that I've found. You wouldn't think that something as simple as a pen can make much of difference but it really does. Here are the features that make this pen 1000 times better than cheapo ball point pens and worth spending a little extra money.1. Bold, easily readable ink - If you write a word with a ball point pen, and then write a word next to it with this pen, you would immediately notice how much more bold and vibrant the letters are on the page. Much easier to read.2. Smooooooth writing - That's right, this roller ball just glides across the paper. You really don't need a hard surface to write on like you would with a traditional ball point pen.3. Even ink distribution - The ink comes out evenly and uniformly. You will not have any globs of ink on you paper.4. Retraction mechanism - It has a smooth click and works as it should every time. Plus, I feel that a retractable pen is much better than a capped pen because you can just pull it out of your pocket and click it with one hand rather than having to use two hands to remove a cap.5. Comfortable grip - I like that this padded grip is uniformly shaped and not ""bulbous"" like the Pilot G2. It just makes the pen easier to hold.6. Clear body - The plastic body is clear so you can see how much ink is left.7. Durability - These pens hold up very well. I carry one in my back pocket with my pocket noteboook. I am sitting on this pen constantly throughout the day and have never had one break or come apart. The little clip is flexible enough to easily clip onto whatever you need, but rugged enough that it will not break easily.So, there you have it. The best every day pen in the world. Do yourself a favor and try one. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG3UYYE346X6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HXC3E#wasThisHelpful","RG3UYYE346X6D","A1XRKRGYYBI0LU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XRKRGYYBI0LU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It beautifully narrates the story of two women who's paths have no semblance of anything that I have ever gone through. It made me feel very fortunate but also so incredibly inspired by the two women's strength and resolve to do what they set out to do.The author allowed both Ma'arinet and Timneet to develop as characters in very sophisticated literary fashion.

As an avid reader, that is greatly appreciated and something I am always happy to see. The intertwining and culmination of the women's plights was beautifully written and moving, but also unexpected. The originality of Menghedi, Two Women, Two Journeys, One Hope for Freedom just bleeds through the pages. Any reader who appreciates reading outside of their cultural norm will love this book.

"As someone relatively new to the debate between science and religion, I think this was a great impartial ground to get some perspective on both sides. The author was able to succinctly point out contradictions, misunderstandings, and outright absurdity from religious and scientific fundamentalists. Delusions serves well to arm an individual with the understanding to come up with their own understanding of what reality, truth, and existence are.Stanislaw Kapuscinski is a formidable writer who commands the attention of his readers because of his ability to conceptualize rather sophisticated dogmas from religion and science. He is willing and unafraid to challenged those assertions. The more we engage in this type of discussion, the closer we will be able to have steadfast answers to questions that have eluded modern mankind.

"Intimate Conversations is really a novel and unique approach to saving or taking a marriage to a new level. It has so much potential for growth between two people. I was really impressed at how good of an idea this is and it leaves readers eager for more.The author, Bill Syrios, is a very good writer and knows really well how to encourage two people to break down those barriers and open up to each other.

"Stanislaw Kapuscinski has written a major body of work that is unparalleled in the genre of self-help/motivational. I considered this to be another gem of his writing. It explores complex and sophisticated subject matter about life, death, and the balance between the two. No other writer has ever been able to take such weighty topics and turn it into a master body of work that is aimed at getting readers to think critically about themselves and their place in life.I found this book, Key to Immortality very compelling. Many philosophers and historians shy away or are intimidated by the gospels and the teaching of Jesus Christ. However, the author takes that head on with the gospel of Thomas. No reservations and 100% unapologetic, this book will challenge everything about immortality that you know and have yet to know!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DN042R39EBSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055IIBT4#wasThisHelpful","R3DN042R39EBSQ","A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Moral Dilemma threw me for a new to say the least. I didn't expect to find so much that resonated with me. I, too, feel for Rebecca so much about living in the wrong generation. But I also felt that her judgments about her friends and others went a little too far. All in all, I laughed many times at the comedic elements, but also felt lots of emotions as the relationship had its share of trouble. There are many fine lines to straddle with this book, and I like that it allows for the discussion about right/wrong.A lot of women can benefit from thinking about this in a truly critical way. Perfect for ladies' book club! I can not fail to mention Isabella Coombs, honestly one of the most intriguing people I have ever met! Please read about this interesting story.

"Enigma of the Second Coming is a novel that you have to be mentally prepared for. It challenges conventional frames of mind and forces you to think about time, space, and power in new creative ways. This is a good and unique way to introduce yourself to concepts about metaphysics and theology into a progressive plot that has strong themes about love, family, and relationships.Stan I.S. Law always delivers on thought-provoking books that stand apart in the genre. This time, Enigma of the Second Coming, stands boldly in the science fiction genre as unlike any of the others. John, Hey, and J.J. were all dynamic and compelling characters that developed in dramatic ways and contributed to the story's momentum in valuable ways. I think there is so much more to read in-between the lines of these pages. Not only will I be reading Enigma of the Second Coming a second time, but as I am a fan of his writing, I will also be looking out for more of Law's work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODBF6D32EJF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JUOKHU#wasThisHelpful","RODBF6D32EJF8","A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a problem that many of us have, but don't know we suffer from it. Not until we move to a new place or do spring cleaning do we realize how stuck with our possessions we are. Dr. Andrew M.

I think this is a great first step in making even grander changes in our lives for the better.Un-Clutter is exactly what the doctor ordered!

It takes someone who knows their own skin to care for it properly. If you know anything about skincare, you know that vitamins C and E are absolutely essential. For wrinkles and fine lines, it's really the only thing that works. It's by a credible brand, made in the USA, and in an FDA-certified facility, which makes any customer feel very confident in their product. It works wonders!

"This wasn't a gruesome bloody murder book; it was a true mystery solve-the-case type of book. It challenges your own intellectual capacity in the psychological sense. Every part of the book gives you another clue and brings you closer to figuring out for yourself who the killer is. In that way, it seems that the author, James Kipling, intended to create an indirectly interactive book.For anyone interested in British detective murder mysteries, The Dart Murders is a great choice.

"Science fiction is a genre that surely brings a set of expectations about the creative and, usually, irrational leaps that the author will make. Stan I.S.

It's almost as if this journey has already taken place, and by Stan I.S. Law himself, because of the detail-oriented nature of the book, the flow of events, and the way everything culminates into something grander that will move mankind further ahead.I'm still processing a lot of the book, well after finishing, because it was simply so much to take in.

"My heart goes out to all the others out there who are wrestling with this disease or who are sharing the experience with a loved one who is struggling as well. This is an awful disease, so I'm so glad that there is a resource out there that is honest and wants to provide a comprehensible guide to the disease.The author is absolutely right - Lung Cancer is not just limited to smokers, it affects more people than that. This book has the answers to this devastating mystery. To be from a trusted, M.D. who is well-versed in the subject, has studied it first-hand, and is an undeniable expert, this was the obvious choice to understanding the disease wholly. Dr. Naheed Ali writes from an objective manner, telling the complete truth.I like that it doesn't read like a textbook, but doesn't patronize people who are suffering either. It is detailed and specific, but gives you what you want to know about alleviating symptoms, what makes it more bearable.

She intertwined them in a way that contributed to a unique plot, one that competes with some of the best books in the genre.In my opinion, the romance genre has suffered for a while, but Light Shadows gets me excited about it all over again. The author takes a lot of expertise from the entertainment industry and seamlessly weaves it into her plot and the character's professional lives.

You can tell that the authors, Alain Forget and others, speak from a place of real expertise and first-hand knowledge. It's also really impressive how all of their views align very cohesively.

Each person's journey is different, and I think that's an important aspect of How to Get Out of this World Alive. The one thing that is across the board is that you have to be able to overcome those mental and subconscious obstacles that keep your life static.There is a lot to learn from this book.

So long as you don't depart from that, you can go about weight loss in a very pragmatic and realistic way. 5 Gears Diet is not a step-by-step, do-this approach.

I think a lot of it is because of the changing economy, but there is so much more introspection and questioning of one's place in the world.

Whether its with love, religion, work, or any other way, people are on self-discovery.The author, Paul Huhn writes very honestly and direct.

"Legendary Detective in the City of Kings told a set of really exciting stories of Detective Kirin in his many quests. Each one had a high-stakes situation that kept me really captivated throughout its entirety.The author, Kaye Wagner, used very lofty and poetic language that I was so drawn to. It really meshed well with this genre being urban fantasy. It incorporated those elements with that of a solid mystery so well. It's also great that each story was able to draw on more themes as well. It can be difficult to bring all of that into one coherent storyline, so breaking it up like that gives so much to the reader. Legendary Detective in the City of Kings was extremely well-written and I'm pleased to have read it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXMAAVK5G8O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDZKDVQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SXMAAVK5G8O2","A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tracers was a fine example of the best in the young adult genre. It really effectively balanced themes of fantasy/paranormal with youth/teen storyline. I also think that there is a lot to be gathered from what happens to our protagonist, Jerry. At the surface it's like a search for identity but it's really about accomplishing something for a greater good and not being so concerned with the self.I felt that the author, Jerome Gilden, was good at not over-packing too much, but allowing just enough meaning and heavy weight to keep the story quite strong. For young adults who want to get a taste of the fantasy genre, and vice versa, this is a stellar middle ground. There are plenty of unexpected events and high-stakes situations that really keep the reader engaged, so I liked it a lot. Great book, thanks a ton!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DV33JWYYKBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QNAGIK#wasThisHelpful","R19DV33JWYYKBH","A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QQ0AQ89ZVCFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stop the Fear seemed like it was speaking directly to me. I was impressed, from beginning to end, the extent to which the details of how these episodes were described. From the thoughts of how last they long, to how to get rid of them, I felt this book was right on target.The author, Jamie Richards writes very eloquently and from the perspective of real expertise. You can tell that a lot of time has been devoted to understanding these problems that many of us are facing. The solutions are described in a concise and direct manner.

"Wow, I do not get all the great reviews for this book.The writing is childish in the extreme, with everything stated in a linear fashion, no subtext or building up of any kind of tension. The heroine is fond of making speeches about everything, even though she's supposed to be a painfully shy,. abused math nerd. She also suddenly morphs into a party girl with the aid of one make-over, and lets guys hug and hang on her, although she's been alone and trusted only one person in her entire life.Just unbelievable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNFSPFVUZ9W5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MPQH18#wasThisHelpful","RNFSPFVUZ9W5W","A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this book one star because of the moral character of ... well, everyone in the book. Except the baby.Also because there is a lot of angry sex, but absolutely no romance.The hero is a Mafioso criminal who breaks kneecaps for a living (Yeah, just how I love my heroes--not), the heroine is one of those old bodice-ripper gals who enjoys it when he humiliates her, is cruel to her, threatens her, makes her crawl, ties her up all day ... I dunno, any one of those would have me looking for the nearest sharp object, but not this sweetie. She craves her some Mr Bad Boy action.The worst part about their interactions is she's terrified one minute, then he gets her hot in a NY minutes. She's furious - same thing. He threatens to take her baby away - same thing. She tries to run away, he ties her up - it's all aphrodisiac to her. This is not good character development!I enjoy well-written BDSM with true character development. This is Jersey Shore revisited.

The hero, heroine are both pathetic with how they 'know what they should be doing but just fight it because ...(insert reason of the year)' Since they did so until they were both thirty, I wouldn't hold much hope for their marriage to last, or at least not happily.

"So this girl has been living on the streets for 7 years and she's beautiful, with satin skin and hair, etc? Um, let's do the nutritional math. No. She's been living without basic cleanliness or nutrition, her hair and skin would be wrecked, along with her teeth. She would've also likely been raped, beaten, etc. Homelessness is nothing to romanticize. It's a heartbreaking killer of health, leaving the person with little sleep because of constant fear, no place to get clean and eating the worst kinds of foods.Then, there's Lev's family. They're tough, savvy and run a casino/bar or whatever. Yet they accept a homeless girl into their mansion, about whom they know nothing-including her record and the state of her mental health, because many, many street people have severe mental issues to deal with. They accept her into their home and leave her alone with the baby?? Seriously??Lev. Evidently he is supposedly on the autism spectrum.

"I'm a big fan of Melissa Olson's 'Boundary' series.This book, I struggled with. And yes, its personal. I'm a mother. 4 pregnancies to get two wonderful boys. And I'm a teacher, not a cop. I've never wanted to put myself in the line of fire to protect and serve - I admire those who do. But the way Lena did it ... I struggled very hard to like and respect her. I liked her family, her husband, and Nate the teen - to me he was the true hero of this story.She refused to tell her husband she was pregnant, because he might fuss. Uh, yeah? That's one of the joys and privileges of waiting 9 months to get that baby out, so get over your bad cop self.She put her baby in physical danger over and over - and that I can't forgive. Whether you want to be pregnant or not, once you are, you are completely responsible for that little beings's life.

"This author can write. She simply goes overboard here to create the perfect heroine, with lots of angsty pain for her to wade through in this tale of woe. I finished the book, because I wanted to know what happened, so yes, the story held my interest the entire way through.That said, I thought the hero completely self-centered! He only changes a bit when he finally realizes he wants the heroine ... and I have to say if she marries the guy, she's in for more, because people that selfish don't change at heart, they regress once they've got their caregiver locked in with a ring on it.The heroine? Meet Mary Sue. She's beautiful, an absolute angel to everyone even when they're mean to her, looooves the elderly and small children, who by the way gravitate to her and protect her because she's so wonderful, she works harder than anyone else around her, she goes to deepest Africa to help the down-trodden ... and she evidently does all this in stiletto heels and big hair.Mummy was physically and mentally abusive to her--dad did nothing. Some of her co-workers are mentally abusive to her--she does nothing, nor does loverboy.

The heroine behaves like a 12 year old boy ... oh, wait, so do most of the males in the story.The hero is sweet, handsome and unfortunately lacking in personality.Facts are suddenly flung at us instead of being subtly foreshadowed and then introduced as logical outcomes of the characters and plot.I'll definitely be back to read more of MZ's work.

"Kristin Callihan can write superbly. Love her contemporaries, and her historical paranormal ENTWINED. Unfortunately, EMBER is not one of her good ones, and serves as a warning rather than enticement to the following series.The hero is on a long, long, long, long journey to discover a cure for his mysterious malady. During this time he meets person after person, all bent on harming him. He scrambles ineffectually, a victim instead of a hero who can make his own mark on the story.The heroine is at the mercy of an evil, weak father who uses her, abuses her, and lies to her. She has powers but instead of parleying them to help herself, she harms and then scrambles to help, doing neither effectively. She is also a victim of all the men in her life.Why read on? I stopped with a major roll of my eyes when the heroine suddenly appears in a sexual dream for the hero, which seems to have nothing to do with their current situation, but merely the author saying to herself, 'Hey, time for some sex to keep readers interested!'KC should stick to what she does well and drop this lumbering saga.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T67B0BUWABPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006T2KUPI#wasThisHelpful","R1T67B0BUWABPV","A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How I wish I could give negative stars and suck away the 5 star idiocy for this story.I guess one woman's nightmare is another's fantasy, but ick, ick, ick! So many publishers will not even publish rape and abuse, but TT has found an audience for violence porn. And by porn, I mean sex that is only for titillation, containing abuse and no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I like good erotic romance, but only if the hero is redeemable. This one is just a sick abuser.When I was a kid, I used to turn over a rock to see the squirmy things underneath. That's what the part of this book I read was like.

"4.5 Stars. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a typical Ashley fairy tale set in the rough and tumble of Denver's supposed underworld, complete with MC hero who rides in,sweeps the heroine off her feet, and saves the day. The poor, plucky, but beautiful heroine needs help, and she gets it, along with plenty of sexy fighting and loving from the hero. He's a rough, tough MC biker with hidden depths, she's the one who can save him from his dark past.Nobody does this theme like KA.

"Struggling to believe this writer is a NYT bestseller. Her writing is some of the most untrained and under-edited I've encountered in historical romance, and I've read a great deal. For example: Hero kisses heroine for the first time. 'When he finally decided to halt, a protracted amount of time had elapsed. (?) Really? This dude has grown up in London's slums? And notice how we are not in the hero's head, but outside of it admiring his big words? Not realistic or sexy.Author never lets us find out ANYTHING, but dumps all possible information, backstory and possible outcomes right out of the characters' mouths in each scene. No suspense here, folks. And subtext? What's that? Everyone says exactly what they think, in excruciating detail, in every single scene.The characters spend a great deal of time in other people's heads. Hero kisses heroine. Then he thinks '..her knees were weak ...' How the heck does he know her knees are weak? He's not inside her head. The author does this over and over, letting one character 'know' what another is thinking or feeling with no reason that they could possibly know, and not giving us any physical description that would SHOW us why they make these assumptions.She then has hero think 'He never made commitments. He was a liar and a fraud, and he never made promises because he never kept them.'Uh ... what? People don't think things like this about themselves. We're all the hero of our own stories. We believe our reasons for doing things are right, and other folks are wrong when they oppose us. Also, hero supposedly has a huge amount of loyal minions in London underworld, which he would hardly have if he never did anything good for others.Heroine is either schizophrenic or completely unrealistically written. I'm going with the latter. Ex. Hero kisses the daylights out of her for the first time. She's a virginal miss, but 'She broke whatever spell had been festering. Flashing a lazy smile, she said, ""That wasn't so bad.""A virginal miss of that century 'flashing a lazy smile' after her first kiss from a bad man?? Doesn't seem likely.Okay, moving past the bad writing. This hero is a truly loathsome individual. He blackmails the heroine into being his mistress, then confronts her with his fiance and treats heroine as if she's a hired whore who is completely unimportant. Then he can't figure out why either woman might possibly be upset.The heroine continues her schizo tendencies (maybe it's not just bad writing) by alternately standing up for herself in a way that makes us want to  cheer, and wilting like a cooked linguine in the face of the hero's incredibly loathsome behavior. We're supposed to excuse this because of his lost childhood. Sorry, hero. Either you have character or you don't.Couldn't finish","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WCLL3WBKNCFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDI7ITG#wasThisHelpful","R2WCLL3WBKNCFE","A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"May as well admit, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this story. I don't usually read very dark romance, or capture romance.These two authors are really good together. They have created a hero who has such a dark, horrific past that his present actions are completely understandable. And that's saying a great deal, since he kidnaps the heroine and forces her to stay with him. The only part I couldn't get past is that he has sex with her the first time while she's drugged. That was pretty rapey, I thought. Just a short little step up from date rape drugs.The heroine also is far from the sweet innocent she at first appears, and her background lends itself to her understanding and sympathy for the hero. I liked her, and enjoyed getting into her head to see what she would do next. She is no dummy, and no pushover. She stands up for herself at crucial times, even escapes when she can.The hero's band of 'brothers' are really well-written, and I will read more if the two authors write more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERFFNZF1R7Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OT2RNSW#wasThisHelpful","R3ERFFNZF1R7Z4","A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUBO91ZGR0Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What the heck did I just read?Okay, I only read the first chapter, but that was enough to convince me that this author needs some serious training as a writer.First, the heroine wakes in hysterics and describes a weird, erotic dream to her husband in great detail. Very great detail Never heard a dream described in such detail--it was almost as if she was trying to titillate him, not get comfort. The first paragraph, and I'm already not respecting or liking the heroine. Ouch.Next, the husband cusses her out for waking him, refuses to touch her, sneers at her, and instantly goes back to sleep. WTF? I'm supposed to accept this man as the hero of a romance, and want to flash back to their early romance? I don't think so.

"This is one sick puppy of a book. And at first I laid it on the manipulative, amoral hero ... but then I realized it's all the author.This book contains extra-marital cheating, abortion of a child created by two people who supposedly love each other, manipulation, lies and ... that's all between the hero and heroine. I get that abortion has to happen at times. This was not one of those times. Lies must sometimes be told to avoid causing deep pain. I get that, but why wasn't this hero strong enough to live with what he knew, to save the heroine, instead of breaking her heart to avoid causing himself pain?Houston, the hero is weak, manipulative, amoral and completely self-serving. He lies to his 'great love', he lies to his wife ... and etc. His sister made a very bad mistake with an older man. She then killed herself. For some weird reason he used this to drive away the heroine, his 'great love'. I put this in somewhat satirical quotes because truly loving someone does not mean treating them like dog doo, which is what he does.It was at this point I realized the author was manipulating the characters according to some great soap opera plan of hers that involves the characters moving around like puppets to create the Great Drama and Mystery of the plot. Ick, ick, ick.Could not finish, which is too bad because I liked the heroine (when she wasn't cheating with a married man) and I loved her gay friend. He was the nicest person in the story.

"I used this to replace my 3M Dual-Swivel Monitor Arm (MA140MB) and a Workrite Poise Heavy Duty Monitor Arm PA3000-S Silver.Comparison:1. The AmazonBasics model, a dual arm mounting arm, provides the same tension and the same level of adjustments as my more premium Workrite arm. I use a Samsung 27-Inch Curved LED-Lit Monitor S27D590C on the right hand arm and have more control of monitor height and tilt with the AmazonBasics arm.  From the bottom of my monitor, I have 11 inches of clearance to the surface of my desk. I also get about 10 inches more of forward placement on the Amazon side by side. The Workrite stretches from the back of my desk to about 18"" toward me, but the AB model extends even closer; I can move it within five inches of the front of my desk, right above my keyboard.2. The AmazonBasics model, although it has a six inch shorter mounting base than the 3M arm, also provides 11 inches of lift to my 19-inch Hyundai screen. I even get an additional 10"" of forward placement. My 3M, just like the Workrite mentioned above, does not come as far forward on my desk as the AB dual arm.For document management, I enjoy having the wider options provided by the Amazon dual monitor arm.Conclusion: The AmazonBasics dual arm reaches just as high as my other two independent arms. The AB model adjusts more back to front than my other two arms. The tension on the arms are just as good as my (very) premium Workrite arm. And instead of two mounts, I know have cleared up some surface space by going with the single point mount provided by the AmazonBasics arm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18593WCR5L4TR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIBN71I#wasThisHelpful","R18593WCR5L4TR","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works as promised in the item description. Solid and durable for a plastic toy. Easy to fill twist top plug.Has a good 20' foot range. Water shoots when the pump is pulled.

"I have always had a bit of a dry mouth. I'm known for always having some kind of fluid on hand.Although this toothpaste doesn't foam like most brands, I found the texture smooth and tasty. And unlike other brands, this paste isn't opaque. It isn't runny and holds well to the brush. The flavor (and residue) reminds me of a dental office visit. It's not harsh.The first few days was a learning period for me. I missed the foaming action of regular toothpaste, but at the same time, I appreciated the clean feeling and didn't miss the overly crisp mint flavors that I'd grown used to. I'm not sure if it has the abrasive ingredients that make regular toothpaste work as it should. It doesn't feel chalk-like or heavy.And it works well. I could feel the effects (freshness mostly) of the Therabreath throughout the day. Even after having lunch, I could tell that the paste was still at work.

"I see many of the reviews here focus on the general content with a concern for avoiding spoilers. I would like to comment on my general experience as a reader who has never experienced Neal Stephenson's writing before.The story sounded intriguing. I'm more of a history and mystery reader, but the destruction of the moon sounded like an area where I've never (t)read. The first 20%, or so, of the book was nearly impossible for me to quit reading. I'm happy that I began reading at the beginning of a four day weekend. I was hooked on the author's ability to introduce what appears to be truly scientific content while keeping a pace that seemed at once exciting and compelling.The characters are rich, but not so much detail that it seems like biographical sketches. There is a fair balance between ""action,"" science, struggle,  and tension. There is never a moment when the author conveniently introduces a fix to a sticky problem. There is really no deux en machina driving the events; no ""fix"" to calamity.The last 25% of the book doesn't maintain the same pace, but the creativity shown by the author and the writing ability demonstrated by Stephenson is well worth the admission price.Although I am an avid reader, I haven't committed this much time to a single book, large or small, since George R. R. Martin's books four or five years ago.Although I was learning an entirely different lingo than the genres with which I'm familiar, I rarely struggled with the concepts. The author does an impressive job of introducing terms and concepts without making me feel like I'm entering new territory.If you maybe think this is too large of a book, I would agree that almost 900 pages is daunting. As for me, I read the first 76% of the ebook in about two days. I finished the rest of the title in the last two days. I was overly ambitious and maybe you'll find that a more casual pace is better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVKMGEN0XAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZWV8JO#wasThisHelpful","RHVKMGEN0XAA","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What happens when the very demons who've shaped us to their will simply disappear to be replaced by the angels of our own affliction?Graeme Cameron seems to resolve the tension between our rising demons and our even more-so troubling angels. The anti-hero, a very well-developed character, slowly deteriorates into a sane madness in a nicely fluid and nicely crafted tale.Although this book is not for the timid, this book is a story of redemption from evils that have defined who we are.

"This is a beautiful design. The slats are nice and close with about the same space between slats as the Sleep Master Easy To Assemble Smart Platform Metal Bed Frame, Twin. That being the case, you might be able to do without a box spring and go straight to memory foam. The Sleep Master has metal slats and have a lock in feel, but can't be picked up to be moved from the ends. This Classic Brands model doesn't have the same issue since the outer frame is bolted together and forms a more permanent frame.The wood does concern me a little. They aren't weak and will likely support two adults, but I suppose the slightly curved shape does seem like a good reinforcement against too much stress in more weight centered areas.I like it.

I can sleep on this without trapped heat developing.The Dreamaway was heavy for its size. But it wasn't/isn't a heat magnet like the Novaform. It's deep enough to avoid pressure points (I sleep in one position all night without moving).This Classic Brands mattress is seriously thick and is very firm. It is well made, but I get more of a memory foam feel from the Dreamaway. This mattress feels like a better made, higher quality fabric and outer cover than all of my past mattresses except for the Sleep Number.If you're looking for a mattress without a box spring, this would be a good choice due to its size.

"""Is Jesus God?"" or is that even the right question. Although New Testament passages do speak to the issue, writers like James Dunn would say that other passages suggest otherwise and that the solution lies in the development of early Christology. But what if the intent of Paul and other Biblical writers was not so much to proclaim Jesus *as* God, but was intended to glorify the Father, Son and Spirit by defeating modalistic conceptions of God? Yes, the revelation of Christ was new. There's no dispute. Instead of seeing NT references as defensively positing the divinity of Christ, maybe we should be reading them with a view to offensively posturing the reality of Christ. Not so much ""Jesus is God!"", but ""the God you know is not without Christ.""As Wesley Hill demonstrates, the NT is replete with ""the one who"" language, after all. To understand God, we shouldn't conceive of God as one and three, but one who is three. So ""the Father who sent me"" and ""the one who raised Him up"" defines who Christ is in relation to the Father.Recently, scholars have attended to the New Testament liturgy and confessions to demonstrate a High Christology at work well within the first century. I've enjoyed this new line of reasoning, with its wonderful answer to the New Atheism. I still have some reservations, however. It seems that a truth claim as significant as including Jesus as God in the concept of the Trinity should be seen early and should be strong. There should be no doubt. There should be such overwhelming evidence that when Christ's name is mentioned in association with the identity of God, there is hardly any mention of doubt or hesitancy in accepting that claim. From the early confessions in church history, it seems as though when God is worshipped, there is no doubt that it is *through* Christ exclusively.I think Wesley Hill’s “Paul and the Trinity” has added to the discussion of the early acceptance of Christ's claims and Scripture's meaning, but with a different method and intent.My understanding of Dunn's argument, for example, is that the NT writings demonstrate a *development* of Christology and then lay in categories of high and low on top of a developmental Trinitarianism. Yet if we accept Wesley Hill's presentation, we don't see a gradual developmental phase of Jesus' Godhood, what we witness in New Testament teaching is the dawning comprehension and a growing confession of Christ's Godly station. The truth of God isn’t changing, but the impact of Christ’s self-revelation changes the understanding of His message.The Apostle Paul presented by Wesley Hill is not one struggling to maintain his monotheistic roots (his Rabbinical background) against the intrusion of a new teaching (Christ’s revelation). Rightly, Paul's writing is an example of a rapidly expanding, crushing realization of the fullness of God. Though the Trinitarian mystery of being and identity may never be adequately explained, we can see that none of the Triune identities function by themselves. It almost appears that Paul presents Christ as “the one who sends the Spirit” or “the Son sent by the Father,” always in relation with the other persons of the Godhead. Christ is identified by His relation to the Spirit and the Father at almost every turn. The Trinity in unity.If Hall’s approach is correct, it would suggest, for example, that in 1 Corinthians 8:6, Paul isn’t redefining the Shema, nor is he attempting to somehow dialogue with or retain his Judaism in the face of new revelation. In other words, Paul isn’t recasting the ancient confessional statement according to a newly found Christology. When Paul writes 1 Corinthians 8:6, he is not only forging Christology, he is smashing modalism.And though I should probably read the book once or twice more to make sure I understand the reasoning more fully, I am delighted by the tone and the writing style. I would recommend this title to those who enjoy reading Bauckham, Hurtado and Dunn.I truly hope I've written the review well enough. The material is fresh in my mind, but the implications are exciting and are still thrashing around.Forgive me if I've failed the author.

"One third of my way into this title, I knew that it was one of the top fifteen books I have read in 25 years of research, education and reviewing.The writing style is smooth and the subject matter is addressed clearly. Instead of thinking of a bland, academic and heavy-handed commentary, consider this as a fluid paraphrase with little knowledge nuggets deftly added, giving this work a deeply informative read.The author transitions between commentary and personal application in a graceful manner. Not only are the vast (read: staggering) amounts of insight into the details of Esther provided in a clear and lucid manner, but the unveiling of Esther's literary devices explode from each chapter. I am still boggled by the amount of material the author was able to squeeze into the book without turning it into a graduate level deconstruction.This is really good work.

"Despite it's dozens of pieces, this is not a bad decision. While working in a mattress and frame wholesaler, I've had to manhandle hundreds of frames. My toes and shins have come under intensive battery. The problem with typical frames is how to transport and store them.There are always going to be sharp (ish) corners and edges. As simple as it sounds, many people don't realize that frames without edges have a huge effect on the perception of the mattress. The farther in the edge of the frame, the more the mattress sags when a person goes to lay down or even simply sit down. This frame comes right to the edge without much overlap of my mattress on my memory foam mattress (standard Queen).The same goes with the corners - without good corners, your feet and head will tend to fall off and you'll also have a tendency to roll inward, squishing your partner (if such is the case).The ends of the frame are also good. I didn't notice any sliding or tipping when applying my full body weight to the end. The support legs are in a good place. Too far away from the end and it would be like sitting on a bench without a counterweight...it tips! But this frame doesn't lend toward tipping.There are loads of pieces and I wasn't prepared for that, but with a little time, it's all good. These are tubes, not rigid bars. The weight is reasonable. The slats are just a little too far apart for me to be comfortable with using additional supports underneath a mattress and probably will ruin a good mattress over time. Recommendation: add a box spring.I like the design for storage considerations, but I had to deduct a star for quality of shipping.

"1. Presentation and Packaging: Stellar. It feels like I'm opening an Apple product. Tight, white and solid. There is an outer box with a fold down side. The inner box contains the watch the the sleep band. The inner box opens like a large jewelry display case. The watch and sleep band are protected in two separate compartments. Both are fastened around small round leather pillows.2. The watch: Incredibly solid. The band is supple and has a silicone band. It is slick and feels a little like shark skin. While wearing it, I can tell that I won't have to worry about hair grabbing. It is snug and doesn't slid around my wrist as I move. The hands glow in the dark as does the Philip Stein symbol at the top of the display. I see three insets: 24-hour clock, days of the week and day of the month. At this point, I can't tell if it keeps a regular calendar of if I will have to change it for months with only 30 days (and of course, February). It's not evident from the photo, but the bezel slopes down to the clock face, giving a depth to the display of about 4 millimeters. As it slopes down so do the numbers, but at a lesser angle, which gives the numbers a nice 3d effect. The hours stand out against the interior nicely. It's very attractive. There are no sharp exterior edges. Even the the crown is rounded. Position one and two of the crown are easy to find, so I didn't have any issues setting the different time functions. The listing above does not say, but the watch is the ""Fruitz"" line. The line is marked on the back of the watch and on the clasp, but nowhere else, not even in the instructions. I see quartz movement. And it's hefty. This is not a light plastic watch, folks. There is a type of inset hole in the back of the watch about 5 millimeters wide with a depth of about 2mm. Around the hole, which is covered with a crystal face is written, ""Natural Frequency Technology."" I had to search for what this meant. The best I can find is that the ""technology"" is an electromagnetic field. Supposedly, this watch has been field tested by members of the Miami Dolphins and 93% of them reported positive reduction of aches and pains after sporting the watch for three weeks. It is water resistant to three atmospheres and is stainless steel.3. The sleep band: This piece is about half the size of the watch in total girth. It looks like an attractive memorial band. The word ""Sleep"" is printed on the steel where the band meets the piece. I have to admit that at first glance, this looks a little silly. In the middle of the piece is another small window-like, crystal covered space that looks the same as the one on the back of the watch. Since I have chronic sleep issues, I will be interested to see if I show any improvement. I'm willing to try it even if I can't adequately account for how it might work. Does an electromagnetic field work to induce sleep or aid in the reduction of pain? I don't know yet, but will try it tonight and over the next few weeks to see. I'll update this post as I go. The band on the sleeper unit feels different than the watch. It's like a felt material and has holes throughout which I believe is supposed to reduce the heat signature of the band.Both of the units have a unique quick release mechanism allowing the user to switch bands without having to resort to knife blades in order to exchange.Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of the set. The display case itself is an impressive addition. I think the package adds to justifying the price. After all, if I were to pay retail for this set, I wouldn't want a bubble wrapped plastic stand. The extra touch of the pillows and jewel case are bonuses and also might alleviate some of the price shock of the set.The big question is the price. Is it really worth it? I can honestly say that this is not a cheaply made watch. It is well built, has a beautiful display and feels great. The most I've ever paid for a watch was around $200 and it ""lived"" for about ten months in a combat zone. I took this Philip Stein around my property today, in the rain, and did a little work. I left my cell phone at the house so I would have to rely on the more traditional timepiece. I came back with a scratch-free watch that didn't interfere with the outing. Incidentally, I came back without any aches or pains that I would normally have (combat injuries that will never go away). Did the watch take away the pain? I don't know, but I'm not going to argue.I did not find a single thing that would convince me to take away stars on the rating. Everything has been a positive experience. I really do like this watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVTPN9A2YRA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3MLYIE#wasThisHelpful","R3GVTPN9A2YRA5","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is a little coordination issue, but he is figuring out his spacial awareness very well.Just don't stand close when your little one is in the zone.If you want good, clean indoor fun (especially during these cold snaps we are having), give this a shot.NOTE: Games can be downloaded, but for those of us way out in the country, a physical copy of the game is a must.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F7XDULAKB9W5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6K0C#wasThisHelpful","R3F7XDULAKB9W5","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have reached my lifetime quota of clickety-clicks. It was either find a quiet mouse or go mad from trying to be quiet in the middle of the night. I also work in a cube farm and really can't take my own clicketys any longer.Based on some of the reviews, I decided to try this one and I have a winner. It really is quiet. It's muffled and hardly makes any sound at all. The wheel makes more noise scrolling than either the right or left mouse buttons.By the way, the little red button between the keys (and below the wheel) changes the cursor speed. It has a sensitive setting and a normal. It's nicely designed and didn't result in inadvertent activation.Overall, this is an excellent solution.

"Adam, the Fall, and Original Sin is a title that is striking in detail and thoroughness. While the chapters are individually authored by a range of respectable names, it is nonetheless one of the most cohesive books I've read. While the vision of the title seems overly ambitious, the philosophical, scientific and theological arguments put forward are impressive in scope and breadth.Seemingly a difficult task, addressing Adam, his fall and his sin in one volume is asking quite a bit of any team of authors. I think this work has demonstrated the talent of the general editors at keeping the group focused on their task. Many chapters seem to be unified under a good deal of editorial preparation while demonstrating a fair amount of latitude in the ability of the authors to add their own flair and personality.Although the age of Adam identified in the text is likely older than many Evangelicals would be willing to reach, I found the argument persuasive yet a little outside my reach as a reader of theological works.Chapters dealing with those who deny original sin and the Fall are presented clearly and generally, but with enough content to likely satisfy advanced students of philosophy. The history of the development of the doctrines of sin are smooth and clear as well.In all, I enthusiastically enjoyed the book. I believe the writing style is probably most accessible by a moderate to advanced philosophy/theology readership. The title will likely find an agreeable audience with traditional Augustinian or Reformed backgrounds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38NCK2APJOOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLXDK6S#wasThisHelpful","R38NCK2APJOOK","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wasn't sure what to expect. I have a Neptor 5600mAh 3.1 Amp charger and like it very much for its compact size and charging power.The AmazonBasics charger (this one) is the same in output, but only has 2.4 Amp output instead of the 3.1 compared to my Neptor. Both seem to take just as long to charge, but the Neptor seems to charge devices faster.As far as size, it's difficult to compare exactly. The Neptor is a 1/2 inch smaller in length (almost 13 mm) and a half inch wider. The Amazon charger is flat, which is my personal preference for techy portables, things just tend to fit better when they are similarly shaped. The Neptor is a half inch thicker and is shaped like an oval (from the end view). So this category, is for me at least, a tie. The Neptor is smaller, but the Amazon charger has more of the design I personally prefer.Price wise, it's about the same. Currently, the Amazon charger is $24 USD and the Neptor is $22.Color might be another issue. My Neptor is blue and is therefore pretty high visibility. That is definitely not something I prefer. I like my gadgets black or tech silver.All in all, I can't decide on my own between the two. I am partial to Amazon's policy on product warranties and am basically a fan of anything working better, but this is a dead even race when all options are compared.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD9PFP0EXQ5ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRK8IV0#wasThisHelpful","RD9PFP0EXQ5ZY","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Four stars for being durable, but minus one for large turning radius at my location.It might not be fair to the manufacturer since winds are pretty steady where I am. The Fire Shot does fly flat and is surprisingly resistant to wind surges, but I'm thinking that the slow turn might be due to fighting the winds.It's just hard to judge since I'm in the country. I have a 100'x100' area which gives about five seconds of flight in a straight line before needing to turn. I am getting a flight ceiling of about 20' before it starts pitching.The vehicle has been stolen by dogs, flow into large cacti and has been prodded by a three year old. It still works.

"I have a problem reading books dealing with military operations or environments. I have no idea how many books and TV shows I've started only to end up disgusted with the creator's lack of knowledge concerning the tactics, technical language and equipment.Blake Crouch's series largely avoided those pitfalls (either that or he had a heck of an editorial review). And because I was so hooked on the Wayward Pines books, I decided to dabble in the fan fiction.To Steven Konkoly: Thank you for your excellent descriptions of equipment. Your WP books do a great job at showing action and avoid overly technical language and at the same time, you do a great job of getting things right. It doesn't sound forced.To everyone else: This guy can write vivid scenery and events.

"The publisher promises a book which will, undoubtedly with as little bias as possible, present the varied eschatalogical views held within the evangelical church.In this reviewer's experience, it is the multi-view books which have offered the most insightful comparisons and contrasts wherein representative authors are able to make their own cases and respond to their opponents or detractors.The author of ""The 8 Great Debates of Bible Prophecy"" has presented a thinly veiled defense of one eschatological position, namely, Pretribulational Dispensationalism.The arguments presented are not new, but they are presented with a little more style and a lot more accessibility than other attempts. The reader is not left to rifle through pages of materials; the arguments are plainly laid out, in context and with a good deal of explanatory material. Many of the views are decently presented and the author does not shy away from admitting to which view appeals to him the most. I found the honesty of that particular device refreshing.However, there are a number of views that are carelessly addressed, reminding this reviewer of material directly out of Scofield or Chafer, amounting to no more than straw man arguments.The author reminds the reader of the claim that three Church Fathers believed in a literal interpretation of Scripture, resurrecting the assertion that allegory reigned and saw it's eisogetical fullness in Augustine. Although this has been trumpeted for over a century in quite a few Dispensational publications, it is fallacy to restrict this time to a single interpretive method as winning the hearts and minds of the church at large.Some issues, orthodox preterism specifically, are treated to no more than one page, dismissed with the prefatory ""evangelicals in general believe,"" as if that were representative of past or contemporary preterist enthusiasts. RC Sproul is mentioned, as is Gary DeMar. But none of their particular arguments are presented. Only their names are listed as advocates of a position that is untenable for no apparent reason other than the rejection of their interpretation of one word by ""general evangelicals.""Overall, I would not recommend this title to readers looking for an even-handed presentation of Protestant end-times positions. This would be more suitable for a Sunday School class or introductory college class for students who are already dispensational in confession.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR6L6SBHQZ0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736944265#wasThisHelpful","R3BR6L6SBHQZ0S","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Notes on my experience:Setup was a breeze. Google login first, then Kindle. The rest of it, including a system upgrade, is on the user.If you want to feel as challenged as I did know this: the stylus is not the black piece on the left side of the device. And yes, that piece does come out. It just doesn't do anything. The stylus is found on the bottom right corner. And it's cool. It has an eraser! To get the eraser to work, I had to double tap it on the writing pad. When the stylus is removed, a small tutorial comes up. Don't close it. :)Another thing, I count only 11 gbs of storage. So the rest is either eaten up by system files or there really isn't 16 gb available, as promised.I installed my usual suspects of cloud storage (Mega, hubriC, Tesorit, dropbox, otixo, etc.) and was pleased to see that Google Drive, Onebox (Skydrive) and Box were already installed. A bonus HP cloud storage app is on there, but I can't get on, even after resetting the password. All in all, I'm sitting at around 100 gigs of storage through this little device and I'm linked to my desktop (which I don't really even use any more except as a file server).I really do enjoy the forward facing speakers. But they vibrated when I turned the volume to max. I had to back off about half way before the vibrations quit.And hot! This little thing can crank out the heat. About two minutes after booting and setting up, I noticed that the back of the tablet was heating up like an iPad 2. The heat diminished, but don't be surprised during your initial sequence when your leg starts burning.I also like the rubberized feel to the case. Everything except the screen has a ever-so-slight rubberized coating. I'm guessing that this will be a very nice feature when other devices might slide around on the seat next to me when I drive.

"Pros: Superbly written and meticulously researched.Cons: Date and time references could be mentioned more.Having dabbled in the grounds of the military historian, I realize how difficult it is to present the information in an engaging but accurate way. Custer history is in itself particularly difficult.There are so many niche historians who concentrate their efforts on this one man, his career and of course, the Battle of the Little Bighorn, that even what may seem to be a trivial error in research can turn out to be monumental. I am firmly convinced that Thom Hatch should never have fear of being ostracized from that community. If anything, this present title should find a warm welcome across the spectrum of military historians, armchair generals and even out to a very broad audience beyond the realm of history buffs and Bighorn specialists.Style: The writing is fluid. The story is elegantly displayed as Custer goes from civilian life, through training at West Point and enters his place among the Army's superb tacticians of his time. Hatch is able to weave the romantic interests of Custer as it occurs without making them distinct periods; it occurs to me that most biographical exercises tend to compartmentalize the different aspects of the character in question. What the author has produced here is much more informative and develops very nicely.Content: Hatch does not set out to create a dissertation full of footnotes and quotations, instead, he blends the accounts together so that the content is ruled by his writing style.It's probably obvious that I am extremely pleased with Hatch's work. I think Glorious War adds a dimension to Custer that is rarely emphasized and often overshadowed by his defeat in 1876. I went to the effort of double-checking a few of the events and was pleased to find how the author directly addresses controversial points while avoiding taking a reconstructionist view of those trifles. He does not set out to create a new or different understanding, but expressly sets out to capture the pivotal events which demonstrate the bravado, cunning and occasionally even, the tactical errors of George Armstrong Custer.Hatch's work firmly demonstrates the character and drive of Custer.Audience: There are only a handful of titles on my shelves of Custeriana that stand above all others for their ability to weave history, external sources and narrative. Among them are A Terrible Glory, A Controversial Life of George Armstrong Custer andThe Day the World Ended at the Little Bighorn. I think it's fair to include Hatch's work in this group. But beyond this, I believe Thom Hatch's Glorious War will cross over to readers of other genres easily and with great acceptance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T9Z4RAQUO5UX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DA733JK#wasThisHelpful","R2T9Z4RAQUO5UX","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had to stop reading and then go back and add notes to locations where supposed evidence can be found tying the author's father to the Zodiac.The single biggest disappointment is the lack of material concerning the Zodiac. At one point, I had to look back to realize that only two out of 51 chapters at that point had even talked about the Zodiac's actions or behaviors. Everything else is family history and whining about what a horrible childhood the author had. Not quite true, the author does spend a lot of time on racism and anti-gay bigotry in San Francisco, the Manson Family connection, the Zodiac meeting the Queen of England, the Zodiac discovering a plot to assassinate President Ford and many more fascinating departures from the thesis.Not one time is anything of substance offered for the author's father being the killer. The first murder is in Riverside, CA. Well, Van (the author's dad) drove by there once. We think. And then without anything to indicate the dad was there, the author manufactures an entirely fictional what-if scenario that is without any grain of believability. Read it and consider the time it would take to accomplish all those things in one day without ever being seen or questioned.Here's more evidence:Van is an alleged ""expert cryptographer"" yet creates a simple substitution cipher that was cracked in less than two days. The cipher in question ends with ""ebeorietemethhpiti,"" completely unusable and wasted text.Van is an alleged ""expert marksman"" yet was unable to kill five victims immediately. He had to resort to a knife, leaving Mike Mageau, Cecelia Shepard, and Bryan Hartnell alive. Shepard died two days later after her attack. Paul Stine was the only person to die from a single gunshot wound.The author claims to have found the full name of his father written completely, just backwards and without using code in one of the ciphers (""Earl Van Best Junior,"" written backwards in plain sight""). I found my own name (including full middle name without too much effort).The most complete description of the Zodiac killer (20 to 30 years old, sloppily dressed, big stomach, not intelligent with a slight drawl) completely contradicts the author's description of his father (40 years old, immaculate speech with slight British accent, highly intelligent).30 years later, the author asks the detective if he's ready for the media frenzy that will take place when the dad is proven to be the Zodiac. The detective is shocked. He's never thought about that before. Really?More evidence: All the women victims looked similar to one of the dad's ex wives. UPDATE: No other motivation has been given for any of the murders except that less than half of the victims appeared to look like Van's second wife.Even more evidence: The name found in the cipher is mentioned again. However, I found ""Oreo Rocks"" plainly spelled out in the cipher. Does that prove anything?And that's it. That's all the evidence.Not once is there anything mentioned as to why Van used astronomical or nautical symbols or even why he chose the Zodiac moniker.This was a horrible disappointment. I'm getting a refund! UPDATE: Amazon gave me a refund.-----Notes:(The following notes are based on Kindle locations).Location 2029: The first murder. The author's dad is alleged to have traveled three hours toward Mexico then for no particular reason, gets off the freeway, drives 20 miles northeast and finds the library on campus. He spots a girl go into the library and then with no one looking, opens the hood of her car and disables it without being seen. On campus. Then he goes and finds a desk in a room in the library, writes a poem, carves it into the bottom of a desk, then goes back and waits outside the library for the girl to exit. How many hours would this take? This is not a believable series of events. All of this without being seen.2033: The motivation for the murder is that Cheri Jo Bates looked like his ex wife.2117: The Z on the Zodiac letters is actually E and V (the first two initials of the author's father)? And one graphologist says the Z is E and V and would defend that conclusion ""in a court of law"" (see location 4838). UPDATE: Additional marriage documents filled out by Rev. Filger have now surfaced. The hand writing on the Reno marriage certificate is a match for Rev. Filger.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NV2BLMWYQVTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ3AD2I#wasThisHelpful","R2NV2BLMWYQVTK","A3J031UXHGZTWV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J031UXHGZTWV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good field of view. The metal is a good heavy gauge and the mirror clicks nicely out of the way when needed.The steel tube that grips the mirror to the inside of the bar becomes distorted on first installation so if you need to remove it and reinstall it it's a little difficult and you must try to reshape the tube with pliers so it will fit back in the bar for each subsequent installation.

If you look at the reviews of the other chain tools, broken and bent tips (the part that pushes the chain pin) is a very common complaint and has been my experience with other chain tools. Because it is so small and light it is a little difficult to use but the tip is hard enough that it deformed the chain pin slightly and made a sharp edge that cut me.

"I purchased both lamps, the front (white light) and rear (red light). The rear red would a very good rear lamp except the amount of light emitted to each side (of both front and rear lamps) is very close to zero so they are effectively seen only from the front and rear -- not the sides.The front lamp has no conventional lens with which to focus and amplify the light so it spreads a very wide beam when mounted horizontally or a very tall beam when mounted vertically. Essentially, it casts light to places you don't need to see. The front beam casts only to about four or five feet. I have a very inexpensive single-LED lamp (two AA batteries) that has a focusing lens which casts a directed a beam that is a little brighter and casts a few feet longer.The lithium-ion batteries charge with a conventional mini-USB cable. A cable is included but no AC adapter is included.  They require 2 hours to charge. That it is rechargeable is not much advantage. At the highest intensity the batteries last less than two hours. Most modest LED lamps using convention AA or AAA batteries will last in excess of 40 hours or more. On an overnight trip or a bicycle tour a conventional AA powered lamp would be a far better choice.The manual states that ""the battery may become ineffective at about 80% of its value after 300 to 500 charge/discharge cycles ... 5 years life span under good care."" 300 charges sounds closer to 1- to -2 years in my cycling universe. The manual further states that the battery ""loses 1% of its charge per day when stored at room temperature and 5% per day at temps over 104F degrees. Stored battery life decreases 50% at freezing and further degrades as temperatures decrease.""The white front lamp is perhaps better used for other purposes, a dark closet or cupboard, for example. I returned the red lamp but will keep the front lamp for a cupboard. Now that I have it for that other use it will still see some limited use on my bicycle but next time I will make another choice for my cycling needs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V05EDKTO5XKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOWSIOC#wasThisHelpful","R1V05EDKTO5XKI","A3Q8RALYOLC51Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q8RALYOLC51Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, I had used these for decades. If the bike falls on the left side, any mirror is likely to break but I would always replace a broken mirror with this model.There is a thin brass threaded barrel inside the base. That threaded barrel is there to accept the screw. Twice now, on two different mirrors purchased a week apart, that threaded barrel has come out of the base. In theory it could be glued back into the base but the barrel is so thin that it breaks at the slightest pressure of a pliers needed to get the barrel off of the screw, so that it might be glued back into the base. It really should be glued at the factory but recently it seems it is not.By the way, the manufacturer sells replacement parts but asks $4 to ship what could be shipped for the price of two postal stamps. In my case it would cost $10 yet you can buy the entire mirror for $12 so what's the point of offering parts?Update: I grew tired of replacing plastic mirrors every time the bike falls on the side with the mirror so I opted to get a metal motorcycle mirror here: UNIVERSAL BAR END HANDLEBAR MOUNT MIRROR BLACK 6212041. I believe mountain bike handlebars are the same inside dimension as a 7/8 inch motorcycle handlebar (1 inch outside diameter) so most any motorcycle mirror should fit, especially the ones that mount in the bar end as this mirror does.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J3H5IQGC9HPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009R96YK#wasThisHelpful","R1J3H5IQGC9HPR","A3Q8RALYOLC51Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q8RALYOLC51Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Guitar bridge pins come in a few diameters, lengths and tapers so one must do a bit of research before purchasing. The Graph Tech website will tell you the dimensions -- especially the diameter and taper -- of all their pins so you can match what you need.I measured my existing pins' diameter and length with a 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper with Extra Battery and Case (great bargain here on Amazon for only $12, plus you can use this tool to measure nut and bridge spacing, string gauge, all sorts of things). I didn't have a protractor so I eyeballed the taper by drawing a straight line in MS Word and then drawing a second straight line, connected them, and then rotated the second line to 3 degrees. Holding my old pins up against my monitor to compare, I toggled the angled line a few degrees back and forth, plus and minus a few degrees. 3 degrees seemed like a match. Once I installed them they fit and stay in.I knew in advance that these would be shorter than my originals but the length, it seems to me, is the least important measurement, as long as they are within 1/4 inch or 3/8 or so. Diameter and taper seem to me far more important.My original plastic pins were so bad they were bending, distorting, and getting stuck to the point where I needed a small vice-grip to get them out. I thought they would break off inside the bridge and would need to be drilled out. No such worries with these as the material used is strong and the quality is very good.If they improved the sound the improvement was only slight. It makes sense that graphite is probably more resonant than bone, rosewood or ebony pins would be. All things considered, if I didn't have a good reason for replacing the the plastic I probably would have passed on this purchase but I don't regret getting these instead of bone, rosewood or ebony. The quality is very good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OK35KW4Q36QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T7SGDC#wasThisHelpful","R2OK35KW4Q36QD","A3Q8RALYOLC51Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q8RALYOLC51Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author of this book works for Stew-Mac; he knows his stuff and he's an innovator. The best part of this book is that the author has made all the mistakes and so he gives you additional steps for 'just in case' so if you follow his exact instructions (exactly!) you will avoid the pitfalls that you could have never have seen coming. Can you damage the finish by replacing a nut? Yes, it's very, very common and he tells you all the pitfalls and how to avoid them. This book will also tell you if you need to buy a specialized tool for the job at hand or if you can get by with a generic tool. Another big plus is that this is perhaps the only repair/setup book that gets updated periodically as new techniques, tools and innovations are introduced into the craft.Aside from things like truss rod and bridge adjustments on electrics, or saddles and replacing tuning keys, almost everything else requires that you purchase dedicated tools to do each of the jobs right. For example, yes you can shape a nut with a generic file and sandpaper, but to file the slots for the strings you must purchase at set of six graduated files that correspond to the gauge of each of the strings to be used (.10, .13, .17, etc). So if you're planning on doing nuts for your acoustics and electrics, you need close to 24 graduated files; (6 for a light acoustic set and 6 for a medium acoustic set) and the same for electrics (another 6 and 6). There's a little crossover on a few of the gauges and you can 'file wide' on a few but otherwise there's no way around springing for a bunch of slot files. It adds up fast. If you already own a fine woodworking shop and are a very experienced woodworker, you can maybe find alternate ways of doing things but for most of us, a specialized tool will be required. Really. Yes, the author works for the #1 luthier tool supply house and their tools are pricey but it's a niche market and even where there's competition, the prices are mostly the same.And it doesn't stop there with the $$$ for the specialized tools. That's why luthiers and guitar techs get the big bucks; they bought all the very costly tools and have the experience.I bought all the tools and measurement instruments to do the more mundane work on both acoustics and electrics -- up to and including fret leveling and fret polishing, and I estimate I dropped more than $350 on tools alone, not including the materials and parts like nuts, saddles, glues, electrical wire, etc, etc. And then it turned out that my $12 Radio Shack soldering iron wasn't good enough so it was another $100 for a pro soldering iron. Sometimes I wish I had paid a luthier instead. Again, it really adds up fast.The very best and cheapest tools to start with are the nut slot files and assorted measurement instruments like this 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper, an incredible bargain at only $12. What size replacement nut do I need to buy? What are the gauges of the strings that are on this guitar now? What are the string spacings of the nut and saddle? This tool will tell you all that and much more. I end up using this tool fairly often on household projects too, on more things than I ever could have imagined.Mistakes happen so if you're making a new nut or saddle for example, buy two or three to cover your early mistakes; they're cheap and will get used eventually. Before I started working on my best guitars I went around to the pawn shops and bought one $50 acoustic and one $50 electric ($$$ again) to make mistakes on and after quite a few mistakes they eventually ended up being slightly better guitars.Some other reviewers complain that the book is not a good read or not well organized but hey, it's a reference book. Just look in the index for the job at hand and follow along carefully. Others complain that there's not much guidance for the more esoteric guitars but the techniques crossover perfectly. The most popular guitars are used as examples because ... they're the most popular guitars. And this again is why the pros demand the high fees. They have been forced to think long and hard about how to apply their existing skills to every new and esoteric challenge that comes into the shop. And they instill enough trust for you to permit them to do it. Experience is priceless. This distinction is what separates the pros from the amateurs.Overall a great book. You may never use half of it because the tools are so expensive but more knowledge is better than too little.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S5L1VI7KQV7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879309210#wasThisHelpful","R1S5L1VI7KQV7X","A3Q8RALYOLC51Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q8RALYOLC51Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed in these towels initially because they were thinner than what I had hoped for. I was trying to replace a very heavy weight cotton towel that I had used instead of a drainboard for the water dripping off a dish rack. It was an unfair judgement because the towel that I was trying to replace was too thick to be of any use otherwise.These towels are soft and pliable as a dish towel needs to be.

"I did a lot of 'review' research before buying these and have owned them for more than two years. I haven't tried any others. I live in the Sonoran desert so I purchased this model because it claims to perform better in very dry desert climates. I bought 4 or 5 of these in the package that includes a digital hygrometer with each humidifier so I have the pair, humidifier and hygrometer in each of my guitars' cases. These never leak and keep my guitars humidified at between 45 and 55% humidity while the ambient humidity is usually between 10 and 20%, sometimes as low as 5%.The guitar needs to be in its case for this thing to work well and in extreme enviros this is probably true of any case-type humidifier. When the guitar is out of its case, the case must remain closed. Guitar humidity remains fairly stable while in its case; I've gone a few months occasionally without checking and refilling the humidifiers and the humidity then varies between 35 and 55%. The difference is probably the different design and materials of each individual brand and model case. As long as you don't live in a desert you should have zero worries for a few months at a time.There are water-absorbing and retaining gel pellets inside the cavity that increase effectiveness and longevity between fillings. If they run dry one must first fill the humidifier, cap it, and then wait some time so that the gels are re-hydrated. Then open it again to top it off. The fabric mesh succeeds at releasing the moisture slowly. The mfg. recommends distilled water.I like to rotate the humidifier periodically. I'll start with it tucked between the stings, pointed into the sound hole and then move it to the cavity where the neck rests so that the fingerboard gets its share. It really helps to oil the fingerboard occasionally but use a dedicated fingerboard oil from a respected luthier supply house. I recently took repossession of a guitar I gifted away in the 1980s. I had used lemon oil on the fingerboard in the 80s and it was still thick there on the rosewood like an oily paste.I am very satisfied with this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340UHBS3OGHYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018A5R5O#wasThisHelpful","R340UHBS3OGHYE","A3Q8RALYOLC51Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q8RALYOLC51Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To prevent an old surgery site from becoming newly aggravated I wear both knee pads and shin pads all day every day except while sleeping. These knee pads are as good as I have used and are far better in many regards.I only really put these to the test while gardening and for that they might be overkill except, for my purpose, they will last a lifetime. A construction worker who is often on his or her knees might need to replace them more often but it would be worth it for the comfort and grip.The surface that contacts the ground grips very well and is similar to the Vibram-brand sole often featured on hiking boots. Beneath the contact/sole area there is approximately 3/4 inch of gel. The fabric on the outside is very hard and dense (the side that faces the ground) and very soft and flexible on the inside (the side that is exposed to your knee). The contact area is secured to the padding area twice -- with both glue and stitching.It kind of feels like there should be an additional pair of Velcro straps higher up on the pad but the single pair hold the pad well enough to the leg while standing and when kneeling it's never an issue.The Velcro straps are soft and elastic.As soon as I received these I searched the web the manufacturer's website to see what else I might need from them because these are high quality.For anyone who also needs or desires shin pads these Brine Lacrosse Goalie Shin Guard (One Size, Black) are of a similar quality and the best I have tried.Quality still exists in the world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOKLD0UQ6707/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBP7K48#wasThisHelpful","RIOKLD0UQ6707","A3Q8RALYOLC51Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q8RALYOLC51Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clear, durable with easy soap and water clean up.I'd say the only problem with this finish is that the dry times are too optimistic. To sand and reapply after just two hours, as the label suggests, seems optimistic. The label further states, ""After final coat, allow 3 hours before light handling and 24 hours before normal use."" If you should need to wait 24 hours before normal use you probably should need to wait 24 hours before sanding and additional coats. It just makes sense. I wait 24 hours between all coats and have zero problems.Note that this is also available in semi-gloss. The semi-gloss doesn't attract and hold as much dirt so the semi might be a better choice for many applications.

"I used this to repair a broken plastic furniture castor. It needed to withstand at least 50lbs so I felt I needed to apply it somewhat thick to bolster the structural strength.Printed on the package are the 4 instruction steps: Prepare, Mix, Apply, Dry. There is an asterisk following step 4 that states you should wash the parts in detergent and file or sand the surfaces. I missed that asterisk on my first try. The instructions say it cures in one hour above 40F degrees so I let it cure for 5 hours at 75F because I had applied it somewhat thick. After 5 hours it fell right apart under weight. Partially my fault for not sanding/filing but the epoxy still hadn't hardened after 5 hours. The product I received dried completely clear and transparent.Tip: Score the surfaces with an Xacto knife. This should absolutely be step one. If you are repairing broken plastic, sandpaper will not likely reach all of the uneven, broken surfaces to be joined and a file would deform them, ruining the shape of the seam to be joined.On my second try I used the Xacto knife to deeply score the surfaces. I really recommend doing this as it gives much more surface area to adhere. I then scrubbed the parts with detergent and splashed them with 91% alcohol. This time I allowed it to cure over 48 hours and so far it's holding.My advise is score the surfaces well and let it cure as long as you possibly can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGR26A8J1MSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EU5ZMK#wasThisHelpful","R3HGR26A8J1MSV","A3Q8RALYOLC51Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q8RALYOLC51Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cycle daily so I ordered one of these in just about every color except red more than a year ago. The only color I didn't care for is chocolate; all the other colors looked great.I sweat a ton from the brow and so used to wear one bandana folded and tied as a headband and a second bandana draped and tied like a skullcap. This is a serious issue with me; that's what was required to keep the sweat out of my eyes.This cap absorbs almost as much sweat as I can produce. I still carry a single bandana as a backup for the hottest days/hardest workouts but the absorption of this cap is probably more than most people would need. I have machine washed and dried one or two of these hats by accident a few times and they held up but I would not recommend it consistently.I was lucky, the cap fits me perfectly. I can wear 7 1/4 or 7 3/8 depending on the hat.Most all of these hats ended up having loose threads here and there but I just burned them back with a lighter to prevent them from pulling any further except, even still, on just one hat, the brim began to separate within a few weeks. The brims are plastic underneath the cotton. Aside from that the construction and materials are high quality.I can position/spin this hat on my brow in any direction as the sun changes including all the way to the rear and out of the way.

"The scope itself is quite nice, though it would be better if there was some sort of gap so you could attempt to remove the offending particles while they are well-illuminated and magnified.  The swabs and solution worked well on the minimal bits that remained on the sensor after the vacuum failed miserably and I resorted to holding the camera sensor down and using my manual rocket blower.  I like the scope itself, but the vacuum is inadequate and mine came with a busted LED headlight.  As a kit, I don't think it is worth the money for the scope, swabs, solution and what is basically a miniature lens pen to ""polish"" the sensor all in a tidy case.

"The build, materials, and quality plus the included little box made these seem ideal.  I was looking for plugs/filters to reduce sound slightly but not isolate me.

I'm glad this is not rubberized, but some texture would increase confidence in gripping, aiming, and deploying.  I hope I never have to use this, and I am glad the manufacturer offers safety classes to improve self-protection efficacy.

"These are really great cacao nibs.  I have tried a few other brands and couldn't understand why anyone would choose nibs to snack on.The other brands tasted weak, a little stale, and so very crunchy.The Viva Labs Organic Cacao Nibs:  smooth but strong flavor and while they have that crunch and satisfying snap, they also give you a wee bit of that ""teeth sinking into tasty, tasty chocolate"" sensation which, for me, makes a big difference.  Cacao nibs will never satisfy the cravings of those of us who like a good milk or bittersweet chocolate, but it can temporarily tame them, it seems.The value is substantial, compared to our local health food shops (we do not have Whole Foods around here), especially considering how fresh they are.  I am looking forward to attempting making my own chocolate bars with these, though I may need another bag as my family has been grazing on this bag (with even some well known, national brands the nibs just got grosser and more stale as nobody wanted to eat them.

"C2O is not the first coconut water we have tried.  I've tried most of the typical natural-foods store refrigerator case brands (VitaCoco, Zico, O.N.E., etc) and I honestly concluded that I just don't like coconut water and would never choose to drink it with other options around.  This was confirmed when I purchased a couple of young Thai coconuts.  I found the liquids to be odd tasting, like something at the start of going bad rather than something fresh and vibrant.  Just not my thing.I continued to buy those brands, thinking they were an easier alternative to opening coconuts, when I needed liquid to add to my famous (in my own mind) raw coconut macaroons.  I always try to add a liquid with some nutritional value, even if it is mostly vitamins, electrolytes, yadda yadda yadda.  The other flavors in the macaroons eclipsed any weird taste of the coconut water, and all was good.Then I tried C2O and while I'm not going to be drinking coconut water daily, it is such an improvement over all of the other brands.  The flavor is fresh and sweet and pretty good when served fresh from the fridge.  As a type 1 diabetic, I did not the carb counts and I usually choose carb/calorie free fluids.  I will, though, reach for one of these next time I am feeling dehydrated, and I will use this as the base for my electrolyte ""cocktail"" I make for my family when we are ill.  As far as my macaroons, I would rather use this and have the flavor enhanced by all of the ingredients rather than feeling like I have to cover up anything, even in the slightest bit.I did take a star off as I'm not a fan of the packaging.  I prefer, even for this size, a resealable container especially when a product has more than one serving per container.  Also, a search revealed that these cans are, according to bloggers who contacted the company, BPA free.  I typically avoid goods in metal cans for that reason, but it's good to know that I don't have to compromise on this product.  I will, though, purchase their resealable tetra-paks the next go around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ATAFCJEUZQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM9HN0#wasThisHelpful","R13ATAFCJEUZQ5","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried three different palettes of the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Eye Shadow.  The formulas are gentle, even for my very sensitive skin and reactive, allergic eyes.These are definitely shadows that work better for a ""natural"" or daytime look than a night out, but the effect really is quite lovely.These would probably be a poor choice for someone who prefers more exotic and louder eye makeup, but a good match for those who would like their eyes, rather than their makeup, to be the first thing people notice.  The colors are very neutral and not saturated.  On application, they remind me of a dry wash or tint.  At first I was concerned that the colors were disappearing into my skin, but once I had on all four colors, in the prescribed locations, the look was quite lovely (albeit neutral and not dramatic).My favorite palette is the ""cool plum"", which really brightened my eyes (along with some mascara).  My skin is very pale, very pink/ruddy, and my lashes and hair are dark blond (lashes bordering on black), and my eyes are grey (with a dark grey ring).  The other colors didn't work as well, as far as accentuating my eyes, but I would guess that others with different skin and eye tones/colors may find the other palettes to be more complimentary for them.As far as ""long wear"", I found these had faded quite a bit at around the 4 hour mark, though the darker accents in the crease and along the last line, were still visible they were not so fresh looking.  Sleeping in them for 8 hours found some dust and smudge on my lower lids, and little left on the top lids.

"I replaced a long since burned out CF globe bulb in my bathroom vanity with the Kobi K8L1 rather than another CF bulb (we have a few in our supply closet), just to compare and test it out with the other two bulbs in the 3-bulb fixture (one CF, one GE reveal C).The Kobi is instant on.  The moment you switch it on, it is nice and bright.  The moment I switch the CF bulbs on, they need to ""warm up"" to full light, which can take as long as a thorough handwashing or brushing my teeth.  It's annoying having to change my ""routine"" because of the technology in the lightbulbs. Plus, I can hear the CF bulbs when they are on (yes, I have wicked sensitive, hyper-hearing).I really like that this provides a consistent light throughout the whole bulb, the way the old white incandescent bulbs used to.  The CF bulbs I have don't offer that, and you can see the curly CF bulb inside the glass globe, which detracts from the overall appearance of the room and the light fixture itself.The Kobi light is bright and warm and perfect for my vanity.  The light isn't overly warm, or artificially warm.  It's just right.  I find it better for makeup application than the GE Reveal, as the Reveal is a smidge too blue and this is a better match for my makeup and the environment.It has a warranty, which definitely provides some comfort in trying out this brand which I had never heard of before.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GK8JTRDIVTJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDOI2U8#wasThisHelpful","R3GK8JTRDIVTJK","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first pair of Bose headphones.There is no going back.I may not be an audiophile, but I do have have auditory processing challenges, my hearing is very sharp (I went blind from cataracts at age 20 and my ears super-compensated to help me navigate a new city in the months before  surgery), and I have hyperacusis.  My kid has ears that are even more finely tuned than mine and he wears isolating ear muffs to deal with sensory overwhelm but I had not found a workable, comfortable solution until now, and I needed one as even the sound of our dishwasher and clothes dryer were increasing my fatigue substantially,The QuietComfort 25 provides a much needed buffer between me and the world, while I am still present and interacting fully.I wear these without the audio cable attached, and noise canceling powered on.The first day, I wore them on a moderately busy street while waiting for a bus (during daylight, in a safe environment) and instead of feeling my body gradually tighten up from the cumulative sounds of cars, motors, air conditioning units, the buzz of the power lines, the shrill squawk of crows overhead I only heard the teenagers laughing as they jogged by, the birds tweeting at eachother, and a gentle, wavelike roll of automobile wheels as they passed me.I have not felt calm, like this, since I was a little kid, exploring the woods around out home, alone, in an environment without crisscrossing power lines, a/c, cell phones, fluorescent bulbs, etc...  These filter, but do not isolate.For me, these are a miracle.  I do not like listening to music via headphones because I am usually the only responsible adult here and my hypersensitivity to most sensory input means I never even sleep deeply, so escaping into music and not hearing something or someone is scary to me.  If I need to listen to something, I'll either listen over Bluetooth speakers or a pair of Audio-Technica open style studio headphones.  Audio Technica ATH-AD700X Audiophile Headphones.That being said, music sounds rich and wonderful, vivid, textured, nuanced.My only issue, with these, is the earcups padding is soft and comfortable but so sweaty after wearing for a relatively short time.  A cooler material may have not offered the same seal, but I would be willing to forego a wee bit of enclosure for a less sweaty, longer distance wear.For now, I'm just enjoying the silence  (and the sweet sounds of the world which filter, gently, through).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIW0MGXS87JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1NEUA0#wasThisHelpful","RLIW0MGXS87JH","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I learn better this way, as does my son (we have Asperger's).  This book was a great match and definitely sparked my interest, rapidly and fairly easily taught me a whole pile of new skills, and ignited a hunger for more.This is a good match for older kids and adults with an interest in Minecraft.I'm off to see what else I can learn from this series and Andy Hunt,","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSG8AI8BNGTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937785785#wasThisHelpful","R2YSG8AI8BNGTI","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It removed leftover Dyson Zorb Carpet Maintenance Powder, 26.5 oz. from a wall-to-wall carpet which had been vacuumed a few times since using the Zorb, with both my Dyson compact ball upright and a Panasonic upright.  There is a dial on the cleaning head, to adjust the brush roll based on flooring type and carpet depth.  I think that, plus the substantial suction are a good combo.I prefer the extension hose and tools on my Dyson, as this a Eureka does not seem to hold them as well on the body of the machine, for storage,  this machine requires two hands to activate the handheld feature/assemble the attachments and then turn the selector dial.I am very satisfied with this vac, overall.  Though, with my arthritis and back issues, it's a bit too much machine for me to use frequently.

"Cea Sunrise Person takes us on the journey through her unique (for most of us, in modern times) childhood and the personalities and relationships she meets along the way.The ride feels almost as though it is over too soon, as her writing style has a comfort and ease to it that lets her story wind its way through the wilderness and back again.  Her storytelling, in North of Normal, is linear, which only makes the story that much easier to get sucked into (I had to set a timer, or else I would have read it all in one go).Her voice, as a child, is authentic.  She doesn't stop to reflect on her experiences, along the way, from her perspective as an adult retelling her memories, but rather reflects on them, very occasionally, as they occurred to her at the time, as a child, embedded smoothly in the story.  Her story reads as though we are walking paths and around lakes and riding stick horses right along with her, at the same age.  She really has a writing style that is immersive for the reader.Cea's story is relatable, not only for the other souls who were raised in similar circumstances, but also, perhaps, for people raised adjacent to (it's hard to say ""by"" for the most extreme cases) self-involved parents.  Her relationship with her mother reminds me a bit of Stockholm Syndrome (which seems to be the parenting philosophy of many disordered narcissistic parents and generally self-involved parents, whether they are just not ready for parenthood or just not ready for it even though they planned it).I really enjoyed her tale, and toward the end, she does step over some larger gaps in time, which perhaps were not crucial to moving the story forward, but considering the pacing and style of the rest of the memoir, that sudden shift in the passage of time is a bit jarring and feels a bit like girl-Cea has been grabbed away from us too soon.

"The quick version:-It's a chunky, squishy case-It makes your iPad Air look like a toy-It is super-snug and secure-The included screen protector film is a major PITA.-Possibly good for kids in dry, clean conditions (this is rugged for reasonable impact, not for exposure to dirt, sand, water, etc)-Heavy (better grip for arthritic hands, but overall heft negates benefit).-The red is vivid and saturated and quite a wonderful red.-Meets military-grade MIL-STF-810G standardsMy suggestions: If you need the loud, chunky, rubbery case than this may be the case for you.  If you are looking for a solid, sturdy case but want to preserve some of the iPad Air aesthetic, in a lighter weight body, you might want to take a look at this case, which offers the same military-grade standard:  Logitech Big Bang Impact Protective Thin and Light Case for iPad Air, Forged Graphite (939-001042)The longer thoughts:  I'm just not crazy about the aesthetics.  The Black Belt 2nd Degree Rugged Case makes the iPad Air look like a toy, which for some applications may be perfect.  If my kid still had trouble holding onto things and I thought he should be using my swanky new iPad Air regularly,  I would consider a cushiony, rubbery, chunky case like this.For that purpose, it seems to work just fine.I like the options provided by the build in easel/stand, but in practice I never use them and I would prefer a softer material encasing the back.The extra thick frame is easier to hold for my arthritic hands, but the case is so notably heavy that it bugs the rest of my achy body instead.  For a child, I don't think that would be an issue, but as a more ergonomic, arthritis friendly grip I find the trade off with heavy weight isn't worth it, but that's me and YMMV.The screen protector is the kind which requires epic effort to smooth out all of the bubbles with a credit card or business card.  It is annoying and I applied it before snapping it into the case.  When I snapped it into the case, the edges popped up.  Now, a month later, it seems like just a couple of spots of the protector are still clinging to the screen.  It looks crappy and I much prefer one of the bubble-free solutions for screen protection, though I am unsure if those will fit without peeling up, due to the precise snugness of the Black Belt 2nd Degree's snap-in frame.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FPQBAPYVTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HY5IOKM#wasThisHelpful","R22FPQBAPYVTV","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Streamlined, protective, very thin case does what the perfect case should, ideally, do.It disappears.Sure, it's there.  Anyone can see that our iPad Air is in some sort of case and not just naked and exposed.It's in using it, daily, where it disappears.The shell (and the impact absorbing insert) is thin and light enough that it doesn't bloat the device and it is thin and light enough that I forgot it was there.  All functions are readily available and do not require additional effort to access them, while the iPad Air is snapped into the case.I have had other iPads and cases and shells etc but most of them add enough weight that it feels like a let-down having to hide the beauty of the bare iPad and those cases always popped into my conscience when my arms grew tired and achy after holding my iPad up for any length of time.This is thin and light enough that it is unobtrusive and the handy magnetic front cover folds so that the overall weight of device and shell become moot points as you can watch a movie handsfree or type with greater ease, depending on the setting/angle chosen.The one thing I am not over the moon about is the texture of the cover.  I find the exterior to be grippy, and helpful when carrying only my iPad, in this case, for any length of time.  I think the look is more rugged and of utility than one which would compliment the iPad Air in the same fashion as the rest of the Big Bang Case does.Overall, we are happy with this case and it is the first one which has stayed on any of our iPads, as it is so unobtrusive (especially compared to the parade of previous cases, since discarded).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FEXLD8KLAHS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZM7TKI#wasThisHelpful","R1FEXLD8KLAHS9","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The two stars are because it works and it seems to have a fairly sturdy build, and it is very squat, so unlikely to tip over easily.My recommendation:  for the price, this vac doesn't offer anything special compared with similar vacs, plus you need to add on approximately $22 for a filter to be able to use it as a ""wet"" capable machine and the disposable filter vacuum bags (which are optional, but an option I like for certain pick-up jobs) are priced, for one bag, the same as a three pack for others.

"We replaced an old HP  Photosmart C7200 with the Epson WorkForce WF-3620.Generally, I am pleased with our decision, as once the WF-3620 was up and running it did all of the things that old HP promised to do, but either never did well (scanning wirelessly) or just refused to do (it had a duplexer but choked at the mention of ""double sided"").It is quite a novelty to print something from one of our iPads, my laptop, or the family desktop and have it print perfectly the first time around, without having to move the heavy machine and take parts out to unjam little, crimped bits of paper.So far, I am finding, for printing from a device, the Epson WorkForce 3620 is what I have always wanted a printer to be.  Once it was set up, I didn't have to think about it because it just worked and aside from one issue, it did so without protest.We no longer fax, so I will not be using or reviewing that particular feature.Scanning and copying from the platen glass works well.Scanning and copying from the ADF?  It may just be my particular machine, but after feeding the machine a pile of papers once, it started jamming every time I used the ADF. I emailed Epson (seriously, don't bother, it was like playing ""Who's On First"" but with printer features).  I called their US support number and after an extremely long hold time, I did get a very helpful human named Markus, who walked me through some trouble shooting steps before determining that the best action would be to replace the machine.  They are shipping me a replacement along with a label to send the faulty machine back.  They said I should see the replacement within a few days and then I will return the broken one.  They do take a credit card number in case you do not return the defective machine, but it is just a hold and does not get processed as long as they get the machine back.Is this ideal? Of course not.However, I am fairly happy with the smooth operations this ""all in one"" provides otherwise, so I'm hoping that a fully-working machine will elevate this model printer into the realm of reliable workhorse, which would be a dream (a weird dream, but I have had my share of lemon printers at home and at work).The thing I find awkward about this is the combination of touch screen and arrows when choosing features on the (very clear and brightly lit) screen.  It's mostly touch screen, and has graphics for arrows up and down which you'd think you could tap to scroll, but they want you to use the physical arrow pads next to the screen to do so.  It's not a huge deal, it just seems a little awkward and less fluid than it should, ideally, be.  I tend to have difficulty with touch screens recognizing my input, but I haven't had an issue with this particular screen.  I do think the menus for administrative and network related features could be a bit more intuitive and straight forward.  Once set up, I found I rarely needed to access them, but when I did there was quite a bit of backing up and pressing the home button to ""guess"" where the selection could be in the menu.Setup was somewhat of a PITA as I do not have a CD/DVD-ROM drive on my laptop.  I found the appropriate software and drivers on the Epson site and connected everything and it works nicely.  I did find that certain features (like Epson Connect, which allows you to print and scan using other services) aren't just available but they require a little legwork to sign up and get them running.  This isn't a problem for me, but it could be more interconnected with other necessary setup processes (like offering a link to Epson Connect during registration, and not having separate registration procedures for each service) to make it much more end-user friendly.Since setup I am pretty content (other than that darn ADF issue which is being resolved).  Even without ADF functioning, the WF-3620 still actually does most of the tasks the HP C7200 promised to do but never actually did reliably.The PrecisionCore feature is not something I was in the market for or even particularly care about, but so far the ""starter"" cartridges which the printer came with have printed more than any other new printer I have had and they still have plenty of juice in them.I compared the specs, side by side, and for printing higher quality photographic prints (on specialty paper), I will continue to use my Canon and HP inkjets, but for everyday, household and home office tasks, the Epson is my top choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BQHRJ4XWZEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGF06#wasThisHelpful","R21BQHRJ4XWZEW","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I use these SSD as external drives by popping them into an appropriate enclosure.I have been using these:  Tool Free Screw-Less ORICO 2588US3 USB 3.0 2.5-inch SATA External Hard Drive Enclosure Adapter Case for HDD SSD SATA Drive - Black  and it works like any external HDD, though with the speed and finesse of an SSD.  On occasion I use them with a Lightning adapter (powered).For a couple of weeks, I swapped my Samsung with the OCZ Vector 150 to see if I noticed any difference.  I used them both with USB 3.0 adapters as well as a Seagate Lightning adapter.  I will disclaim that I do not know if these are geared for Lightning use (again, I'm not that brand of nerd), but for occasional large file transfer, I didn't find any issue at all.The only marked difference, for me, was when I'd jump from processing (in Lightroom) my RAW files from one year, to an earlier year.There was some lag in moving from mostly consecutively created (dates) and named adjacent files to ones which were outside of that ""comfort zone"" and more random.However, I typically work on files as I load them in from my camera/SD card (into Lightroom and the files onto my SSD), and the lag was more of a pause and nothing detrimental to my workflow or focus.-I do like that the OCZ has a 5 year warranty, whereas the Samsung has a 3 year warranty.-The OCZ does come with a 3.5"" bracket, if needed.  Samsung also offers one and their drive with the bracket is called a ""kit"".-If you compare the pricing of the OCZ and the Samsung KIT, the prices are even more comparable.Otherwise, the two drives seem comparable to me and the deciding factor, for me, is price, especially because I don't need the 3.5"" bracket for my use.I will continue to use my OCZ drive for daily workflow and I will post back if anything changes or if I need to contact OCZ for everything, but so far I have integrated it into my workflow.I will install my other SSD drive as an internal SSD in our MacMini to boost the speed a bit, but so far I'm satisfied with the OCZ Vector 150 and don't see any need in transferring all of my files back to the Samsung for my daily work as OCZ is working just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1MQFWOSQV8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4E2J32#wasThisHelpful","R2V1MQFWOSQV8M","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It charges our Lightning devices, in our car, without hassle.  A charger with interchangeable cords to accommodate different devices might be a better option, if you have devices with different plug types.  The cord is coiled and our 2014 Kia Soul has a little bin below the two lighter/power sockets in the lower dash area, and the coil is the perfect length for charging the phone as it sits in that bin.  The cord could be longer, as I keep my iPad on the seat or on the seat and in my bag, and it's a little too short and tightly wound to reach the rear of my front passenger seat.  Also a longer cord may be a better feature, not so you can use your phone while driving and while it is charging, but so that when you are parked or waiting for someone that ability would be a plus.  It works well, doesn't stand out as it blends with the dark interior of our car.  I also like that it has a 1 year limited warranty.

"I am a big fan of CeraVe products and regularly use the lotion, cleanser, and cream for my face, and the foaming cleanser in the shower as a body wash.  My skin is finally looking the way I want it to.I was thrilled to see CeraVe's new Baby Lotion, as the ingredients were similar to their regular lotion but without the paraben preservatives.  I thought that would make this a good match for my skin and my son's as well.I wish they made the Baby Lotion without adding Dimethicone 1%.  I know it's a skin protectant and works for some folks, but for me, at 1%,  it triggers an attack of contact dermatitis (blisters, itching, redness, cracking skin) on my hands and a much milder itching everywhere else.  If I did not have this issue, or if CeraVe had left out the dimethicone or used a lower amount of dimethicone, as they do in their other products (Dimethicone must, according to FDA rules, be labeled as an Active Ingredient once it hits 1%, lower than that it is just a regular ingredient and doesn't require the expanded monograph on the label), this would be my first pick for my son's sensitive skin as the rest of the CeraVe line has done wonders for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYM5CF6TZB2O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF3RYPM#wasThisHelpful","RYM5CF6TZB2O1","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pencil by FiftyThree is both an ordinary stylus and an enhanced one, depending on what application you are using.If you use the Paper by FiftyThree app, with the stylus, you are in for a treat.  It is intuitive and precise and an absolute joy.  More than once, my disbelief was thoroughly suspended, and I felt like I was making organic, tactile art rather than creating art digitally, without ever opening a tube of paint or a jar of ink.  It was a fantastic feeling and so relaxing because I really did not, for once, think ""I'm using a stylus"", as it does, within the Paper app, work so intuitively like a non-digital pen, brush, eraser, pencil.Set up was easy after I charged the battery with one of my MacBook's USB ports.  Connection was fairly straight forward and I like that whenever I pickup Pencil, it just works for me.  I have other devices (cameras, another stylus, printers, etc) that are hit or miss whether they will connect with my iPad mini.  Pencil seems much more reliable and I wish other manufacturers would catch on to make device integration as smooth and easy, so those of us who use such devices could get back to working and creating with them.I do wish there was a way to get the functionality, within the Paper app, to crossover to other apps (all apps!) as I think I would only put it down to recharge.The hand feel is fantastic.  The shape is like a carpenter's pencil, which is much easier for me to hold and create with than a regular, round barrel, due to arthritis in my hands.  The materials are lovely.  I have developed sensitivity to many rubberized coatings on other products, so I was thrilled that the Pencil only has anything rubbery on the tip, but the part that is in your hand is brushed aluminum which doesn't cause any issues for me at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BMFL9I6353IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP12170#wasThisHelpful","R2BMFL9I6353IM","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been curious about Maca for some time, but never got around to trying it.This gelatinized incarnation tastes good, though I have nothing with which to compare it.The pros- mild taste, incorporates easily into smoothiesThe cons- a little concern about the CalProp 65 warnings & the (within legal limits) lead contentI was concerned about adding these to my smoothies as some of the powdered ingredients I augment my usual fruit, yogurt, chia, and hempseed with tend to cake onto the side of the blender cup.  Of course I can scrape it down but when you are rushing out of the house for an appointment, trying to listen to two other people at once, and trying to remember what you are supposed to cover at the appointment, it gets a bit chaotic and I'd really like to just blend the smoothie, throw on the travel lid, and run out the door without paying my breakfast any more attention.I do not know if people consume this powder just mixed with water.  I figured I'd test it out anyway.  When mixed with cold (refrigerated) water, it didn't dissolve so well and left big floating clumps (even after thorough, vigorous stirring) that left me grimacing and taking it that way is not likely to become routine, or a habit.  I mixed the same amounts but this time used hot tap water and with a little vigorous stirring, the Maca dissolved into the water almost completely.  The mouth feel was smooth, grit free, and slightly soft - like drinking a cup of hot water with gelatin mixed in, but more like tea than mud, as it was with the cold water.  The taste isn't bad, with just the hot water, but I can't see myself seeking a hot cuppa Maca regularly.This gelatinized preparation does not leave any grit or clinging on bits on the blender cup and while there is a flavor and scent to it, they are not unpleasant.  I probably wouldn't choose to eat this without a smoothie to mask it, but the fragrance is slightly sweet and oddly reminds me of a not-to-sweet bran muffin. The flavor is slightly sweet at first, and then a bit more ""earthy"" (but not flat out dirt-earthy, tolerable and even pleasant, by itself but fantastic blended with other whole, fresh foods).I was, and still am, a bit concerned about the CalProp 65 notice on the label.  I went to the Gaia Herbs website and they have a pile of information in their FAQ section.  I suggest everyone go to the site and read it, to decide if this is acceptable to them.  For me, I'm on the fence.  As the amounts are well-within FDA limits, I think I may use this jar and decide if the benefits and results outweigh the lead contamination (usually from runoff and contaminated water from mining in Peru).I would be more concerned about this if my son would be sharing smoothies with me, but as Maca hasn't been explored enough in kids, I would likely pour off his smoothie portion, sans Maca, and then add Maca and blend some more for my portion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SVKVJ97GQFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZAIB6Y#wasThisHelpful","R6SVKVJ97GQFN","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not been using any heated tools on my hair for a very long time due to my schedule and pesky arthritis.Recently, I tested out a set curlers and was very pleased with the extra bounce they gave my very thick, very heavy, long hair. I did, though, want a bit more active control as I've always found curlers, especially the little clamshell ones I recently purchased, to have less of an intuitive feel and the results can be a bit choppy and require additional tools to make one look truly put together.I tried the Revlon Rose Gold Professional Curling Iron and was impressed with the amount of heat settings and the swivel cord, but having nothing but my middle school adventures with the crimping and curling irons of the 1980's to compare it to, I kept an open mind and set to work.I am happy with the Rose Gold Professional.  It didn't snag my hair and my hair released from the barrel as though it was non-stick.  The iron heats up wicked fast.  1"" is perfect for me and my thick hair.  It gives me enough lift at the roots and takes my natural waves and slight curl, to a less motley and more consistent and polished look.  If I focus on a tiny bit of hair, and hold the iron perpendicular to the floor, I can get the boingy curls going but that would take forever (with my copious hair) and for boingy I'd probably go with the rollers and use this to fix any stubborn pieces afterward.  The barrel and the clip, without wrapping, also made my bangs clean up beautifully.I won't use heat on my hair on a daily, or even weekly basis.I will happily bust out this curling iron for special occasions and professional events requiring a more polished look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2THE1Z6WCX967/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMJ6E5A#wasThisHelpful","R2THE1Z6WCX967","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping to use this on a sofa bed that is intended for my living room, and that I have slept on (rather uncomfortably), but the arrival has been delayed.But I just couldn't wait.I broke my foot a few months ago and it hurts even when resting on my relatively plush (euro top) mattress, I also have autoimmune arthritis and end stage arthritis in my spine.  I'm one achy lady.I needed relief and a solid, healing night of sleep.  Desperately.So we unpackaged this sofa bed mattress.  It came packaged in a very tall, narrow box and it was heavy.  The mattress was wrapped in plastic and compressed before being rolled up tight, fastened, and boxed.  Unwrapping it was a challenge but I enlisted the help of my resident kid and we handled it no time flat.  I've had other mattresses and pads with memory foam and I was expecting a chemical odor when we unwrapped this, but it was very mild and faded quickly.So, without a sofabed, we hoisted it onto my mattress.  My mattress is rather high to begin with, and the added inches do make fitted sheets an extra challenge, but I wasn't going for a design award, just some sleep.The cover is very nice and soft.  It feels like jersey knit cotton, or bamboo jersey knit, but quilted.  It zips off, for cleaning, leaving just the underside in place, so you don't have to wrestle with the heavy mattress before or after cleaning the cover. I put a mattress protector over the whole thing and then my sheets and I climbed on in.I've had memory foam mattresses and mattress pads before, but the 4.5"" of sinking in really makes a huge difference, at least it did for me, when coping with a broken foot and cranky joints.  I don't know that I'd like that depth for non-sleep activities, as it can be a challenge moving around, but for resting and snoozing, it works well for me.At this rate, I might keep this one on my bed and pick up another one for the sofa bed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R366UYVWUI1QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNFAFY8#wasThisHelpful","R366UYVWUI1QA","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tracy Fullerton's third edition of Game Design Workshop is not light, casual reading.  Other reviewers have described it as a textbook, and it does have some of the makings of an academic tome (namely some of the language and the sheer concentration of information wedged between the covers), however the title says it perfectly: this is a workshop.I think the best way to approach this volume is to read it and tackle the examples and actively workshop an idea rather than attempting to learn all of the steps needed to take an idea all the way through to production.I am not a game designer, nor do I have aspirations of becoming one (or any of the other roles involved in producing a game).  My son is into this stuff and often bounces ideas off of me.  I thought Game Design Workshop would provide the guidance and resources so I can tutor him and guide him through fleshing out his ideas.

"L'Occitan, upon initial spray, smells very fresh and it is heavily fresh (not dried) lavender for a few moments until it meets your skin.At that moment, the lavender smells less like a sachet or soap and definitely more of a soapy, fresh, and very slightly rosemary, minty without being pepperminty.  It's like the coolness of wintergreen without the medicinal smell.After wearing it for awhile,  as you go about your day, the soapy freshness fades and leaves behind the fragrance of warm wood and a little hint of cool air.  It reminds me of being near the beach, with a fire going, on a brisk afternoon, with a good, old book.I like that this is the sort of fragrance that needs the warmth of skin and physical closeness to really enjoy.I would love this on a man, but it can work just as well on a woman (and as a fragrance for one's home.

"As I am raising a child with developmental delays, including gross motor skill challenges, I am a fan of the Oball, Rhino Toys Oball Original (Colors May Vary).  However, my kid is growing up fast and when we were ready to introduce some playtime focused on more traditional sports and to develop the skills needed to participate, we found he had outgrown his Oball, at least as far as playground sports go.The Nerf Bash Ball is a good alternative, especially for older kids with larger hands.  I'm not thrilled by the name and the packaging brought me back to some ugly rounds of dodgeball when I was a kid (with the same developmental disorder as my child).  The ball itself, is a bit easier to catch and throw thanks to the built in handles/holes all around the ball.  It definitely is encouraging and motivating for a child to pick up a ball and focus on the throwing action instead of only being able to hyperfocus on the challenges they have holding the ball and getting ready to throw.  I like that this ball allows him to develop a wider array of skills, but of course we will still work with the other skills and regular balls, but woohoo!  What a joy to see your kid light up because they threw the ball with all of their might and it went somewhere, or you tossed it to them and they caught it.  It's wonderful.It's also Nerf, so my kid is less likely to run away from the ball and knowing he can catch it has given him more confidence which is definitely a necessary skill when venturing onto the playground.  The other kids just see it as another Nerf ball.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9C1KAI7CFGNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECV5KSU#wasThisHelpful","R9C1KAI7CFGNT","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Those little hulls are sneaky and can be as painful as a bad tooth in need of a root canal.The nice thing about Kernel Season's popping corn is that although I can see some hulls, they seem to break apart easily with regular chewing and I have been through 2 16oz bags so far and I haven't had one dental drama.I am more of a fan of white corn popcorn, but from now on I'm retiring our usual white corn for Kernel Season's as I can actually eat it and not hurt.  Which is a pretty nice feature.  Of course, your mileage may vary.  I cannot say this is safe for dental work, as I am not a dentist.

"I purchased a Raspberry Pi for my son when they first available for delivery in the United States.He is 10 and very adept and adaptable when it comes to computers, electronics, programming, etc...I am nearing 40, a happy Mac user, and an artist.  I am a scientific thinker, autodidact, pretty good with my hands and adept with tactile & spatial problem solving but when it comes to electronics and programming, once it heads out of the tactile, I'm pretty lost. When it comes to learning, I tend to be hands on and very visual, but rapidly lose knowledge gained without any sort of physical motion.Once I set my kid up with the parts needed to get his Raspberry Pi up and running, he pretty much taught himself the basics of it, some Python, and started playing with Scratch.Then he wanted me to set up WiFi for the Raspberry Pi.HA!Glad the kid still has faith in this relative luddite.Thankfully, Teach Yourself VISUALLY published this guide.It is clear, concise, and will have anyone, with pretty much any level of experience, up and running on the Raspberry Pi within the first couple of chapters.  It also provides step by step tutorials on some advanced concepts, and quite a bit of the book it dedicated to programming and changing code to make the Raspberry Pi do what you may want it to do.  There is a whole chapter on using Scratch, which is a pretty fantastic platform for learning programming for any age (it is from MIT's Lifelong Kindergarten).  There are also a few projects to try which provide a nice segue into the world of electronics and practical use of the Raspberry Pi.With this book on hand I finally feel like we can tackle some of the concepts in this book as a team (including getting Raspberry Pi hooked up to our network) and perhaps put both of our strengths to work on a project, together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OBJVT1ZAMZHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118768191#wasThisHelpful","R1OBJVT1ZAMZHT","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After putting the Able Life Universal Stand Assist together, I was thrilled with how sturdy it felt and I couldn't wait to install and adjust it on my favorite chair so I could employ my upper body to help lift me out of the chair and take some of the stress off my broken foot and aching knees (from all of my joints trying to compensate for the big ortho boot I had been wearing for weeks).First off, the description states:Stand safely from any couch, chair, or reclinerDual support cushion handles makes standing easyUniversal fit: on top of, or between chair cushionsFully adjustable in height and depthThe only part of those traits I found to be true are the dual support cushion handles.  Yes, it has cushioned handles.It does not fit any couch, chair, or recliner partly because it only has limited adjustment on height and depth and not all chairs have their seats at perfect right angles to their rise.  As far as any chair, I guess it might be more likely to fit an average, upholstered living room chair.  It does not seem to fit on any other sort of chair and in my experimenting it didn't work with my office chair, non-upholstered chairs of any sort, and sadly it also did not work on my Stressless lounge chair.  It did fit on the chair with the U shaped portion sitting on top of the seat cushion (the seat cushion is not detachable on the chair I have), however it still stuck out quite a bit in the front, creating enough of a gap to catch my ortho boot in as I attempted to stand and then maneuver around my chair.  After sitting in it for some time, the feel of the u shaped portion became very apparent and uncomfortable.  The Stand Assist did work a bit better on my more traditional living room chairs and loveseat, and in that capacity it protruded less, created less of a tripping hazard, and the bar was not noticeable as far as longer sitting comfort went.My advice?  This may be a workable solution for you if you have the sort of furniture pictured in the image (the brown loveseat with the lady with the yellow shirt rising to a standing position), but if you are looking for an assistive device for any other type of seat, you should probably investigate other models.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5RKQ0Z76YZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I45JJRS#wasThisHelpful","R1G5RKQ0Z76YZS","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This works well for my son's toys which he has outgrown, as he is very hesitant to part with anything but telling him that we are just relocating them to storage for a year to see if he really needs them is (hopefully) teaching him through our actions and by participating hands on.If I start packing up any books, I will likely choose a smaller size box as the 18 x 18 x 16 become quite heavy with such a dense load and I was concerned with the amount of tape I had to use to feel confident that the flaps would stay closed when being carried.I saw that some other reviews mentioned that these sorts of boxes may be available for less cost, at local brick & mortar shops.  That's great, but these came in a large square box that wouldn't fit in my car and I'm not supposed to be lifting anything heavy.  It was much easier, for me, to get these via Amazon.com, have them delivered in a matter of days, and I just pushed the box inside my home without having to lift or strain much.  I am thrilled that these are available here.  The convenience factor makes the price of these well worth it, at least for my family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TA3F65OH231C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMOOB3K#wasThisHelpful","R3TA3F65OH231C","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Caroline Clarke's exploration of her history, on all sides of the adoption triad, rings very familiar to me in some ways as I am an adoptee who has been through the experience of the reunion and claiming that part of my story.  The way she writes all of parts that make up that missing and then found history and moving forward really drew me in and made this a quick read.  I relished reading the facts and stories she learned along the way and her observations as much as if I was reliving my personal experience.Some readers might not find the backstory and family histories that interesting, particularly if they have lived their lives knowing that information.  For those of us who have to seek the information and find it elusive, it is breathtaking, even some of the more mundane seeming facts.  It's a nice ride with lots of ups and downs and a good blend of her inner voice and the voices of others who make up her family (that includes all of them- adoptive, biological, etc).","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYMUD2JAFBMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062103172#wasThisHelpful","R3OYMUD2JAFBMI","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the John Frieda Glosser in Warm Red.The Glosser does not foam.  John Frieda makes a permanent hair color that does foam.  This is not that product.I have coppery red hair that, without color refreshing of some sort, reverts to medium, drab blond/light brownish.  Blah.I have used many color depositing conditioners (including John Frieda's conditioner for red hair) and they tend to be hit or miss and I wind up having to use them every single shampoo.  That's not a big deal for some but as they all tend to be very perfumed and I am very sensitive to perfumes and additives, it is a big deal for me.Glosser has surprisingly minimal ingredients.  The fragrance is less pervasive than John Frieda's conditioning and shampoo products but it is similar- vaguely floral and a bit powdery and perfumey but not freshly dyed in fragrance.  Once hair is dry it does persist but it definitely more muted and likely will meld with any other styling products.The color is pretty good.  I use Glosser a couple of times a week and really love how natural it makes my particular warm red/copper color hold up but also shine.I do have extremely thick hair that borders on coarse and I have more than a couple of greys coming in these days (I call my hair copper and platinum).  This doesn't color or cover the grays, but it adds a lovely sheen to all hair which makes it look more modern and youthful, at least on my hair.  It does rub off just a little on white towels while hair is wet.My hair does feel smoother, sleeker, and less bouncy after using this.  It just seems to take some of the body out of it, but after the next wash my hair is back to perfect.  For the lower body days I use big curlers or a blow dryer and diffuser, while I am usually a towel dry, clip, and go sort of a girl.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBE2JGU1E0QU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLS55DC#wasThisHelpful","R2LBE2JGU1E0QU","A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16PUD6V3KAZ0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this as a tamping mat for my espresso machine. I like the way it captures stray grinds in the crevices and how fast it cleans up with just a rinse of water. I throw it in the dish washer every so often and get it really clean. Heat doesn't seem to bother it and while not thick it is adequate.

"I bought mine at Costco in 2012 and I've used this machine daily (sometimes three or four times a day) for the last three years. It comes with three frothing disks 1 for heating steamed milk and two for frothing. In addition there are three settings. One for cold frothing, warm frothing and the third for hot frothing. The unit shuts off when the frothing is done. Cleanup is easy as it has a Teflon coating. I just rinse it out with a pressure water stream and put it (the pitcher) in the dishwasher once in a while to give it a good cleaning. Some Teflon has come off in the bottom of the pitcher but after three years I guess that could be expected. While the unit is made of cheap plastic and the pitcher is Teflon coated aluminum it has held up very well and honestly when wiped clean looks new. Not bad after three years.Creates a nice consistent hot foam for cappuccino which is what I use. I've used it for lattes as well and found the best way is to use the frother exactly the same as for my cappuccino but wait approximately 2 minutes for some separation to occur and use the steamed milk underneath as well as a small amount of the foam that is on top (once used you will understand). I like my milk hot and this unit gets it right to the point where it will barely begin to ""scum"" the sides because of the heat. I use 2% and whole milk because they seem to work the best. Non-fat doesn't seem to do well at all. Its like trying to froth water. The froth isn't microfoam like a barista would make to do latte art so don't expect it to do that but it is rich and has full body and never burnt. I begin the pour into a couple shots of espresso from about 6-8"" above to cause the cappuccino to blend somewhat and decrease the height gradually to float some foam on top.Pros: If it broke today I would buy another (in fact we did on sale just in case this one broke and set it aside).Cons: It does feel cheaply made (but has never broke).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190O32A4IJIP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LXY2HA#wasThisHelpful","R190O32A4IJIP7","A2HBOG4LVIY15L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HBOG4LVIY15L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arrived fast and packed well. First time using Dezcal I've always used a weak vinegar and citric acid solution I made up. Thought I would try a commercial product this time. I mixed it at about 1.5 tablespoons per quart of water. Pack should be good for four cleanings or so.This seemed to work great following directions. Following directions, I cleaned and descaled two espresso machines. First I mixed the solution then pumped into the machine enough solution that I could tell it filled the boiler. Then I let it sit for half an hour. You could see the lime deposits flushed out as I pumped out the Dezcal after the half an hour. You must flush out the Dezcal several times with clear water because it tastes terrible.My machines are both over 8 years old but I do maintain them by using only filtered water and descaling every 6 months or so.

"Bought for my 28 year old daughter who is a budding photographer. Smaller than the 65"" would seem because the actual tripod is short with a long center post to get to the 65"". This causes the tripod to be less stable when fully extended. The ball head is fine for short lenses and light DSLRs. Long lenses and rigs over 10lbs  are best left to sturdier setups. The good thing is this is portable and sturdy when center column is not fully extended. Leg locks are sure and tight. The conversion to a monopod is a nice touch as well.The bag that comes with it is nice and handy.All this is to say that it is much more than a department store tripod or one you get in a ""kit"".

"I had mixed emotions on how many stars I would give this so I'll let you decide. Incidentally the reviews about this grinder are accurate. Out of the box it doesn't grind fine enough.It arrived fast and was shipped and packed very well. I was excited to get this as all I had was an old blade grinder that would burn my coffee if I ground it fine and would as often as not make powder. I followed the instructions and set the machine to a middle setting. This was way too coarse a grind for a espresso machine so I decided to take it to the smallest setting. Push the button and grind for a little while and I couldn't see a lot of difference, still way too coarse. It was about the size grind from a grocery store grinder set to drip coffee. Now I'm thinking ""this was a big mistake"".Something isn't tight enough but all was at the finest grind so, disappointed the reviews were right.All the cheap grinders (under 100.00) use the same blades so why did this brand grind so coarsely? I took the upper blades out and checked out how close they got to the lower ones. WOW! There was a gap of about 1/16 inch. I thought if I can get them closer I can make the grind finer. So I began to brainstorm and came up with this solution. Review the photos at the end of this article while you are reading this.I build computers so I have these small washers that are made of fiber that is designed not to compact yet are softer than a steel washer. You can get them free from any computer store (see pic). I took apart the upper blade from the guard (three screws) and set the guard aside. Placing the washer between the guard and the blade I screwed the assembly back together. I tightened the screws going round the circle two or three times so that I didn't risk breaking the ceramic blade tightening slightly more with each round. When tight you can see a slight gap between the blade and the guard about 1/32 inch. I installed the blade and guard back into the machine. Done in about 2 minutes. In one of the pictures you can see the washer just peaking out from behind the blade.When you turn it back on don't put any beans in the machine at first. Test the mod at a wide gap gradually narrowing until you are at the finest setting. My machine just barely touched (you could barely hear it) at the finest setting. I just want to make sure that you don't burn out a motor by having the blades grinding against each other.When I was done testing I filled the hopper with beans and started in the middle settings just as when I first got it. Now I had a grind that was like a very fine grind a drip machine would use. Trial and error I finally found that my espresso machine liked 1.5. I could make powder if I wanted to. I put a picture of the grind with a push pin for reference so you can see the size and consistency (not powder but fine consistent granules).  I couldn't be happier. I only spent 29.00 on the grinder and about 15 minutes modifying it. The consistency of the grind is perfect and with good control if I want it finer or coarser.  I could have spent much more and gotten better, but for the price and slight inconvenience of the mod I feel I got much more than I paid.See the pics for the results. I couldn't get them in order but you get the idea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIICHTSSQLSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DAYHXO#wasThisHelpful","RIICHTSSQLSM","A2HBOG4LVIY15L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HBOG4LVIY15L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works to connect my Amazon Fire Stick to a VGA monitor thus a wireless connection from my tablet to monitor via screen share (Android 4.4 and above). So all is well in paradise. Well, not quite. It really heats up the Fire Stick so I assume it is using the Fire Sticks's HDMI port for a power source (kind of a vampire). Within a few minutes the Fire Stick was quite hot to the touch. I think that if I put a powered HDMI hub/switch in between it would work so if it does I will update.I give it three stars as it does allow a wired HDMI connection from a computer or tablet to a standard VGA port.

"It is a bit of a no frills tripod that is heavy duty (rated at 26lbs). I do have a lighter weight Carbon Fiber tripod made by Induro (it is rated at 11lbs) and have been very happy with it but as my equipment has grown so has the weight of my lenses. While I don't like flip locks in general and prefer twist locks these seem to be quality and with carbon fiber (it doesn't shrink and expand with the temperature) they are much more reliable and do not require adjusting often if ever. The same Oben tripod with twist locks is 200.00 more so I'll deal with the flip locks.  Twist locks are slightly faster too. I prefer to buy my tripods headless as I don't have to pay for a head that I will probably not use and replace it anyway.So here is the lowdown on ergonomics. It is taller than most and with center post down the height is 56"". It holds (along with the tripod head) the camera at the right height to be eye level for me (approx 61"" though that will depend on the height of the head you have). I'm not tall so you might have to extend the post an inch or three but no more than that. It has three leg sections which I prefer. While three don't break down as small it allows for a much sturdier tripod. In addition to this it has on the upper leg a 28mm diameter while on the smallest section it is 16mm. This is much beefier than anything else in the price range. The flip locks are sturdy and didn't need any adjustments but the tools are provided as well as a nice zippered bag. The legs can be used at different angles independently or together. With the proper head and reversing the post you can hold a camera at ground level as well.The setup I am using this with is a gimbal head. Canon 7d and 400mm f4 DO IS lens. For this lens it is rock solid even using a steadying weight of 5lbs to stabilize it in the wind. Lateral motion (twisting) is almost totally absent and the legs are completely stiff with NO flex.At its list price of 349.00 or so it would be an OK deal but at 149.00 its a steal. The twist lock version of this tripod is available for about 300.00 on sale.PROS: Fast setup, sturdy design, solid flip locks, heavy duty .28mm largest diameter tube, and taller than most in this price range.CONS: I'm not fond of flip locks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A9X91S68Z70D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D49WUIY#wasThisHelpful","R3A9X91S68Z70D","A2HBOG4LVIY15L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HBOG4LVIY15L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't purchase this through Amazon but at Costco when they had it on sale for 129.00 with a bumper case a few months ago.I do love this tablet and have been using for the last few months. The selling factors for me were the amazing screen, fast quad-core processor, 2 Mb ram, and the rugged build. 16 Gb of storage is light but with the SD slot (I put 32Gb in it) it is plenty (however see note below). Whenever you  compare this to other sub 200.00 tablets this shines. The looks of this are great too. It is slim, fits well in one hand and looks great with the white case and thin bezel. Sound is nice and no dropouts or static as some have stated. However, the speakers are not very loud.This thing is fast and very responsive. It will connect to your wireless with either 2.4 or 5.8 Ghz so there is no reason it won't connect via whatever Wi-fi your using. The micro HDMI out is a useful tool if you want to do presentations with it. I gotta say that the most impressive feature is the screen. Note that it isn't the brightest but resolution and color depth are superb. It's bright enough except in the sun but most fail here as well. All the apps that I have loaded work well without a problem including 3rd party apps that run my dslr that can give some tablets and their owners headaches.For the most part the ergonomics of this are fine. I would have preferred to have the USB/charging port on the bottom away from the micro HDMI because in the dark you can confuse the two. Likewise the headphone jack I would prefer on the bottom as the cable gets in the way if you are watching a movie. I have begun to use Bluetooth and no longer have that problem. But all of this is nitpicking and not even really issues at all. In fact I didn't deduct a star for this at all.Then why four stars? Acer itself. I have used and enjoyed Acer products for years. My first real laptop was an Acer and I have owned two since. Their service was always top notch. Until now. I called up tech support to find out why they haven't push out a Android 5 update since it has been released almost 9 months ago. I was told they didn't have any plans to do so. Acer only released this tablet barely 1 year ago and it is currently being sold at many outlets. Yes Android 4.4 is solid running but it has huge problems in using the SD Slot. This SD slot support has been restored in Android 5.xx and for most of us this is a big deal. Eventually, when the warranty wears out, I will have to root it to get SD support and 5.xx. What a pain. For a company like Acer to dump support on a current product is nuts.PROS: Everything in the hardware department. Fast, powerful, very high resolution it is as good as many tablets costing double.CONS: Acer support or lack thereofACER If you read this take it to heart. Most companies support their hardware for a few years at least.

We take them to the vet for a commercial (prescription) medication that works well for the cat but I needed a spray to treat the bedding and the places in the house that they frequent. Pronyl (fipronil) is the active ingredient in many long lasting flea treatments so I though this might work well for my purpose. The good news is that it kills the fleas in and around the bedding. However, it doesn't seem to last long. We noticed fleas within four or five days so obviously there was a hatch and the treatment didn't kill the eggs or the young fleas. We treat with Pronyl every week so now is fine but wished it lasted longer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBI374QO1ZS1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWJ9NTM#wasThisHelpful","RBI374QO1ZS1O","A2HBOG4LVIY15L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HBOG4LVIY15L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Didn't want a lot of stuff on the counter or another appliance filling the cupboards. This one is small powerful and functional.

"Arrived quickly and well packed.Very nice quality and being MVA the blacks are intense and colors vivid. Good sharp resolution too. No obvious bleed and the angle of viewing is quite wide.

The stand could be sturdier but all in all an easy to use solid package.The only con is that I wish it was in a 16 X 10 format instead of 16 X 9.

I was hoping at this reduced price I could get something at least similar to augment my aging Floatron. While the pictures are accurate they don't show scale because there is nothing to compare the size in the photo of this product. The Solaxx is about 1/2 the size of the Floatron and the annode is only about a tenth the weight of the Floatron. While it does produce some copper ions it is a toy compared to the real thing. This would probably be fine for a small vinyl pool or hot tub but to expect it to handle an in-ground pool is foolish.So, I will continue to use my aging Floatron and hope it keeps working (its three years old now).

"Arrived quickly and packed well. Attractive design and keeps the phone's slim size fairly well. In fact if the case were any less it probably wouldn't protect the phone at all. Installation is a breeze (just remember to put the top of the phone in first) and the phone just snaps in. The top has a bit more of a lip so if you put the bottom in first might be a problem. It isn't slippery and provides a good grip to handle the phone.Protection is good for a fall on its back or maybe the side but from the front is much less so. You can put it down on a flat surface and the case lip will protect the screen with a small gap but if the surface is uneven could cause a problem. In addition if you are a pocket carrier like me I would clean it out once in a while because debris could get between the case and the back of the phone causing some scratches.Why do I give it 5 stars? Because it is well made with quality cutouts that fit perfectly. It is slim and attractive and capable of protecting against the day to day banging around that a phone gets. It is not a military spec grade A protection device. But if it were it wouldn't be small and attractive. It would also be intrusive to its function.  I added a tempered glass screen protector and feel fairly comfortable about protecting the phone. If you need something bullet proof get an otter box or similar. I'll live with some risk for the convenience, slim feel and looks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YU2L9MNZ2MXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JW7AYYE#wasThisHelpful","R1YU2L9MNZ2MXF","A2HBOG4LVIY15L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HBOG4LVIY15L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are so many books and stories about an apocalypse - with every book having its own idea on what the apocalypse will be - but not many books mention our four-legged or winged friends. When you think about this, it's strange, since I know so many people who consider their pets to be family members, but it's almost as if the world has come to the conclusion that pets will all be lost, or forgotten, when the zombies arrive or the world ends.Tails of the Apocalypse takes the opposite approach, giving us fourteen short stories that are either told from the point of view of the animals, or where our animal friends are a central part of the plot.Overall, I had to give this collection 4 1/2 Stars. Many of the stories will haunt me past reading this, while others were still great but didn't have the same impact. When reading a collection, I usually like to say something about each short story, but it's more difficult when you have a collection with this tightly-woven of a theme, since in some ways every story is alike, while still managing to keep its individuality, so I'm just going to say that I liked all of these stories, loved some more than others, but that there wasn't a single story that I disliked. Whether told from the eyes of a human or of an animal, the authors are able to reach deep into your heart and make you feel exactly what their characters are experiencing.Usually when we think ""pets"" we think of cats and dogs, but this collection also contains stories of wolves, parrots, bats, budgies, and others, along with feline and canine friends. And every stories contains some tale of the world's end, whether by zombies or volcanoes, war or disease.If you enjoy apocalyptic tales, and are a lover of animals of any type, I think you'll enjoy this collection. In addition, this book is being sold for a good cause as well, with $1.00 from every copy sold going to Pets for Vets.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TKZLC45EZCIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E5JIRU#wasThisHelpful","R1TKZLC45EZCIY","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While it's always fun to step back into the 'verse and visit the crew from Firefly/Serenity, this graphic novel was a bit of a disappointment. While the plot is good, it suffers from a bit of a cliffhanger ending. The worst crime, however, is the horrible artwork. The cover and the artwork on the chapter pages are beautiful, but the remainder of the artwork - which is 95% of it - is just terrible, with the characters all looking too much alike so that I had a difficult time sometimes figuring out who was supposed to be who.*Library Copy*","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359A1FD6ZIULV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616554894#wasThisHelpful","R359A1FD6ZIULV","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After first having been introduced to the mist and what lies within in his short story TOWER, we now see the fate of others in what I have to imagine is the exact same mist.In Sandhogs, a work crew is stranded six hundred feet below the streets of Manhattan. The Penthouse brings us to a view from within the mists itself, as a man named Jack drinks alone while pondering his fate. The Harbor takes us out to a ferry, where a visitor just wants to go home with her daughter. All three of these locations have one thing in common... the mists, the creatures within, and the end of the world as they know it.Though I will admit that I liked TOWER better, the author's story that introduced me to the mist, this was a great collection and I enjoyed the chance to see the fates of others when brought face-to-face with a reality filled with nightmares.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQ2X2JAMUG4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0179397WM#wasThisHelpful","RQQ2X2JAMUG4V","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the lights went out, Nathan Farthen was high in the tower at One World Trade. With the memory of 9/11 fresh in their minds, the workers trapped need to regroup and plan an escape. But when the mist creeps in, bringing the tentacles, Nate realizes that this attack is far from mundane, the actions of something other than human.Would they be able to survive?This short story is delightfully creepy. With a Lovecraftian feel, the unexpected horrors that await our protagonist and his new coworkers will keep the readers on the edge of their seats, hoping for the best while wondering what will come next.

"I've recently become hooked on anthologies, finding the experience of reading connected short stories to be an excited way to learn about new authors and become reacquainted with worlds I already enjoy. The newest addition to my kindle is The Time Travel Chronicles, part of The Future Chronicles. I have enjoyed every one of the Chronicles I have picked up, and this was no exception.The collection starts out with a bang... or rather, a blink. Extant, by Anthony Vicino, takes us into a world where the gifted can freeze time, race through it, or blink to the past. But not everything is perfect... can knowing that you're saving the world make up for the horrifying consequences? (5 Stars)Gambit by Rysa Walker is the second book of the collection, and asks the question that everyone wonders: can you safely change the past to make the future your own? And... if you can, should you? When I completed this story, I immediately bought the first 2 books of the author's CHRONOS series, which tells you how much this premise intrigued me. (5 Stars)Were unicorns supposed to be on Noah's Ark? Beasts of the Earth by Ernie Lindsey answers that question, and more. (4 Stars)Excess Baggage takes us into a whirlwind of a tale, where a boy is swept away into the past accidentally. The ending of the story leaves so many possibilities open to fuel the imagination, allowing the reader to wonder not only about the fates of the travelers, but also the world left behind. (4 1/2 Stars)Stefan Bolz's The Traveler made me cry... it's a bittersweet story about loss, and the lengths that someone will go through to say goodbye. (5 Stars)Eighty-Three is a story with twists and leaps through time, showing us a man who randomly jumps into his past and future, interacting with the world-to-be, or that left behind. But it is true, or just a delusion? (4 1/2 Stars)Everyone dreams of living forever... or to somehow jump into a better future. But what if the future isn't what you imagined it would be? Though I had a premonition of what the ending of Life/Time in the New World would be, it was so well-written and had such an edge of truth to it that I can confidently say that it was one of my favorites in the collection. (5 Stars)I've been a fan of Robert J. Sawyer's work since I picked up his WWW Trilogy a few years back, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed his short story, Just Like Old Times. This was a fun tale about an alternate death sentence, leaving us to wonder if the past could change the present. (4 1/2 Stars)Shades is the tale of a boy who can't stay still.. but not by his own choice. Every five years, since his birth, all proof of his existence is wiped clean and he finds himself ten years in the future, with no past, no family, and no hope of a normal life. Can he find the courage to take control back? (4 1/2 Stars)The smell of blood on the beach foretells a day of horror, when humanity will go back to try to change the past. The Nothing Gate is a morbid tale that leaves you to wonder about the fate of both the main character and the world itself. (4 1/2 Stars)Meddler by Ernie Luis is another favorite... when you combine a drug dealer with a conscious with time travel, nothing could possibly go wrong, right? I look forward to looking into more books by this author! (5 Stars)I'm still trying to figure out my feelings toward The Diatomic Quantum Flop. This is a story that will leave you thinking about the possibilities hidden within the human mind while simultaneously wondering what happens next. While I enjoyed this tale, it was a little chaotic to be a favorite of mine, but was still an excellent and intriguing tale. (4 Stars)Red Mustang is a standout piece in a collection full of stories that shine. What happens if an action of yours not only ruined your life, but the lives of those around you? If you could go back to that moment and relive your life, knowing that you do now, would you? (5 Stars)Hereafter by Samuel Peralta is a perfect story to close out the anthology, drawing us into a family tied together by time travel. Not only is the timing of the travel clearly thought out, but the impact on the people involved is so well described that this story made me cry as well... not once, but twice. This author will play with your heartstrings while making you wonder about what the future holds. (5 Stars)At the end of this collection, I'm left with fourteen outstanding tales, and nothing that I would rate less than four stars. I am very happy that I was given an opportunity to read this book, and I look forward to reading more by all of these authors in the future.While I received an Advance Reader Copy of this book for review purposes, I have also purchased the anthology because I loved it so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F6USFBKRH3YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016XIY2EC#wasThisHelpful","R3F6USFBKRH3YW","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sondrine never expected to find herself in the middle of a war, seemingly the only hope to defeat an immortal queen. In fact, all that she wanted was to avoid an arranged marriage and to somehow continue practicing her magic. But when Sondrine leaves her aunt's emporium and apothecary shop in the light of a full moon, she finds herself transported from London to Winterhaven, trapped by an insane king who somehow knows her name.The author has created a wonderful world that draws the reader into the middle of an adventure. This is a world where everyone has at least a touch of magic, where monsters and myths come to life, and where deception lurks in unexpected places. One thing that I loved is that the author doesn't just give you all of the answers. Though I was able to correctly guess some of the things that were brought to light at the end, they weren't obvious, and there are still some questions left unanswered for the reader to wonder about.Overall, this is a wonderfully fun book, full of humor and mischief, as well as danger. The characters are complex, for the most part, allowing the reader to peel apart the layers slowly throughout the book to finally reveal a well-developed personalty and back-story. Even the secondary characters are interesting enough that you want to read more about them. While this is the first book I have read by Jenna Nelson, it will not be my last.4 1/2 StarsI received a copy of this book for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9KGYLBE9AXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996739815#wasThisHelpful","R1C9KGYLBE9AXV","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to be immortal? After a while, what would you do? The quest to gather wealth would eventually grow boring, and with every movie watched and ever book read, after having watched all of your friends and family die before you, would you crave the cold caress of death?The Immortality Chronicles is a collection of stories all dealing with, well, immortality. It's not a comfortable book, but it is a good one, making you realize how sweet mortality is even as the days pass by. As children, we all want to grow up, but as adults many of us wish for the carefree days of our youth. This collection takes us into the minds and stories of the people who can't, who are doomed - one way or another - to live forever.I always have a difficult time reviewing collections, because while each story has its own merits and thrills, the book as a whole has to come together seamlessly, taking us from story to story in a way that makes us want to read more until we come to the end, sad that it is over. Samuel Peralta has once again gathered a talented group of authors to share their stories, and I'm happy to say that there wasn't one story I disliked.This collection has everything from time folds to immortality serums, from a plague that makes the world stop aging to a man who becomes more machine than human in his quest to live forever. If I had to pick a favorite story, it would probably be ""Eternity Today"" by Thomas Robins. In this story, an accident on Near Year's leaves humanity reliving January 1st over and over again, coming together to find a solution even though actions have to be restarted every morning. Another favorite is Harlow Fallon's ""A Long Horizon,"" where we learn the tale of a woman destined to live hundreds of years, only to reach the end of her journey as one of the only survivors on a prison ship. A third favorite made me actually stop reading for a while - ""Rememorations"" by Paul B. Kohler caused me to think about how ever person and every decision is tied together in my past, and what the loss of one would do to everything else in my life.After reading this collection, as well as a few others in The Future Chronicles, I'm excited to read more by these authors. Not only did I find a book that actually made me appreciate my own life so much more, but I also was introduced to a few more authors that I hadn't yet looked into. This is a great 4 1/2 star book and one I would recommend to any fan of science fiction.*Borrowed from Kindle Owners' Lending Library*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZJGFZMS7I8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LAPCT4#wasThisHelpful","R3FZJGFZMS7I8R","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Geekomancy is a book that will resonate with a specific subset of readers: Geeks, but more specifically Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Gamer Geeks. And not only that, you really do need to belong to all three genre subsets to understand the jokes and references that are threaded throughout the story. An average person, or someone who just tips their toes into Geekdom, will most likely find themselves lost and confused while reading this book.So now I have to bring out my geek fury about one thing that bothered me throughout the book. The authors introduces characters with D&D style stats, but instead of using Intelligence (usually abbreviated INT in the D&D world) the author uses IQ. Such as, this character has an IQ of 16. NO, this character would have an INT stat of 16. If they actually had an IQ of 16 it would be a really short book about someone sitting in a corner drooling on themselves...But I digress.Other than my continual frustration over the misuse of IQ in the stat section, I enjoyed the book. It's fun, the plot is somewhat over the top but still works, and I loved the references... Especially since I recognized 95% of them. Ree spends most of the book figuring out (pretty impressively) what she can do with her powers, and the twist of the bad (or perhaps just misled) character was also fun. There are enough surprises in the book to keep me happy and the plot was quick and never got bogged down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280D8XTSS79JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SNRRP8#wasThisHelpful","R280D8XTSS79JC","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twenty years after the robot war, humanity is still healing from their losses. To protect themselves, anything even slightly mechanical or electrical has to be created in a simulation and approved first, to reduce the chance of another disaster. Joel, a simulation engineer student, finds himself thrown into a nightmare when he finds out that his new internship assignment is to work on a robot...But is Jerry a robot?The title of the novella claims that Jerry is not, but the reader will need to make his or her own decision based on the facts of the story. Tying Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics to human decency  - and perhaps even a little revenge - this short story is sure to please most lovers of science fiction, and shows that a tale can pack a surprising amount of information and wonder into just fifty pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZ9YML9O44TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VQF44Q#wasThisHelpful","R3AZ9YML9O44TB","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will start this out with a warning. In this short story, you will find violence, sex, and graphic language.Now that the disclaimer is over, I'll mention what else you'll find in this story. Fighting. Retribution. Ghosts. And a neat little twist at the end. Without giving away too much, I really enjoyed Ground and Pound. I've only read one other story by this author so far (Magno Girl and the Beast of Brooklyn) but this is just as good in a different way. Where Magno Girl and the Beast of Brooklyn is full of tongue-in-cheek humor about superheroes and villains, Ground and Pound is about your normal, everyday heavy-weight fighter. With a Ghost. It's darker. It's more violent and there is more profanity. But I LOVED the ending... maybe I'm just a little vindictive, but I found it satisfying. I smiled. It may have been an evil little ""don't make the red-headed Irish woman angry"" type smile, but it was a smile.So if you want a ghost story with a twist and don't mind sex and profanity, pick this book up. It's currently for free through BN.com for the Nook and also free on Smashwords, and if you're nice and contact the author if may even send you a MOBI copy for free since Amazon hasn't price-matched this yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10BXURYQDTL5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FJE0C6#wasThisHelpful","R10BXURYQDTL5S","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Magno Girl and the Beast of Brooklyn is a fun short story about a superhero named Magno (short for Magnolia) Girl and a bouncer named Ron. When thieves steal large bags of rice from a Chinese restaurant, Ron was close enough to see the events but annoyed with the cops enough to give them some wrong information. His attraction for Magno is enough that he decides to help her find the real criminals, and the story takes off from there.While some parts of this story are hilariously absurd -- a super-villain named Bank Roll who was evicted for not paying his rent?! -- everything is just over the top enough to make it a fast-paced and amusing introduction to Mango Girl. Fighting, flying, and a superpower that affects the hero, along with a nagging mother, this story kept me laughing all the way through. After reading this, I'm excited to see what the author has in store for us in the full novel he's recently released, about Magno and Ron's continuing adventures.NOTE: I received a free copy of this book after signing up for the author's mailing list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1139DF0FPSLA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3TA7DA#wasThisHelpful","R1139DF0FPSLA7","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"London Road is a collection of shorts all tried to the inhabitants of a boarding house in London. The collection starts and ends with Janice, a woman newly released from prison after serving five years for the murder (in self-defense) of her husband. On a recommendation of a friend who was released two weeks prior, Janice arrives at a boarding house... And so the collection begins.The individual stories are short but give an intimate view into the lives of the women who live there. Starting with Janice's quest for self-worth, we are then taken into the mind of a young girl on parole, one lift from jail, before watching a woman deal with an uncertain relationship, a child with her own need to be wanted, and then an older woman dealing with her feelings of rejection in a mind plagued by inner-demons.All of these stories are relatable, and the added touch of subtle British colloquialisms give it a feeling that problems are international, at least from a reader on the American side of the pond. The darkness is there, but with hope threaded through, making these enjoyable and thought-provoking.The one negative that I really have to say about this book is that the narrative is sometimes a little confusing. Each chapter/story if told about a different person, and yet sometimes it's told in first-person narrative and sometimes in third-person. This is a little disconcerting. I would have also enjoyed a longer book, but as the actual events take place over one day I can understand why it is so short.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B2XJQ732X773/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TBEMS2#wasThisHelpful","R1B2XJQ732X773","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third magnetic calendar, and this one works really well. It's a little on the larger size without being too large, but there is ample space to write notes in each day field.  The calendar is set up with a Sunday - Saturday week, with a spot to write the month at the top, spots for each date, and five rows for weeks. This is pretty standard, though some calendars are set up for Monday - Sunday and I prefer Sunday - Saturday.The calendar comes with double-sided foam tape and magnets to stick to the back, so this calendar can then go on the fridge. Some calendars are now coming with hook & eye fasteners on the back, but I prefer these with magnets so I can take the calendar off the fridge to write my monthly work schedule on it, and then put the calendar easily back on the fridge.This calendar also comes with a fine point black dry erase marker that fits in the little holder at the top of the calendar.This is a great purchase if you need to keep track of a schedule - this is useful for people with varying schedules, multiple jobs, projects, kids (for school events, sports, etc.) and pretty much anything else you might need to write down on a calendar.

"The stove at our new apartment doesn't have a time built in, so we needed to buy a kitchen timer. This one has an on/off switch, which is something I wanted, so I purchased it. This timer takes a AAA battery, not included, so please keep this in mind when purchasing it.The timer is not too large and has a magnetic back so it sticks to the fridge. The numbers on the timer are large and easy to see, with more minutes and seconds. The one negative is that it is VERY loud and there isn't a way to adjust the timer. The description states that the timer is loud and clear, but not deafening, but perhaps my hearing is more sensitive than the people who wrote the description since it is on the verge of being deafening... and my desk is about eight feet from where it lives on the fridge. If I could adjust the volume, of it if was a little less loud, this would be a solid 5 stars - so if you don't mind a really loud timer or if you're hard of hearing, this should be perfect for you! As I mentioned previously, there is an on/off switch on the side, so we can turn the timer off when we're not using it to extend the battery life even longer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CALMNR284ERW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOPICNM#wasThisHelpful","R1CALMNR284ERW","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the process of moving, our old vacuum died, leaving us vacuum-less. After checking out Amazon, I noticed this Eureka AS2113A vacuum on sale, and it had pretty good reviews, so we decided to purchase it. Thanks to Prime shipping, we got the vacuum two days later... when you have two cats and friends with allergies, it's never good to be without a vacuum for long!I'm happy to say that this vacuum deserves its high rating. The vacuum was easy to put together and isn't huge - it easily fits in the corner of our front closet. Using it for the first time, we noticed that there wasn't a lever to lean the body of the vacuum back, but instead there is a button on the lower part that it less noticeable. The vacuum suction is good, picking up pet hair and cat litter, and it's able to pick up particles from corners. It's not too loud either.We haven't had to use any of the attachments yet, but there is a brush attachment and an extender so that you can get into places where the base of the vacuum won't fit.

"This is a great portable battery charger. The case is durable and compact, the charger is easy to use plus it comes with instruction guides in five languages (English, German, Spanish, French, and - I think - Italian) so you won't be at a loss when using it. The instruction books come with a QR code and website on the front that unfortunately do not appear to work anymore, but since all of the information I'd need is in the booklet itself, I'm not too worried.The portable charger can itself be charged using an A/C Adapter or there is an included car charger. They recommend charging it completely at full use, and then re-charging it at least every 6 months, though it starts that more frequent charges won't hurt it... that's great to know! It also won't overcharge, so you can leave it connected to the A/C Adapter, so if you forget it unplug it once it's fully charged it won't damage the charger. You can check the charge on the portable charger at any time by pressing the ""Function"" button on top of the charger... there are 4 red LED lights that display the level of charge, with all four as ""fully charged.""With this, you can jump start your car or charge portable devices using the USB port or 12V/16V/19V port.Pretty much everything you need - at least power-wise - is included in this case for an emergency while on a road trip. Cell phone/Tablet/Etc need to be charged and you don't have a USB port in your car? Plug it into this. Left your lights on and your battery died? Jump it with this!

"I received this product in exchange for an honest review. While I didn't have the weight gain that some reviewers report, I did lose 5 pounds in three weeks. I've had a difficult time losing weight since I was on some medication that caused weight gain, so this was helpful in that respect. I also am happy to report that I didn't have any difficulty or bad side effects taking this. The pills are a little large, but vitamins are as well so I'm used to that. I didn't notice much of a change in sleeping, energy levels during the day, or even appetite suppression, but the ""fat burning"" part seems to have done something at least since I did notice a minor weight loss. There is the potential for a large weight loss over the full two month period that is included in this bottle, so I will update my review if I notice any additional benefits or an exponential change in weight loss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8N8ZH505N57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJTM79S#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8N8ZH505N57","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the cable for my kindle broke, I freaked... oh no, I need my kindle! So I found this charger on amazon and bought it, and it's solved so many of my problems. Not only does it charge my kindle, but it also charges my android phone. It's long enough that I can plug it into the wall (using a USB adapter) and then still use my phone or kindle while it charges. You can also plug this into your computer but charging through a computer is always slower.It also works as a USB connector to your computer, however, not just as a charger, so if you need to side-load files onto your kindle or phone, or access stored material on a phone or tablet, this is great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9R6JORIQNU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLP3JMS#wasThisHelpful","RF9R6JORIQNU2","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It comes in a little mesh bag so you can put it and the cable into the bag and then stick it in a bag, purse, or pocket until you need it. I usually charge it up the night before I'll need it and then toss it in my bag, and I can normally get 1 - 1 1/2 full charges of my phone out of this, which gets me through days with even the heaviest usage.I've had this for almost 6 months now and it's stood the test of time so far, with no degradation of charging abilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GMXOVGTPRYZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005X1Y7I2#wasThisHelpful","R3GMXOVGTPRYZ5","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This steamer gets a lot of use in our household. We've had it for a few months now, and it's still going strong. We use it for rice, to steam vegetables, eggs, and even for full ears of corn. It's easy to clean and it's nice so that you adjust the size for steaming multiple layers of veggies or to take the divider out to steam larger items. As my husband says, ""It's awesome and does just about everything!"" The only thing that you can't really steam is peas, because they fall through the holes to the bottom, and then you end up with random peas in your rice (if you're steaming rice at the same time.)We've had a few other rice cookers and steamers over the years, and this is our favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDEADM8WPE14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SB8LPA#wasThisHelpful","RCDEADM8WPE14","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great chair, big enough that you can curl up in in, but not too big - it fits in the corner of my apartment.

I've had to replace the cushion once due to wear/tear & spillage, but the actual chair itself will probably be good for many more years to come.Curling up in this chair leaves you supported on all sides, so it's great.

"This is a great set of resistance bands, in 4 different tensions/resistances. Green gives a light resistance, blue is medium, red is heavy, and blue is XX heavy. I love having the different resistances, because some part of my body are stronger than others, and different exercises work best with different bands for me. I can use the Heavy for some leg exercises and medium for others, and my arms I fluctuate between light and medium. This means that I still have room to grow and strengthen with the different exercises!The set comes with a DVD that shows you some useful exercises to make the most out of the resistance bands. After watching the DVD a couple of times, you'll know the exercises well enough that you can then use the bands while watching TV or listening to music. If you are impatient and want to learn the exercises a little more quickly than the DVD is, just speed it up a little and you can still watch the exercises even without listening. Everyone learns differently, so there are a couple of different options for you!The bands comes in a great little drawstring bag so they don't get lost (or dragged away by my cats) and they're easy to travel with... just toss them in your suitcase and you can still exercise while on vacation.

"Miranda Kane has always felt that she is a screw-up, especially when it comes to magic. When her mother gives her an added incentive to do well at a spellcasting competition, she finds herself somehow in first place... and in more danger than she could imagine.While Spellbinder is a short story in the Shadow Falls universe, it's not necessary that you read the other books before reading this one, since enough background is provided that you are able to get into the story easily. I haven't (yet) read the other books in the series, but after reading this one I'm excited to start reading from the beginning! The author is able to write characters that seem read, even in a fantasy world, and while a short story doesn't give a lot of time for character development there are a few twists and turns in this story to make it interesting. Not only do we have mystery and murder in the plot, but we also dip into Miranda's past and her relationships with her friends and enemies alike. The story isn't perfect, but it's a fun and enjoyable short story.If you're a fan of magic, mystery, fantasy, and light romance, I recommend that you pick up Spellbinder by C.C.

"Set in an alternate Victorian era were magic lurks along with creatures that go bump in the night, Elle Black is a psychic investigator. Happy with her wife, her past intrudes when Elle sees a vision of her deceased husband... but how can he be found when she watched him be buried? Unsure if he is a ghost or a figment of her imagination, Elle jumps at the opportunity to investigate a potentially haunted house.Sundark is a well-written and fun novel that combines mystery and horror along with spirituality and LGBT relationships. I don't want to say too much, in the fear of ruining the book, but I will mention that I love the caring and supporting relationship between Elle and Faedra and the way that their marriage is quietly accepted by the other characters we meet, even though who might have looked askance at first. The plot of story is interesting and has enough twists that it isn't obvious what the ending will be, and the pace of the story is perfect, neither dragging nor feeling rushed.4 1/2 StarsThank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115NWX55UFQRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193662205X#wasThisHelpful","R115NWX55UFQRW","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story isn't your normal alien novel, nor is it your standard dystopian tale. Instead, it's a mix, showing us a world where aliens arrived, but instead of taking over and killing everyone, they came with a mission to ""save"" the Earth. In this world, the Prodigies live with and are cared for by the ShaZha - jellyfish-like aliens with the power to praise and punish - as long as they obey the rules.But humans who cannot see or hear the ShaZha are not as lucky.I enjoyed this story, watching Zarah evolve from a naive and cherished Prodigy - a Pet - to someone who has had her eyes opened to the wider world around her. Without giving any spoilers, I will say that I liked the depth of the characters in the second half of the book more than the shallower characters in the first half. The groups you're introduced to feel real to their environment and upbringing, and while the action is more quiet that some readers may be used to, it just seems right.As for Zarah herself, I may not agree with every decision she made in the book, but I can understand why she made them.My only complaint about this book is that I wish it had been longer... perhaps someday the author can revisit this world to show us what happens next.Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZ3LRKPDTW4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OSZGW0#wasThisHelpful","R3EZ3LRKPDTW4X","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Girl from Above is a story that starts slowly, but before you know it you're wrapped into the thread of the tale and don't want it to end. It's the tale of a synth - a programmed machine with the soul of a girl, hidden behind layers of protocols and fail-safes.1001 shouldn't exist. Chitec was only supposed to make 1000 synths - 500 male and 500 female - to prolong the lives of those rich enough to afford it. So why was 1001 made? That is the true enigma of the tale, threading through with the stories of Caleb, the Mal Reynold-esque smuggler and his second, Fran.This story really does feel heavily influenced by the unfortunately canceled show ""Firefly"", especially at the beginning of the book, when we first meet Cale and Fran. Cale has a ship, a little beaten around, but it takes him around the universe where he can smuggle the goods needed. We have the evil corporation - in this case, we have both Chitec and Fleet, where in Firefly we had the Alliance as a whole, and we also have the stowaway and the bounty hunter.Once we get past the beginning, the tale goes in its own direction, giving us hints of who the characters really are, all leading up to the big reveal at the end of the book. While there were a few things that I was able to guess before they were actually explained, overall this book does a great job of weaving a fun and convoluted story together, leaving me anxious to read the next book once it's released.Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24B5NSDHRK5QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VR14IUY#wasThisHelpful","R24B5NSDHRK5QW","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"POINT OF NO RETURN is the third book in Olivia Luck's Point series, and concentrates on the story of Cam and Violet. Violet, Stella's best friend, is still grieving over the death of her husband. As a twenty-seven year old widow, she feels lost, trapped between a life with Max and a life without Max. When Stella and Dominic - Max's twin brother - convince Violet to take a job as an event planner for an upcoming Scrapers fundraiser, she is thrown back into the world she had been hiding from.This book is wonderful, with the point of view switching between Cameron and Violet in a way that allows us within the minds and hearts of each, without feeling disjointed. The story actually starts before Violet and Max get married, as Cam tells us about the first time he saw her... the day she got engaged. From that point, his heart was taken, though he was respectful and never tried to get between her and Max, and even waited for more than a year after his death to even bring himself to Violet's attention, understanding that she wasn't ready... and may wouldn't ever be ready.The author has done a great job of showing Violet in the greiving process, making it real: fraught with indecision, feelings of guilt, and sadness. But we also learn - along with Violet - that you can't let sadness overtake your life, and that your loved ones would want you to move on and be happy. There were several points in the book that I cried, feeling what Violet was going through. I felt that the author did a great job at bringing the character to life and fleshing out their feelings, motivations, and personalities.This is not a stand-alone book, and you really will want to read the first two in the series - NEW POINT and PRESSURE POINT - to fully understand and enjoy the events and characters.4 1/2 StarsThank you to the author and Book Enthusiast Promotions for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351M9ES4T9IWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCKQE54#wasThisHelpful","R351M9ES4T9IWC","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Training the Alpha is the first book in a series about werewolves in Texas. In this book, we are introduced to Thomas, a man who was bitten and changed into a werewolf at a young age by Ceres, the daughter of the local Alpha. Set some time after he was changed, Thomas and Ceres now live together in a small town, Atropos, while Ceres finishes her schooling as a veterinarian and Thomas deals with his feelings for her. Intertwined with this story of their bonding are Thomas' trials to become the new Alpha of the sister pack being formed.The naming in this book can be clever and unusual in spots. For example, the story is set in Atropos - a town created by the author - which happens to be the name of one of the Greek Fates, specifically the Fate who cuts the threads. Given the events of the book, this town seems to be appropriately named.I really enjoyed this book. I first read it when it was published as the first part of a four part serial, but the author has since re-written the story and fleshed it out considerably, creating a wonderful culture and storyline that ties in with her other stories. If you've read some of her other books, it is great to meet and see references to characters you've already met and fallen in love with, and if you haven't it's a great introduction to the wider world of Vivienne Savage's shifter universe. The characters in all of the books are well-written, and Training the Alpha is no exception. You will quickly grow to love the main characters while hoping for the downfall of those who would hinder them, anticipating the next twist in the tale.Warning: This book contains explicit sex and adult language, menage situations, and violence. 18+ readers only.NOTE: This review has been re-written to accurately reflect the newly released book.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8E1FKEFPUDHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQ04X5S#wasThisHelpful","R8E1FKEFPUDHU","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my favorite USB adapter, and the one I take with me whenever I travel. Not only is is a smart charger, able to recognize your device and provide it the best and fastest charge, but it also have 6 USB ports, each capable of up to 2.4 amps per port, so you can charge phones, tablets, handheld games... anything that is chargeable by USB.When I first started using this, I noticed that my kindle and phone both charged a lot faster than they generally do when plugged in... this is great because it eliminates the amount of time I have to have the devices plugged in, but it also doesn't let them overcharge, so you can safely leave your devices plugged in even after they're fully charged.There is a cable that connects this adapter to the outlet, allowing you to plug this in to those pesky plugs that are always hidden behind the bed in your hotel, or attached to a lamp. This is the only USB charger you will need while traveling... just remember to being your USB cables for each device since you'll still need those!NOTE: I received a promotional code for this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6UJ6XIEADYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPZQI7G#wasThisHelpful","R1G6UJ6XIEADYG","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great USB adapter that allows me to charge up to four devices at a time. This is a smart charger, and will recognize your devices to give it the optimal charge. With four ports, each up to 2.5 amps, you can charge phones, tablets, kindles, and other handheld devices. I really love this one because it only takes up one plug (if you plug it in the bottom plug of the outlet) and you can plug the cables for four devices. It saves space, reduces the number of outlets that you have to use, and it also means that if you're traveling you only have to bring the cables for your devices, and don't also have to bring separate adapters for each.NOTE: I received a promotional code for this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12W827B9K8165/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ0XOVI#wasThisHelpful","R12W827B9K8165","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little USB adapter that allows me to charge two devices at a time.

"Outside In, the second book of the Inside series, is the immediate sequel to Inside Out, where we first met Trella, the Force of Sheep, and the scrubs and uppers of Inside. Now that Trella and the Force of Sheep have taken over and put the Trava family in the brig, they find that there is still a lot more work to do. For years, the uppers have had the more technical jobs while the scrubs did the grunt work... with no one really taking control, the ship is quickly falling apart, with laundry stacking up and trash in piles.In the middle of all of this, the Committee (formed after the rebellion) loses control of this ship, and it's up to Trella to find out if the damage is coming from disturbances Inside... or from the Outside.Outside In is full of twists and turns, with the author switching up the plot every time you think you know what is happening. It is very well written, and the surprises keep you from guessing what the ending will be, and even the entirely of what is happening along the way. While Trella seems to lose her way for a little bit in the beginning, she is soon back to being the kick-ass reluctant heroine we first met. Minor characters from the first book suddenly become much more important, and I'm happy to report that we get to spend more time with Logan and Anne-Jade.Where this book falters a little bit is in the beginning, as the author spends the first third of the story setting the scene for the later action. This means, however, that the action rarely stops once it finally starts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPZ85U2M9UV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373210116#wasThisHelpful","R2NPZ85U2M9UV3","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy to assemble, this scratching post is great. The post is wrapped with sisal, or something similar, giving the cats a rough surface that won't be destroyed easily. The post screws through the bottom platform, so all you need to put this together is a Phillips (crosshead) screwdriver. The ball is made of the same sisal-type material and makes a noise that attracts the cat's attention without being annoying when I have to hear it all day long! It sounds like there might be metal balls or something inside knocking against each other, creating the noise, but I'm not sure.It's a little short for my cats, who prefer a taller scratching post, but other than that it's great! Because it's smaller, and because the base and post are neutral colors, this doesn't look out of place in any room I put in it, and it's a fun activity for the cats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUKYES9K4NRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TA38F8M#wasThisHelpful","R3LUKYES9K4NRQ","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to this author through her Study series, which I will be re-reading this summer, but Inside Out is a completely different book set in a completely different universe.Set at an unknown time when 100 hours equals a week and 100 weeks equals a  really long ""year"", we meet Trella, a scrub from the lower levels. Nicknamed the Queen of the Pipes, Trella yearns for silence away from the overcrowding on levels one and two. When a new prophet convinces Trella to retrieve discs from a hidden location in the upper levels, Trella soon finds herself in the middle of a revolution.I really enjoyed this book. Without it actually being said, the author manages to give the impression that this is set in the future by little comments interspersed throughout the story. This could, in fact, be our future someday. The characters we meet throughout the story are real, with their own personalities and motives, and we are able to learn about them over the course of the tale. Maria V. Snyder has always been wonderful about creating characters you grow to like - or sometimes hate - and this book doesn't disappoint.This is the first book in a two book series, and I'm excited to read the second!4 1/2 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UAG6E9U4OFV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037NB5YW#wasThisHelpful","R2UAG6E9U4OFV4","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about these headphones. I one hand, I like how stylish they are, and they fit well in my ears. On the other hand, there are some things that aren't so convenient about them... for example, the charging port. You really do need nails to be able to pull out the back of the right earpiece to plug the charger in, and even then it's not too easy. Also, I accidentally changed the language and now I can't figure out how to cycle it back... I've tried to hold down on the middle button - the function button? - again to try to cycle through, but with no luck. I'm apparently stuck at Chinese.I've also noticed some issues with receiving calls... I don't always get calls ringing through when I'm wearing these, even though I am connected to my phone and the phone is on, and when I do sometimes the voice prompt of Yes/No to answer/reject doesn't work. It defeats the purpose for me to have to find my phone to push the accept button. My callers also aren't able to hear me as well, though I'm able to hear them clearly enough. It's like the microphone part of the headphones just isn't that response, though the headset part of it works just fine.The headphones work great for me to listen to music when I'm sitting on my desk or just walking on the treadmill... I wouldn't want to test them with running since the fit isn't that great,  but they're decent for music. The volume starts out at maximum volume when you first get them, but it's simple enough to use the volume down key to adjust it.I love the case these headphones comes in, by the way. It's a soft-sided zippered case that has enough structure so that the headphones and charger won't get lose or crunched. It's small enough to keep the headphones always with you in a pocket or purse.I really want to lose these headphones, and I really hope that the issues I'm having with the microphone and calls being missed is corrected in a future version.NOTE: I received these headphones in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DASVM101Q32R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZNC4YM#wasThisHelpful","R3DASVM101Q32R","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT from June 6, 2015 - After starting to use this bag, I would something so annoying that I dropped my review from 5 stars down to 3. It might not be a big thing to some people, but one strap is about 3 inches longer than the other. I can adjust them using the sliders, but then the sliders are not symmetrical, so my OCD kicks in and makes me upset that I'm using something that I feel is flawed. I don't know if this is a flaw with all of the bags or just the one I got, but it's something worth mentioning and worth updating my review for.-----------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm a HUGE fan of backpack bags, so I jumped at the change to get this once, since I needed a new one anyway. This bag is made of very soft material. The outside of the bag has two zippered pockets in the front, and another in the back. The top of the bag snaps shut and also has a drawstring once you open it, meaning that you can pull the drawstring and then also snap it shut, keeping anyone from being able to get into your bag. The inside of the bag is lined and has a zippered pocket.There is a little handle at the top of the bag, if you need to grab it quickly, plus it has the adjustable backpack straps that are wide enough and soft enough to be comfortable. They are sized for adults, not children, so this is a great bag.I have no complaints whatsoever about this bag, at least at this point. I'm sure I'll be putting it through some heavy use over the summer so I will update my review if needed.NOTE: I received this item in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCJUPLGI6B4Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9VSR1G#wasThisHelpful","RCJUPLGI6B4Y1","A33RSNBD4R025S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33RSNBD4R025S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need a clear bag, this is probably one of the best that I have seen. Designed specifically for people who need to take in clear bags - into stadiums or other such facilities - it is well made, large enough to carry most of what you would need, and also has an opaque black pocket for your license and anything else you don't want public, as well as a carabiner for your keys. There is also an ID tag attached that you can fill out in case you accidentally leave the bag somewhere.The bottom of the bag is a reinforced black fabric, and the bag itself is made of a sturdy plastic that stays upright pretty well. There are black handles, a zipper to close the bag, and an adjustable black shoulder/cross-body strap.While I'm sure there may be better bags out there, I think this is a great bag for the price.

"I'm middle aged, with combination skin. I tried this as a day moisturizer but didn't like it as well as my usual Trader Joe's Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum Two Pack, which goes on less creamy and more matte. I moisturize at night only once a week at most (my bad), but as an occasional night creme, the Vichy Aqualinia works great! I am largely scent-free in my laundry products to spare my friends with environmental sensitivities, but I confess I do love my facial products. This one is noticeably scented, but I don't mind it.

"What a luxury facial oil. Unfortunately, within 4 or 5 days of starting to use this as a serum, I developed a deep subcutaneous pimple on one cheek (near the laugh line). I quit using it for more than a week and returned to my neutral skin care routine until my face cleared up. I think tried this oil again, and I got a pimple in the corresponding spot on the other cheek. So I can only conclude that this oil is too rich for my combination skin.

"Haven Travis is an abused wife with a shot at getting away. The book impressed me with the depth of the characters, the deep sympathy for abused women, the suspenseful situations on a number of different fields, and the insightful portrayal of malignant narcissists.Now, I’m generally a more “literary reader, but my friend Tamara Lush, author of Hot Shade, highly recommended that I  try this book once I had finished her book and had become curious about the romance genre. I’ve come to the conclusion that the passion and eroticism are only as convincing as the characters themselves, and this book delivers on both counts. With strongly drawn characters and a well-researched psychological situation, this book has opened up that neglected field of “romance writing” for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R102SIB234AO5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250070694#wasThisHelpful","R102SIB234AO5T","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never understood the premises of this book, so later scenes of danger and suspense bored me. Why was a character in danger? What was the future technology supposed to do, anyway? Sometimes characters hallucinated as a result of the future technology, so of course you couldn't take anything the author presented as definitive to the central storyline. Other times, a character would ""know"" the implications of an action, but I wouldn't, so it seemed random, but I plowed through to the big reveal (which, refreshingly, I did understand). I’ll have to read reviews to see if anyone can explain what was going on. For a more engaging sense of dislocation, I far preferred The Room: A NovelThe characters were intriguing and engaging, but the novel was overlong and padded with every stray thought the author ever invented about the future world. For some, it will be worth reading  as backstory to The Guild of Saint Cooper -- which has a trackable storyline and which was dumbed down enough for the likes of me -- and in which Forecast and its author make important appearances. But for me, summaries and reviews of this earlier novel would have sufficed, getting the gist like reading a synopsis of a Kilgore Trout novel, without having to plow through the whole damn thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QB2UAKBGFNZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937865118#wasThisHelpful","R2QB2UAKBGFNZ7","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comparison of Island Fresh SUPERIOR Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, Cold-pressed and Unrefined for Irresistible Aroma and Taste, 54 Ounce with Organic Coconut Oil - Kirkland - Certified USDA Organic - Pack of 2 - 42.3 Fl Oz. Plastic JarsThese are both high-quality, organic, cold-pressed coconut oils. The Island Fresh liquefied at a slightly lower temperature, and it also had a very slightly milder taste. The lids are the same size, with the Kirkland jar having straight sides, and the Island Fresh jar sloping wider under the lid, like a pickle jar. As a warehouse member, I get a better price on Kirkland, but that won't be available to all shoppers. For the price, Island Fresh is a bargain.Nutritional info is very similar, though the Kirkland calls a Tablespoon “14 grams” for 120 calories; Island Fresh calls a tablespoon  “15 mL” and 130 calories. This shouldn’t worry anyone, as it appears to be merely a difference in how different measuring systems are rounded during conversion.At this quality and price, I am very happy with the Island Fresh version, though I question the need to add all those adverbs and adjectives to the product names! With the products being virtually identical, the differences come down to availability, price, and packaging.

"There are two distinct versions of this book: the ""art"" version of the book, The Hollow of the Hand: Deluxe Edition, and a simultaneously published, more affordable edition, The Hollow of the Hand: Reader's Edition. Sadly, Amazon's policy is to consolidate reviews, even when the editions are quite different.  Check out a classic like ""David Copperfield"" and see that critical editions with essays and beautifully illustrated editions are lumped together with cheap mass market versions in the reviews. I had hoped to review and rate the editions of this book separately, but, alas, I cannot.The two editions share the same content, but the Deluxe edition is larger and more rectangular, allowing the poems to ""float"" more on the page. The paper on both books is lightweight and textured; at this price, I do wish the Deluxe edition has been printed on glossy paper. Harvey's poems, which brought my attention to the project in the first place, are more like ""snapshots"" of particular moments than fully developed poetry. Murphy's photographs show day-to-day life in an unvarnished, insightful way. A more knowledgeable friend of mine who flipped through the Deluxe edition was impressed with the artistry of the photographs.As a coffee table book for fans of PJ Harvey or Seamus Murphy, the Deluxe edition is a treat, but for the money, I'd stick with the Reader's Edition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D43CVRJSCE06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408865289#wasThisHelpful","R1D43CVRJSCE06","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My overpacked small hall coat closet was smelling funky. Throwing this charcoal bag in there didn't solve the problem, so I cleaned out the closet and got rid of some of the extra coats -- not to mention emptying out the box on the floor filled with old junk mail and other miscellaneous stuff from 2002. Honestly, I half expected to find a dead mouse in there, but no; maybe the smell was from one of the wool coats? The garments have room to ""breathe"" around them now, so that might help.Anyway, after cleaning out the closet, I chucked the charcoal bag back in there several days ago, and the improvement has been steady, but a lingering smell still remains. Perhaps if left longer, the odor will be eliminated, or maybe I just need to air out each of the coats until I figure out which one is the problem.

"Romance; what does that mean as a genre? In this debut romance novel, the author gives us maddening flirtation, irresistible attraction, and a soul connection expressing as hot sex. (Very hot sex.) The romance genre, however, has been so outside my previous reading experience, I don’t have a basis for comparison.  However, I’m acquainted with the author, and the book isn’t expensive, so I thought I’d give it a whirl.The genre hasn’t won me over, but even we more literary readers can revel in this authentic, inside look at the life of an ambitious young Florida reporter and her attraction to a jaded young Italian on the run from his country’s crime and corruption. The book also rewards the careful reader with a fair amount of humor. Besides the charismatic lead characters, there are well-defined side characters in an attorney uncle, the reporter’s friends on the newspaper staff, and an obsessed stalker character whom I loved to hate.  The characters have compelling back stories, and Florida’s humidity and weirdnesses are portrayed with affection. Given this good start, I’m eager to see what the author comes up with next.What surprised me about this first romance addition to my reading list was that, while the sex was electric, the arguments heated, and the characters astonishingly gorgeous, their hearts are pure, the love scenes were respectful, and the framing story was as important (or even more important) than the love scenes – though we readers must have faith that circumstances will work out for these lovers from different cultures who nevertheless find themselves to be true soul mates.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W8ABBTMD6EXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942886772#wasThisHelpful","R1W8ABBTMD6EXP","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For several years, I've bought those staple-bound monthly office desk calendars for an ""overview"" of trends. Like most people, I have an online calendar for daily use, which is handy to share appointment information with my husband, and because I can get notifications on my phone when something's coming up.But I want to glance at ONE page and see which days that month I've exercised, chart my weight ups and downs, and remember the timing for larger events such as illnesses and vacations.The great thing about this little planner is that each month has a tab for the month-view calendar, followed by two-page spreads for each week of that month. And glory hallelujah, there are 8 squares for the week! They don't short Sunday; instead, they've titled the extra square for ""notes.""

"Parragon's ""Essential"" series, which was apparently produced to go straight to bookstore sale/remainder tables, features good-quality editions with glossy pages and short descriptions of the artists. Several pages are devoted to such influential artists as Pablo Picasso, Francis Picabia, André Masson, Max Ernst, and René Magritte, with several others also represented. The colors are bright, and the reproductions of surrealism's ""greatest hits"" are nice and clear. Some of the reproductions cross the spine onto both pages, with an adjacent sidebar about the artist. The book occasionally juxtaposes a smaller piece alongside a featured piece to point out parallels in the text, such as a smaller print of male artist Joan Miró's ""Dutch Interior"" placed with Salvador Dalí's ""The Burning Giraffe"" to compare the ""automatic drawing"" styles of the two artists.They've chosen interesting art for this book, but even though it was published in 1990, there is only ONE woman represented -- Dorothea Tanning. No Remedios Varo, no Leonora Carrington. This book was published rather late in the game for such a glaring omission. While not a ""keeper"" for the serious fan of surrealist art, the book is a good value as a general overview.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EBQVNLNJEFKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0752535919#wasThisHelpful","R2EBQVNLNJEFKE","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This story is set in the fictional town of Gravenstein. Now, the Gravenstein apple comes from Sebastopol, California. Sebastopol also has a Gravenstein School District. When I started the book and saw the Zip Code for ""Gravenstein"" was 95472, it confirmed it – this book is set on a farm outside of Sebastopol, California, a town I know well. Sophie’s family has inherited a farm from the late Great Uncle Jim, necessitating a dislocating move from urban Los Angeles to the apple trees and FFA clubs of agricultural Northern California. Sophie is of mixed heritage, and her sense of being an outsider is increased due to people’s preconceptions.Her mother is a freelance writer, and her father is job hunting, so Sophie is on her own for her first summer on their new farm. In poking around, she finds a chicken that has uncanny abilities, even though it’s no smarter than your average chicken.The first half of the book was slow for me, since Sophie was left to her own devices too much, and it was sounding like one of those ""stranded on a desert island with only a chicken for company"" stories. It picks up in the second half when Sophie starts meeting more people and some puzzling situations develop.The tale is told through Sophie’s letters to her late grandmother and dead Uncle Jim, as well as a correspondence course on raising chickens. The illustrations are educational and amusing and move the story along jauntily. (Readers will want to take the quiz to determine their own potential aptitude as poulterers.) If I may go out on a limb, I would suspect the feed store of the story is based on the old Frizelle Enos Feed store, which was destroyed in a fire in the summer of 2013 and subsequently rebuilt under different ownership as The Feed Store.While I personally have not raised chickens, my grandmother and her parents had a small farm with some chickens, but the real reason I ordered this book is because the Amazon page had a blurb from Daniel Pinkwater. I've met many of my favorite authors (such as Francesca Lia Block), but meeting Mr. Pinkwater is still on my life goals list -- though I suspect I'll have to get myself to New Jersey if it is to happen. Mr. Pinkwater, if you’re reading this, author Kelly Jones and I would like to meet you, and Kelly Jones went so far as to write a book in the Pinkwater chicken genre!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKRJTHVN74RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038575552X#wasThisHelpful","R3PKRJTHVN74RA","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update, May 1, 2015: Wow! I like this product and have ordered it before, but this time it was faster (a couple of days, instead of a couple of weeks); better packaged (a small box with packing popcorn vs. a padded envelope); and they included a handful of SAMPLES! Impressed in every way.Previously: I think Refinery29 had glowingly reviewed the Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus Bb Cream 40g Spf25 Pa++_pump, but as an over-50 minimalist with a rather ruddy Caucasian complexion, I too went with this Gold version instead, and have been SO pleased. It took a long time to arrive from overseas, but it has been a pleasure to use it. My husband cracked, ""Oh, you get rid of wrinkles by spackling your face?"" Indeed, it goes on looking rather caulky, but a few minutes later my skin tone is even and I have a deceptively deep-looking glow, making me appear elegant and enigmatic behind this cure-all facial balm. When I want a little extra boost, I use Trader Joe's Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum Two Pack first, which is also very reasonably priced and gives a nourished, matte look to my otherwise shiny face.

"I  have both linoleum (in the kitchen and bathrooms) and v-groove hardwood flooring (in the living room and bedrooms), but the manuals for this Oreck hard floor washer as silent on its use with various types of flooring. So I phoned Oreck to ask about using this unit on the various flooring types – and the customer service representative said I should “ask the flooring installer” if it would be “recommended.”Next call: the local flooring guy. He said to be cautious, and that it would probably be OK on the v-groove hardwood, but to carefully dry any leftover water drops with a cloth afterwards – with the caveat that some folks say even damp-mopping wooden flooring carries the risk of buckling. (The floor guy’s wife actually uses Windex to clean their hardwood floors.)On our stained and textured old linoleum, this unit worked pretty well. It didn't dispense the water solution until I gave the trigger a mighty squeeze, but after you get the water to dispense, you can let go of the trigger until you need more fluid. We have a smallish kitchen, but it would take at least 2 batches of cleaning liquid to cover the whole floor.I still think the floor is cleaned more thoroughly the old-fashioned way, with rags and a bucket, but who wants to do THAT? If you don’t mind the effort and noise of vacuuming, it could be easier on the back and knees than grandma’s low-tech methods.However, when my occasional house cleaner came over and tried out this unit, she didn't like it. She has some back problems herself, and the vacuum cleaner style is actually more difficult to use for her than hands-and-knees scrubbing. She also pointed out that the head with the brushes doesn't let you clean all the way up to the edge of the floor, or in weird narrow crevices, and that the brushes can’t apply the same pressure as one can manually.After experimenting on the linoleum, I won’t be trying this on my wood flooring. When water dispenses, it dispenses a fair amount. The “dry” vacuum option worked well enough to suck up extra water, but I don’t trust that it has enough power to suction water out of the v-grooves of a hardwood floor.While this unit works well enough, I believe I’ll let my house cleaner do her thorough rags-and-bucket method when she’s here, while I go back to the sponge mop and Swiffer for touch-ups and weekly maintenance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IVPCRP2IRWV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWHW#wasThisHelpful","R1IVPCRP2IRWV0","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They say more people are wearing watches, and it’s even been offered as a productivity tip: “Wear a watch to check the time;” otherwise when you pull out your phone just to see what time it is, you may find yourself completely distracted by all the other features of your smart phone. If you haven’t worn a watch before, it can take some getting used to, like wearing glasses, but eventually one can start feeling naked without it.When I first tried on my new Kate Spade watch, it was loose and bulky. First stop: my local watch shop. The proprietor gave me a choice of having 2 links removed for a “bracelet” appearance, or 3 links removed for a more snug “watch” fit. I have a slender wrist, 6” in circumference, so I chose the latter and had 3 links removed. (Don’t try this at home; it cost me only $10 to have it done professionally while I waited, and he had the specialized tools so it didn't get scratched or broken. Save the links in case your tastes change, or you pass it along to someone else, or, god forbid, you gain weight.) These three links took off half an ounce of weight and left the watch weighing in at a tad over 3 ounces (88 grams). Though it’s a large timepiece, it wasn't too heavy for me; it just feels solid and substantial.And oh, the styling! I’m a watch-hound and have five perfectly serviceable, cute drugstore watches that I rotate depending on my outfit, so I originally thought to save this one for special occasions. But I also didn't think I was particularly materialistic until I got this watch! Now I know I’ll be wearing this gorgeous and versatile statement piece frequently.The booklet is generic, apparently written for many different styles, including digital watches, and those with date and stopwatch functions (which this watch doesn’t have).The Amazon product page also has a few mistakes; the watch weighs 3.5 ounces, not 16. And the bezel is stationary (unmoving) rather than uni-directional (rotating in one direction). The specs also say the watch face is merely “white,” but it’s much better than flat white. Against the gold Roman numerals, the face is iridescent, like white marble. The logo name is black with a discreet black spade symbol, and the red second-hand makes it easy to track the passage of the seconds. This is my favorite of the Kate Spade watches -- an elegant, classically styled timepiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28M4WGLE87Q7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADSGV34#wasThisHelpful","R28M4WGLE87Q7L","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""69.

ART reviews, on the other hand, are a whole 'nother story.

"I’m not of the culinary inclination, but the economy has led me gently down the path of less restaurant dining, and more home cooking. When my niece, who has worked in fine restaurants for years, mentioned that she hardly uses her standard oven any more since getting a countertop convection oven, I decided to try it.The initial impediments were frustrating. Right out of the box, you need to check the unit carefully – there was a strip of packing tape on the underside of the oven, for no apparent reason. You also need to wash the two racks and the tray. And it is BIG. (Did I mention that it’s big? From the description, I thought I would be getting a toaster oven, but this unit is bigger than my microwave.)And then, the cord! Sheesh, the cord! If you have the outlet on the right-hand side of the unit, you’ll be OK, but if your outlet has the misfortune of being on the left side of the unit, the cord will extend only a couple of inches past the unit itself. The manual says the short cord is on purpose – “a short power-supply cord is provided to reduce the risk resulting from becoming entangled in or tripping over a longer cord” – guys, the unit is 21” wide, and the cord is only 26” long.  Unless you have it on the counter but are plugging it in at the FLOOR, you are NOT going to trip over this ridiculously short cord. So, while most of us will need an extension cord, the manual gives only generic instructions about using “properly rated” extension cords. After irritated inquiries and digging around, I was able to determine that one needs an extension cord that can handle 1500 watts. (Now you know everything electrical that I know.) We ended up using a power strip that my husband had lying around.Finally, after washing everything, removing the cardboard inserts and random tape, and finding a proper extension cord, the next night I was finally ready to cook something.I used the “convection” setting to cook a pork roast and red potatoes in a “V” rack over the tray. I rubbed the roast with a spice mix, baked it, then drizzled with a sweet sauce for the finish. Payoff! I hadn’t browned the pork roast, but it came out like a pre-seasoned ham (as I said, I’m no great cook). The next night, I used the tray to bake breaded fish. Suddenly, I see what my niece meant. Why heat up the whole kitchen with gas heat, when this efficient unit can bake and broil through the miracle of electricity?There’s no number keypad, so the “bake” and “timer” functions start with presets (350 and 30 minutes, respectively), and you use an arrow key to increase or reduce the temperature and time. In fact, to “preheat,” you just heat the unit for 7 minutes; however, this is not a huge annoyance for an affordable unit such as this. There’s no inside light, but on the countertop, it wasn't difficult to check the progress of the meal.So, all that griping aside, I’m happy with my first foray into convection-oven cooking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EVE9H3R3URA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXSR486#wasThisHelpful","R2EVE9H3R3URA5","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Clean-up is as easy as a paper towel after most uses.  Because these pans can go from stovetop to oven, as you finish one dish, you can put it into the oven to keep warm while you cook another dish in another pan, and everything stays warm.This is a functional, attractive, and practical cookware set for newlyweds, single folks, and families.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6IEG2X4DMQ2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCI71IE#wasThisHelpful","R6IEG2X4DMQ2X","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why use this product instead of good old bulk turmeric from the natural foods store? I called New Chapter to ask.The powder has different parts ""alive"" (as the rep put it) than does Turmeric Force. Oils don't survive well in powdered spices that have been exposed to the air, but these capsules retain those potent oils. Strength-wise, each pill is equivalent to 4 grams of fresh ground turmeric - the average amount a person gets through daily meals in India.Turmeric Force is not manipulated to change the natural balances - for instance, there's the same ratio of curcumin, an antioxidant that is one of the active ingredients in turmeric - but the fiber has been removed. Some people take this product preventatively as an anti-inflammatory; others take it for a while for a specific problem. The rep said that either way is fine, but it was produced for safe, ongoing daily use.After my Kaiser doctor recommended turmeric for back pain, my husband started using a lot of it when he cooked. However, I don't want to eat quite that much Indian cuisine every day, so I'm happy to have these supplements to get the same effect.

"The book is organized primarily by topic, such as ""How do you know anything exists?"" and ""What is a logical argument?"" This should have been more stimulating than it was. Instead, it bogged down with stuffy, almost academic language that took the joy out of the inquiry.Here's a random sample: ""Logic helps us to analyze an argument -- to see its structure, or logical form. We can then assess whether or not the conclusion follows from the premises. An argument is said to be valid when we can deduce [work out] the conclusion from the premises. Such an argument is known as a deductive argument. In a deductive argument, IF the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. But being able to deduce the conclusion from the premises is not enough to prove that the conclusion is true; it also depends on the content of the argument."" (etc.)While it covers the bases in presenting the major themes of philosophical inquiry through the ages, the book reads like a textbook, not like a general-interest book for the curious. The writing is dry, it doesn't convey the passion of philosophy, and the little sidebars and bubbles of info weren't enough to offset the plodding text. I enjoyed its occasional philosopher biographies much more, probably because each individual's life story includes challenges that are more than just academic.This book can't compete with Sophie's World: A Novel About the History of Philosophy (FSG Classics) -- a much more engaging introduction to the fascinating world of philosophy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12QYDHGW7S3A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465424482#wasThisHelpful","R12QYDHGW7S3A0","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A toddler is abandoned in a bookstore, eventually melting the icy heart of the unpleasant, widowed owner. A.J. Fikry. Silas Marner, anyone?Each chapter begins with a commentary by the bookstore owner on a famous short story, and it's amusing to look for the connection between the famous story and the subsequent events of that chapter in this novel. I would not expect this book's audience to make the literary connections on their own, however, because readers of classic fiction are more likely to be as annoyed as Fikry is with chick lit. Indeed, The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry: A Novel is one of the crop of disposable titles bookstore owner Fikry would stock only out of desperation.Bookstore clerks, English majors, and book industry workers will enjoy an unlikable ""writer"" side character, the author's obvious love of classic fiction, the scene of an over-the-top author reading, the theft of one of the world's most expensive books, and the Black Books - The Complete First Series type of eccentric bookstore owner.However, heavy-handed foreshadowing initially confuses the reader and then spoils any sense of suspense. Tongue-in-cheek, self-referential criticisms also become annoying, as when a promising young writer's story is criticized for avoiding contractions and writing in third-person present tense, both of which are quirks of Zevin's herself, or when the bookstore owner says he doesn't like ""orphan books"" or ""supposedly clever formal devices"" - both of which The Storied Life includes.The child character is the weakest link in the cast. (Practical impediments to a contemporary single man being allowed to adopt a toddler were easily dismissed.) The child begins as a bright 3-year-old who speaks in one-word commands, like precocious baby talk, as if young children who can say ""downstairs"" ever just stop there. The orphan, who naturally becomes a voracious reader, is an idealized nerdy, compliant, and insightful child -- just what you want for a book that seems written expressly to be a movie adaptation, to pander to both chick-lit and chick-flick audiences.I disliked this book for the same reason I disliked The Bridges of Madison County; it's a pretentious, title-dropping book for a type of popular fiction reader who imagines herself a serious reader. This book offers a little more hope for the earnest pop fiction reader than does ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" though, with a cop character who is slowly introduced to literary fiction via police procedurals. Literary snobbishness is mentioned often enough to wonder if the author takes herself seriously, believing she can successfully lift elements from classic novels and plop them into what is, in the final analysis, a chick-lit book, one in which plot ""reveals"" depend on characters keeping important (and trivial) secrets from each other ... forever. As in soap operas, ""talking criminal"" scenes eventually clear up all ambiguity (which is a characteristic that discriminating Fikry admits he likes, though ""most readers"" don't), again making it appear the author is mocking both her Fikry character and any readers nave enough to take her book to heart.Author Zevin appears determined to disprove character Fikry's idea that ""literary should be literary, and genre should be genre, and crossbreeding rarely results in anything satisfying."" Here, Zevin is hoist by her own petard, unless the point is that great literature only makes one fusty and unpleasant, and that when one's heart opens, one can embrace chick lit like ""The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry"" and consider it a book of literary merit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QM6XLMC0D8BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616203218#wasThisHelpful","R3QM6XLMC0D8BL","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tested this unit out over the course of several weeks with my 4-year-old niece and her mom, who have a lot of experience with the previous LeapPads, and the Leap Pad 3 is light years better than its predecessors!With the connection to Wi-Fi, you can purchase games from the pad itself, as well as use cartridges. Also, the games are just better! The touch is more comprehensive and the games very entertaining to my little niece, who loves playing with it.You can do a lot more with your ""pet"" in this generation of LeapPad as well -- more games, and more options to customize.  The electric charger vs. the old battery-powered LeapPads is a great improvement. The previous generations used 4 AA batteries, and they wore out FAST. The charge on the 3 is amazing. My niece gets to use it 2-3 hours a week and it still has a good charge -- haven't charged it once in the 3 weeks she has played with it.It seems to be very durable -- as durable as all the other LeapPad products. We don't have a case for it and it has been dropped (a LOT, heh!) and it still works great.The only downside to the LeapPad 3 and its predecessors is the addicting video game component, but it sure does make a great distraction if mom or dad just needs to get something done without the kiddo getting in the way for an hour. All in all, my little niece, her mom, and I give it 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DUHGCR0XKDOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLHW0JC#wasThisHelpful","R3DUHGCR0XKDOU","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a charming story, beautifully illustrated, of a fox and a rabbit stuck on either end of a teetering log precariously balanced over a river. If they move, they could both fall into the river.

"I like to sit on the porch with my phone and stream radio stations, and you've got to have a better speaker than the phone speaker if you don't want to insult the music. For the price, this is a functional low-end Bluetooth speaker that works fine, though the whole party/color-changing feature seems overly ambitious for the quality of the unit. Theoretically you can tap a button and get it to stay on one color, but I couldn't get that feature to work and just turned off the color feature. At the default white & black, it really does look like cheap plastic. Well, I suppose that's fair, because the casing IS cheap plastic and lacks any aesthetic appeal.

"There's a big difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com. If you've blogged by choosing a ""theme,"" you've been using WordPress.COM, the free site.WordPress.ORG, on the other hand, is for self-hosted blogging. Your ISP may include blogging and website capability with your account -- mine, Sonic.net, does -- but you don't get all the preset themes and functions of WordPress.com. WordPress.org is a DIY project. You can't place ads of your choice on the free .com version (though WordPress reserves the right to include their ads with your blog), but you can with the .org version, and using the .org version gives you the ability to choose your own domain name, without the ""***.wordpress.com"" (""wordpress"" added to domain name).If you're a novice blogger, you may want to get your feet wet with WordPress.com and then decide if you eventually want to take the step to self-hosting with WordPress.org. And if you take that leap, you'll want this book! It walks you through the programming codes so you can replicate the functions that the .com ""themes"" give you as a package.The author also reveals the power of WordPress for other functions, such as nonblog uses, e.g., a Content Management System (CMS) for database management.This is not a ""dummies"" type book, however; it would be very useful as a college-level blog design textbook. There's a lot of power here, but it won't be for everyone. If the mere appearance of a line of code like:function smashingtheme_exclude_category ( $query ) {makes your eyes roll around in your head, this book may be more than you need. But if you're up for the power and control and adventure of a self-hosted WordPress.org blog, this book will be well worth the investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0YXBVFM3DUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118600754#wasThisHelpful","RN0YXBVFM3DUR","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comparing the Schick Hydro 5 Sensitive Razor to my old Schick Hydro 3 Blade Razor, much is the same. The handles are similar and both versions have swivel heads. While the handles look very similar, the cartridges are NOT interchangeable (I tried!). Both types of cartridges have a row of tiny dots at the top so you can see how much life is left in them.I had to decide between the Hydro 5 and the  Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Razor, but the reviews on the latter suggested there would be more gel than I wanted, and I believe I made the right choice with the Hydro 5 Sensitive Razor.I did get razor burn on my underarms the first time I used the Hydro 5, so perhaps it's sharper (or just newer), or I was overzealous. Take it easy with this baby right out of the wrapper.If you dry the blades to extend the life of the cartridges, as I do, tap only the metal blade part against a towel, because the moisturizing gel top on the top of the plastic cartridge is sticky on the towel.One distinct advantage to the Hydro 5 is that the cartridges have a ""trimmer"" function. You can flip back the bulky top of the cartridge that has the gel, which allows the blades to sit closer to the skin. I tried this on my bikini line and it worked as described. Just watch it when you flip the top back so you don't cut yourself.

"This is a good, solid vacuum cleaner - very strong, very powerful, and multi-directional. It can go under beds and into corners that standard vacuums can't reach.The foot on/off switch is hard to press and the controls are rather stiff. The cord is very long and wonderful for large rooms. Just don't run over the cord -- the motor is so strong it actually might suck up the cord. (It also really begs for an automatic cord-winder.)However, I had my elderly mother-in-law give it a try, and she found that it took some strength to both turn it on, and then to hang onto it, but she loved the power and suctioning ability. It wouldn't be good as the only vacuum cleaner for a two-story house, however, because it's quite heavy and would be difficult to carry up and down stairs. In fact, when her caretaker gave it a try, he said he wouldn't buy one because it was too hard to maneuver.Still, this vacuum cleaner is very well made and we found it much more effective as a cleaning tool than the current flimsy plastic models.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM0Z2KDEWVYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOD354I#wasThisHelpful","RM0Z2KDEWVYL","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always on the lookout for ""the"" miracle product, I was happy to try this one, since I like the Olay line in general and I kept seeing it at the Costco warehouse.So many grandiose claims are made about so many products, I have naturally become jaded, so I was quite pleasantly surprised at the quick difference this cream made in my complexion. I have mixed oily/normal skin that tends to red splotchiness, and I soon was rather surprised to see a noticeably lighter, more even, brighter tone to my skin.My go-to morning moisturizer is Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer SPF 15, 4 Ounce, but I left off with that for the Regenerist review period. A big difference is that the Aveeno is SPF 15, and Regenerist doesn't have any sun protection. However, Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free Loose Powder, Translucent Medium, 0.49 Ounce, my other standby, just added SPF 16, so I'm covered there (though I wonder how well SPF coverage works in powder).I sometimes use Trader Joe's Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum before I put on the moisturizer, and they don't clash.I dislike the sticky feeling of the Regenerist on my hands after applying it and always wash my hands afterwards; still, this could become a staple of my morning facial routine, except that the price is significantly higher than the Aveeno moisturizer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2GGWZL10HMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I073WLE#wasThisHelpful","RS2GGWZL10HMR","ABY77ZEHN9WLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABY77ZEHN9WLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the fourth book in this series about The Marino Bros. I recommend you read these in order as they really are super great reads. I thought it was perfect that the author left Andreas story until last.I read book one last December. I signed up to review all four for a blog tour so I re-read book one and literally inhaled the rest of the series.This is Andreas 'Andy' Marinos story. He's the eldest of the brothers. He took over responsibility of his brothers when his parents were murdered. He can't seem to move on until the killer is caught.Cats a great character. She's strong and independent. When she needs help she reaches out for Andys help.Although these two try to keep it professional they get more than they bargained for.This is a super ending to the series. One word-perfect. Absolutely love this book and the full series. Highly recommend these books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17PJNYFS3V6F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JPPNRY#wasThisHelpful","R17PJNYFS3V6F0","A1LYMNC951UTVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMNC951UTVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh wow. I'm sitting here in bed with tears rolling down my face after reading this. If you read my reviews you will know that crying from reading is a rarity for me. Yep this author certainly got me with this book.This is the first book I've read by this author and its blown me away. It's got all kinds of everything in it. Laugh out loud moments, great off the chart sex scenes, angsty moments and for me tear jerking moments when I least expected it. We also have two broken characters Luca and Cassie. They both have been broken from different tragedies in their past. However their coping mechanisms are the same- have sex with whoever but don't get involved. When these two get together for a one night stand the rule of no going back for more is more difficult than they thought. Yes there is lots of sex in this book however it's not the main focus. Both have secrets that they can't talk about. They are both afraid to feel or let anyone close to them.Truly brilliant story. I thought the author got me started under false pretences in that I thought this was gonna be a normal run of the mill story. I was so so wrong. The author pulled on my emotions and teased me with angst dotted throughout the story, leaving me in tears towards the end. Brilliant read. Can't recommend this story highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRZCQB4XGOXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y997HEA#wasThisHelpful","R3IRZCQB4XGOXS","A1LYMNC951UTVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMNC951UTVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book has me thinking what kinda warped mind I've got as I literally inhaled this book in one sitting... Maybe with a few little breathers to grab some alcohol lolAs soon as I read the warning I couldn't resist reading it. However it didn't prepare me for the depths of darkness these two authors would take me to. On several occasions while reading this I couldn't believe what I was reading.I couldn't believe how much I wanted to devour this warped intense dark read. Does that make me warped??? Maybe it does lol however I read this as the erotic horror fiction that it is.Have I mentioned the ending? Oh my dayz. Speechless!!!Please read this warning before you 1-click. If you like the dark warped kinda read then give this a go.

"I waited with baited breath for this release. I've known this lovely lady for a while on fb and was so excited for her when she told me she was writing a book. So as you can imagine I squealed with delight when this landed on my kindle.Abby is a tough cookie. No matter what is thrown at her she is strong and brave. On tour as a famous singer her life starts to crumble when she finds her guitarist boyfriend cheating on her. This is the start of a lot of hurtful secrets being revealed. Abby realises over time who she can trust and not trust. As things got heated with Abby and her bodyguard Danny I was shouting at my kindle for them to get a move on and get together.Did I mention Danny is hot? Although it's his job to protect Abby I loved how he will do anything to protect her. He's a hot alpha male.This author has wrote a wonderful story. I thought it was a great balance between the music industry and security. Although not an angsty read I found myself holding my breath on a few occasions. Once I started this I did not want to stop. As addictive as it was I even found myself reading while drying my hair. Yes it's that kinda read.Well done Debra on a brilliant debut novel.

"I really like this camera lens because it helps me with taking much better family pictures.  My camera on my phone is not all that great but with this lens I can see a good improvement in the clarity and it does give a little wider angle.  It was easy to put on my android phone.  It looks well made and sturdy.  The lens seems to be protected well and also has a cover to put on it.  It hasn't done any damage to my phone even though it has a nice strong grip it's like a rubber material so I'm not worried at all.  It's very easy to take it off when it's not needed.

"I really like this argan oil conditioner.  The main reason I like it is that it really has helped me with the itchiness.  Next thing that I really like is that it doesn't really have a smell to it.  I like that because sometimes products just have to much perfume in them for me and are bothersome but not with this one.  This conditioner is really thick and I had to shake it down very good to get it to come out of the bottle.  The nice thing though is It spreads on my hair very well.  It rinses out really easy which I was surprised since it was so thick.  It didn't leave my hair feeling weighed down.  It did leave my hair less frizzy which I love.  It was o.k.  to comb through my hair but  it would have been nicer if it was a bit more easy.  I did keep it in my hair the recommended amount of time before washing it out .  I suppose I could have used more conditioner but then I really wouldn't get many uses out of the bottle.  Keep in mind my hair is to the bottom of my back and very thick and coarse so that may not be the case for everyone.  With the good and not so good I'm for the most part satisfied with this conditioner.

"This tire inflator looks very sturdy.  It does have some weight to it.  It has a comfortable handle to carry it.  The gauge is is easy to read.  It also comes with a couple of other adapters for airing up different equipment like  balls and other inflatables.  It has a very decent carrying case to be stored in.  The cord on this is plenty long to reach the tires on my car and is easy to plug in my car lighter area.  I was really pleased with the time that it took to air up my tires.

"I really love how easy it is to use this minoxidil foam.  Just two pumps twice a day is what it says to use on the directions.  I think this can will last a good amount of time.

"These are somewhat comfortable headphones.  My son who is five wears them and really likes them.  I can see they fit him a little bit big and I'm not able to make them fit better since the setting is at the end and won't get any tighter.  They kind of hang low on his ears.  I have been wearing them and for me they fit quite snug.  We received the blue pair of headphones and the star looks cute on them.  It's fairly easy to change the setting for a bigger or smaller fit.  My son did somehow pull off the ear cushions.  I was able to put them back on after removing the black piece of plastic on the earpiece then fitting the cushion back over it and then snapping it back onto the set.  The cushion on the earpiece is not great quality but should be fine for awhile.

"I really like the way this jacket fits and the color looks just as the picture in the product ad.  I did order the Khaki color.  I like to wear men's jackets at times and this is one of those that look neutral for me to wear.  I think what I like the most about this jacket is the zipper because after zipping it I can button over it and it hides the zipper.  I think that makes it look better.  It is a nice material that feels good and the stitching is done well.  It is comfortable to wear and moves well with body motion.  I did wash it and it held up alright.  I think the thing I liked the least was after washing it the lining became a bit puffy.  It was fairly easy to iron the jacket.  The jacket is light but gives a bit of warmth for cool days.

"I just love this ceramic flat iron.  It's not very heavy.  It has a really awesome handle that's easy to hold onto.  I have very long hair that goes to the bottom of my back and is very curly, thick and frizzy.  The good thing that I like about this iron is that it gets really hot enough to straighten out my hair.  It usually takes a very long time to do all of my hair but this cut some of the time out of it since I didn't have to hold it on my hair as long.  It left my hair very straight and smooth.

"I think this is a good quality mirror especially since it's for crafts.  The mirror is very clear.  I have looked around on some sites that have craft ideas and DIY kinda stuff and found some really good ideas.  With this particular mirror my son and I are going to be making  a decoration for his room and putting some cars around the mirror.  I guess for a girl it could easily be like pony stuff or whatever she liked.  The mirror is just the right thickness not too thick and not to thin.

"I am using this for my cat indoors.  She likes to stay curled up on rugs but now she stays curled up on this mat.  I like the design  with leopard print on one side and having the option to flip it over showing a solid black side.  The mat is plenty big enough for my cat with some extra space and it doesn't take up a lot of room.  It feels nice and soft on the outside and the stitching looks o.k.  It does have like a crinkly sound  from the inside of  it if I pick it up and  touch it and fold it about.  I guess that's probably to help keep my pet warm with their body heat.  But when my cat steps on to it and lays down it doesn't make any disturbing sound I guess that would be different for each pet. because of size and other factors.

It pops up and open and then when you close it it closes at the top then I just press it back down.

On one side of the card is the math problem without the answer and on the reverse side is the math problem with the answer.  These are really helpful in practicing multiplication.

"I think the shower curtain looks really pretty.  It is on the thin side.  It didn't have any strong smell when I hung it up.  None of the holes ripped when I put the shower curtain rings on it.  The shower curtain rings that came with it seem to be a plastic.  They were easy to put on the shower curtain and then put around the shower curtain rod.  They are white and match the curtain well but could always be switched out for a different look.  The cons that I found about this shower curtain is that there are no suction cups or magnets to keep it in place so that water doesn't get out in the corners.  Even without those things I really haven't had any problems but it is good for just in case.

"These labels are definitely high quality. They are durable, have a nice matte finish that takes well to printing, and they apply easily to the surface and stay put with the strong adhesive that is on them.  Like the product description says, these are tough labels for tough jobs.The templates supplied on Avery's web site are great. The site is easy to use - choose the design you want, enter the information you want, and then a PDF file is created that you can print to any printer whose drivers accept a PDF file. Really easy.The particular size I have (2"" x 4"", 10 per letter-sized page) comes in a box of 500 labels. I don't really need that may for purposes of labeling chemicals, but they are excellent for that purpose when using Avery's templates, and the labels themselves are perfect for any non-chemical purpose as well because they are so durable and adhere so well.The labels are just as described on the product page.

"This is a superb book for the person who wants to gain a practical understanding of the principles of electricity and how electronic devices work, which in turn provides the foundation for being able to diagnose and repair those items.If you are looking for a book that gives you a step-by-step quick-fix to a specific device, my recommendation is to look elsewhere. The sections in the book devoted to repairing various categories of electronic devices are predicated on the reader understanding basic electronic concepts, how to apply them, and also having the proper tools.For the person who wants to understand the hows and whys of electronic repairs, Mr. Geier has written an excellent manual, with the chapters arranged in a logical order. He explains the principles, tells you what basic and also optional more advanced equipment you ought to have in your workshop and also provides plenty of tips on how to efficiently use everything.  The first part of the book provides the knowledge base. The second part of the book discusses the workings and how to repair a good variety of common devices that often break down.  If something in your house has broken and you are looking for a book that tells you how to specifically repair this in a cookbook way, this really isn't the right book. This book is more for those who want to understand what they are doing so that the knowledge they gain can be applied across a variety of devices.If you have an interest in electronics as it relates to knowing how common devices and appliances work, and to be prepared to repair them, then this book is an invaluable resource.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPW1G7TASZKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071848290#wasThisHelpful","R3PPW1G7TASZKM","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attractive and sturdy unit that works like it is supposed to work.  I have both the 10 and 8 outlet models. The differences between the two are (1) the number of outlets, obviously; and the 10 has, whereas the 8 doesn't, (2) LED dimmer controls; and (3) controlled outlets.The controlled outlets are dependent on whether or not the device you have plugged into the Master outlet is drawing power, i.e., turned on. If the device in the Master is on then the controlled outlets are operational and supplying power. This is handy when you have, for example, an audio receiver and want to turn on a subwoofer and a Blu Ray player automatically when the receiver is switched on, and turn them off when the receiver is switched off. What is nice is you don't necessarily have to use the Master outlet feature - it is enabled or disabled via a switch on the power filter.This is the first power filter I've seen/used that has a rotating power outlet strip and I find this to be very convenient. One beef I have, and this is for all power filters in general, is that the outlets are spaced too closely to allow power bricks that many devices use to be plugged into adjacent outlets. Use of these bricks will most always cause you to lose an outlet. That said, there is an outlet on either side of the rotating section into which you can plug a brick and not lose the outlet because of the rotating feature. However, those two side outlets on the 10 outlet model are for a high current and Master plug, respectively, for which I don't think you'd want to plug in a power brick because that would be overkill.I can't say how well this filter protects against power surges or lightning since I haven't experienced any yet and hope I never do. But in all other respects it works like it is supposed to. I've used other APC products in the past and wouldn't hesitate purchasing or recommending that brand because they have always worked well for me and they have excellent quality construction.Units like these, particularly the 10 outlet, would be suitable for a home theater system because of the controlled outlet feature, but I am using them with my computer equipment (and they work fine). The only reason they're not being used with my home theater is because I have more elaborate APC equipment protecting it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CHSXVIGWSS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTJ2QRY#wasThisHelpful","R30CHSXVIGWSS4","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jade green in color with a somewhat thinner than medium thickness, this combo shampoo and conditioner lathers up and cleans very well.  It also has a pleasant deep and refreshing smell which to me is reminiscent of pine, oil of wintergreen and minty menthol.  So why the three stars?  Because the smell lingers - it leaves the scalp feeling refreshed but it lingers there and on my hands despite trying to rinse very well.  After debating on deducting one versus two stars I took off two because of the staying power of the aroma.Granted, it is a pleasant one but still, I would rather something wash off cleanly and completely regardless of how nice it smells.  Otherwise I'd wear cologne.That said, if you don't mind a pleasant product aroma that lingers, then this is worth trying because it does clean very well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24NI1X10A5N41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70QKBK#wasThisHelpful","R24NI1X10A5N41","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I received a complimentary sample of this product for review purposes.  I am a strong believer in using quality cables, especially with my audio, home theater and computer equipment.  I don't believe in any of that nonsense about a fancy-schmansy power cable can make your audio system sound better, but I do believe that one needs a durable, properly made cable.These power cables from Cable Matters are of high quality.  They are durable, have a substantial feel to them, yet they are flexible. The jackets are sturdy and resistant to tearing or kinking, and the ends are solidly connected. As another reviewer pointed out, the prongs are strong, too - it is very difficult to bend them by pinching them together like you can with so many stock cords that come with appliances.All in all, these are very well-made cables for a very attractive price.  Use them with confidence; the price also makes it convenient to keep some in reserve, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KXB8F83BHNUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WA0W0QA#wasThisHelpful","R2KXB8F83BHNUS","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, the audio quality leaves something to be desired as it sounds like it was recorded using two mediocre mics on an average reel to reel deck in a garage. No Dolby noise reduction here - there's lots of tape hiss and some sound dropouts here and there. But I'm not deducting any stars because we're not led to expect anything better - the main focus is on capturing Linda Ronstadt in a ""live"" and somewhat spontaneous situation.What's nice is her vocals are front and center and despite the less than stellar sound quality, it's readily apparent she is an exceptional singer. She's so talented and puts a lot of emotion into the songs - no way is any of this just going through the motions.  The backup band is in the background and for the most part sounds a bit muffled but they put on a good show and if you can concentrate on the music rather than audio quality aspect, it's a really entertaining album that showcases the tremendous talents of Ms. Ronstadt.  I'm glad this performance was preserved for us to enjoy so many years later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGOC22FWJQUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTKK0W2#wasThisHelpful","R1FGOC22FWJQUR","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall I liked this album.  The arrangements are generally good but they lack the verve and emotional intensity Ms. Nyro put into all of her songs. I thought that was glaringly obvious with the treatment given Save the Country, in which he turned a very fine and serious song into something that sounded light-hearted like he had no idea what the lyrics meant and was singing wearing a Happy Face t-shirt.  Some of the other songs border on that same lack of congruence with the original intent, but on the whole I enjoyed the album because of my admiration of Ms. Nyro's songs and the nice arrangements done on most of them.  You can't beat the original but then that's a high standard few can match. That said, this is a very listenable album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9POLJRTGRUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFGS94C#wasThisHelpful","RA9POLJRTGRUM","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second George Foreman grill, the first being a much smaller version from several years ago that wound up being donated to Goodwill because it was too darn hard to clean. I like the concept of indoor grilling, though, along with a larger cooking area so I ordered this one.It is indeed large!  It looks like a giant flying saucer with its lid on; the cooking surface is generous and the grill works well. It only cooks one side at a time unlike other versions, however, and I also find that the heat has to be set to at least 4 to do a decent job of grilling and make the grill marks on meats or veggies.It's still not a breeze to clean, however.  The surface makes it easy to wipe clean but if you want to do a more thorough job then you have to remove the temperature control and drip tray, and wash the plate in the sink. It's larger than the average sink so you have to wash sections of it at a time and it is rather cumbersome to do so. That said, the non-stick surface facilitates easy food and grease removal, plus any excess grease has already drained into the drip pan anyway.  The drip pan is easy to wash.It's a healthy way to cook foods and even though it doesn't impart a true grilled taste since no coal or wood is used, it does leave attractive grill marks on the food and drains the fat. I use it indoors for cooking. The stand doesn't seem real sturdy and on top of that the instructions say not to leave it outside so for me it is a hassle wheeling this thing indoors and storing it. That's the reason for deducting a star.Overall, it works well and does what it is supposed to do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1454J1AL4WDS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRH3HA#wasThisHelpful","R1454J1AL4WDS1","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's a worthwhile collection of brief but relevant and to the point devotionals, each followed by applicable Bible verses in support. While the author has targeted these writings for women, I find they are just as useful for men - for anyone who has a heart for Jesus, or wants to know more about Him and the Bible.We've all gone through similar situations described by the author and it's comforting to read how she dealt with them through a trust in what God's word as divulged in the Scriptures has to say.  The devotionals themselves are short as are the verses that follow, but the verses offer a good springboard to do further reading from the rest of the Bible chapters they are taken from.Efficient and appropriate - I recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDICYJ7QO03G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718032535#wasThisHelpful","R3FDICYJ7QO03G","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to watch reruns of this show as a kid and really enjoyed it so out of curiosity I bought this set to see how I felt about it now. Still a great show. Hearing the theme song really brought back memories.The episodes are very intelligently written, and it engages the viewer's brain, unlike so much garbage that is on TV these days. I like how the host comes on at the beginning to discuss some aspect of science.  Episodes are nicely done and don't have to resort to the sort of wild special effects or sensationalism, scandal, violence, etc. that today's show needs in order to hold an ever-decreasing attention span of today's viewer who can barely take their eyes away from their smart phone to do anything else.  I also find it interesting comparing what was considered the latest and greatest technology of the time, and also what they envisioned as future technology, to what we actually have today.Picture quality is as good as you can expect from a show produced so long ago on a small budget. The audio is clear and understandable. Sure, it can't compare to modern picture quality but then it's the content that makes it an excellent show, not the side fluff.  I'm very happy that this series has finally been released on DVD. If you like science fiction, this is well worth purchasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AEDARU6V5VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ30A04#wasThisHelpful","R10AEDARU6V5VZ","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a simple, yet functional unit geared for emergency use. It has a radio with AM, FM and Weather station bands, a clock, alarm, cell phone charger and flashlight. Clearly it is meant for emergencies and not for everyday use. The features work but there's no luxury here.The radio has decent reception in all bands. It sounds like a transistor radio, with limited audio quality. Someone complained about that and yes it sounds tinny but it isn't meant to be audiophile-quality, its meant to be used when you have no other source for tuning in radio stations. The weather channel is also helpful and not something that normal radios have.  There was another complaint about how you can't scroll through the stations but have to go one by one up or down the band by pressing the + or - button on the radio. That can be annoying but that's what happens with a digital (what this is) versus an analog tuner. One good thing is in an emergency having a digital tuner that goes from station to station might be helpful so that you don't miss anything when searching for whoever is broadcasting.  Reception is aided by the attached antenna.Setting the time and alarms are easy. The instruction pamphlet is basic but written well enough to understand.The flashlight works fine and has a fairly bright light - enough to let you navigate in the dark.Using the crank feature requires a lot of cranking which gets tiring soon but it's better than not being able to self-power the device or to charge a cell phone. We're so used to modern conveniences that we get spoiled easily. This is meant to be used in disasters and emergencies and you have to expect to be inconvenienced during such times.All in all, it does what it is supposed to do.  It is compact and lightweight. It feels sturdy enough for normal use but I wouldn't want to drop it to see if it still works. It's something handy to have around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPM3J1FYZQFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTKQ1P4#wasThisHelpful","RGPM3J1FYZQFZ","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a nutshell, I found this book to be disjointed and rambling, with sentence structure that made it difficult to hold my attention. Yes, there are some good nuggets of wisdom to be found that can help the reader facilitate a creative frame of mind but they are scattered; the book lacks structure.The theme is to think like a 5 year old to unleash your inner creativity but I'd say the only real advantage a 5 year old has in that respect is he hasn't grown old enough to learn how to be inhibited. Or to have let failures create uncertainty and fear of trying something new. On the other hand, there is a wide range of traits, including creativity, among 5 year olds and you can't really generalize to say that they are any better at being creative than adults.The examples given by the author didn't seem particularly relevant to me, either. Galileo is mentioned in one chapter as an example of someone who was a rebel, who went against the current grain of thinking and never gave up in his quest to prove he was correct. That may be true, but what does that really have to do with creativity?  Galileo just happened to be right - what if he was wrong?  Another example is given of how the popular plaything PlayDoh came to be, but that really has nothing to do with creativity either except someone came up with a clever name for what was originally called Rainbow Modeling Compound. But as to what creative factors led to the better name of PlayDoh, there is no real discussion at all.The book is also supposed to have a Biblical foundation but I found the relationship to be rather weak.I'm sorry; I feel the author had good intentions when writing this book but my personal opinion is that it is not a truly helpful aid towards becoming more creative.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ON878T194BR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426786417#wasThisHelpful","R3ON878T194BR2","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for very simple use, mainly to measure straighforward distances. That is, I didn't need to compute the height of a tree, or figure the volume of a room, etc., just needed to know how far it was from point A to point B.  For this, the device does an excellent job. Granted, I haven't actually gone back to see how exact the measurements are but I get consistent results from checking the same length multiple times so I am assuming it is pretty accurate.It is simple and easy to use, the instructions are understandable, and the device itself feels solid.

"It's nice having a product like this both for helping to keep things organized within a suitcase or larger bag, or for just storing things in a drawer. Although the description said that four different sizes are included, my shipment included four bags but there were two of the medium size.Bag measurements are approximately 18""x13""x3"", 15""x10""x3"" (I got two of these), and 15""x5""x3"".  They're black with gray stripes on the top (like what you see in the picture) and have an Amazon Basics label. There is mesh on both sides of the top and solid cloth-like material in the middle, as well as for the rest of the bag.  Each has a carrying handle and double zippers.My examination tells me its a quality product.  The seams are sturdy and well done, the zipper works smoothly, and it seems very durable. The handles are secure. It would take a great deal of abuse to tear the material or break it; for normal use it should last for a long time.

"This is an excellent, comprehensive concordance for the NIV Bible.  What Strong's does for the KJV, this version does for the NIV.  Every single word in the NIV is indexed/referenced to its location in the Bible.  There is also an index of every Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek word that is used, as well as a cross reference to the Strong's version.  There are also frequency counts of every word, in case you're interested. This is one valuable reference tool that I find extremely useful.I'd like to address a couple of criticisms made by other reviewers. First, they mentioned the print is very small and indeed it is, which I suppose is a tradeoff between smaller print versus a lot more pages and a heavier book. The book is heavy enough and the print is still readable. Some may require a magnifying glass but I'd say most people will be able to read it, albeit with slight inconvenience. Second, some mentioned that you can find the same or more information on the internet and that is true but some prefer the tangible, textural nature of a book.  This one has it all in one place and you can thumb back and forth to find the references/information you need.  I think it depends on how you prefer to do your research.It is indeed a big book but not unwieldy considering you're probably going to use it on your desk most of the time. The pages are on the thin but not fragile or dainty side (i.e., they don't wrinkle easily) and that helps keep the book weight down. And indeed it is comprehensive - it accomplishes what the authors set out to do and is an excellent concordance. If you are the type that likes using books for reference and need an NIV concordance, this is the one to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27C6BV13UUZLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310262933#wasThisHelpful","R27C6BV13UUZLW","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am no Tim Allen and hate doing anything having to do with home improvement. But the torture of having a west-facing window in Southern California during hot weather was enough to motivate me to acquire this product and attempt to install it correctly.After having put up the film, I now appreciate the talents of the employees at shops that do automobile window tinting, and also understand why so many DIY window tints look awful. My finished job looks like there are either small cracks in the window or stray spider webs; it definitely is not smooth and there are also air bubbles all over the place. The good part is that the film does work in terms of reducing the heat caused by the afternoon sun. So regardless of how inept my results look, I'm leaving it up there.My particular windows are two 43"" H x 21"" W panes, one of which slides and there is also a window screen. Because the review sample I received is 60"" x 36"" I was not able to use one whole sheet of film on a window; I had to cut the film and do two sections on each. The instructions are very clear and easy to understand; I followed them to the letter but my difficulties stemmed from working with a relatively large sheet of film and my not having much of a talent for this sort of work. As much as I kept repositioning the film and trying to use the squeegee to push out the air bubbles, I ended up with some creases and stubborn bubbles that just refused to go away on the large section.  The smaller section was much easier to do and had good results.  I suspect another problem may have been that I didn't spray enough Windex on the window. I did clean it first then sprayed a generous amount before applying the film but I'm thinking I should have kept spraying more and maybe the film wouldn't have creased.The film has a light blue tint that is obvious when compared to the pre-film window but it isn't that dark. Certainly not as dark as it looks before you apply it and it still allows you to see outside very clearly.  The benefits of the heat reduction are well worth putting up with a slightly darker window.The product does work. My advice is to follow the directions to the letter and to work slowly and carefully. That said, I tried to do that and my results don't look all that great so perhaps you also need either more experience than I had with projects like this, or a natural aptitude for them. Four stars because the product works, but I don't think it is as easy peasey as the product description says it is. They make it sound like it's a quick and easy thing to do, which it isn't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K88STYRC7X5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M4X7I#wasThisHelpful","R3K88STYRC7X5K","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this as well as two other products as samples from the manufacturer in exchange for their requested ""honest review.""  So here it is...The other two products I received, D3 and fish oil, are pretty much universally acknowledged to be beneficial for one's health.  CoQ10 is a dietary supplement which, as far as I can tell, may help improve heart function, improve energy and prevent cancer although the evidence is not conclusive. However, there's also no evidence that taking a dosage of 100 mg like what is in the capsules in this product does any harm.After taking the recommended dosage of one capsule for a while, I have to say I don't really feel any different. Some days I feel more energetic than others or more ""on the ball"" but I can't correlate this with the taking of these capsules. I'd have to say diet and sleep are as big factors as taking CoQ10.  For that reason I only give it three stars.On the plus side, the product is manufactured in the USA and the manufacturer provides a lot of information about it. The capsules are relatively small and easy to swallow and haven't caused any side effects on me, as far as I can tell. It seems like a high quality product.  I'd say if you are going to take CoQ10 and believe that there are benefits for doing so, then these particular ones are a good choice. It seems like PCNL really cares about their product and the consumer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B6V8TONJ8SQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV7MK4C#wasThisHelpful","R1B6V8TONJ8SQH","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this lantern as a free sample for review purposes, but this review is my honest opinion.The AYL Starlight is a sturdy, well-made and practical product. It's useful and it works like it is supposed to. It comes with a set of easy to understand directions which are not really necessary as everything is either intuitive or obvious. I'd say putting in the 3 ""D"" cell batteries is the most difficult part but if you follow the directions you'll be fine.I'm glad I had some D batteries around the house. I'm not used to using them since most of the items I have use ""AA"" or ""AAA"" cells or 9V. But I appreciate how the latern uses the more robust D cells to maximize battery life.The light itself is plenty bright.  There is a low, high and strobe setting and they all work very well. Low is still quite bright and the high setting will ensure you can find your way anywhere in the dark. The strobe is also very bright. The casing is strong but not that heavy so it is easy to carry using the built in metal handle. The sides are rubber-lined to protect it from damage. The casing itself is plastic but feels durable - no cheap thin stuff here. If you want to hang it up, turn it upside-down and there's a hook you can use.I am not a camper but am glad to have this for use when our power goes out.  You can remove the translucent shield around the LED lamp for more directed, flashlight-type lighting.  There's even a small LED on top of the power button that blinks so you can find the lantern in the dark. By the way, the power button also feels very solid. You use it to cycle from low to high to strobe then off. It has a satisfying click with each press.I'm pleased with this product. It is well made, thoughtfully designed, and I'd say well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJZXCPV7OYK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPTKQ7M#wasThisHelpful","R3BJZXCPV7OYK8","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was using a TP-Link Powerline and was curious to see how this Netgear 1200 product compared.First of all, the Netgear Powerline comes nicely and securely packaged, two of the units plus Ethernet cables for each. Setup is very simple - just plug and play. I plugged the Ethernet cable from my router to the source Netgear.  The receiving Netgear was plugged into the Ethernet jack of a PC in the back of the house. It worked right off the bat, no problems.I used speedtest.net to test the Netgear and the TP-Link. The TP-Link averaged between the mid-19 to mid-21 Mbps range. The Netgear averaged between the low-23 to low-24 range. The results were pretty consistent. What wasn't consistent were the latency and jitter results, which were all over the place for both products so I can't draw any meaningful conclusions from that.A subjective comparison between the two by just doing some browsing on the net really didn't seem to reveal any difference. If I didn't know which powerline was in use, I wouldn't reliably be able to tell one was faster than the other. My opinion: the Netgear Powerline is a quality product that works well, and is very easy to setup and use. The units have a nice, solid feel to them and both the electric prongs and Ethernet cables connect securely. Nothing confusing about it!My only beef is the size. It blocks the other outlet on a two-outlet panel.  Netgear has compensated for this by putting a throughput outlet on the front so you can use that, but the problem is if you have it plugged into a tight space, such as behind something that is pushed up next to the wall, you lose the space that is the thickness of the Netgear. While it may not seem like that much, it's noticeable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20A2S3A8FLKM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6DBGIS#wasThisHelpful","R20A2S3A8FLKM1","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line - this product is primitive compared to a Sonos system.It arrived in a nice box and the construction quality appears to be good. The instruction manual is of the quick start variety but is adequate to get the product up and running. Setup was easy. I have a Galaxy tablet so I downloaded the app for an Android device from the Google Play store which installed quickly and with no problems. Connecting the box was also easy. For streaming you need a pair of speakers and speaker wire. I connected a pair of Hsu HB-1 Mk2 speakers to the Omni A1 using 14 awg speaker wire with banana terminals. If you want more detailed instructions they are available on the product page on Polk's web site.When you initially start up the Omni A1 app, it searches for the system box. It found mine right away, after which I input my wireless password to enable it to connect to my network. Piece of cake. It also asked me to register the product. They entice you to provide more intrusive registration information by offering to extend the warranty for one year plus give you a free upgrade ($15 value) to their DTS Play-Fi HD edition - more on that in a moment.This product is described as enabling you to stream your music wirelessly to existing component speakers anywhere in your home. The music that is included consists of any music files you have on the device that is running the app, music on a media server that you have connected to your network, internet radio, or as of the time of this writing, 6 online music services: Deezer, KKBox, Pandora, QQMusic, Sirius XM or Songza.If you install the DTS Play-Fi app on your PC, that also enables you to stream whatever you choose to play on your PC to your speakers.Also, you can connect a digital source such as a CD player, as well as a turntable to the back of the Omni A1 unit to play source material such as CD's or records, respectively, to whatever speakers are connected to the box.I have a media streamer that I use with my Sonos system so I selected that from my apps menu to stream wirelessly to the Omni A1. It found the streamer just fine and gave me options of selecting by artist, album, genre, etc. That's where this part of the app goes wonky. I selected ""artist"" by tapping on that category selection and was provided with a list of all the artists with files on the streamer, in alphabetical order. I then selected a particular artist by tapping on it, but instead of going to that artist it presented me with the same list of all artists except in a different section of the alphabet. Tapping on another artist then gave me all of the songs in the streamer for that artist but they were not categorized any further. That is, they were not sorted by album or anything, just a list of songs from which to choose.  Tapping on a song resulted in it playing through the speakers I had connected to the Omni A1 box.How did it sound? Fine. Polk lists the amp as putting out 75 watts per each of the two channels at maximum power. They don't use the more conservative ""continuous power"" rating that pretty much all quality audio companies use but instead call it ""peak power rating.""  Still, it was adequate to drive a pair of efficient speakers such as my Hsu's to levels that are loud enough for normal listening. The sound quality was fine.I subscribe to Pandora and tested that out. It worked fine, same as using their web site to add stations and select artists.  I didn't try any of the other music services since I am not a member.Tapping on Internet Radio lets you choose from a huge number of stations. That works fine as well.The app also lets you play music that is stored on the same device as the app. I have a very limited number of music files on my Galaxy so there isn't much choice there, but it works fine, streaming whatever you select to the Omni A1 and the speakers.I then tried the DTS Play-Fi app.  When I initially registered, I did not provide the additional information to do a ""full"" registration but only enough to register my product. Thus, unless I wanted to go back and provide that info or else pay an additional $15, I did not have access to their HD Edition Upgrade which would enable me to choose where I wanted to stream music if I had more devices in the house, plus get better sound quality. The DTS app installed quickly with no problem on my computer. What it did was commandeer all of the sound that normally would play from the speakers connected to my PC and redirected it to the Omni A1.  Not just music that I chose to play, but every sound such as e-mail notifications and other non-music files. Meanwhile I was unable to play any sounds through my PC speakers, even when I closed the DTS application. I had to uninstall it in order to get sound to play through my PC again.How did the music sound when using the DTS app?  Horrible. It had a pulsating, distorted character and was unlistenable.  Since the DTS upgrade offered better sound quality, I decided to go back and do a full registration in order to get the key code to enter in the software and get my free upgrade. I completed it, received an on screen thank you plus a confirmation/thank you e-mail from Polk but as of this writing, never received the key code. I'll be darned if I am going to spend an extra $15 just to see if their upgraded DTS app gives me any better sound.Here's what I think is good about the Omni A1:  Construction quality seems good. It is easy to set up everything. Sound quality, except for the DTS app, is fine.Here is what I do not like about the Omni A1:The DTS app, at least when I used it (this is the non-upgrade version) results in very poor sound.  I never received the promised upgrade key after going back to do a full registration.  This app also completely takes over the sound on the PC so that you can't listen to anything from your PC speakers. As I mentioned above, even when closing it I could not get the sound back until I uninstalled the program.I felt like being held hostage by having to provide additional, invasive information to do the full registration, which consists of providing education level, type of residence, marital status and household income. All things that marketing people want in order to sell you more stuff.The app gives you a very limited choice of online music streaming services.Making a selection from a media server is a cumbersome and wonky process.The only way to create a playlist, or queue of music in a practical way is to create it from music that is on the device running the app. I tried creating a playlist of songs that were on my media streamer but was unable to do so. I had to choose which song I wanted to listen to in real time and wait for that song to be over before making another selection, otherwise the current song would stop and the new selection would start. The songs that had been played all went to a list in the app, which I could then select and use as a playlist but there is no way to create a list in advance of what you want to listen to unless the music files are on the same device that is running the app.As I mentioned at the beginning of this long long review, I have a Sonos system. It is MILES above the Polk. The Sonos app is much more sophisticated. It has a huge list of online music services to choose from.  If you have a media server, it indexes all of the songs on it and does it properly so that you can confidently select what you want to hear by categories such as album, track, artist, genre, etc. and then you can assemble a playlist or queue from those selections in advance of playing any of the songs. Sonos also has internet radio available. I can also stream music to my system via my PC but using Sonos, it does it the right way. I can assemble a queue/playlist in advance and when I send it, it doesn't shut off the sound on my PC.The whole Polk Omni A1 system is primitive compared to what Sonos offered.And no, I do not work for Sonos, I have nothing to do with them except I have been a satisfied owner of their products for several years. When I was offered the Omni A1 for review as a Vine member, I eagerly selected it based on the glowing descriptions provided by Polk on the product page because I was interested in comparing the two.  Sonos wins hands down, no contest.  I don't know what the current price difference is between the products but it doesn't matter - it is not worth spending the money asked for the Omni-A1 unless you primarily use it to stream music that is located on the same device as where you run the Omni app.  Everything else about it needs some work before it is ready for prime time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZU5QIY8MC9KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAMZAQY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZU5QIY8MC9KZ","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very practical gloves. They're thick/sturdy enough for jobs that don't require heavy duty thickly insulated gloves, fit snugly and are thin enough to enable dexterity, have excellent grip and are strong enough for reuse.  While the outside of the gloves is textured to facilitate grips, the inside is smooth, making it easy to put on the hands.  The bright orange color makes them easy to spot if you happen to take them off during a job plus it helps you feel like Spiderman if you admire that superhero.They're so versatile and intelligently designed, I am very happy to have these.  I didn't count to verify there are actually 100 in the box, though. I noticed the product description says there are 100 by weight which makes me wonder how precise the numerical count is.

"This is a nice, roomy and lightweight carrier that works well. The zipper is smooth and the Velcro handles are easy and quick to use. I like the red and white checked pattern, toolOnly ""negative"" thing is either it would be good if it could be folded for storage, or the bottom was made stiffer instead of being flexible, for better support of heavier items.

"When you stop to think about it, the mind is truly an incredible, complex work of art (which is evidenced by your actually being able to stop and think about it). I enjoy reading books about how the brain functions, and was attracted to this one because of the promise of something practical to be gained as well, namely gaining insight into moments of insight, aka the ""aha moments.""I've had them and I'm sure you've had them.  I've given some thought as to what causes this but for me there seemed to be no real rhyme or reason to when the aha moment popped up. I wanted to read this book to find out.The authors have written a book that's easy to digest, explaining things clearly and providing examples so that it's just as much a pleasure read as it is textbook.  They focus on two main ways of approaching problem solving - analytical and insightful, the latter being from where the aha's arise. Personal, third party and experimental experiences are cited for both types of thinking. Evidence is presented on how the brain functions differently under both of these conditions.Now the big question is, how do you use all of these findings to increase your own aha moments?  For research I give the book 5 stars but for answering that big question, I had to take away a star. They provide some ideas, some conditions that facilitate those sudden bursts of insight, but it is left rather open-ended. I think that's how it has to be, at least at this point in time because there's still no real formula for achieving an aha moment. They offer suggestions to foster these moments but ultimately like it's definition, it just happens. All of a sudden the insight comes to you.Even though the authors document no sure-fire way to generate an aha moment, the research they present is fascinating and easy to understand. Definitely worth your time if you have any interest in how the brain functions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9373HV46BA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068541#wasThisHelpful","R2P9373HV46BA5","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find these to be a useful and novel way to store small items. Initially I was worried that their flexible nature would make it difficult to stay upright if some items were stored that leaned over the side, but they're as stable as pretty much anything else except for something made out of lead or heavy glass. Obviously they aren't meant to store real tall and/or heavy things.  For stuff like pens, pencils, remotes and other knickknacks, it's fine.Construction-wise, the stripes on mine lined up very well and you can't tell where the seam is unless you examine it closely.  It's undetectable from a normal distance. The fabric is evenly distributed on both; no bunching up.

"First off, this is the nicest, most expensive mixing/blending set I've used, and the first all-in-one. No experience with comparable Kitchen-Aid or Cuisinart models so I can't compare it to those.  But from evaluating it on its own merits, plus comparing it to separate mixers and blenders I've used in the past, this set is really nice and something I feel will last a lifetime.It comes in a big, heavy (and rather awkward because of size and weight) box.  Everything is sturdily packed to prevent damage but its all easy to remove. The construction quality is excellent. The motor assembly is robust, the parts fit together precisely and snugly and Kenwood didn't skimp on materials. It seems very heavy-duty to me.The instructions are brief but adequate and as others have pointed out, there are no recipes. I'm no expert chef but I had no trouble figuring out how everything fits together and is supposed to be used. Despite the large box I like how the unit itself fits into a fairly compact space and also like the all-in-one nature of the product.  It takes a little getting used to having the food processor and the blender sit on top of the unit, though.Performance-wise, it works fine and as intended. The motor is quiet with plenty of power. The speed adjustment works fine.  It's a very solid product.  I have a ways to go in terms of making use of everything that comes with it but so far, so good - it does a wonderful job. To me it seems like a well-engineered, well thought out product with great versatility in the way everything is combined into one. It looks impressive, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8RKWSOK9D6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYFICRO#wasThisHelpful","RQ8RKWSOK9D6J","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Note: I received these gloves as a free sample.  I opened the package as soon as I brought it inside, on a cold day, and tried on the gloves. They were cold!  Be aware that they take on the surrounding temperature, unlike cloth mitts that feel warmer.I actually tried them with hot pans the next day after they had been stored in a drawer in our house which thankfully is warmer than the cold outdoors and the gloves were much more pleasant to wear at room temperature.Are they effective when handling hot items?  Indeed they are. Much better than the thick cloth mitts my wife and I were using.  There's no sensation of heat as these gloves do a fine job of insulation.  For that they get 5 stars. I also like how they are waterproof so they don't get all messed up if you get juices or other liquids on them.I have to say they aren't the most attractive gloves, though. My first impression was of the monster that comes out of the sea in one of those old sci-fi movies whose title I can't remember (sort of like the Creature From the Black Lagoon but this one was not exactly the same). The bright orange color is rather garish but it also helps with being able to find them quickly.  Their thickness makes it difficult to handle things with fine motor control (which is the tradeoff you make for having such insulation) and they can be difficult to put on unless your hands are absolutely dry.Overall, however, these gloves do a great job at insulating hands from heat.  The current price is reasonable and I foresee these lasting a long time because they seem really durable.  They're a worthwhile purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17R7O12NS9UN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBWAK8Y#wasThisHelpful","R17R7O12NS9UN","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gorgeous-looking scale. I love the silver metallic finish as well as the sleek, slim look. Maybe that's an encouragement to keep one's body sleek and slim as well, haha.I compared the results from this scale to one that I've been using for the past several years and found that this one is consistently 2/10 of a pound lower than the other. I can live with that. In fact, I like the reading from this scale better because of that!  As to which one is really correct or if either of them are, that's not a big deal. At least I see the two are very close to each other and what they do help with is to point out any weight gains or losses that take place.The only beef is the battery compartment is a little difficult to open as it doesn't slide that easily. It comes with a couple of Maxell batteries that don't appear to be lithium to me but as long as it works, that's fine.  One nice thing about this scale is it is triggered when you stand on it and you don't have to tap it first or switch anything on.  It just goes on when something is put on it, and then it automatically shuts off a few minutes later.All in all, a nice, attractive scale for a reasonable price.

"This is the second pair of Keds I've purchased in the past few months.

Recently I saw someone wearing them and it reminded me of how I used to wear them all the time so I bought a pair.  And I liked the one I got so much I decided to get another pair, in a different color.Keds are Keds. These are comfortable. I bought a size 8, which is my usual size, and it fits as expected.  They are comfortable, look good and great for casual wear.  I don't expect them to last a real long time because they don't seem all that durable.

I was going to put blue on one side and white on the other and my wife insisted that looked stupid so I said ""yes dear"" and gave in and did the conventional thing of having the same color lace on both shoes.Anyway, I like them, they look good and are comfortable at a reasonable price, hence the 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4J63AWMNW4JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YD94XU#wasThisHelpful","R4J63AWMNW4JI","A1QVFHPY8418HC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVFHPY8418HC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wow piece of hardware. Admittedly it is expensive but the construction quality is first rate, as is the design and engineering. It offers features beyond that of a standard level, and does them all very well.The instructions are clearly written and easy to follow.  Using the level is pretty intuitive but I found it useful to read the instructions. There's a large LCD panel with highly visible readings.  You can determine not only if something is level, but do so to within 1/100 of a degree.  It also provides the option of alternate measurements in pitch (inches per foot, in 1/8 inch increments) or slope percentage. Thus it not only enables you to determine if something is level, but it measures the angle of surfaces that are not level.There's a memory function that allows you to store up to 9 readings.  Other features include being able to measure relative angles, a built-in laser dot pointer that operates up to a distance of 300 feet, enabling you to level large areas.  The tool has a ruler on its surface along with strong magnets along the  bottom, a nice, soft carrying/storage bag, a hanging hole, and a couple of soft/rubberized grip handles built into its body.  There is also a beeper function you can enable that lets you know when something is level (0 degrees), 45 or 90 degrees, or the most recently stored value in memory.  One reviewer noted that his seemed to beep constantly.  I noticed mine beeps a lot but only when it is at the designated angle. I found that upon placing the level on a surface, it takes a moment to finalize the measurement during which time it may go positive or negative from 0 degrees which triggers the beeping each time it does that.Any drawbacks?  The only thing some people may not like is the size (mine is 24"") but for those who think it is too large there is a 10"" version and for those who think it is too small, there is a 48"" version.All in all I'm impressed by what a quality product it is, and also by what you are able to do with this tool.  As I mentioned earlier in this review, it may seem pricey but if you consider its capabilities as well as its construction quality, this is something that will last for years and years.  Just keep replacing the batteries when needed and you'll never need another level.  By the way, I notice they used a pair of Kirkland AAA batteries in mine.

"I've used 3-In-One oil for as long as I can remember and have always gotten excellent results. It's a quality product. This new product seems to be no exception.  I used it to lubricate various things around the house, such as the door hinges, and it works beautifully.The reasons for a 4 instead of a 5 star rating: The oil comes out a bit too liberally from the container for my liking. That is, you don't really need to squeeze the bottle for a lot of it to come out.  I guess it is a matter of getting used to it but it does make it somewhat difficult to fine tune the amount of lubrication you use. I would have preferred the ""default"" flow to be more restricted.Just for information purposes, the oil has a scent.  It's not an unpleasant one but just know that it is scented although that disappears when it dries.

"These towels feel soft, plush and luxurious.  I haven't used them for a long time so I can't comment on their durability but they look and feel like a quality product.  After washing (no fabric softener or dryer sheets used) they still come out nice and soft.I have the green ones. I'd say the color is pretty close to what shows on the product page - not exact, but then each person is going to see a slightly different shade of green depending on his or her monitor.  The color on my monitor is close enough to give me a good idea of what the towels look like in person.The towels are on the pricey side but if you want to pamper yourself with something that has a luxurious feel, these are ones to get.

"This is a very nice collection of articles over the years from the New York Times.  Even though some are quite old, none of them are dated.  There are no wine reviews per se, but just a variety of articles dealing with various aspects of the wine world.  Since they come from the newspaper columns, they're short, to the point and easy to read and digest.Some were more interesting than others and I skipped a few that didn't appeal to me from the get go (mainly ones on non-wine items such as cognac) but on the whole I read nearly all the articles and feel this was a truly worthwhile collection.

"I found these glasses on closeout at Ross and snapped them up.  They came two in a box.  When I washed them, the stem on one of them broke.  They are really, really fragile which I suppose is why they were on clearance because another box at the store had two glasses with broken stems.  I went to a few other Ross stores in my area looking for more of these and managed to find one more box, but it had only one glass in it.They look just like the picture.  Very tall, thin stem and crystal, and superbly elegant. Upon close examination the quality is not first rate (you can see a very thin seam in the glass and there are also some bubble imperfections in the bottom) but they look so good at a normal distance that I don't care, which is why I give them four stars.  They are gorgeous, but - be very careful as they are very delicate.  Don't even dare putting them in a dishwasher. Plus because of their height they may have trouble fitting in some cabinets, too.

"Kingdom of Rock picks up where its predecessor, ""Freefall"" by Magnus Karlsson, left off.  That is to say this is another excellent collaboration of great songs, great musicians, and great guest vocalists that may be even better than the ""Freefall"" album.  Karlsson takes credit on the album for all of the songwriting, guitars (lead and bass), and keyboards.  Karlsson also takes production credit but the album is mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen.  Karlsson sings on two tracks.  The other vocalists are the incredible Jorn Lande, who sets the tempo for the album on the opening track, which is also the title track, and which hearkens back to some of his best solo work on ""Spirit Black"".  The other guest vocalists are Jakob Samuel of the Poodles, Joe Lynn Turner, Tony Martin, David Readman, Rick Altzi, Tony Harnell, Harry Hess, and Rebecca de la Motte.  The songs do not all sound the same but appear to be crafted by Karlsson to utilize the strengths of each of the vocalists, including himself.  Bottom line:  This is a must have album for fans of melodic rock who don't mind a tinge of metal or power metal in the mix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q44CI7IYQSPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I062N6#wasThisHelpful","R2Q44CI7IYQSPI","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Burberry Touch is a classic scent.  It has been around for over a decade.  I would generally consider this to be more of a daytime fragrance for use in temperate weather, when it is not particularly hot or cold, say in the upper-60s°F to low-70s°F. It has mixed overtones of spicy and fruity notes.  The opening notes are citrus and floral, the primary mid notes are spice (nutmeg) and cedar, and the low notes are musky (tonka beans) and woody (vetiver).  The floral overtones soften the scent and the citrus overtones give it some sweetness that may not be for everyone but I would consider it to be a fairly good scent overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ONUW4S3MN51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKMY1UK#wasThisHelpful","R16ONUW4S3MN51","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very tasty and handy to have around as a snack or meal supplement.  Nevertheless the quality of these bars has gone down in my experience over the last year or so.  A good, or rather unacceptable, percentage of these bars taste very stale and it is almost like eating tree bark.  This problem became more pronounced when the company switched from packaging these bars in aluminum foil to plastic. Previously, you would occasionally get an aluminum foil package that was not sealed properly and the contents would be stale. Now, the frequency of my getting stale bars has at least tripled and there is no indication that the package was not sealed properly, though it is possible there could be a pinhole leak in the package that is not visible to the naked eye.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCM005YH907Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCH6HHE#wasThisHelpful","RNCM005YH907Z","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been an avid user of Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom for a few years now but decided to take this opportunity to try Cyberlink PhotoDirector 7 Ultra. I must say, I'm very impressed. I was a bit worried that I would have to learn a new layout as well as manage a new workflow and that was definitely not the case.PhotoDirector is a perfect mix between Adobe Lightroom and a light version of Photoshop. With tools like the body shaper and background remover, PhotoDirector takes these tasks that used to be a bit of a process in Photoshop and makes them a simple two or three steps.I shoot a lot of action sports as well as portraits so I'm usually bringing a good couple hundred photos into my photo editor at a time. PhotoDirector has the manageability and workflow of multiple photo editing without the monthly cost of an Adobe Lightroom account.If you're looking for a good mix between Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom or a good start out program to learn photo editing, PhotoDirector would likely be a good fit for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TNRRI32DYCRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158RGNR8#wasThisHelpful","R1TNRRI32DYCRL","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The trio of musicians who backed her on the first two albums are gone.  Her father, Ed Ehrhardt, who contributed many strong, soulful guitar licks on her first two albums is sorely missed.

The bottom piece is more substantial.  It is made out of plain cardboard stock, of about 100lb weight paper.  The problem is that, as soon as I opened the planner, the top part of the cover started separating from the bottom part of the cover by peeling off at the outer edges.  Just the process of using my thumb to push up the cover caused the top part of the cover to peel back.

"The overall layout and design of this planner is very well done.  The orange highlights add a gentle flair to the pages without being overbearing or harsh.  There is a double-sided clear pocket page at the back of the planner that is very useful for temporarily storing receipts, tickets, etc.  The cover is very smooth, looks similar to leather, and has a nice faux leather feel to it.  The only drawbacks are from the manufacturing process.  The back cover of my planner had a tiny nub on it.  I thought this was just a piece of adhesive material that got stuck to the planner.  When I removed it, however, it was actually part of the back cover and there is now a small, discolored pit on the back cover.  The other problem is that my planner does not close properly.  You cannot close it using the back cover.  You must close it using the front cover only.  Also, you cannot close it using the front cover all by itself as it gets stuck.  You must first close the pages, front to back, and then you must tug the front cover up and over to close it.  Two steps when one should do; and the second step may eventually end up tearing the cover (but maybe not until after a hundred or more uses) at the stress points where the cover gets pulled up and pushed through the rings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV51HLLE05OCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWVY2XQ#wasThisHelpful","RV51HLLE05OCR","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first solo album by Fergie Frederiksen is very good.  There are a lot of fine guest musicians, including Ricky Phillips, Bruce Gowdy, Tim Pierce, Jason Schieff, Ron Wikso, and Neal Schon.  (All of these also appear on the eponymous Frederiksen/Phillips album.)  The album contains some outstanding, even quite beautiful songs, including the title song, ""Equilibrium"" (co-written by Fergie Frederiksen, Jim Peterik, and Ricky Phillips), and ""Falling into Place"".  But, overall, the album needs more oomph, more vitality.  It is too mellow or soft for me.  It lacks dynamism. It is more of an easy listening album than Fergie's other solo albums and his collaborative efforts with Ricky Phillips and Tommy Denander.  If you liked Toto's Isolation album, which featured Fergie on vocals, than you will probably like this one as well as in some ways it is better than the Toto album as Fergie's vocals are more expressive and upfront here (and he is the lead vocal on every track, unlike on the Isolation album).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FIN0XORWLSDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000023ZXH#wasThisHelpful","R1FIN0XORWLSDP","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fergie Frederiksen is in fine vocal form here as he sings songs primarily written by Ricky Phillips.  (Phillips is given credit as the sole writer or as a co-writer on all of the songs.  Frederiksen is given credit as a co-writer on four of the songs.  There are eleven songs on the album, which are listed below.)  As a surprise bonus, Giuffria is credited a co-writer of the music, along with Frederiksen/Phillips, on one of the songs. David (Glen) Eiseley is even credited with background vocal on that track. The musicians on the other tracks, including Neal Schon on one track and Deen Castronovo on several others, are well respected and add some flair to the arrangements.The album overall is a pleasant collection of tunes that is more melodic, soulful, and uptempo than Fergie's album with Toto.  For melodic rock aficionados this is a must have.The tracks are: (1) Shot down, (2) Oh Diane, (3) How much longer, (4) Name of love, (5) You must be a liar ('cause you're unbelievable), (6) Baby Blue, (7) Captured, (8) Queen Bee, (9) Hopelessly lost, (10) Do you love her,  and (11) Long way around the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z52N8INTUVU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000024IOB#wasThisHelpful","R2Z52N8INTUVU5","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are fairly good sparring/bag gloves.  They hit solid.  They are stiff and tight at first and it takes several good uses to really break them in.  All the padding, wicking material, and inner elastic work better than I thought.  The blue color is nice and bright but I personally prefer the limited edition in black and red.

"This has a great sound for the price.  The speaker looks professional. It comes with a cable so you can hook it up to a laptop or computer that does not have Bluetooth.  What I do not like about the speaker is that it is too difficult to turn on and off.  You have to press the on/off button for three seconds to turn it on.  This is just too long to stand around and push down a button on such a simple device to turn it on.  It turns off with a single, hard press of the on/off button.  This is nice but the on/off button is almost flush with the body of the speaker, making it unnecessarily hard to use.  Also, the device does not turn itself off automatically after a certain period of time.  Battery life, just a few hours, is not optimal for a speaker of this size.  If you are concerned about price but not about size, I would suggest looking at the TDK TREK-360 with is currently heavily discounted to the same price range as this Lenovo speaker but the TDK has four speakers and a sub-woofer. I would consider the TDK TREK-360 to currently be the best value on the market in this price range, i.e., under eighty dollars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWIMXJ5PMI83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01133CT88#wasThisHelpful","R1PWIMXJ5PMI83","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These pills come in a softgel form.  They are easy to take and easy to digest.  The pills include both lutein, 40 mg, and zeaxanthin, 1,600 mcg.  The product is naturally made.  No synthetics.  And it is non-genetically modified.  The package contains several warnings on use, including that you should not take it if you are allergic to daisy-like flowers.  I started taking this supplement originally in a lower dosage, 40 mg and 800 mcg, to see if I suffered any adverse effects.  So far, so good, so I am now trying this higher dosage.  And again, so far, so good.  The ingredients in these pills are supposed to support general eye health.  (I think studies have shown that normal eyes retain 20 mg of lutein and 800 mcg of zeaxanthin but I do not know how often they are used up and need to be replenished.) There is some evidence, though apparently nothing definitive yet, that your eyes need these supplements to help prevent macular degeneration, a disease which usually occurs in people in their mid-sixties.  But by the time you get this disease it is realistically too late to take these supplements.

"Forty years on and still rockin' strong!  This is Motorhead's 22nd studio album.  And this year marks the band's 40th year.  This is the reason, I guess, for the four XXXXs on the cover.  The cover also looks like some kind of war medal, maybe it represents the Medal of Valor for Mean and Lean Rock'n'Roll.  Anyway, this album is pretty similar to the last five studio albums, i.e., since Inferno, in that Cameron Webb produced this one and the last five.  And the major players are the same, Lemmy, Phil, and Mikkey, as they have been for the last 20 years.  In other words, the album does not disappoint.  A major surprise is the last cut, Sympathy with the Devil, which I thought would be sub-par but Mikkey Dee does some incredible drumming that kicks this song up a notch.

"Excellent hair dryer.  Dries hair more quickly than most hair dryers.  Convenient in that it has three heat settings and two speed settings. It also includes interchangeable nozzles that are very useful and convenient for styling and straightening.  It includes a conditioning ring that you thread onto the dryer.  The conditioning ring contains oils that are apparently designed to be released as micro-conditioners to keep your hair conditioned as you dry it, i.e., to reduce dryness and frizziness.  Use of the conditioning ring, however, did not seem to make any noticeable difference.  The hair dryer by itself is pretty well designed and leaves hair shiny and sleek, with no breakage.  If you do use the conditioning ring then the oils will eventually run out and it will need to be replaced.  Replacement is recommended every three months.  I could not find any replacements for sale, perhaps because this is still a fairly new product and the replacements are just not yet on the market. Another convenience is that the back of the dryer pops off for easy cleaning of the filter.

"Wow.  Great, quiet office vacuum.  My prior experience with using commercial vacuum cleaners is that they were loud and heavy.  This Hoover model is surprisingly light and not that loud compared to other models and brands I have used.  It has two speeds, high and low.  It defaults to low.  With just average use on office carpets I found no need to use the high speed.  The low speed had plenty of suction even though it wasn't that loud.  (I tend to mistakenly associate loudness with suction power in vacuums.)  My only misgiving is that it has no headlight.  It also has no attachments but that is not really an issue for me as I would only be using this to give a good vacuuming to high traffic areas.  The sample I receive for test purposes only came with one bag so you should get some replacement bags at the same time you get the vacuum.  Another good feature is that the extension cord that comes with the unit is not built into it but attaches to the rear so if  the cord gets worn out for any reason, or if you want to use a longer one, you can easily replace the original cord with a standard, preferably heavy duty, extension cord.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PGSOPFORE0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R12PGSOPFORE0F","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For only three dollars more at the time of this review, the Kniper is well worth the extra expense compared to the H.K. Porter model. I do find the release latch somewhat easier to use on the H.K. Porter than on the Kniper.  But the opening spring on the H.K. Porter is weak and I have to push the device open manually with the handles to get the jaws wide enough to do anything.  This would quite irritating if you were using the H.K. Porter model for more than a few quick cuts per use.  The Kniper model claims to be made in Germany while the H.K. Porter model is made in China.  German quality is generally superior to Chinese quality for comparable products.  Also, the Kniper product comes with a lifetime guarantee so that shows some confidence by the manufacturer in the quality of their products, which are highly regarded in any event.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P67277D6AIAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHM2POO#wasThisHelpful","R3P67277D6AIAG","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Classic Nelson album.  Nice production.  Great harmonies.  Excellent musicianship.  Well thought out songs. Favorite songs are the first, third, and eleventh tracks:  Hello Everybody, Invincible, and Bad for You.  If you like the style of previous Nelson albums, with the possible exception of ""Because We Can"" which has a countryesque feel to it, you will enjoy this album as well.  Only song I did not care for at first was the last track, Leave the Light On for Me, as it does not really fit with the rest of the songs but it's growing on me and will likely be a concert favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJQOPN8NC0MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USKVOZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3VJQOPN8NC0MR","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice door lock. Nickel satin finish looks classy.  Easy to install.  Requires only a Phillips screwdriver if the door and door frame already have standard cutouts or you are replacing an existing door.  (Two sets of easy to understand instructions are included, one for doors with pre-existing cutouts and one for making the cutouts if you need them.)  Also no trouble lining up the screws while installing the second knob as you just basically snap the second knob in place.  This feature alone is quite a time and frustration saver.  Easy to use both entering and exiting if the door is not locked.  The lock itself is not secure.  There is no key for the lock.  The lock can be easily disabled if you are outside the door with a small coin or almost anything that you can fit into the groove where the keyhole would ordinarily be located.  The door is meant to be installed on doors that swing into a room.  Otherwise, you could get locked into the room if the door swings out but since you can easily override the lock that is not an insurmountable problem for most people.  The door knobs are a little bigger than standard size knobs.  This is probably to help implement the push pull feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VIGKB33QV4FQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J03HMHC#wasThisHelpful","R2VIGKB33QV4FQ","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent shipping tape, superior to many other brands I have used in the past.  As soon as I got this tape I put it to the test to  securely box several items I happened to need to return.  The width of the tape is very useful.  It does eliminate the need to use a double row of tape in most instances.  (I confess that I sometimes overtape my packages but better too much tape than not enough.)  The dispenser that comes with the tape is also very easy to use.  I would not consider this to be a universal tape for all shipping purposes as it is not reinforced but for basic shipping this is a great tape to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFNCR09909D3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MR6FTAQ#wasThisHelpful","R3AFNCR09909D3","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to lug my HP 17.3 inch laptop around in.  I was previously using a Case Logic briefcase like bag for the same purpose.  I prefer using the briefcase style bag whenever I have to transport my large laptop.  The backpack looks a little hipper than the brief bag but the brief bag is sturdier.  The handle on the backpack is just too slight for its intended use.  A sturdier, more robust handle is needed to comfortably carry around a 17.3 inch laptop with all its accoutrements.  The same thing is true for the backpack straps.  They are not quite sturdy enough for me and do not provide sufficient support when the backpack is fully loaded.  Moreover, there is no small outside pocket to stuff those little things into that you might need in a hurry but don't want to get lost inside the backpack.  Finally, I thought the lime green color accents looked fine online but when I received the backpack I did not care for this coloring at all.  For me the color is too weak, too washed out, too childish.  Cautionary note:  If you do get the briefcase style bag it also has some flaws.  The handle on it seems too weak as well but it certainly far superior to the one on this backpack.  In addition, the clips on the shoulder strap for the brief bag are made of hard, brittle plastic and in my experience these inevitable fail, usually sooner rather than later.  I purchased a Klein shoulder strap separately, which has much better padding and metal clips.  This shoulder strap has worked well for a couple of years now without any problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKLX3GHC3T5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7HQTHO#wasThisHelpful","R1MKLX3GHC3T5V","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are well-made shipping labels.  I use them for returns.  They print easily and clearly.  The only problem is that the box they come is not sturdy enough to hold the weight of all the sheets of labels in the box.  My box arrived torn in two places and the sticker on the reclosable flap was also torn off and the flap damaged.  (The shipping box was not damaged.)  This means I either spend several minutes repairing the box so everything does not fall out when I pick it up or I get another box to put the labels in.  I chose to use an empty letterhead box I just happened to have available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F18UTB55QFIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIYVHIW#wasThisHelpful","R2F18UTB55QFIJ","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absolutely fascinating book on how business works, although a more accurate title would be: How Businesses Work In Today's Global Marketplace.  This is because there is a lot more information than just the nuts and bolts of how a business works.  There are also many explanations and examples of how, in today's world, factors outside what one would normally consider the parameters of a business affect and impact that business.  This includes the role of social, environmental, and other concerns that a company must often take into account in today's marketplace.  Factors that were pretty much non-existent in many respects just 20 years ago.

"I really like this trimmer.  It is just what I needed.  I use it to edge trim some ivy and this trims it in no time.  It is not too heavy, 10 pounds or less, to lug around for the 5-10 minutes it takes to get this done.  The battery does not seem to last much longer than two uses without needing a recharge, so it is not ideal for any big jobs that might take over about a half hour to complete.  It has a variable speed trigger, which takes a little getting used to, and naturally the faster the machine operates (i.e., the more power you use) the faster the battery drains.  It has a self-feeding line -- awesome! -- and the handle is adjustable, and easily so.  This sure beats dragging a gas-powered trimmer around or fiddling with a cumbersome electrical cord. This does require a little assembly when you first get it but it is quite easy, only requires a standard no. 2 Phillips screwdriver, and takes just a couple of minutes.  (There is also a Black and Decker string trimmer assembly video on YouTube if you do need help.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Q8UZ8HEOUQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLMU9W2#wasThisHelpful","R14Q8UZ8HEOUQT","AXTDCF7RF73K1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXTDCF7RF73K1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The hype for this album is true: It really is a melodic rock masterpiece. I would not go so far yet as name it an instant classic but I do not see how anyone who enjoyed the first Kiske - Somerville collaborative effort would not enjoy this one as well. The vocal artistry of these two singers is amazing.  I was skeptical when the first album came out, not knowing what to expect but trusting that it could not be that bad considering who was involved, Kiske, Sommerville, Sinner, Karlsson, and my trust was rewarded and my skepticism vanished upon my first listen.  This time around I knew what to expect and was not disappointed.
